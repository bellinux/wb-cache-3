When 2 D image is applied Fresnel transform, the result concentrates center region. When applied to a hologram, on the other hand, the result focused diffraction pattern of 2 D form.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{enforcement}} of nonlinear constraints in Petri nets. An integer linear programming model is formulated to transform a nonlinear constraint to a minimal number of conjunctive linear constraints that have the same admissible <b>marking</b> <b>space</b> as the nonlinear one does in Petri nets. The obtained linear constraints can be easily enforced to be satisfied {{by a set of}} control places with a place invariant based method. The control places make up a supervisor that can enforce the given nonlinear constraint. For a case that the admissible <b>marking</b> <b>space</b> decided by a nonlinear constraint is nonconvex, another integer linear programming model is developed to obtain a minimal number of constraints whose disjunctions are equivalent to the nonlinear constraint with respect to the reachable markings. Finally, a number of examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach...|$|R

It {{is also used}} to <b>mark</b> <b>spaces</b> in parking lots or special purpose spaces for disabled parking, loading zones, or time-restricted parking areas. Colors for these applications vary by locality. Paint is a low-cost marking and has been in widespread use since approximately the early 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Simple point {{processes}} are often characterized by their associated compensators or conditional intensities. For non-simple {{point processes}}, however, the conditional intensity and compensator do not uniquely determine {{the distribution of}} the process. Various ways of characterizing non-simple multivariate point processes are discussed here, some important classes of separable non-simple processes are investigated, and methods of simplification involving thinning, rescaling, and changing the <b>mark</b> <b>space</b> are presented...|$|R

The interval between stadia marks in most stadia instruments gives a stadia interval factor of 100. The distance between the instrument and a stadia rod can be determined simply by multiplying the measurement between the stadia hairs (known as the stadia interval) by 100.|$|R

40|$|The Jingpho or Kachin {{language}} is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Kachin State and northern Shan State, Burma and adjacent areas of China and India. This paper, {{based on data from}} a 320 -thousand-word corpus of Jingpho which I compiled, provides a description and analysis of the case marking system of Jingpho. An overview and list of case markers are given in section 3. Section 4 discusses case markers for S (intransitive subject), A (transitive subject), and P (transitive object), and claims explicitly. In section 5, various case markers which mark local semantic roles (locative, source and goal roles) are shown in some detail. Using concordance lines obtained from my corpus, I quantitatively analyse {{the difference between the two}} locative markers, ko? and tha?, and emonstrate that ko? typically <b>marks</b> <b>spaces</b> while tha? typically markstime, although both of them can <b>mark</b> <b>spaces</b> and time. The genitive case and genitive personal pronouns are discussed in section 6, followed by a description of the comitative marker which marks various kinds of semantic roles. Finally, nouns which function as case markers (i. e., mtu 'for', m∂lay 'instead', m∂jo 'because', and zon 'like',) are discussed in some detail...|$|R

Here, we explore gen-eralization of Meyer’s theorem {{to the case of}} marked point processes, where the <b>mark</b> <b>space</b> may be quite general. Assuming simplicity and the existence of a conditional intensity, we show that a marked point process can be transformed into a compound Poisson process with unit total rate and a fixed mark distribution...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. We study {{marked point}} {{processes}} (MPP's) with an arbitrary <b>mark</b> <b>space.</b> First we develop some statistically relevant topics {{in the theory}} of MPP's admitting an intensity kernel t(dz), namely martingale results, central limit theorems for both the number n of objects under observation and the time t tending to in nity, the decomposition into a local characteristic (t � t(dz)) and a likelihood approach. Then we present semi-parametric statistical inference in a class of Aalen (1975) -type multiplicative regression models for MPP's as n! 1, using partial likelihood methods. Furthermore, considering the case t! 1,we study purely parametric M-estimators...|$|R
