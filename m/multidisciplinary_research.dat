40|$|Capacity {{constraints}} {{imposed by}} current {{air traffic management}} technologies and protocols could severely limit {{the performance of the}} Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). A fundamental design decision in the development of this system is the level of decentralization that balances system safety and efficiency. A new surveillance technology called automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) can be potentially used to shift air traffic control to a more distributed architecture; however, channel variations and interference with existing secondary radar replies can affect ADS-B systems. This paper presents a framework for managing arrivals at an airport by using a hybrid centralized/distributed algorithm for communication and control. The algorithm combines the centralized control that is used in congested regions with the distributed control that is used in lower traffic density regions. The hybrid algorithm is evaluated through realistic simulations of operations around a major airport. The proposed strategy is shown to significantly improve air traffic control performance under various operating conditions by adapting to the underlying communication, navigation, and surveillance systems. The performance of the proposed strategy is found to be comparable to fully centralized strategies, despite requiring significantly less ground infrastructure. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

In 1952, the Department of Energy formed a second design lab {{under the direction of the}} University of California, becoming the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Since that date the two labs have competed on a wide variety of bomb designs. With the ending of the Cold War, both labs turned their focus increasingly to civilian missions. Today, Los Alamos is one of the largest science and technology institutions in the world. It conducts <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> in fields such as national security, space exploration, nuclear fusion, renewable energy, medicine, nanotechnology, and supercomputing.

25|$|The country’s various policy {{instruments}} are {{evaluated by the}} Council for Higher Education, the National Council for Research and Development, the Office of the Chief Scientist, the Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Ministry of Finance. In recent years, the Magnet administration in the Office of the Chief Scientist has initiated several evaluations of its own {{policy instruments}}, most {{of which have been}} carried out by independent research institutions. One such evaluation was carried out in 2010 by the Samuel Neaman Institute; it concerned the Nofar programme within the Magnet directorate. Nofar tries to bridge basic and applied research, before the commercial potential of a project has caught the eye of industry. The main recommendation was for Nofar to extend programme funding to emerging technological domains beyond biotechnology and nanotechnology. The Office of the Chief Scientist accepted this recommendation and, consequently, decided to fund projects in the fields of medical devices, water and energy technology and <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
25|$|The College of Science {{consists}} of six departments: Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Earth & Environmental Sciences, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology. The College offers over 50 bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs, including fast-track programs in select departments which {{allow students to}} earn advanced degrees in a shorter period of time than traditional degree programs. The College's faculty includes members of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Inventors, as well as Fellows in various professional organizations and recipients of numerous national, state and UT System teaching awards. Faculty in every department are engaged in cutting-edge, <b>multidisciplinary</b> <b>research,</b> supported by {{millions of dollars in}} federal, state and private funding annually. Students can engage in hands-on research from their first semester on campus. The College's High Energy Physics group is heavily involved in ongoing experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and made major contributions to the discovery of the Higgs boson particle in 2012, working on detectors and computational data analysis.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{detecting}} many-body localization (MBL) in disordered spin systems. The method involves pulsed coherent spin manipulations that probe the dephasing of a given spin due to its entanglement {{with a set of}} distant spins. It allows one to distinguish the MBL phase from a noninteracting localized phase and a delocalized phase. In particular, we show that for a properly chosen pulse sequence the MBL phase exhibits a characteristic power-law decay reflecting its slow growth of entanglement. We find that this power-law decay is robust with respect to thermal and disorder averaging, provide numerical simulations supporting our results, and discuss possible experimental realizations in solid-state and cold-atom systems.

500|$|The Georgia General Assembly amended EES' charter in {{the early}} 1960s, authorizing an [...] "industrial {{extension}} service to meet the technical, informational and other needs of industry and local development groups". This led to an expansion of some of EES' activities {{that it had been}} involved in since the 1940s. In particular, EES began providing additional services as a technological incubator during this time frame, and began an international development initiative that improved infrastructure and facilitated technology transfer in over 40 developing nations. The station's expanded mission bolstered its traditional research strengths, resulting in work on projects that improved radar operation on the Saturn rocket and in the invention of the compact antenna range by Richard C. Johnson. Throughout the 1960s, these changes brought about an increased focus on research that sought to solve societal problems rather than research for the sake of pure scientific knowledge.
