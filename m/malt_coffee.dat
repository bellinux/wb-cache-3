50|$|Since 1845, sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} from sugar beets grown {{on the nearby}} fields. Since the 19th century, coffee substitutes as rye and <b>malt</b> <b>coffee</b> or chicory have also been produced in Sereď. The town {{is known for its}} production of cookies, biscuits, and wafers. In 1950, the sparkling wine manufacturer, Hubert company moved to the town. By utilizing its rich wine-making tradition, a modern wine-processing factory was established in the town during the 1950s. Wine is produced here using the latest technology. Today, sparkling wine is produced using classical champagne techniques, and in-tank fermentation is used as well.|$|E

With the connection of the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad to Rockford in 1852, Peacock was ready to serve the droves of immigrants that followed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Barley is a cereal crop with {{multiple}} uses: as fodder, brewing, food. Has long {{been one of}} the main crop with wheat and millet. In recent decades the importance of barley decreased and cultivated area declined by 3 - 4 times. Barley grains contain a percentage of 8 - 15 % cellulose (paddy), 60 - 70 % starch, 11 % protein, 10 % ballast, lipids, vitamins (especially B) and minerals, gluten. People with gluten intolerance can not drink beer because barley is an important ingredient. The economic importance of barley is lower compared to that of wheat, corn, rice or rye; is used especially winter barley as animal feed. In food people can remember especially <b>malt</b> and brewing <b>coffee,</b> also one can remember the effect of barley extract in cases of high fever, with fever-lowering effect of patient. In addition to the uses already known, barley has therapeutic qualities, recovered by treatment of conditions such as diarrhea, cystitis, rheumatism, cough, hemorrhoids, influenza, infertility, depression, anemia, skin problems etc. Barley is considered the therapeutic properties of herbal and remineralizing, anti-inflammatory, hypotensive, increases sex drive and helps people young and old to recover after a period of convalescence. The research was conducted in two areas with different climatic conditions, Timişoara and Mizieş- Bihor. In both centers, four varieties of spring barley were studied: Aspen, Adonis, Penellope and Hanca and four varieties of winter barley: Laura, Trasko, Plaissant and Clarine. The research aimed to determine the influence of fertilization on yields. Four variants of fertilization wer...|$|R
40|$|To produce {{specialty}} malt, malts were roasted by combined microwave-hot air {{at various}} specific microwave powers (SP = 2. 5 to 3 W/g), microwave heating times (tmw = 3. 3 to 3. 5 min), oven temperatures (Toven = 180 to 220 °C), and oven heating times (toven = 60 to 150 min). The response variables, color, energy consumption by microwave (Emw) and oven (Eoven), total energy consumption (Etot), quantity of neo-formed contaminants (NFCs), which include hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, furan, and acrylamide were determined. Response surface methodology (RSM) {{was performed to}} analyze and predict the optimum conditions for the specialty malt. Production using combined microwave-hot air roasting process based on minimum energy consumption and level of NFCs. At 95 % confident level, SP, Toven, and toven were the most influencing effects with regard to Etot, whereas tmw did not affect Etot. Toven and toven significantly affected malt color. Only Toven significantly influenced the NFCs content. The optimum parameters were: SP = 2. 68 W/g for 3. 44 min, Toven = 206 °C for 136 min for <b>coffee</b> <b>malt,</b> SP = 2. 5 W/g for 3. 48 min, Toven = 214 °C for 136 min for chocolate malt, and SP = 2. 5 W/g for 3. 48 min, Toven = 211 °C for 150 min for black malt. Comparing with conventional process, combined microwave-hot air reduced Etot by approximately 40 %, 26 %, and 26 % for coffee, chocolate, and black malts, respectively, and reduced HMF, furfural, furan, and acrylamide contents by 40 %, 18 %, 23 %, and 95 %, respectively, for black malt. Practical Application: An important goal for research institutions and the brewery industry is to produce colored malt by combining microwave and hot air roasting, while saving energy, getting desirable color, and avoiding the formation of carcinogenic and toxic neo-formed contaminants (NFCs). Therefore, one objective {{of this study was}} to compare energy consumption and content of NFCs during roasting of malt by hot air-only and combined microwave-hot air processes as well as to determine the effect of specific power, microwave processing time, oven temperature, and oven processing time during combined microwave-hot air roasting. Another objective was to predict the optimum conditions for the production of coffee, chocolate, and black malts. © 2010 Institute of Food Technologists®. financial support from Natl.
