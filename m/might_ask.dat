5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
25|$|One <b>might</b> <b>ask,</b> {{since the}} {{homogeneous}} polynomials {{are not really}} functions on P(V), what are they, geometrically speaking? The algebro-geometric answer {{is that they are}} sections of a sheaf (one could also say a line bundle in this case). The situation with modular forms is precisely analogous.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{peace treaty}} has been negotiated, the parties {{involved}} <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> the United Nations for a peacekeeping force to oversee various elements of the agreed upon plan. This is often done because a group controlled by the United Nations {{is less likely to}} follow the interests of any one party, since it itself is controlled by many groups, namely the 15-member Security Council and the intentionally diverse United Nations Secretariat.|$|E

25|$|One {{question}} we <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> is whether, {{if we had}} chosen a different free ultrafilter V, the quotient field A/U would be isomorphic as an ordered field to A/V. This question {{turns out to be}} equivalent to the continuum hypothesis; in ZFC with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to order isomorphism, and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we can prove that there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.|$|E
25|$|One {{year after}} the shooting, Johnston's family sued the city of Atlanta, the police chief, and five other {{officers}}, accusing them of false imprisonment, civil rights violations, racketeering, and other violations. The suit claims that officers used unreasonable and deadly force and that Johnston's constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated. A spokesperson for the family told the press {{that as part of}} the lawsuit the family <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> for the street on which Johnston had lived to be renamed to Kathryn Johnston street.|$|E
25|$|But how, one <b>might</b> <b>ask,</b> is {{this still}} {{thriving}} given the increasing emphasis on internet security? The simple, but unfortunate solution, according to Symantec’s “Internet Security Threat Report”, {{is that of}} the expanding “underground economy”. With more than fifty percent of the supporting servers located in the United States, this “underground economy” has become a haven for internet thieves, who use the system in order to sell stolen information. These pieces of information can range from generic things such as a user account or email to something as personal as a bank account number and PIN.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the clearest}} example to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} difference between original intent and original understanding is to use the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though some would argue that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.|$|E
25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and even what constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequences}} of Androgeos' death {{are described in}} the Bibliotheca as follows. Minos received the news of his son's death when he was performing a sacrificial rite {{in honor of the}} Charites at Paros. Overcome by grief, he threw off his garland and ordered for the music to stop, but did complete the sacrifice, from which circumstance the festivals in honor of the Charites at Paros involved no music or flowers from then on. Minos led a war against Athens to avenge the death of his son, but failed to sack the city and prayed to Zeus that the Athenians may be punished. The city was struck with famine and pestilence. The Athenians consulted an oracle as to how to avert the calamity, and were instructed to sacrifice the daughters of Hyacinthus the Lacedaemonian, but this didn't help. The citizens consulted the oracle once again and were told to give Minos whatever he <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> in retribution. The king obliged the Athenians to send several youths every seven or nine years to be devoured by the Minotaur. This continued until the Minotaur was killed by Theseus.|$|E

25|$|On November 6, 1957, the {{day after}} voters {{rejected}} the proposed bond issue, Mayor Celebrezze met with officers of the Equitable Life Insurance Co. to assess its interest in financing the new convention center. Celebrezze told the press that he would push for a revised bond proposal {{to be placed on}} the November 1958 ballot, and that he <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> Cuyahoga County voters to approve the proposal as well. Celebrezze suggested that the revised proposal would cover not only the convention center but the hotel, office building, and plaza as well. To build support for the new push, Celebrezze met the following day with Council member Russell, Joseph E. Flannery of the Heart of Cleveland group, and Cuyahoga County officials. Russell and Flannery agreed that the bond proposal should go before all Cuyahoga County voters, not just city voters. Cuyahoga County officials asked that the city turn title Municipal Stadium and Public Auditorium over to the county in exchange for the county's support for the project. Russell suggested that Celebrezze scale back the size of the redevelopment, and Flannery agreed with his idea. Celebrezze was also told by others present at the meeting that the city should come up with a master plan for redeveloping downtown and for beginning a citywide urban renewal effort to show voters that the convention center would fit with this wider effort.|$|E
25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person who is going to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E
500|$|Heartbleed is {{therefore}} exploited {{by sending a}} malformed heartbeat request with a small payload and large length field to the vulnerable party (usually a server) in order to elicit the victim's response, permitting attackers to read up to 64 kilobytes of the victim's memory that was {{likely to have been}} used previously by OpenSSL.

Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|E
