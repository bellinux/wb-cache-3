25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group {{might well be}} seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the <b>middle</b> <b>office</b> such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on <b>middle</b> <b>office</b> functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} interest for performance measurement, in both the academic literature and by practitioners. Most organizations measure performance relying on financial/nonfinancial measures such as Human resources management, products/services quality and customer satisfaction, to evaluate their success and growth. The purpose of this dissertation focuses on studying the performance and efficiency of the operational division of an international bank. More precisely, measuring and comparing the performance of two different organizational banking models currently adopted by corporate banking front offices (CBFs) which work exclusively with enterprises 1. It will successfully be done by adopting a particular methodology (Diagnosis Model) based on performance indicators (PIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs). Overall, the study highlights on the performance assessment of seven CBFs of the bank from different perspectives (ex. Employees’ profile, number of operations and reworks) from data of 2011 and 2014. At the end, {{it was found that}} CBFs without <b>Middle</b> <b>Offices</b> perform differently than CBFs with <b>Middle</b> <b>Offices.</b> Certainly, by employing a structured and particular methodology developed by myself, my project team and the client project team, and taking the opportunity to regularly contact the bank directors and employees, this thesis has enhanced my development as an academic and will positively improve my ability in future professional settings. Also, due to the conclusions taken from this thesis it may be a valuable tool to what concerns key strategic decisions concerning CBFs, in the short and long term...|$|R

40|$|E-commerce {{systems may}} be {{considered}} as 3 -layers information logical structure consistent of front office, <b>middle</b> <b>office</b> and back office layers. Front office is the best described layer of the model. It is related to direct information exchange between the client and hardcore part of the organization. The back office related to LAN information exchange and physical realization of front office demands is also well matured. But there is one important problem: all front office applications are stateless type (after cancelling the session, all data are lost), whereas back office applications are real time with necessity of blocking records, generation of online fiscal documents, etc. Any model of a-business defines its own supply chain. A linkage between logical layers and the defined supply chain is forming by modules and functions of the <b>middle</b> <b>office</b> layer. This layer limits full operational ability of the e-commerce systems like, ZenCart. The main problems derive from the computerization and integration of the supply chain. The offered solutions for the <b>middle</b> <b>office</b> layer are usually either too complicated or improper for online integration. Therefore for successful rolling out of computer aided e-commerce system, the optimum structure of the <b>middle</b> <b>office</b> layer design is crucial, because there {{are the most important}} conceptual limits...|$|E
