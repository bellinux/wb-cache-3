50|$|Electric motors {{experience}} losses due to hysteresis and {{eddy currents}} {{set up in}} the iron core of the motor. These are proportional to the frequency of the current. Since the harmonics are at higher frequencies, they produce higher core losses in a motor than the power frequency would. This results in increased heating of the <b>motor</b> <b>core,</b> which (if excessive) can shorten the life of the motor. The 5th harmonic causes a CEMF (counter electromotive force) in large motors which acts in the opposite direction of rotation. The CEMF is not large enough to counteract the rotation, however it does play a small role in the resulting rotating speed of the motor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>motor</b> <b>core</b> {{is usually}} {{manufactured}} from magnetic steel sheet with press machine. However, usually {{most parts of}} the plate are scalped, and only small percent of the sheet is used for the core. The spiral accumulating core system is suitable for manufacturing the core more ecologically because in this system more than 50 % of the magnetic steel sheet can be used. However, since the spiral accumulating core has many slits and embossing interlockings, the equivalent Young's modulus is not known. In this study, therefore, the equivalent Young's modulus of the spiral accumulating core is considered in order to find out a good method to fix the core. Here, the finite element method is applied to analyze the permanent magnet <b>motor</b> <b>core,</b> whose layers and slits are periodically arranged. Then, the effects of slits, layers and embossing interlockings on equivalent Young's modulus are discussed. It is found that around the slits the core layer should be considered to have zero elastic modulus because no tangential stress exists. Finally, a convenient method of calculation based on rule of mixture is newly proposed to estimate the equivalent Young's modulus efficiently...|$|E

The folding of the <b>core</b> <b>motor</b> domain resembles that of human kinesin reported recently [Kull, F. J., et al. (1996) Nature 380, 550 − 554]. Novel features of the structure include the N-terminal region, folded as a β-strand, and the C-terminal transition from the motor to the rod domain, folded as two β-strands plus an α-helix. This helix {{is the beginning of}} kinesin's neck responsible for dimerization of the motor complex and for force transduction. Although the folding of the <b>motor</b> domain <b>core</b> {{is similar to that of}} a domain of myosin (an actin-dependent motor), the position and angle of kinesin's neck are very different from those of myosin's stalk, suggesting that the two motors have different mechanisms of force transduction.

40|$|The kinesin- 13 {{class of}} motors catalyses {{microtubule}} depolymerisation by bending tubulins at microtubule ends.

40|$|Dynein {{interacts with}} microtubules through a {{dedicated}} binding domain that is dynamically controlled to achieve {{high or low}} affinity, depending {{on the state of}} nucleotide bound in a distant catalytic pocket. The active sites for microtubule binding and ATP hydrolysis communicate via conformational changes transduced through a ∼ 10 -nm length antiparallel coiled-coil stalk, which connects the binding domain to the roughly 300 -kDa <b>motor</b> <b>core.</b> Recently, an x-ray structure of the murine cytoplasmic dynein microtubule binding domain (MTBD) in a weak affinity conformation was published, containing a covalently constrained β+ registry for the coiled-coil stalk segment (Carter, A. P., Garbarino, J. E., Wilson-Kubalek, E. M., Shipley, W. E., Cho, C., Milligan, R. A., Vale, R. D., and Gibbons, I. R. (2008) Science 322, 1691 – 1695). We here present an NMR analysis of the isolated MTBD from Dictyostelium discoideum that demonstrates the coiled-coil β+ registry corresponds to the low energy conformation for this functional region of dynein. Addition of sequence encoding roughly half of the coiled-coil stalk proximal to the binding tip results in a decreased affinity of the MTBD for microtubules. In contrast, addition of the complete coiled-coil sequence drives the MTBD to the conformationally unstable, high affinity binding state. These results suggest a thermodynamic coupling between conformational free energy differences in the α and β+ registries of the coiled-coil stalk that acts as a switch between high and low affinity conformations of the MTBD. A balancing of opposing conformations in the stalk and MTBD enables potentially modest long-range interactions arising from ATP binding in the <b>motor</b> <b>core</b> to induce a relaxation of the MTBD into the stable low affinity state...|$|E

This twofold study has investigated the impact of short circuit and the impact of short circuit positions on total power loss. Multiple shorts have been applied at different positions.
