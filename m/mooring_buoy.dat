5|$|Two {{research}} vessels have sailed in the US {{bearing the}} name R/V Rachel Carson. One {{is on the}} west coast, owned by MBARI, {{and the other is}} on the east coast, operated by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. Another vessel of the name, now scrapped, was a former naval vessel obtained and converted by the US EPA. it operated on the Great Lakes. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary also operates a <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy</b> maintenance vessel named the Rachel Carson.|$|E
5|$|Since {{receiving}} its startup funding, Florida Atlantic has secured {{additional funds}} from other sources, including federal and private research grants. As a result, both centers {{have engaged in}} academic and industry partnerships, combining expertise in ocean engineering, marine biotechnology, functional genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Researchers, scientists, and students at the centers are designing technologies to explore the sea, harvest renewable energy, discover new medicines, and develop new therapeutics to combat agents of bioterrorism. As {{a result of this}} research, in 2007 the university and Lockheed Martin announced an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and produce a rapidly deployable and autonomous <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy</b> system for military and scientific uses.|$|E
40|$|This study {{consists}} of a literature review of various types of <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> systems. Depending on its purpose and mission, <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> systems may be either a singled moored line or a multi-leg system which is heavily instrumented and may be deployed in deep seas and in severe sea states. The development of mathematical models based on static and dynamic systems are reviewed to develop an engineering approach for <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> system design. Models based {{on the principles of}} naval architecture are also used to determine the frequency response of buoy systems operating in both current and wave conditions. A synthesis of the methods used in designing <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> systems is reviewed in this section. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

2500|$|Three deadweights in the {{south-west}} of {{the rock}} were laid down, to dock the boat nearby during [...] and ebb tides. A <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy</b> floated {{a short distance from}} the steamboat.

2500|$|The basic rode {{system is}} a line, cable, or chain several times longer than {{the depth of the}} water running from the anchor to the <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy,</b> the longer the rode is the {{shallower}} the angle of force on the anchor (it has more scope). [...] A shallower scope means more of the force is pulling horizontally so that ploughing into the substrate adds holding power but also increases the swinging circle of each mooring, so lowering the density of any given mooring field. By adding weight {{to the bottom of the}} rode, such as the use of a length of heavy chain, the angle of force can be dropped further. Unfortunately, this scrapes up the substrate in a circular area around the anchor. A buoy can be added along the lower portion of rode to hold it off the bottom and avoid this issue.|$|E
60|$|Leaving {{the road}} outside the village, they struck across some wet fields {{and came to}} a marsh, through which a muddy creek wound crookedly. After jumping deep drains and floundering through rushes, they reached a steep bank of gravel, with a cut where the creek made its way to the sea. A <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy</b> floated in the channel; and across the channel lay a waste of sand, dotted with shallow pools. This ran seaward until it was lost in the haze.|$|E

40|$|A 10 m height {{wind vector}} data set, named CMODFD, from ERS- 1 Active Microwave Instrument (AMI) measurements, was {{compared}} with <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> wind observations. The CMODFD wind vectors compared favorably with <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> wind observations at about 60 sites. Satisfactory results {{were obtained from}} intercomparisons between CMODFD and <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> estimates of horizontal wind divergence and wind stress curl. The CMODFD positions of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) at 28 deg west were nearly equal to those determined from satellite images of clouds.

60|$|The voyage, however, {{came to an}} end {{almost too}} soon, and the rocks and firs were growing dim when they ran into the cove and picked up their <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy.</b> After they had stowed and covered the sails they went ashore, and both boys were very tired and warm when they reached the homestead. Harry's clothes were covered with flour, which had left a white trail along the way.

60|$|It was a boisterous day, half a gale of wind {{against the}} flood tide. Two fellows managed her. A youngster of {{seventeen}} was cox (and a first-rate cox he was too); a fellow in a torn blue jersey, not much older, {{of the usual}} riverside type, looked after the engine. I spent {{an hour and a}} half in her, running up and down and across that reach. She handled perfectly. With eight or twelve oars out she could not have done anything like as well. These two youngsters at my request kept her stationary for ten minutes, with a touch of engine and helm now and then, within three feet of a big, ugly <b>mooring</b> <b>buoy</b> over which the water broke and the spray flew in sheets, and which would have holed her if she had bumped against it. But she kept her position, it seemed to me, to an inch, without apparently any trouble to these boys. You could not have done it with oars. And her engine did not take up the space of three men, even on the assumption that you would pack people as tight as sardines in a box.|$|E

40|$|A Jan. - Jun. 1992 10 m height {{wind vector}} field was {{computed}} with the CMOD 2 model function.

The ESA and FD model functions and algorithms were substantially different. The FD wind vectors were in better agreement with the climatological mean wind field and with <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> wind measurements. The average correlation coefficients between monthly mean and daily averaged FD and <b>moored</b> <b>buoy</b> matchups of the Cartesian wind components were 0. 84 and 0. 74, respectively.
