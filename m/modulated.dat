The modulation means considered here are continuously variable-speed drives. The <b>modulating</b> performance data were obtained for purposes of:- establishing a technology base for <b>modulating</b> components,- providing a foundation for <b>modulating</b> model development, and- screening compressor and drive types to be used in <b>modulating</b> system design assessments. For the screening analyses, the relative performance of various compressors and drives was evaluated under appropriate <b>modulating</b> conditions.

Background Preliminary capacity modulation assessment work was reported at the previous DOE/ORNL Heat Pump C 0 nference. l In that work, annual performance gains of 36 % (26. 5 % energy savings) compared to that of conventional single-speed heat pumps (with rather large cycling lossesa) were predicted for a moderate climate. These predictions were based on early estimates of possible compressor and blower modulating-drive efficiencies, and they contained significant uncertainties with regard not only to drive efficiencies but also to basic hermetic reciprocating compressor performance over the assumed speed ranges. The dynamic losses for such <b>modulating</b> systems were likewise roughly estimated. *Research sponsored by the Office of Building...|$|R

In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
