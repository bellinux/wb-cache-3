5|$|Space Run is a tower defense {{video game}} {{developed}} by PassTech Games {{and published by}} Focus Home Interactive. It was released for Microsoft Windows on June 13, 2014, and later released for OS X and Linux. The player assumes {{the role of a}} cargo ship pilot, and <b>must</b> <b>build</b> modules and weapons to defend their cargo from attacking ships and other hazards. The game received mixed reviews from critics, and a sequel was announced in March 2016.|$|E
5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations <b>must</b> <b>build</b> a Wonder to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player <b>must</b> <b>build</b> a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as coconut shies and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|E

5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player <b>must</b> <b>build</b> rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from their}} initial headquarters, races may build {{research}} and resource centers, unit-producing facilities, and defensive fortifications. Research buildings may research special upgrades {{that increase the}} abilities of that race's units, while resource buildings produce resources. Unit facilities produce infantry and vehicles. In order to access their next tier, a race <b>must</b> <b>build</b> certain buildings to unlock new technologies and buildings.|$|E

50|$|The {{advent of}} digital {{television}} makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast {{as part of}} a multiplex that carries several channels in one signal, and {{it is almost impossible to}} insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only <b>must</b> the perpetrator <b>build</b> or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he <b>must</b> also <b>build</b> or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to digitally encode the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.|$|R
25|$|The Troitsky Bridge Building Competition brings {{together}} engineering students from across Canada {{and parts of}} the United States. Teams of students representing their universities <b>must</b> <b>build</b> a 1-metre-long bridge using only regular popsicle sticks, toothpicks, dental floss, and white glue. A panel of judges grades the bridges based on originality and presentation while a hydraulic loading device is used to determine the maximum load and performance.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{primarily}} a variant on the tower defense game mechanic. Players <b>must</b> <b>build</b> traps and fortify doors and windows to keep a horde of zombies from entering a given building. During gameplay players can also scavenge the building for additional powerups, items and things that can assist in keeping the zombies at bay. The game can be played locally with four players in a splitscreen format, and includes ten single player levels along with an additional eight multiplayer co-op levels.|$|E
25|$|The player's {{territory}} {{can only}} be expanded by using pioneers or building a military complex near the territory border. Each complex must {{have at least one}} soldier garrisoned for the territory to expand. To recruit soldiers, the player <b>must</b> <b>build</b> a barracks, with each individual soldier requiring their requisite weapon to transition from settler to soldier. The player can also build lookout towers, which are manned by regular settlers, and which can see for great distances, but don't grant new territory.|$|E

5000|$|Significant new build {{activity}} {{is occurring in}} developing countries like South Korea, India and China. China has 25 reactors under construction, However, according to a government research unit, China <b>must</b> not <b>build</b> [...] "too many nuclear power reactors too quickly", {{in order to avoid}} a shortfall of fuel, equipment and qualified plant workers.|$|R
25|$|Infrastructure {{in general}} (if not every {{infrastructure}} project) plays {{a vital role}} in a city's capacity for economic activity and expansion, underpinning the very survival of the city’s inhabitants, as well as technological, commercial, industrial, and social activities. Structurally, many infrastructure systems take the form of networks with redundant links and multiple pathways, so that the system as a whole continue to operate even if parts of it fail. The particulars of a city’s infrastructure systems have historical path dependence because new development <b>must</b> <b>build</b> from what exists already.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} work {{required}} to implement a filter graph depends on several factors. In the simplest case, DirectShow can create a filter graph automatically from a source such as a file or URL. If this is not possible, the developer {{may be able to}} manually create a filter graph from a source file, possibly {{with the addition of a}} custom filter, and then let DirectShow complete the filter graph by connecting the filters together. At the next level, the developer <b>must</b> <b>build</b> the filter graph from scratch by manually adding and connecting each desired filter. Finally, in cases where an essential filter is unavailable, the developer must create a custom filter before a filter graph can be built.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of the Electoral College claim such {{outcomes}} do not logically {{follow the}} normative concept {{of how a}} democratic system should function. One view is the Electoral College violates the principle of political equality, since presidential elections are not decided by the one-person one-vote principle. Outcomes of this sort are attributable to the federal nature of the system. Supporters of the Electoral College argue candidates <b>must</b> <b>build</b> a popular base that is geographically broader and more diverse in voter interests than either a simple national plurality or majority. Neither is this feature attributable to having intermediate elections of presidents, caused instead by the winner-takes-all method of allocating each state's slate of electors. Allocation of electors {{in proportion to the}} state's popular vote could reduce this effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislature}} {{insisted that}} before this charter {{and its associated}} subsidies was made real, the company <b>must</b> first <b>build</b> 10 miles of its line.

50|$|Airport Tycoon is a {{business}} simulation game released for Windows 95/98 in 2000. It {{was developed in the}} United Kingdom by Krisalis Software (now defunct). In Airport Tycoon, the player <b>must</b> successfully <b>build</b> and manage an airport without going bankrupt. There have been two sequels created for Airport Tycoon: Airport Tycoon 2 and Airport Tycoon 3.|$|R

It is {{more from the}} feeling that nothing should be untried, than from the expectation {{that he can be}} of use." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{multiplayer}} games, {{there are}} seven different game types available, {{all of which are}} provided as standard with the game: Supremacy—the standard game mode—includes randomly generated map and all gameplay aspects; Conquest is similar to Supremacy, but victory is only possible by defeating all other players; in Deathmatch players begin the game with high resources, but the game is otherwise the same as Supremacy; in Lightning, the gameplay is identical to Supremacy, but the game plays at twice the normal speed; in Nomad mode, players start with one civilian unit, and no Town Center, and <b>must</b> <b>build</b> up on a settlement; the goal of King of the Hill is to control a monument {{in the center of the}} map for a set period of time; and in Sudden Death, a player loses if their Town Center is destroyed, and they fail to rebuild it within a set period of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} and co-programmed by Volker Wertich, creator of the original Settlers game. Having consulted fan feedback from the first two games, Wertich wanted to expand {{the scope of the}} third installment as much as possible, whilst preserving the elements which made the series unique. In light of this design principal, although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly the same as in previous titles, many of the game mechanics have been altered. For example, combat is more involved, with the player given direct control over their army; roads are no longer necessary to connect buildings, as all settlers can now walk freely around the player's territory; headquarters no longer automatically generate settlers as required, instead the player <b>must</b> <b>build</b> residences to gain new settlers; and the different races are no longer merely aesthetically differentiated, they now have different economic models, different magic spells, different war machines, and several unique abilities and buildings. The game was also the first in the series to feature online multiplayer, the addition of which {{had been one of the}} main requests from fans.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} August 1913, Captain Bucey {{was taking}} the BC Express up from Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache when he was stopped a cable strung across the river at Mile 141 where the railway was {{building}} a bridge. Although the railway had promised {{that they would not}} impede steamer travel on the river, it was apparent that they were doing just that. Bucey turned the BC Express back towards Fort George and immediately wired the company's head office at Ashcroft and informed them of the obstruction. The BC Express Company had the Board of Railway Commissioners investigate the situation and the Board came back in the company's favor and told the railway they <b>must</b> <b>build</b> the bridge at Mile 141 and the other at Bear River with lift spans as they had promised. The GTP refused the order, stating that if they changed the level of the bridges they'd have to change the level of the grade. The company took the railway to court for damages and loss of revenue, as they had been earning in excess of $5000 a week on that route, {{but by the time the}} case was heard, World War I had begun and the company's attorney was engaged in war work and was unable to appear. His replacement, a junior partner with little experience, was unable to prepare and present the evidence properly and the company lost the case.|$|E
