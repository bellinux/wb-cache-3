This role has not been taken up by community pharmacists. This study aimed to explore attitudes, knowledge, barriers and incentives towards involvement of community pharmacists in New Zealand with problem drinkers. Method. A postal survey (three <b>mailshots)</b> of community pharmacies was undertaken in Auckland, New Zealand, followed by a 10 % random sample non-responder-follow-up. Results. A response rate of 39. 1 % to the postal survey was obtained. In general, knowledge of alcohol content of drinks and recommended safe drinking limits was poor. Respondents were generally well motivated towards undertaking this role, but lacked knowledge, skills and confidence. On follow-up, non-responders were found to be less knowledgeable, but had similar attitudes to respondents, indicating potential for extrapolation with regard to beliefs and views on this subject. Discussion. This novel study has found that there is potential for involvement of community pharmacists in New Zealand in SBI for problem drinkers. Lack of knowledge can be remedied relatively easily; greater hurdles such as lack of skills, and lack of confidence may be offset by the high level of motivation of this group. This is an area where community pharmacists can further their professional scope of practice by being in an essential position to provide this service.

40|$|Background Recruitment to {{trials in}} primary care is often difficult, {{particularly}} when practice staff need to identify study participants with acute conditions during consultations. The Scottish Acute Recruitment Management Application (SARMA) system is linked to general practice electronic medical record (EMR) systems and {{is designed to provide}} recruitment support to multi-centre trials by screening patients against trial inclusion criteria and alerting practice staff if the patient appears eligible. For patients willing {{to learn more about the}} trial, the software allows practice staff to send the patient's contact details to the research team by text message. Aim To evaluate the ability of the software to support trial recruitment. Design of study Software evaluation embedded in a randomised controlled trial. Setting Five general practices in Tayside and Fife, Scotland. Methods SARMA was used to support recruitment to a feasibility trial (the Response to Oral Agents in Diabetes, or ROAD trial) looking at users of oral therapy in diabetes. The technical performance of the software and its utility as a recruitment tool were evaluated. Results The software was successfully installed at four of the five general practices and recruited 11 of the 29 participants for ROAD (other methods were letter and direct invitation by a practice nurse) and had a recruitment return of 35 % (11 of 31 texts sent led to a recruitment). Screen failures were relatively low (7 of 31 referred). Practice staff members were positive about the system. Conclusion An automated recruitment tool can support primary care trials in Scotland and has the potential to support recruitment in other jurisdictions. It offers a low-cost supplement to other trial recruitment methods and is likely to have a much lower screen failure rate than blanket approaches such as <b>mailshots</b> and newspaper campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with good and poor recruitment to multicentre trials. Data sources: Part A: database of trials started in or after 1994 and were due to end before 2003 held by the Medical Research Council and Health Technology Assessment Programmes. Part B: interviews with people playing {{a wide range of}} roles within four trials that their funders identified as ‘exemplars’. Part C: a large multicentre trial (the CRASH trial) of treatment for head injury. Review methods: The study used a number of different perspectives (‘multiple lenses’), and three components. Part A: an epidemiological review of a cohort of trials. Part B: case studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment. Part C: a single, in-depth case study to examine the feasibility of applying a businessorientated analytical framework as a reference model in future trials. Results: In the 114 trials found in Part A, less than one-third recruited their original target within the time originally specified, and around one-third had extensions. Factors observed more often in trials that recruited successfully were: having a dedicated trial manager, being a cancer or drug trial, and having interventions only available inside the trial. The most commonly reported strategies to improve recruitment were newsletters and <b>mailshots,</b> but {{it was not possible to}} assess whether they were causally linked to changes in recruitment. The analyses in Part B suggested that successful trials were those addressing clinically important questions at a timely point. The investigators were held in high esteem by the interviewees, and the trials were firmly grounded in existing clinical practices, so that the trial processes were not alien to clinical collaborators, and the results could be easily applicable to future practice. The interviewees considered that the needs of patients were well served by participation in the trials. Clinical collaborators particularly appreciated clear delineation of roles, which released them from much of the workload associated with trial participation. There was a strong feeling from interviewees that they were proud to be part of a successful team. This pride fed into further success. Good groundwork and excellent communications across many levels of complex trial structures were considered to be extremely important, including training components for learning about trial interventions and processes, and team building. All four trials had faced recruitment problems, and extra insights into the working of trials were afforded by strategies invoked to address them. The process of the case study in Part C was able to draw attention to a body of research and practice in a different discipline (academic business studies). It generated a reference model derived from a combination of business theory and work within CRASH. This enabled identification of weaker managerial components within CRASH, and initiatives to strengthen them. Although it is not clear, even within CRASH, whether the initiatives that follow from developing and applying the model will be effective in increasing recruitment or other aspects of the success of the trial, the reference model could provide a template, with potential for those managing other trials to use or adapt it, especially at foundation stages. The model derived from this project could also be used as a diagnostic tool if trials have difficulties and hence as a basis for deciding what type of remedial action to take. It may also be useful for auditing the progress of trials, such as during external review. Conclusions: While not producing sufficiently definitive results to make strong recommendations, the work here suggests that future trials should consider the different needs at different phases in the life of trials, and place greater emphasis on ‘conduct’ (the process of actually doing trials). This implies learning lessons from successful trialists and trial managers, with better training for issues relating to trial conduct. The complexity of large trials means that unanticipated difficulties are highly likely at some time in every trial. Part B suggested that successful trials were those flexible and robust enough to adapt to unexpected issues. Arguably, the trialists should also expect agility from funders within a proactive approach to monitoring ongoing trials. Further research into different recruitment patterns (including ‘failures’) may help to clarify whether the patterns seen in the ‘exemplar’ trials differ or are similar. The reference model from Part C needs to be further considered in other similar and different trials to assess its robustness. These and other strategies aimed at increasing recruitment and making trials more successful need to be formally evaluated for their effectiveness in a range of trials.

40|$|Abstract Background Better use of e-health {{services}} by patients could improve outcomes {{and reduce costs}} but there are concerns about inequalities of access. Previous research in outpatients suggested that anonymous personal email support may help patients with long term conditions to use e-health, but recruiting earlier in their 'journey' may benefit patients more. This pilot study explored the feasibility and cost of recruiting patients for an e-health intervention in one primary care trust. Methods The sample comprised 46 practices with total patient population of 250, 000. We approached all practices using various methods, seeking collaboration to recruit patients via methods agreed with each practice. A detailed research diary was kept of time spent recruiting practices and patients. Researcher time was used to estimate costs. Patients who consented to participate were offered email support for {{their use of the}} Internet for health. Results Eighteen practices agreed to take part; we recruited 27 patients, most (23 / 27) from five practices. Practices agreed to recruit patients for an e-health intervention via waiting room leaflets (16), posters (16), practice nurses (15), doctors giving patients leaflets (5), a study website link (7), inclusion in planned mailshots (2), and a special <b>mailshot</b> to patients selected from practice computers (1). After low recruitment response we also recruited directly in five practices through research assistants giving leaflets to patients in waiting rooms. Ten practices recruited no patients. Those practices that were more difficult to recruit were less likely to recruit patients. Leaving leaflets for practice staff to distribute and placing posters in the practice were not effective in recruiting patients. Leaflets handed out by practice nurses and website links were more successful. The practice with lowest costs per patient recruited (£ 70) used a special <b>mailshot</b> to selected patients. Conclusion Recruitment via general practice was not successful and was therefore expensive. Direct to consumer methods and recruitment of patients in outpatients to offer email support may be more cost effective. If recruitment in general practice is required, contacting practices by letter and email, not following up non-responding practices, and recruiting patients with selected conditions by special <b>mailshot</b> may be the most cost-effective approach. </p...|$|E

Respondents were able to report contacts either as individuals or as members of a group with a reported size. Allowing the reporting of groups of individuals was a deliberate methodological design to permit the easy reporting of large numbers of contacts, to avoid the approach taken by previous studies [11], which imposed a high burden on respondents with large number of contacts, and to ensure the best capture of the right-hand tail of the degree distribution. In general, we expect that such data will become increasingly available due to the epidemiological importance of this tail (e.g. the study of Read et al. [21]).|$|E

40|$|Background: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines (CPGs) recommend universal {{prenatal screening}} for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early onset neonatal GBS infection. Interventions to promote physician adherence to these guidelines are imperative. This {{study examined the}} effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) of obstetricians, compared with CPG <b>mailshot</b> and no intervention, on the screening of pregnant women for GBS. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in the medical cooperative of Porto Alegre, Brazil. All obstetricians who assisted in a delivery covered by private health insurance managed by the cooperative in the 3 months preceding the study (n = 241) were invited to participate. The obstetricians were randomized to three groups: direct mail (DM, n = 76), AD (n = 76) and control (C, n = 89, no intervention). Those in the DM group were sent guidelines on GBS. The AD group received the guidelines and an educational visit detailing the guidelines, which was conducted by a trained physician. Data on obstetrician age, gender, time since graduation, whether patients received GBS screening during pregnancy, and obstetricians who requested screening were collected for all participant obstetricians for 3 months {{before and after the}} intervention, using database from the private health insurance information system. Results: Three months post-intervention, the data showed that the proportion of pregnant women screened for GBS was higher in the AD group (25. 4 %) than in the DM (15. 9 %) and C (17. 7 %) groups (P = 0. 023). Similar results emerged when the three groups were taken as a cluster (pregnant women and their obstetricians), but the difference was not statistically significant (Poisson regression, P = 0. 108). Additionally, when vaginal deliveries were analyzed separately, the proportion screened was higher in the AD group (75 %) than in the DM group (41. 9 %) and the C group (30. 4 %) (chi-square, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Complex {{interventions}} {{are widely used}} in modern health care practice and are defined as those having potentially interacting components. Evaluation can be challenging due to difficulties in logistics, standardisation and delivery. In addition, there can be difficulty recruiting to time and to target (particularly in multicentre studies) and minimising attrition and data loss. We report how the RAFT study [a seven-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a complex group cognitive-behavioural (CB) intervention with standard care for the reduction of fatigue impact in patients with RA) is implementing successful strategies to meet recruitment, intervention delivery and retention targets. The study requires patients to make a substantial commitment over a 2 year period and for the intervention to be delivered by routine clinical staff trained for this purpose. Methods: The following strategies were agreed upon during the planning and design phase: Maximising recruitment: Funded research nurse time at all seven sites; <b>mailshot</b> option for approach; recruitment posters for clinics; flexible and pragmatic approach to session attendance; telephone, email and postal contact; newsletter and regular knowledge exchange between the central trial management team and sites; weekly recruitment updates and reviews. Ensuring intervention delivery: Flexible course dates and times set by each site, regular communication with the central management team to discuss foreseeable issues and preventative actions, provision of real-time clinical supervision and full-time telephone/email support. Minimising attrition and data loss: Primary outcome collection by telephone, ensuring regular personal contact; secondary data collection by postal questionnaire, {{reducing the number of}} hospital visits; telephone reminders; partial withdrawal options; personalized letters and thank you cards. Patient involvement: We had a number of acceptability and feasibility consultations with our two patient partners. Both partners had prior experience attending the intervention, were co-applicants on the grant proposal and continue to provide a patient perspective as members of the trial management group.
