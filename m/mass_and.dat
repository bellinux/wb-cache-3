5|$|The {{equivalence}} between <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> energy, {{as expressed}} by the formula E=mc, is the most famous consequence of special relativity. In relativity, <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> energy are two different ways of describing one physical quantity. If a physical system has energy, {{it also has the}} corresponding <b>mass,</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. In particular, all properties of a body that are associated with energy, such as its temperature or the binding energy of systems such as nuclei or molecules, contribute to that body's <b>mass,</b> <b>and</b> hence act as sources of gravity.|$|E

5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles).

5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> composition. When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product is less than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E

We adopt the see-saw {{mechanism for the}} explanation of smallness of neutrino <b>masses</b> <b>and</b> introduce the right-handed Majorana neutrinos and Dirac neutrinos.

5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, <b>mass,</b> <b>and</b> time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E

Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat.
