Several <b>merging</b> strategies, including raw-score <b>merging,</b> round-robin <b>merging,</b> normalized-score <b>merging,</b> and normalized-by-top-k <b>merging,</b> were investigated. The effects of translation penalty on <b>merging</b> was also examined. The experimental {{results show that}} the centralized approach is better than the distributed approach. In the distributed approach, the normalized-bytop-k <b>merging</b> with translation penalty outperforms other <b>merging</b> strategies, except for raw-score <b>merging.</b> Because the performances of English to other languages are similar, raw-score <b>merging</b> gives better performance in our experiments. However, raw-score <b>merging</b> is not workable in practice if different IR systems are adopted. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to <b>merging</b> DL-Lite ontologies by utilising an alternative semantic characterisation instead of classical DL mod-els. The new <b>merging</b> process consists of two operators (TBox <b>merging</b> and ABox <b>merging).</b> These operators satisfy several desirable properties for <b>merging,</b> which in turn demonstrates the suitability of the new approach to DL-Lite <b>merging.</b> It is shown that the complexity of our <b>merging</b> operators is {{on the same level}} as the complexity of propositional belief <b>merging.</b> Moreover, a new algorithm is developed for transforming the reasoning problem of DL-Lite <b>merging</b> into the evaluation of Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs). ...|$|R
5|$|The {{bottleneck}} of this {{greedy algorithm}} is the subproblem of finding which two clusters to <b>merge</b> in each step.|$|E
5|$|The {{main idea}} of the {{algorithm}} is to find pairs of clusters to <b>merge</b> by following paths in the nearest neighbor graph of the clusters. Every such path will eventually terminate at a pair of clusters that are nearest neighbors of each other, and the algorithm chooses that pair of clusters as the pair to <b>merge.</b> In order to save work by re-using {{as much as possible}} of each path, the algorithm uses a stack data structure to keep track of each path that it follows. By following paths in this way, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm merges its clusters in a different order than methods that always find and <b>merge</b> the closest pair of clusters. However, despite that difference, it always generates the same hierarchy of clusters.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} drivers' <b>merging</b> {{behavior}} and the rear-end crash risk in work zone <b>merging</b> areas during the entire <b>merging</b> implementation period {{from the time of}} starting a <b>merging</b> maneuver to that of completing the maneuver. With the <b>merging</b> traffic data from a work zone site in Singapore, a mixed probit model is developed to describe the <b>merging</b> behavior, and two surrogate safety measures including the time to collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid the crash (DRAC) are adopted to compute the rear-end crash risk between the <b>merging</b> vehicle and its neighboring vehicles. Results show that the <b>merging</b> vehicle has a bigger probability of completing a <b>merging</b> maneuver quickly under one of the following situations: (i) the <b>merging</b> vehicle moves relatively fast; (ii) the <b>merging</b> lead vehicle is a heavy vehicle; and (iii) there is a sizable gap in the adjacent through lane. Results indicate that the rear-end crash risk does not monotonically increase as the <b>merging</b> vehicle speed increases. The <b>merging</b> vehicle's rear-end crash risk is also affected by the vehicle type. There is a biggest increment of rear-end crash risk if the <b>merging</b> lead vehicle belongs to a heavy vehicle. Although the reduced remaining distance to work zone could urge the <b>merging</b> vehicle to complete a <b>merging</b> maneuver quickly, it might lead to an increased rear-end crash risk. Interestingly, it is found that the rear-end crash risk could be generally increased over the elapsed time after the <b>merging</b> maneuver being triggered. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the geometry of interplanetary magnetic field lines of force <b>merging</b> with geomagnetic field lines at the dayside magnetopause is traced from Dungey's picture of <b>merging</b> at the subsolar point to a three-dimensional picture in which <b>merging</b> occurs along curved lines that emanate from the polar cusps. The new <b>merging</b> configuration is shown {{to be consistent with}} recent observations of flux transfer at the dayside magnetopause and of convection patterns at high-latitudes. In terms of a bimodal model of the magnetosphere incorporating the new <b>merging</b> configuration, it is estimated from observations that the contributions to convection from <b>merging</b> and viscous interaction are about equal. Theoretical constraints on the <b>merging</b> process are traced from the requirement of antiparallel fields, to various dependences of the <b>merging</b> rate upon the angle between the <b>merging</b> fields, to no dependence at all.

The variations of <b>merging</b> positions become significant when the density of mainline is higher. A similar tendency can be observed if acceleration lane length becomes longer. Regarding <b>merging</b> speed, {{it is found that}} mainline traffic conditions significantly affect <b>merging</b> speeds. They decrease as traffic conditions become denser.

30|$|This {{shows that}} we can {{arbitrarily}} delay the moment when we consider a peak for <b>merging</b> {{as long as we}} respect the three <b>merging</b> rules. The mergers happening in the mean time cannot change the properties deciding if and through which saddle this peak will be <b>merged.</b> A possible way to prevent violation of <b>merging</b> rule (ii) is to consider all peaks for <b>merging</b> until no further mergers are possible before any new key saddle of the <b>merged</b> peaks is computed. This results in using the saddle points for <b>merging</b> on a ‘level-by-level’ basis. This is a key to the parallelization of phew since it will allow performing a big number of operations (mergers), in between each round of communication (finding new key saddles). Note that this line of argumentation breaks when we violate <b>merging</b> rule (iii) and use for example the clump mass as <b>merging</b> criterion. The mass is a property that changes with every merger. Therefore, altering the <b>merging</b> order does change the mass of a clump at the moment it is considered for <b>merging</b> and can thus change the decision whether the clumps should be <b>merged</b> or not.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Decision {{diagrams}} (DDs) are {{a popular}} means for decision making, e. g., in clinical guidelines. Some applications require to integrate multiple related yet different diagrams {{into a single}} one, for which algorithms have been developed. However, existing <b>merging</b> tools are monolithic, application-tailored programs with no clear interface to the actual <b>merging</b> procedures, which makes their reuse hard if not impossible. We present a general, declarative framework for <b>merging</b> and manipulating decision diagram tasks based on a belief set <b>merging</b> framework. Its modular architecture hides details of the <b>merging</b> algorithm and supports preand user-defined <b>merging</b> operators, which can be flexibly arranged in <b>merging</b> plans to express complex <b>merging</b> tasks. Changing and restructuring <b>merging</b> tasks becomes easy, and relieves the user from (repetitive) manual integration to focus on experimenting with different <b>merging</b> strategies, which is vital for applications, as discussed for an example from DNA classification. Our framework supports also reasoning over DDs using answer set programming (ASP), which allows to drive the <b>merging</b> process and select results based on the application needs. ...|$|R
