50|$|This becomes {{useful in}} {{photometry}} and colorimetry as the perceived color changes with source illumination and spectral distribution and coincides with <b>metamerisms</b> where an object's color appearance changes.|$|R
5000|$|From {{front to}} back, the basic {{shape of the}} {{earthworm}} is a cylindrical tube, divided {{into a series of}} segments (called <b>metamerisms)</b> that compartmentalize the body. Grooves called [...] "furrows" [...] are generally externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and nephridiopores exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm's surface, allowing it to breathe. Except for the mouth and anal segments, each segment carries bristle-like hairs called lateral setae used to anchor parts of the body during movement; species may have four pairs of setae on each segment or more than eight sometimes forming a complete circle of setae per segment. Special ventral setae are used to anchor mating earthworms by their penetration into the bodies of their mates.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} approximations {{assume a}} display device at gamma 2.2, using the sRGB color space. The further a display device deviates from these standards, the less accurate these swatches will be. Swatches {{are based on}} the average measurements of several lots of single-pigment watercolor paints, converted from Lab color space to sRGB color space for viewing on a computer display. Different brands and lots of the same pigment may vary in color. Furthermore, pigments have inherently complex reflectance spectra that will render their [...] greatly different depending on the spectrum of the source illumination; a property called <b>metamerism.</b> Averaged measurements of pigment samples will only yield approximations of their true appearance under a specific source of illumination. Computer display systems use a technique called chromatic adaptation transforms to emulate the correlated color temperature of illumination sources, and cannot perfectly reproduce the intricate spectral combinations originally seen. In many cases, the perceived color of a pigment falls outside of the gamut of computer displays and a method called gamut mapping is used to approximate the true appearance. Gamut mapping trades off any one of lightness, hue, or saturation accuracy to render the color on screen, depending on the priority chosen in the conversion's ICC rendering intent.|$|E
2500|$|The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) {{developed}} the XYZ model for describing {{the colors of}} light spectra in 1931, but its goal was to match human visual <b>metamerism,</b> rather than to be perceptually uniform, geometrically. In the 1960s and 70s, {{attempts were made to}} transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry, influenced by the Munsell system. These efforts culminated in the 1976 CIELUV and CIELAB models. The dimensions of these models— and , respectively—are cartesian, based on the opponent process theory of color, but both are also often described using polar coordinates— or [...] and also HCL, where L* is lightness, C* is chroma, and h* is hue angle. Officially, both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their color difference metrics ∆E*ab and ∆E*uv, particularly for use defining color tolerances, but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models, including in computer graphics and computer vision. For example, gamut mapping in ICC color management is usually performed in CIELAB space, and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images. CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as RGB, HSL, HSV, YUV/YIQ/YCbCr or XYZ, but are not perceptually perfect, and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{an animal}} may be {{classified}} as [...] "pseudometameric" [...] meaning that it has clear internal <b>metamerism</b> but no corresponding external <b>metamerism</b> as is seen, for example, in Monoplacophora.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in the spectral compositions of two metameric stimuli {{is often referred to}} as the degree of <b>metamerism.</b> The sensitivity of a metameric match to any changes in the spectral elements that form the colors depend on the degree of <b>metamerism.</b> Two stimuli with a high degree of <b>metamerism</b> are likely to be very sensitive to any changes in the illuminant, material composition, observer, field of view, and so on.|$|E

50|$|Nevertheless, they {{do provide}} a measure, called the <b>Metamerism</b> Index, {{to assess the}} quality of {{daylight}} simulators. The <b>Metamerism</b> Index tests how well five sets of metameric samples match under the test and reference illuminant. In {{a manner similar to}} the color rendering index, the average difference between the metamers is calculated.|$|E
50|$|In some schemes, {{the concept}} of <b>metamerism</b> is {{regarded}} as one of the four principles of construction of the human body, common to many animals, together with general bilateral symmetry (or zygomorphism), pachymerism (or tubulation), and stratification. More recent schemes include also other three concepts: segmentation (conceived as different from <b>metamerism),</b> polarity and endocrinosity.|$|E
50|$|In animals, metamery {{is defined}} as a mesodermal event {{resulting}} in serial repetition of unit subdivisions of ectoderm and mesoderm products. Endoderm is not involved in metamery. Segmentation is not the same concept as <b>metamerism.</b> Segmentation can be confined only to ectodermally derived tissue, e.g., in the Cestoda tapeworms. <b>Metamerism</b> is far more important biologically since it results in metameres, also called somites, that {{play a critical role in}} advanced locomotion.|$|E
50|$|In colorimetry, <b>metamerism</b> is a {{perceived}} matching {{of the colors}} that, based on differences in spectral power distribution, do not actually match. Colors that match this way are called metamers.|$|E
50|$|The best-known {{measure of}} <b>metamerism</b> {{is the color}} {{rendering}} index (CRI), which is a linear function of the mean Euclidean distance between the test and reference spectral reflectance vectors in the CIE 1964 color space. A newer measure, for daylight simulators, is the MI, CIE <b>Metamerism</b> Index which is derived by calculating the mean color difference of eight metamers (five in the visible spectrum and three in the ultraviolet range) in CIELAB or CIELUV. The salient difference between CRI and MI is the color space {{used to calculate the}} color difference, the one used in CRI being obsolete and not perceptually uniform.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} light sources with vastly {{different}} spectral power distributions {{can result in}} a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arise from two different spectral power distributions is called a <b>metamerism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The word <b>metamerism</b> {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} used {{to indicate a}} metameric failure rather than a match, or incorrectly used to describe {{a situation in which}} a metameric match is easily degraded by a slight change in conditions, such as a change in the illuminant.|$|E
5000|$|... homonymous metamery is {{a strict}} serial {{succession}} of metameres. It can be grouped into two more classifications known as pseudometamerism and true <b>metamerism.</b> An example of pseudometamerism is in class Cestoda. The tapeworm {{is composed of}} many repeating segments primarily for reproduction and basic nutrient exchange. Each segment acts independently from each other {{which is why it}} is not considered true <b>metamerism.</b> Another worm, the Earthworm in class Annelid can be an example of true <b>metamerism.</b> In each segment of the worm, a repetition of organs and muscle tissue can be found. What differentiates the Annelids from Cestoda is that the segments in the Earthworm all work together for the whole organism. It is believed that segmentation evolved for many reasons including a higher degree of motion. Taking the Earthworm for example, the segmentation of the muscular tissue allows the worm to move in an inching pattern. The circular muscles work to allow the segments elongate one by one and the Longitudinal muscles then work to shorten the elongated segments. This pattern continues down the entirety of the worm allowing it to inch along the surface. Each segment is allowed to work independently but towards the movement of the whole worm.|$|E
50|$|The {{chordates}} are metamerically segmented animals while Balanoglossus retains {{in adult}} stage, the trisegmental character of their larvae. According to Newman, Balanoglossus thus retains throughout life a larval organisation while Amphioxus and vertebrates have secondarily introduced <b>metamerism</b> by division of posterior coelom {{into a long}} scries of segments.|$|E
5000|$|A {{camera or}} {{colorimeter}} {{is said to}} be colorimetric if it satisfies the [...] by [...] (1868-1945) (also called the [...] "Maxwell-Ives criterion"), reducing observer <b>metamerism</b> color errors, if the product of the spectral responsivity of the photoreceptor and the spectral transmittance of the filters is a linear combination of the CMFs.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{standard}} monitor hardware specification for {{the digital}} {{release of the}} Munsell Vision Test. Correct and thorough monitor calibration takes into account human visual system <b>metamerism,</b> a phenomenon that combines several color science elements to generate visual matching colors regardless of differences in source illumination, although it is ultimately not universally effective.|$|E
50|$|Consider two light sources {{made up of}} {{different}} mixtures of various wavelengths. Such light sources {{may appear to be}} the same color; this effect is called <b>metamerism.</b> Such light sources have the same apparent color to an observer when they produce the same tristimulus values, no matter what the spectral power distributions of the sources are.|$|E
50|$|Augmented SRM is {{advantageous}} {{relative to}} the ASBC tristimulus method in that color under any viewing circumstances can be computed in addition to which the familiar SRM rating is retained. Because of <b>metamerism</b> one cannot, in the general case of non zero deviation coefficients, estimate the original spectrum from the L*a*b* values reported by the ASBC method.|$|E
5000|$|In biology, <b>metamerism</b> is the {{phenomenon}} of having a linear series of body segments fundamentally similar in structure, though not all such structures are entirely alike in any single life form because some of them perform special functions.In animals, metameric segments {{are referred to as}} somites or metameres. In plants, they are referred to as metamers or, more concretely, phytomers.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{and other}} {{chordates}} are conspicuous examples of organisms that have metameres intimately grouped into tagmata. In the Chordata the metameres of each tagma are fused {{to such an}} extent that few repetitive features are directly visible. Intensive investigation is necessary to discern the <b>metamerism</b> in the tagmata of such organisms. Examples of detectable evidence of vestigially metameric structures include branchial arches and cranial nerves.|$|E
5000|$|Color rendition: Most cool-white LEDs have spectra {{that differ}} {{significantly}} from a black body radiator like the sun or an incandescent light. The spike at 460 nm and dip at 500 nm can cause the color of objects to be perceived differently under cool-white LED illumination than sunlight or incandescent sources, due to <b>metamerism,</b> red surfaces being rendered particularly poorly by typical phosphor-based cool-white LEDs.|$|E
50|$|CIE Ra's {{ability to}} predict color {{appearance}} {{has been criticized}} in favor of measures based on color appearance models, such as CIECAM02 and, for daylight simulators, the CIE <b>Metamerism</b> Index. CRI {{is not a good}} indicator for use in visual assessment, especially for sources below 5000 kelvin (K). A newer version of the CRI, R96, has been developed, but it has not replaced the better-known Ra general color rendering index.|$|E
50|$|The Chirocephalus marchesonii {{stands out}} easily {{from the others}} branchiopods thanks to its long body, {{approximately}} cylindric, just as the non-attendance of shell. The body, which presents an obvious <b>metamerism,</b> is divided in three sections, face, thorax equipped of eleven pairs of appendix/fins also having a breathing function, and the abdomen which contains the reproduction organs: an egg sac for the female, and two penises of same length for the male.|$|E
50|$|Color matches made in {{the paint}} {{industry}} are often aimed at achieving a spectral color match rather than just a tristimulus (metameric) color match under a given spectrum of light. A spectral color match attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good metameric match with a low degree of <b>metamerism,</b> and thereby reducing {{the sensitivity of the}} resulting color match to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of the anus was an important stage {{in the evolution of}} multicellular animals. It appears to have happened at least twice, following different paths in protostomes and deuterostomes. This accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments: the bilaterian body plan, the coelom, and <b>metamerism,</b> in which the body was built of repeated [...] "modules" [...] which could later specialize, such as the heads of most arthropods, which are composed of fused, specialized segments.|$|E
5000|$|Spectral {{printing}} {{is the art}} {{and science}} of reproducing the spectra of a scene-referred image, by means of hard-copy printing using more than four process-colour printing inks namely cyan, magenta, yellow and black and their lighter versions. The additional secondary inks are {{often referred to as}} spot colours. As opposed to normal four-colour process printing, the aim of spectral printing is to eliminate or reduce [...] <b>metamerism</b> either due to illuminant or observer.|$|E
5000|$|A gray card is a flat {{object of}} a neutral gray color that derives from a flat {{reflectance}} spectrum. A typical {{example is the}} Kodak R-27 set, which contains two 8x10" [...] cards and one 4x5" [...] card which have 18% reflectance across the visible spectrum, and a white reverse side which has 90% reflectance. Note that flat spectral reflectance is a stronger condition than simply appearing neutral; this flatness ensures that the card appears neutral under any illuminant (see <b>metamerism).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Segmentation {{can be seen}} as {{originating}} in two ways. To caricature, the 'amplification' pathway would involve a single-segment ancestral organism becoming segmented by repeating itself. This seems implausible, and the 'parcellization' framework is generally preferred - where existing organization of organ systems is 'formalized' from loosely defined packets into more rigid segments. [...] As such, organisms with a loosely defined <b>metamerism,</b> whether internal (as some molluscs) or external (as onychophora), {{can be seen as}} 'precursors' to eusegmented organisms such as annelids or arthropods.|$|E
50|$|D65 {{corresponds}} roughly to {{the average}} midday light in Western Europe / Northern Europe (comprising both direct sunlight and the light diffused by a clear sky), hence it is also called a daylight illuminant. As any standard illuminant is represented as a table of averaged spectrophotometric data, any light source which statistically has the same relative spectral power distribution (SPD) {{can be considered a}} D65 light source. There are no actual D65 light sources, only simulators. The quality of a simulator can be assessed with the CIE <b>Metamerism</b> Index.|$|E
50|$|Also, dye-sublimation {{papers and}} ribbons are {{sensitive}} to skin oils, which interfere with the dye's ability to sublimate from the ribbon to the paper. They must also be free of dust particles, {{which can lead to}} small colored blobs appearing on the prints. Most dye-sublimation printers have filters and/or cleaning rollers to reduce the likelihood of this happening, and a speck of dust can only affect one print as it becomes attached to the print during the printing process. Finally, dye-sublimation printers fall short when producing neutral and toned black-and-white prints with higher density levels and virtually no <b>metamerism</b> or bronzing.|$|E
