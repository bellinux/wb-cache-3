This group of proteins is characterized by a polybasic proteolytic processing site that is cleaved to produce a mature protein containing seven conserved cysteine residues. Members of this family are regulators of cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues. Studies in yeast suggest that the encoded protein is involved in aging.

40|$|Experiments {{reported}} {{over the}} past several years, including genome-wide microarray approaches, have demonstrated that many eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) associate with multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) both in vitro and in vivo. This multitargeted binding property of RBPs has led to a model of regulated gene expression in eukaryotes that we termed the post-transcriptional operon. This concept was established by an analogy between polycistronic mRNAs that are generated from bacterial operons, and the co-ordinated regulation of multiple <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNAs</b> by RBPs. Post-transcriptional operons represent a powerful mechanism to organize and express genetic information as functionally related combinations of <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNAs.</b> In fact, much of the diversification of individual proteomes may be determined by the combinatorial properties of post-transcriptional operons. This review examines data supporting the role of post-transcriptional operons and regulons in organizing genetic information and co-ordinating expression of functionally related transcripts from their origins at transcription to their subsequent splicing, export and translation.

40|$|X-chromosome linked {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis (XIAP) mRNA {{has been}} proposed to bear a stress-activated internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that stimulates translation under conditions that inhibit cap-dependent initiation. However, several reports have indicated that the strong activity of the XIAP IRES in certain bicistronic reporter assay systems stems from production of unintended monocistronic transcripts through splicing or cryptic promoter activity. Here we extend these findings by providing evidence that the XIAP IRES similarly provokes the production of <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> encompassing the 3 ′ cistron in the βgal/CAT bicistronic reporter plasmid that was originally used to identify and characterize this putative IRES, through cryptic promoter activity...|$|E

25|$|In genetics, an operon is a {{functioning}} unit of genomic DNA containing {{a cluster of}} genes {{under the control of}} a single promoter. The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo trans-splicing to create <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNAs</b> that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be co-transcribed to define an operon.|$|R

40|$|Alpha-galactosides are {{abundant}} sugars in legumes such as soy. Because {{of the lack}} of α-galactosidase (α-Gal) in the digestive tract, humans are unable to digest these sugars, which consequently induce flatulence. To develop the consumption of the otherwise highly nutritional soy products, the use of exogenous α-Gal is promising. In this framework, we characterized the melA gene for α-Gal in Lactobacillus plantarum. The melA gene encodes a cytoplasmic 84 -kDa protein whose enzymatically active form occurs as oligomers. The melA gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding an active α-Gal. We show that melA is transcribed from its own promoter, yielding a <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA,</b> and that it is regulated at the transcriptional level, i. e., it is induced by melibiose but is not totally repressed by glucose. Posttranscriptional regulation by the carbon source could also occur. Upstream of melA, a putative galactoside transporter, designated RafP, was identified that shows high homology to LacS, the unique transporter for both α- and β-galactosides in Streptococcus thermophilus. rafP is also expressed as a <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA.</b> Downstream of melA, the lacL and lacM genes were identified that encode a heterodimeric β-galactosidase. A putative galM gene identified in the same cluster suggests the presence of a galactose operon. These results indicate that the genes involved in galactoside catabolism are clustered in L. plantarum ATCC 8014. This first genetic characterization of melA and of its putative associated transporter, rafP, in a lactobacillus opens doors to various applications both in the manufacture of soy-derived products and in probiotic and nutraceutical issues...|$|E

The dnaJ gene specified one <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> which was also heat inducible.

40|$|Translation {{initiation}} site usage {{on the human}} rhinovirus 2 internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has been examined in a mixed reticulocyte lysate/HeLa cell extract system. There are two relevant AUG triplets, both in a base-paired hairpin structure (domain VI), with one on the 5 ′ side at nucleotide (nt) 576, base paired with the other at nt 611, which is the {{initiation site}} for polyprotein synthesis. A single residue was inserted in the apical loop to put AUG- 576 in frame with AUG- 611, and in addition another in-frame AUG was introduced at nt 593. When most of the IRES was deleted to generate a <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA,</b> {{the use of these}} AUGs conformed to the scanning ribosome model: improving the AUG- 576 context increased initiation at this site and decreased initiation at downstream sites, whereas the converse was seen when AUG- 576 was mutated to GUA; and AUG- 593, when present, took complete precedence over AUG- 611. Under IRES-dependent conditions, by contrast, much less initiation occurred at AUG- 576 than in a <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> with the same AUG- 576 context, mutation of AUG- 576 decreased initiation at downstream sites by ∼ 70 %, and introduction of AUG- 593 did not completely abrogate initiation at AUG- 611, unless the apical base pairing in domain VI was destroyed by point mutations. These results indicate that ribosomes first bind at the AUG- 576 site, but instead of initiating there, most of them are transferred to AUG- 611, the majority by strictly linear scanning and a substantial minority by direct transfer, which is possibly facilitated by the occasional persistence of base pairing in the apical part of the domain VI stem...|$|E

This gene was located within the PstI I fragment of the AcMNPV genome (14. 7 to 17. 9 map units), immediately downstream of Ac-iap, the AcMNPV homolog of a baculovirus gene family involved in blocking apoptotic programmed cell death. The nature and temporal regulation of both Ac-iap and lef- 6 transcripts was examined. Ac-iap and lef- 6 were cotranscribed as bicistronic messages at both early and late times postinfection. In addition, lef- 6 was transcribed as a <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> by initiation from an early promoter within Ac-iap...|$|E

The amyP gene was expressed weakly in Escherichia coli, and transcription started 49 base pairs downstream of the P. stutzeri MO- 19 transcription start site. Synthesis of the amylase in P. stutzeri MO- 19 was induced {{by the addition of}} maltose to the culture medium and was repressed by the addition of glucose. The induction by maltose was shown to be result of transcription induction of the amyP gene. In contrast, glucose did not repress transcription initiation of amyP, indicating that it controls synthesis of the enzyme, probably at the posttranscriptional level...|$|E
40|$|Most plastid {{genes are}} part of operons and {{expressed}} as polycistronic mRNAs. Many primary polycistronic transcripts undergo post-transcriptional processing in monocistronic or oligocistronic units. At least some polycistronic transcripts are not translatable, and endonucleolytic processing may therefore be a prerequisite for translation to occur. As the requirements for intercistronic mRNA processing into stable monocistronic transcript are not well understood, we have sought to define minimum sequence elements that trigger processing and thus are capable of generating stable translatable <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNAs.</b> We describe here the in vivo identification of a small intercistronic expression element that mediates intercistronic cleavage into stable monocistronic transcripts. Separation of foreign genes by this element facilitates transgene stacking in operons, and thus will help to expand the range of applications of transplastomic technology...|$|R
40|$|Like {{bacterial}} genes, most plastid (chloroplast) {{genes are}} arranged in operons and transcribed as polycistronic mRNAs. Plastid protein biosynthesis occurs on bacterial-type 70 S ribosomes and translation initiation of many (but not all) mRNAs is mediated by Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences. To study the mechanisms of SD sequence recognition, we have analyzed translation initiation from mRNAs containing multiple SD sequences. Comparing translational efficiencies of identical transgenic mRNAs in Escherichia coli and plastids, we find surprising {{differences between the two}} systems. Most importantly, while internal SD sequences are efficiently recognized in E. coli, plastids exhibit a bias toward utilizing predominantly the 5 ′-most SD sequence. We propose that inefficient recognition of internal SD sequences provides the raison d'être for most plastid polycistronic transcripts undergoing post-transcriptional cleavage into <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNAs...</b>|$|R
50|$|Being acellular, viruses such as Ebola do not {{replicate}} {{through any}} type of cell division; rather, they {{use a combination of}} host- and virally encoded enzymes, alongside host cell structures, to produce multiple copies of themselves. These then self-assemble into viral macromolecular structures in the host cell. The virus completes a set of steps when infecting each individual cell.The virus begins its attack by attaching to host receptors through the glycoprotein (GP) surface peplomer and is endocytosed into macropinosomes in the host cell. To penetrate the cell, the viral membrane fuses with vesicle membrane, and the nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm. Encapsidated, negative-sense genomic ssRNA is used as a template for the synthesis (3'-5') of polyadenylated, <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNAs</b> and, using the host cell's ribosomes, tRNA molecules, etc., the mRNA is translated into individual viral proteins.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{heat shock}} protein (Hsp) HtpG {{is a member of}} the Hsp 90 protein family. We cloned a single-copy gene {{encoding}} a homologue of HtpG from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Sequence alignment with HtpGs from other prokaryotes revealed unique features in the cyanobacterial HtpG primary sequence. A <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> of the htpG gene increased transiently in response to heat shock. In order to elucidate the role of HtpG in vivo, we inactivated the htpG gene by targeted mutagenesis. Although the mutation did not affect the photoautotrophic growth at 30 and 42 °C, the mutant cells were unable to grow at 45 °C. They lost both basal and acquired thermotolerances. These results indicate that HtpG plays an essential role for the thermal stress management in cyanobacteria, the first such an example for either a photosynthetic or a prokaryotic organism...|$|E
40|$|Inverse PCR {{was used}} to amplify major cold shock protein (MCSP) gene {{families}} from a diverse range of bacteria, including the psychrotolerant Yersinia enterocolitica, which {{was found to have}} two almost identical MCSP coding regions (cspA 1 and cspA 2) located approximately 300 bp apart. This tandem gene duplication was also found in Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. ruckeri but not in other bacteria. Analysis of the transcriptional regulation of this MCSP gene in Y. enterocolitica, performed by using both reverse transcriptase-PCR and Northern blot assays, showed there to be two cold-inducible mRNA templates arising from this locus: a monocistronic template of approximately 450 bp (cspA 1) and a bicistronic template of approximately 900 bp (cspA 1 /A 2). The former may be due to a secondary structure between cspA 1 and cspA 2 causing either 3 ′ degradation protection of cspA 1 or, more probably, partial termination after cspA 1. Primer extension experiments identified a putative transcriptional start site (+ 1) which is flanked by a cold-box motif and promoter elements (− 10 and − 35) similar to those found in Escherichia coli cold-inducible MCSP genes. At 30 °C, the level of both mRNA molecules was negligible; however, upon a temperature downshift to 10 °C, transcription of the bicistronic mRNA was both substantial (300 -fold increase) and immediate, with transcription of the <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> being approximately 10 -fold less (30 -fold increase) and significantly slower. The ratio of bicistronic to <b>monocistronic</b> <b>mRNA</b> changed with time after cold shock and was higher when cells were shocked to a lower temperature. High-resolution, two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis showed that synthesis of the corresponding proteins, both CspA 1 and CspA 2, was apparent after only 10 min of cold shock from 30 °C to 10 °C. The data demonstrate an extraordinary capacity of the psychrotolerant Y. enterocolitica to produce major cold shock proteins upon cold shock...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} gene for ferredoxin I, petF, from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 has been isolated from a recombinant lambda library. Mixtures of tetradecanucleotides and heptadecanucleotides, each containing all possible DNA sequences corresponding to two separate {{regions of the}} ferredoxin amino acid sequence, were synthesized and used as hybridization probes to identify a genomic clone containing the coding sequence for the petF gene. The sequence of the entire petF coding region and portions of the 3 '- and 5 '-flanking regions was determined. The DNA sequence of petF suggests that, {{in contrast to the}} nucleus-encoded plant protein, cyanobacterial apoferredoxin is not synthesized as a higher-molecular-weight precursor.
