25|$|H2S therapy uses a H2S donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to {{increase}} the supply of H2S to an AMI patient. H2S donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion complications. Increased H2S levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce sulfane sulfur, a storage intermediate for H2S. H2S pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess H2S and eNOS {{to increase}} NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of H2S directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In H2S therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarct</b> size.|$|E

40|$|I n {{view of the}} {{clinical}} importance of myocardial lesions, a technique for visualizing them in the intact patient is clearly desirable. The advent of scintilla-tion scanning suggested a promising ap-proach to this problem. The first encourag-ing result was the finding that dogs with experimental <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcts</b> showed less concentration of rubidium- 86 {{in the area of}} infarction than in normal myo-cardium. 1 This permitted clear visualiza-tion of the infarct if the heart were subse-quently removed from the dog, but the high energy of the gamma emission of rubidium- 86 made it unsuitable for studies of the heart in situ. The next step, demon-stration of experimental myocardial in-farcts through the intact chest wall of the living animal, was first successfully ac-complished by the use of mercury- 203 -labeled chlormerodrin. 2 When applied to human beings, however, this technique proved to be only irregularly successful. 3 The development of a method for obtain-ing suitable quantities of cesium- 131 for use in human beings has now permitted the use of the latter isotope in myocardial scanning. 3 The present communication demonstrates the usefulness of cesium- 131 in experimental <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcts</b> in dogs and in <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcts</b> in human beings...|$|R

Methods: Lipid profile namely phospholipids cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and lipoprotein were assayed in both serum and heart tissue. Results: Significantly reduced the cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids levels in heart of the cardiotoxicity <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcted</b> rats. Lagenaria siceraria (Mol) fruits also increased the cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids significantly in isoproterenol induced cardio toxic rats. In isoproterenol administered rats, LDL and VLDL fractions were increased significantly with a decrease in HDL cholesterol in serum. Oral administration of EELSF (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) significantly reverted the levels of almost all the selected parameters to near normal. Conclusion: The experiment thus concludes that Lagenaria siceraria (Mol) fruits possess cardioprotective effect on experimentally induced cardiotoxic <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcted</b> rats...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The MRL mouse strain shows {{extraordinary}} {{wound healing}} capacities. Some years ago, Leferovich et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2001; 98 : 9830 - 35) have reported {{the absence of}} scar formation after cryogenically-induced right ventricular <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcts</b> in adult MRL mice. An independent group (Oh et al., Cardiovasc Pathol 2004; 13 : 203 - 6) found that MRL mice repair left ventricular ischemic infarcts after coronary artery ligation with regular scar formation. Given the divergent outcomes in infarct healing in MRL mice reported by those two studies, we have investigated whether MRL mice heal <b>myocardial</b> <b>infarcts</b> without scar both in the cryoinjury and in the coronary ligation model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four different protocols of cryogenically induced right and left ventricular injury, as well as permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, were tested in adult MRL and control C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. At 60 days after experimental infarction, MRL mice showed pronounced scarring of the affected right and left ventricular areas, with {{no significant differences in}} infarct size and thickness between MRL and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice using any of the five experimental protocols. Analysis of cell proliferation by 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into the DNA did not show any difference between the two strains of mice after infarction. Histological analysis of infarct areas using picrosirius red staining did not show differences in extent of collagen and distribution between the two mouse strains.

40|$|<b>Myocardial</b> <b>infarcts</b> heal by scar {{formation}} {{because there}} are no stem cells in myocardium, and because adult myocytes cannot divide and repopulate the wound. We sought to redirect the heart to form skeletal muscle instead of scar by transferring the myogenic determination gene, MyoD, into cardiac granulation (wound repair) tissue. A replication-defective adenovirus was constructed containing MyoD under transcriptional control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. The virus converted cultured cardiac fibroblasts to skeletal muscle, indicated by expression of myogenin and skeletal myosin heavy chains (MHCs). To determine if MyoD could induce muscle differentiation in vivo, we injected 2 � 10 9 or 10 10 pfu of either the MyoD or a control �-galactosidase adenovirus into healing rat hearts, injured 1 wk previously by freeze-thaw. After receiving the lower viral dose, cardiac granulation tissue expressed MyoD mRNA and protein, but did not express myogenin or skeletal MHC. When the higher dose of virus was administered, double immunostaining showed that cells in reparative tissue expressed both myogenin and embryonic skeletal MHC. No muscle differentiation occurred after �-galactosidase transfection. Thus, MyoD gene transfer can induce skeletal muscle differentiation in healing heart lesions.
