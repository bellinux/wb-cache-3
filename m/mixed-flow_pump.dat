The results show that the models with cylindrical casing have much worse head and efficiency characteristics than the experimental model, and this is caused by the flow in the pump casing. By moving the guide vanes half inside the pump casing, the efficiency gets improved while the low pressure zone at the corner of outlet pipe and pump casing disappeared. When the length of pump casing increases from the size equal to the diameter of outlet pipe to that larger than it, the efficiency drops obviously and the flow field in the outlet pipe improved without curved flow.

Another important observation is that blade excitation forces cause the impeller to whirl in a direction opposite to shaft rotation. Results of measurements are compared with unsteady CFD calculations using FLUENT®. Computed global characteristics show a good agreement with measurements. Also the magnitude of blade interaction forces shows a good qualitative agreement.

40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} flow patterns of a volute-type discharge passage were investigated in a <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>pumping</b> {{system based on}} CFD by using the RNGturbulence model to close the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. According to the numerical analysis of the {{internal flow}}, the hydraulic characteristics of the volute-type discharge passage and the velocity distribution features in several key cross sections were analyzed and quantitatively calculated in terms of velocity distribution uniformity and bias angle. The computed {{results show that the}} internal flow field is very complicated involving flow separation and vortex in some regions and the velocity distribution is uneven. The uniformity curves of axial velocities in the outlet cross-section of the volute and the outlet cross-section of the passage are protruding ones while the bias angle curves in the same cross-sections are concave ones, both of them reaching their maximum or minimum value respectively at the flow rate corresponding to the best efficiency point of the pumping system. The hydraulic loss of the volute-type discharge passage varies with the discharge and reaches its minimum when the pumping system efficiency approaches its highest. When the pumping system operates under off-design condition on the large flow rate side, the hydraulic loss of the passage tends to increase rapidly causing the pumping system efficiency to drop sharply. Therefore, appropriate regulation methods should be adopted to adjust the pump operating condition to ensure the pumping system working within high efficiency zone...|$|R

The reliability of the simulation was verified by comparison with the experimental data of external characteristics and fluctuation in the guide vane passage. Through ANSYS-CFX, MATLAB code and fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, pressure fluctuation characteristics in this pump were obtained. The results show that pressure fluctuation exists in all conditions due to the rotor-stator interaction. Under the no tip clearance and tip clearance conditions, the maximum fluctuation value was located near the guide inlet and impeller outlet, respectively. Clearance leakage had less influence on pressure fluctuation at the impeller inlet and central regions within a certain range of the clearance; beyond this range, fluctuations in the whole flow passage increased significantly, while the clearance variation had less effect on fluctuation in the guide vane.

40|$|The {{internal}} flow of reactor coolant pump (RCP) {{is much more}} complex than the flow of a general <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>pump</b> due to high temperature, high pressure, and large flow rate. The pressure pulsation that is induced by rotor-stator interaction (RSI) has significant effects on the performance of pump; therefore, it is necessary to figure out the distribution and propagation characteristics of pressure pulsation in the pump. The study uses CFD method to calculate the behavior of the flow. Results show that the amplitudes of pressure pulsation get the maximum between the rotor and stator, and the dissipation rate of pressure pulsation in impellers passage is larger than that in guide vanes passage. The behavior is associated with the frequency of pressure wave in different regions. The flow rate distribution is influenced by the operating conditions. The study finds that, at nominal flow, the flow rate distribution in guide vanes is relatively uniform and the pressure pulsation amplitude is the smallest. Besides, the vortex shedding or backflow from the impeller blade exit has the same frequency as pressure pulsation but there are phase differences, and it has been confirmed that the absolute value of phase differences reflects the vorticity intensity...|$|E
