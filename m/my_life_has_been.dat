500|$|Not My Life is a {{documentary}} film about human trafficking and contemporary slavery. It addresses {{many forms of}} slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, unfree labor in Ghana, forced begging and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, {{and other kinds of}} child abuse. The focus of the film is on trafficking victims, especially women and children, the latter of whom are often betrayed by adults that they trust. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking, including members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Free the Slaves, Girls Educational and Mentoring Services (GEMS), International Justice Mission (IJM), the Somaly Mam Foundation, Terre des hommes, Tostan, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Department of State (US DoS). Not <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> called [...] "a cautionary tale". It depicts the commodification of millions of people and identifies the practices of traffickers as undermining international economics, security, sustainability and health.|$|E
500|$|The apocalyptic wartime {{setting and}} the climactic moment when Jim sees the distant white flash {{of the atomic}} bombing of Nagasaki gave Spielberg {{powerful}} visual metaphors [...] "to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy's innocence {{and the death of}} the innocence of the entire world." [...] Spielberg reflected he [...] "was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence, not an attenuation of childhood, which by my own admission and everybody's impression of me is what <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> This was the opposite of Peter Pan. This was a boy who had grown up too quickly." [...] Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in Empire of the Sun, include a child being separated from his parents (The Sugarland Express, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Poltergeist) and World War II (1941, and Raiders of the Lost Ark). Spielberg explained [...] "My parents got a divorce when I was 14, 15. The whole thing about separation is something that runs very deep in anyone exposed to divorce." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Veitch told Brown {{that she}} {{believed}} that the JC's Girls ministry needed to move to Las Vegas, and he responded supportively. By 2008, Veitch had moved to Las Vegas and based the new chapter of JC's Girls at Central Christian Church in nearby Henderson, Nevada, leaving {{the leadership of the}} Riverside chapter to Albee. That year, Veitch collaborated with Annie Lobert, a former call girl working with Hookers for Jesus, an organization similar to JC's Girls. The organizations were both represented at that year's AVN Adult Entertainment Expo. The PussyCat Preacher, a documentary film about Veitch's experiences starting JC's Girls, was released that February. The following month, pornographic film actor Sophia Lynn left the sex industry after becoming a Christian; she underwent {{more than a year of}} counselling with Veitch through JC's Girls. Veitch had flown to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to spend a weekend educating Celebrate Community Church about the sex industry. The church soon gave Lynn a job in its office, a scholarship to go to college, and a place to live. Lynn said, [...] "I hope I don't have to wake up from this.

500|$|The news of Ferrier's death {{came as a}} {{considerable}} shock to the public. Although some in musical circles knew or suspected the truth, the myth had been preserved that her absence from the concert scene was temporary. The opera critic Rupert Christiansen, writing as the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death approached, maintained that [...] "no singer {{in this country has}} ever been more deeply loved, as much for the person she was as for the voice she uttered". Her death, he continued, [...] "quite literally shattered the euphoria of the Coronation" [...] (which had taken place on 2 June 1953). Ian Jack, editor of Granta, believed that she [...] "may well have been the most celebrated woman in Britain after the Queen." [...] Among the many tributes from her colleagues, that of Bruno Walter has been highlighted by biographers: [...] "The greatest thing in music in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to have known Kathleen Ferrier and Gustav Mahler—in that order." [...] Very few singers, Lord Harewood writes, [...] "have earned so powerful a valedictory from so senior a colleague." [...] At a memorial service at Southwark Cathedral on 14 November 1953 the Bishop of Croydon, in his eulogy, said of Ferrier's voice: [...] "She seemed to bring into this world a radiance from another world." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E

2500|$|In {{more than}} 20 films for Famous Players, Hayakawa was typecast as either the {{dangerous}} villain or the exotic lover {{who in the}} end would turn his female love interest over to the [...] "proper" [...] man of her own race. This typecasting was the reason Hayakawa established his own production company in 1918, near {{the height of his}} American fame. At the time, he stated he wanted to be shown [...] "as he really is and not as fiction paints him." [...] As for his prior roles, he said, [...] "They are false and give people a wrong idea of us [...]" [...] Hayakawa desperately sought to show a more balanced and fair portrait of Asians. In 1949, he lamented, [...] "My one ambition is to play a hero." [...] In his autobiography he observed, [...] "All <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a journey.

2500|$|Goodrem {{states that}} [...] "This time around I {{had time to}} think 'What kind of song do I want to create here?'", [...] "I really felt the sky was the limit with this record, you could do {{anything}} in a song. I didn't feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I could go down, more directions I could choose". Songwriter Guy Chambers had been keeping an eye on Goodrem's career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album's key tracks. [...] "'It's really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who's not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music", You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings." [...] Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. [...] "There's a definite story in the tracklisting," [...] Goodrem says. [...] "I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> such an intense one and I wanted people to know my thoughts".|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, she {{released}} Mi Vida Loca, which debuted at number 1 on the Regional Mexican Albums chart and number 2 on the Top Latin Albums chart in the United States, the album garnered {{an award for}} Regional Mexican Album of the Year at the 2008 Latin Billboard Music Awards. In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine she stated, [...] "That was more of Jenni telling her story through music. <b>My</b> <b>life</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so put out there by the media that I figured I might as well {{put it out there}} myself, in my own words and through my music. I wanted to clear up speculations about my private life." [...] The album also garnered Rivera her first Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year, an award she would dominate {{for the rest of her}} life. The same year {{she released}} La Diva en Vivo, a live album that consisted of songs recorded with a mariachi band, which garnered her, her second Latin Grammy nomination for Best Ranchero Album. That year she was the only female singer nominated in that category. The album was recorded at The Gibson Amphitheater in Universal City, California, Rivera sold out the concert which led her to become the first female banda singer to do so. Her tenth studio album, Jenni released in 2008, became her first No. 1 record on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. The album led Rivera to win her second Lo Nuestro Award for Banda Artist of the Year, becoming the first female act to win the accolade. A feat that currently stands to date. In 2009, she changed course and recorded her first full mariachi studio album titled La Gran Señora, which garnered a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Ranchero Album, it peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in the United States. In an interview Rivera said that releasing the album was very daring and marked her career in a positive way, she said she wanted to grow as an artist and the people that listen to banda will listen to mariachi if they find a good album that they feel is worth buying. She went on to say there are certain nationalities that will listen to mariachi and not banda. Those were the people that she was going after. She also stated, [...] "Commercializing a ranchera album is much harder. There had not been a successful female mariachi artist in a long time. It was a big risk, but it was a risk that I was willing to take. La Gran Señora ended up being the biggest-selling [...] album of 2010." ...|$|E
