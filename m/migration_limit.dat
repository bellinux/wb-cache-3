40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2, 4 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl and 4 -(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl triesters. The substance was evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2011 and 2, 4 -di-tert-amylphenol, an impurity and hydrolysis product was re-evaluated by the CEF Panel in 2015. In this application, the applicant requested an increase of the specific <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of the substance, currently established at 5 mg/kg food, to 10 mg/kg food, and provided new toxicological studies. Findings from three new in vitro mutagenicity assays on the oxidation products support the conclusion from 2011 that the substance and its oxidation products are not genotoxic. A new toxicokinetic study on the substance supports the consideration from the evaluation in 2011 that the substance does not raise concern for accumulation. The outcome of a new delayed neurotoxicity study on a structurally related substance, phosphorous acid, tris (2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) ester, which was considered not to cause neurotoxicity in hens, strengthens {{the conclusion of the}} Panel in 2011 that the substance does not represent a concern for neurotoxicity. From a new two-generation reproduction toxicity study and a prenatal developmental toxicity study on the substance, a new subchronic toxicity study on its oxidation products that completes the one submitted in 2011 on the substance itself, and a 2 -year oral toxicity study on the structurally related substance, the lowest NOAEL was 58 - 147 mg/kg bw per day (from the 2 -year oral toxicity study). Compared to the requested increase of the <b>migration</b> <b>limit,</b> this gives an acceptable margin of safety of 348. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that an increase of the specific <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of the substance from 5 to 10 mg/kg food is not a safety concern for the consumer...|$|E

Nevertheless, there are restrictions established by the Brazilian Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA) for plastic packages intended to be in contact with foodstuffs which must be submitted to analyses at a proper laboratory in order to check the compliance with the requirements established. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a method for determining the migration of n-octadecyl 3 -(3, 5 -ditert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionate, antioxidant known commercially as Irganox 1076, CAS 2082 - 79 - 3, from plastic packages intended to be in contact with foodstuffs employing high performance liquid chromatography.

40|$|International audiencePlastics bottles {{made from}} {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) are increasingly used for softdrinks, mineral water, juices and beer. In this study a literature review is presented concerning antimony levels found both in PET materials {{as well as}} in foods and food simulants. On the other hand, 67 PET samples from the European bottle market were investigated for their residual antimony concentrations. A mean value of 224 ± 32 ppm was found, the median was 220 ppm. Diffusion coefficients for antimony in PET bottle materials were experimentally determined at different temperature between 105 °C and 150 °C. From these data the activation energy of diffusion for antimony species from the PET bottle wall into beverages and food simulants was calculated. The obtained value 189 kJ mol- 1 was found to be in good agreement with published data on PET microwave trays (184 kJ mol- 1). Based on these results the migration of antimony into beverages was predicted by mathematical migration modelling for different surface/volume ratios and antimony bottle wall concentrations. The results were compared to literature data {{as well as in}}ternational legal limits and guidelines values for drinking water as well as <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> set from food packaging legislation. It was concluded that antimony levels in beverages due to migration from PET bottles manufactured according to state-of-the-art can never reach nor exceed the European specific <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 40 ppb. Maximum migration levels caused by room temperature storage even after 3 years will never be essentially higher than 2. 5 ppb and will be in any case below the European limit of 5 ppb for drinking water. The results of our study confirm that the exposure of the consumer by antimony migration from PET bottles into beverages and even into edible oils reaches approximately 1 % of the current TDI established by WHO.

The final material is intended to be used for single and repeated contact with all types of foodstuffs, for short term contact at temperatures up to 100 ºC and/or for long term storage at ambient temperatures or below. Specific migration in aqueous simulants and olive oil under adequate conditions were below the current specific <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 5 mg/kg food. Due to the aggressiveness of 50 % ethanol, the Panel considered that this type of polymer is not suitable for contact with high alcohol content foods. Given that all of the co-monomers have already been evaluated and considered not to raise a concern of genotoxicity, the Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity of the oligomers. Therefore, the low individual migration for low molecular weight oligomers containing both 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol and 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane, estimated to be up to 0. 06 mg/kg into 10 % ethanol, does not raise a safety concern.

The existing <b>migration</b> <b>limit</b> of 5 mg/kg food should not be exceeded.

Consumer products made of melamine resins such as plates, cups, bowls or cutlery can re-lease melamine and formaldehyde if they are exposed to high temperatures above 70 ° C. <b>Migration</b> <b>limits</b> have been set for the migration of melamine and formaldehyde into foods. Testing by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) as well as test results of the com-petent Länder (regional) authorities for the official control of foodstuffs reveals that the regu-latory <b>migration</b> <b>limits</b> for the <b>migration</b> of melamine and formaldehyde to food are exceeded at higher temperatures. This occurs especially at 100 °C, the boiling point of water.

The European Union edits a regulation 10 / 2011 which must be followed by suppliers specifying the maximum values of Overall <b>Migration</b> <b>Limit</b> (OML) and Specify <b>Migration</b> <b>Limit</b> (SML) of each species established for food in static conditions. However, for food transported through tubes, the migration of additives requires to study the mass transfer in dynamic conditions. According the European directives, mathematical modeling is allowed to demonstrate the compliance with the EU regulation 10 / 2011. A numerical model, detailed in this contribution, coupling the diffusion process in plastic with the transport in food has been developed. It is decomposed in two sub-problems: i) the first describes the unsteady diffusion of a plasticizer in the tube, ii) the second is devoted to the advection and diffusion in the liquid, called Graetz problem. For the second problem, the mass transfer coefficient from the wall to the liquid can be easily determined {{as a function of the}} Graetz number which is a dimensionless group equivalent to a Péclet number. The first problem is numerically solved by a pseudo-spectral Chebyshev method. The coupling between the two sub-problems are achieved by the boundary conditions. The temporal evolution of the plasticizer migration are computed as a function of the ratio of the additive diffusion coefficient in the plastic matrix to the diffusion coefficient in the liquid, the partition coefficient (ratio of the additive mass concentration in the liquid to the mass concentration in the plastic matrix at the plastic/liquid interface) and the Graetz number. The effect of the flow regime, laminar or turbulent, is evaluated. Conversely to the static conditions, the concentration of plasticizer at the exit of the tube decreases with time due to the renewing of the liquid showing that the compliance with the EU regulation 10 / 2011 can be fulfilled if the residence time of the liquid in the tube is controlled...|$|E
