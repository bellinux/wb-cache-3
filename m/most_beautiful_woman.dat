5|$|In the Uttara Kanda {{book of the}} Ramayana (regarded by most {{scholars}} as a later addition to the epic), Brahma crafts Ahalya as the <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> and places her {{in the care of}} Gautama until she reaches puberty. When that time arrives, the sage returns Ahalya to Brahma, who, impressed by Gautama's sexual restraint and asceticism, bestows her upon him. Indra, who believes that the best women are meant for him, resents Ahalya's marriage to the forest-dwelling ascetic.|$|E
5|$|Jolie's {{public image}} is {{strongly}} tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal. Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman,</b> while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles have often been based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.|$|E
5|$|Another {{key figure}} in Skagen, P.S. Krøyer, married Marie Triepcke after {{falling in love with}} her in Paris in 1888. The {{daughter}} of a prosperous German loomery engineer, she was said to be the <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman</b> in Copenhagen. However, as the years went by, Krøyer's health began to deteriorate and Marie was increasingly unhappy with their marriage. The marriage finally ended in a divorce in 1905 when Marie became pregnant after an affair with the composer Hugo Alfvén whom she then married. Krøyer died in Skagen four years later, apparently as a result of mental illness.|$|E

5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman.</b> He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|Created by the god Brahma as the <b>most</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>woman,</b> Ahalya {{was married}} to the much older Gautama. In the {{earliest}} full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra's trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} how she is purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot.|$|E
