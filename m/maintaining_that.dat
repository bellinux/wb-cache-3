5|$|By mid-1826, the Canal Company had {{insufficient}} funds {{to complete the}} work, and a special meeting authorised the taking out of a mortgage to cover the £15,000 deficit. The canal was an obvious competitor to the River Tone Navigation, which was managed by the Conservators of the River Tone, a legal body created for that purpose by Act of Parliament in 1699. There was animosity between the Company and the Conservators, with the Company <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> they {{had a right to}} use the Tone to reach the centre of Taunton, and the Conservators <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> they did not. The canal was scheduled to be opened on 1 January 1827, but the opening was delayed until 3 January, as the connection to the River Tone was not made until 2 January. The opening celebrations were hampered by snow and bitter cold weather.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression {{back to the surface}} pressure. Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded almost entirely by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.|$|E
5|$|Apologists also cite {{parallels}} between the scenes depicted on the facsimiles and several ancient documents and other Jewish writings, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no evidence}} that Smith studied or even had access to these sources. Examples include: the attempted sacrifice of Abraham and his subsequent rescue (a similar story was preserved in a Coptic encomium only translated into English in the 20th century), Abraham teaching the Egyptians astronomy (this is recounted in the aforementioned Coptic encomium, and is mentioned by Eusebius, quoting Pseudo-Eupolemus, in his work Praeparatio evangelica), and God teaching astronomy to Abraham.|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{material}} composition {{is one of}} the most hotly debated topics in contemporary ontology. Some ontologists <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> there are no composite material objects at all. Some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> organisms are the only composite material objects. Others <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> for any material objects, there is something composed of them. A closely related debate concern...|$|R
5000|$|Friends of Lee <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the actor's {{death was}} not a mistake {{and that he was}} a victim of LAPD ineptitude. Other friends <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Lee would not have pointed a weapon, real or fake.|$|R
50|$|One {{thing that}} clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is <b>that</b> Kantianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> man, as a {{rational}} being, makes the moral law universal. Whereas, divine command <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> God makes the moral law universal.|$|R
5|$|As {{champions of}} the Football League, Burnley {{qualified}} for the Charity Shield, then known as the Dewar Shield. Burnley's opponents were Tottenham Hotspur, who had finished sixth in the First Division and beaten Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. In what was the last match of the 1920–21 campaign, Burnley fell to a 0–2 loss at White Hart Lane on 16May 1921. The match was not without controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> the whistle had already been blown by the referee.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|For a {{short time}} during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds {{temporarily}} changed his demeanor {{at the behest of}} a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, {{in the midst of a}} slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.|$|E
50|$|The term {{electronic}} {{civil disobedience}} and hacktivism {{may be used}} synonymously, although some commentators <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> {{the difference is that}} ECD actors don’t hide their names, while most hacktivists wish to remain anonymous. Some commentators <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> ECD uses only legal means, as opposed to illegal actions used by hacktivists. It is also <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> hacktivism is done by individuals rather than by specific groups. In reality the distinction between ECD and hacktivism is not clear.|$|R
5000|$|While some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Christ merely {{descended into}} the [...] "limbo of the fathers", others, notably theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (inspired by the visions of Adrienne von Speyr), <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> {{it was more}} than this and that the descent {{involved}} suffering by Jesus. [...] Some <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> this is a matter on which differences and theological speculation are permissible without transgressing the limits of orthodoxy. However, Balthasar's point here has been forcefully condemned by conservative Catholic outlets.|$|R
25|$|Viktor Zemskov–Zemskov <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the {{population}} loss {{due to the}} war was 20 million, including 16 million direct losses and 4 million deaths due to the deterioration in living conditions. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the Russian Academy of Science figure of 26.6 million total war dead includes about 7 million deaths due to natural causes based on the mortality rate that prevailed before the war. Zemskov <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> military dead numbered 11.5 million, including nearly 4 million POWs. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the figure of 6.8 million civilian deaths in occupied regions was overstated because it included persons who were evacuated to the rear areas. He submitted an estimate of 4.5 million civilians who were Nazi victims or {{were killed in the}} occupied zone. Zemskov <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the government figure of 2.1 million civilian deaths due to forced labor in Germany was inflated compared to German wartime records that put the deaths of forced workers at 200,000.|$|R
5|$|In February 2013, Yahoo! Sports {{reported}} that Braun's name appeared {{three times in}} records of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed performance-enhancing drugs {{to a number of}} Major League Baseball players who tested positive for banned substances. One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike some of the other players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic.|$|E
5|$|On December19, a {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia, which initially tracked to the south-southeast {{before turning to}} the southwest. Later that day, the system intensified to moderate tropical storm status, prompting the Mauritius Meteorological Service to name it Bakoly. The storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone, reaching peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) on December23. After <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> intensity for about 12hours, Bakoly weakened below cyclone status as it turned to the south-southeast. On December25, the storm passed between Réunion and Mauritius, and later resumed its south-southwest trajectory. After executing a small loop, Bakoly turned to the southeast and dissipated on December30.|$|E
5|$|Other black {{newspapers}} {{also carried}} significant {{coverage of the}} lynching, as did liberal papers such as The New Republic and The Nation. Freeman traveled around the U.S. to speak to audiences about her investigation, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> a shift in public opinion could accomplish more than legislative actions. Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre. Leaders of the NAACP hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington's death, but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} wide range of {{philosophical}} views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of ethical altruism <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is ethical egoism, which <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} in what determines {{whether or not}} an action is the right action. Act utilitarianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> an action is right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.|$|R
50|$|European {{scholars}} have <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Gorani is separate from Kurdish and that Kurdish {{is synonymous with}} the Northern Kurdish group, whereas ethnic Kurds <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Kurdish encompasses any of the unique languages or dialects spoken by Kurds that are not spoken by neighboring ethnic groups.|$|R
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents would again seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.|$|E
5|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{refused a}} compromise proposal from Michelin {{to allow a}} chicane to be installed, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable {{to come to a}} compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate. It was later stated that the Michelin-shod teams could have potentially exposed themselves to criminal liability under Indiana state law had they competed.|$|E

50|$|The {{plaintiffs in}} the {{subsequent}} litigation <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the pollution has resulted {{in an increase in}} cancer rates. Apart from maintaining its lack of responsibility for the bulk of the pollution, Chevron has <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> there is no causal link between the produced water and cancer.|$|R
5000|$|The scholar K. Paul Johnson <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "Masters" [...] that Madame Blavatsky {{wrote about}} and {{produced}} letters from were actually idealizations {{of people who}} were her mentors. In an article in the New York Times, Paul Zweig <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.|$|R
5|$|The protein-only {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised by those <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> the simplest {{explanation of the}} evidence to date is viral. For more than a decade, Yale University neuropathologist Laura Manuelidis has been proposing that prion diseases are caused instead by an unidentified slow virus. In January 2007, {{she and her colleagues}} published an article reporting to have found a virus in 10%, or less, of their scrapie-infected cells in culture.|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{left the}} family home in 1933, and he and Louise openly {{discussed}} the separation with the media, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> they were still friends and had not taken divorce action. From September 1933 to June 1934, Tracy had a public affair with Loretta Young, his co-star in Man's Castle. He reconciled with Louise in 1935. There was never again an official separation between Tracy and his wife, but the marriage continued to be troubled. Tracy increasingly lived in hotels and by the 1940s, the two were effectively living separate lives. Tracy frequently engaged in extramarital affairs, including with co-stars Joan Crawford in 1937 and Ingrid Bergman in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
50|$|Many authors <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the pre-tribulation rapture {{doctrine}} {{originated in}} the eighteenth century, with the Puritan preachers Increase and Cotton Mather, and was then popularized in the 1830s by John Darby. Others, including Grant Jeffrey, <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> an earlier document called Ephraem or Pseudo-Ephraem already supported a pre-tribulation rapture.|$|R
50|$|Zhu Xi <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> {{all things}} are brought into being by the union of two {{universal}} aspects of reality: qi, sometimes translated as vital (or physical, material) force; and li, sometimes translated as rational principle (or law). The source and sum of li is the Taiji (Wade-Giles: T‘ai Chi), meaning the Supreme Ultimate. The source of qi (Wade-Giles: ch‘i) is not so clearly stated by Zhu Xi, leading some authorities to <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> he was a metaphysical monist and others to <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> he was a metaphysical dualist.|$|R

5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Federalist state legislatures, {{primarily}} those {{north of}} the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt {{a second set of}} resolutions affirming the first, lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, <b>maintaining</b> <b>that</b> there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives {{at the outset of the}} 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially the endorsement of nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|Russia and the US {{remained}} at discord concerning the future political {{role of the}} Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

50|$|Some {{scholars}} <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Ammon {{had ceased}} to exist as a distinct nation by this time, and that the designation of Ammonite as applied to Timothy is geographic rather than ethnic; the account of Justin Martyr (who <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> Ammonites were numerous in his period) call this hypothesis into question.|$|R
