40|$|Cancer-associated {{fibroblasts}} (CAF) play {{a crucial}} role in regulating cancer progression, yet the <b>molecular</b> <b>determinant</b> that governs the tumor regulatory role of CAF remains unknown. Using a mouse melanoma model in which exogenous melanoma cells were grafted on the skin of two lines of mice where the genetic activation or inactivation of Notch 1 signaling specifically occurs in natural host stromal fibroblasts, we demonstrated that Notch 1 pathway activity could determine the tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressing phenotype in CAF. CAF carrying elevated Notch 1 activity significantly inhibited melanoma growth and invasion, while those with a null Notch 1 promoted melanoma invasion. These findings identify the Notch 1 pathway as a <b>molecular</b> <b>determinant</b> that controls the regulatory role of CAF in melanoma skin growth and invasion, unveiling Notch 1 signaling as a potential therapeutic target for melanoma and potentially other solid tumors...|$|E

40|$|Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) play an {{essential}} role in the regulation of natural killer cell functions. KIR genes are highly polymorphic in nature, showing both haplotypic and allelic variations among people. We demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models a significant heterogeneity in function among different KIR 2 DL 1 alleles, including their ability to inhibit YT-Indy cells from degranulation, interferon γ production, and cytotoxicity against target cells expressing the HLA-Cw 6 ligand. Subsequent experiments showed that the <b>molecular</b> <b>determinant</b> was an arginine residue at position 245 (R 245) in its transmembrane domain that mechanistically affects both the efficiency of inhibitory signaling and durability of surface expression. Specifically, in comparison with R 245 -negative alleles, KIR 2 DL 1 that included R 245 recruited more Src-homology- 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 and β-arrestin 2, showed higher inhibition of lipid raft polarization at immune synapse, and had less down-regulation of cell-surface expression upon interaction with its ligand. Thus, our findings provide novel insights into the <b>molecular</b> <b>determinant</b> of KIR 2 DL 1 and conceivably a fundamental understanding of KIR 2 DL 1 allelic polymorphism in human disease susceptibility, transplant outcome, and donor selection...|$|E

40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV 1) is an ionotropic receptor {{activated by}} temperature and chemical stimuli. The C-terminal region that is {{adjacent to the}} channel gate, recognized as the TRP domain, is a <b>molecular</b> <b>determinant</b> of receptor assembly. However, the role of this intracellular domain in channel function remains elusive. Here, we show that replacement of the TRP domain of TRPV 1 with the cognate region of TRPV channels (TRPV 2 -TRPV 6) did not affect receptor assembly and trafficking to the cell surface, although those receptors containing the TRP domain of the distantly related TRPV 5 and TRPV 6 did not display ion channel activity. Notably, functional chimeras exhibited an impaired sensitivity to the activating stimuli, consistent with a significant contribution of this protein domain to channel function. At variance with TRPV 1, voltage-dependent gating of chimeric channels could not be detected {{in the absence of}} capsaicin and/or heat. Biophysical analysis of functional chimeras revealed that the TRP domain appears to act as a <b>molecular</b> <b>determinant</b> of the activation energy of channel gating. Together, these findings uncover a role of the TRP domain in intersubunit interactions near the channel gate that contribute to the coupling of stimulus sensing to channel opening...|$|E
40|$|Despite advancements in {{lowering}} blood pressure, {{the best}} approach to lower it remains controversial {{because of the lack}} of information on the molecular basis of hypertension. We, therefore, performed plasma proteomics of plasma from patients with hypertension to identify <b>molecular</b> <b>determinants</b> detectable in these subjects but not in controls and vice versa. Plasma samples from hypertensive subjects (cases; n= 118) and controls (n= 85) from the InGenious HyperCare cohort were used for this study and performed mass spectrometric analysis. Using biostatistical methods, plasma peptides specific for hypertension were identified, and a model was developed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression. The underlying peptides were identified and sequenced off-line using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization orbitrap mass spectrometry. By comparison of the molecular composition of the plasma samples, 27 <b>molecular</b> <b>determinants</b> were identified differently expressed in cases from controls. Seventy percent of the <b>molecular</b> <b>determinants</b> selected were found to occur less likely in hypertensive patients. In cross-validation, the overall R(2) was 0. 434, and the area under the curve was 0. 891 with 95 % confidence interval 0. 8482 to 0. 9349, P< 0. 0001.
