Cellular and luminal concentrations of Cl- and K+ in control and drug-treated thyroid glands were derived from the data obtained. Both Cl- and K+ equilibrium potentials across the follicular cell membranes calculated from their concentration gradients are not identical to their corresponding membrane potentials measured directly.

50|$|Current source density {{analysis}} (which {{could more}} accurately be called current source and sink density analysis) is {{the practice of}} placing a microelectrode in proximity to a nerve or a nerve cell to detect current sourcing from, or sinking into, their plasma membranes. When positive charges, for example, flow quickly across a plasma membrane {{to the inside of}} a cell (sink) this creates a transient cloud of negativity {{in the vicinity of the}} sink. This is because the flow of positive charges into the interior of the cell leaves behind uncompensated negative charges. A nearby <b>micro-electrode</b> with substantial tip resistance (on the order of 1 MΩ) can detect that negativity because a voltage difference will develop across the tip of the electrode (between the negativity outside the electrode, and the electroneutral environment inside the electrode). Put another way, the electrode internal solution will donate some of the positive charge needed to compensate the negativity caused by the current sink. Thus, the inside of the electrode will become negative relative to ground for as long as the extracellular negativity persists. The extracellular negativity will persist as long as the current sink is present. Thus, by measuring a negativity relative to ground, the electrode indirectly reports the presence of a nearby current sink. The size of the recorded negativity will vary directly with the size of the current sink and inversely with the distance between the electrode and the sink.|$|E

Measurements of the absorbance signal (Arsenazo III) and Ca 2 + <b>micro-electrode</b> potential during and following voltage-dependent Ca 2 + influx (induced by voltage-clamp pulses) were simultaneously recorded.

Bathing the cell in 0 Ca 2 + artificial sea water (ASW) or intracellularly injecting EGTA decreased the resting [Ca]i. Voltage-clamp pulses, which maximally activated Ca 2 + channels (from - 50 to + 30 mV), transiently increased both the Arsenazo III absorbance and the Ca 2 + <b>micro-electrode</b> signals, indicating a rise in [Ca]i.

The versatility of the same equivalent model, identified by means of impedance spectroscopy, is here highlighted. The presence of single cells in ionic solutions can be detected either in static (for monitoring the growth of a colony of adherent cells) or dynamic conditions (in micro-fluidic impedance flow cytometry), thanks to the contrast in conductivity between the insulating cell volume and the physiological solution, probed bypassing the electrochemical double-layer interfacial capacitance.
