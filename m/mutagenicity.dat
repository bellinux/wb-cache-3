5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is {{particularly}} controversial. Such tests, {{which are still}} conducted in the U.S., involve general toxicity, eye and skin irritancy, phototoxicity (toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light) and <b>mutagenicity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, <b>mutagenicity,</b> carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicology}} of {{a particular}} aziridine compound depends on its structure and activity, although sharing the general characteristics of aziridines. As electrophiles, aziridines are subject to attack and ring-opening by endogenous nucleophiles such as nitrogenous bases in DNA base pairs, resulting in potential <b>mutagenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|One study {{concluded}} that epidemiological evidence is consistent with {{an increased risk of}} birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU. Environmental groups and others have expressed concern about the health effects of depleted uranium, and there is some debate over the matter. Some people have raised concerns about the use of this material, particularly in munitions, because of its <b>mutagenicity,</b> teratogenicity in mice, and neurotoxicity, and its suspected carcinogenic potential. Additional concerns address unexploded DU munitions leeching into groundwater over time.|$|E

2500|$|DAPI can be {{used for}} fixed cell staining. [...] The {{concentration}} of DAPI needed for live cell staining is generally very high; it is rarely used for live cells. It is labeled non-toxic in its MSDS and though it was not shown to have <b>mutagenicity</b> to E. coli, it is labelled as a known mutagen in manufacturer information. As it is a DNA binding compound, it is likely to have some low level mutagenic properties and care should be taken in its handling and disposal.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{who do not}} {{advocate}} {{food irradiation}} argue the safety of irradiated food is not scientifically proven {{because there are a}} lack of long-term studies [...] {{in spite of the fact}} that hundreds of animal feeding studies of irradiated food, including multigenerational studies, have been performed since 1950. Endpoints investigated have included subchronic and chronic changes in metabolism, histopathology, function of most systems, reproductive effects, growth, teratogenicity, and <b>mutagenicity.</b> A large number of studies have been performed; meta-studies have supported the safety of irradiated food.|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] Ethidium bromide {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected <b>mutagenicity</b> without liver homogenate indicates that ethidium bromide is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. Ethidium bromide (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and <b>mutagenicity</b> are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that ethidium bromide is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compound}} CdTe {{has different}} qualities {{than the two}} elements, cadmium and tellurium, taken separately. Toxicity studies show that CdTe is less toxic than elemental cadmium. CdTe has low acute inhalation, oral, and aquatic toxicity, and is negative in the Ames <b>mutagenicity</b> test. Based on notification of these results to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), CdTe is no longer classified as harmful if ingested nor harmful in contact with skin, and the toxicity classification to aquatic life has been reduced. Once properly and securely captured and encapsulated, CdTe used in manufacturing processes may be rendered harmless. [...] Current CdTe modules pass the U.S. EPAâ€™s Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test, designed to assess the potential for long-term leaching of products disposed in landfills.|$|E
2500|$|Arsenic is {{reported}} to cause DNA modifications such as aneuploidy, micronuclei formation, chromosome abnormality, deletion mutations, sister chromatid exchange and crosslinking of DNA with proteins. It has been demonstrated that arsenic does not directly interact with DNA and it is considered a poor mutagen, but instead, it helps <b>mutagenicity</b> of other carcinogens. For instance, a synergistic increase in the mutagenic activity of arsenic with UV light has been observed in human and other mammalian cells after exposing the UV-treated cells to arsenic. A series of experimental observations suggest that the arsenic genotoxicity is primarily linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its biotransformation. The ROS production is able to generate DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations. The oxidative damage is caused by modification of DNA nucleobases, in particular 8-oxoguanine (8-OHdG) which leads to G:C to T:A [...] mutations. Inorganic arsenic can also cause DNA strand break even at low concentrations.|$|E

50|$|Toxicological {{screening}} {{is important}} to ensure safety of the drug molecules. In this regard, the p m-dichloro phenyl analog of venlafaxine was dropped from further development after its potential <b>mutagenicity</b> was called into question. The <b>mutagenicity</b> of this compound is still doubtful though. It was dropped for other reasons likely related to speed at which it could be released onto the market relative to the more developed compound venlafaxine. More recently, the carcinogenicity of PRC200-SS was likewise reported.|$|E
