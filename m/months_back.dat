5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full <b>months.</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).|$|E

25|$|At first {{loyal to}} his King, Carter {{expressed}} support for the Crown {{during the period of}} popular rejoicing that accompanied news of George III's repeal of the Stamp Act. However, Parliament passed additional laws obnoxious to colonial interests, and by 1772 the new Governor Dunmore exacerbated tensions. That year, Carter moved his ailing family (having lost three young daughters to unknown illnesses within 11 <b>months)</b> <b>back</b> to Nomony Hall, announcing his retirement from public life. Carter never appeared in the Governor's Council minutes (other than as present) after it voted to allow slaveholders or local authorities to punish slaves without due process. Moreover, rather than educate his sons at the College of William and Mary, Carter hired Philip Fithian as tutor.|$|E

25|$|It seems Gustav stayed largely {{inactive}} {{during his}} first <b>months</b> <b>back</b> on Swedish soil. According to some sources, Gustav received {{an invitation to the}} coronation of Christian. This was to take place in the newly captured Stockholm in November. Even though King Christian had promised amnesty to his enemies within the Sture party, including Gustav Eriksson, the latter chose to decline the invitation. The coronation took place on 4 November and days of festivities in a friendly spirit followed. When the celebration had lasted a few days, the castle was locked and the former enemies of King Christian were imprisoned. Accusations against the old supporters of Sten Sture regarding heresy were brought forward. The following day the sentences were announced. During the Stockholm Bloodbath, close to 100 people were executed on Stortorget, among them Gustav Eriksson's father, Erik Johansson, and nephew, Joakim Brahe. Gustav himself was at the time staying at Räfsnäs, close to Gripsholm Castle.|$|E
25|$|Merman {{returned}} to Broadway for another Porter musical, {{but despite the}} presence of Jimmy Durante and Bob Hope in the cast, Red, Hot and Blue closed after less than six <b>months.</b> <b>Back</b> in Hollywood, Merman was featured in Happy Landing, one of the top ten box-office hits of 1938 comedy with Sonja Henie, Cesar Romero and Don Ameche; another the box office hit Alexander's Ragtime Band, a pastiche of Irving Berlin songs interpolated into a plot that vaguely paralleled the composer's life; and Straight, Place or Show, a critical and commercial flop starring the Ritz Brothers. She {{returned to}} the stage in Stars in Your Eyes, which struggled to survive while the public flocked to the 1939 New York World's Fair instead, and finally closed short of four months. Merman followed this with two more Porter musicals. DuBarry Was a Lady, with Bert Lahr and Betty Grable, ran for a year, and Panama Hattie, with Betty Hutton (whose musical numbers were cut out of the show on opening night at Merman's insistence), June Allyson, and Arthur Treacher, fared even better, lasting slightly more than 14 months.|$|E
500|$|Having been {{watched by}} a number of clubs, Ingham joined newly {{promoted}} Premier League club Sunderland on 28 July 1999 for a £30,000 fee following a trial in February. He was loaned out to Third Division club Carlisle United on 1 October 1999, making his Football League debut the following day in a 1–1 home draw against Southend United. He finished the successful spell with seven appearances for Carlisle. He returned to Northern Ireland by rejoining former club Cliftonville on loan for {{the first three months of}} 2000–01 on 11 August 2000 to gain more first-team experience, saying [...] "That's why I jumped at the chance of three <b>months</b> <b>back</b> in my old jersey. There was an option to join Lincoln City instead but they were only offering reserve games." [...] He finished this spell with 22 appearances, before being recalled by Sunderland in early January 2001. He made his Sunderland debut by starting in a 4–2 defeat away to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup on 12 September 2001, which proved to be his only appearance of 2001–02. This appearance resulted in former club Cliftonville receiving a payment from Sunderland, which was agreed when he was transferred to Sunderland. He joined Stoke City of the Second Division on a one-month loan on 18 December 2001, where he failed to make any appearances after joining as cover for Neil Cutler following an injury to Gavin Ward.|$|E

This is the Kwong Lee mine of Kota, the property of Captain Ah Kwi.
