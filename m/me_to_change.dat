2500|$|Google CEO Eric Schmidt {{opposed the}} {{development}} of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that [...] "at the time, Google was a small company," [...] and {{he did not want to}} go through [...] "bruising browser wars." [...] After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that [...] "It was so good that it essentially forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> my mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Without his prior knowledge, the Earl of Radnor, {{an admirer}} of his work, had Southey {{returned}} as MP for the latter's pocket borough seat of Downton in Wiltshire at the 1826 general election as an opponent of Catholic emancipation. But Southey refused {{to sit in the}} House of Commons, causing a by-election in December that year, pleading {{that he did not have}} a large enough estate to support him through political life, did not want to take on the hours full attendance required, wanted to continue living in the Lake District, and preferred to defend the Church of England in writing rather than speech. He declared that [...] "for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> my scheme of life and go into Parliament, would be to commit a moral and intellectual suicide"; his friend John Rickman, a Commons clerk, noted that [...] "prudential reasons would forbid his appearing in London" [...] as a Member.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the New York Times Schwarz said that [...] "He hasn't asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> my political convictions," [...] speaking of President de Klerk. [...] "He knows that I'm implacably opposed to apartheid. Otherwise, there's no logic in asking me to do this job." [...] Nor, Mr. Schwarz added, was he bound for Washington to represent South Africa's five million whites. [...] "I've made it clear that I want to be ambassador for 37 million people." [...] A comment in the Boston Herald, typified the reaction among much of the US press: [...] "When a man who has devoted most of his life to the struggle for a new South Africa tells you that apartheid is dead and that sanctions are holding up its burial, he speaks with a moral authority that is difficult to assail." [...] The fact that Schwarz, a well known and respected anti-apartheid leader was willing to accept the post was widely acknowledged in South Africa as a further demonstration of President F. W de Klerk's determination to introduce a new democratic system.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the post-war}} period progressed, Abe's stance as an {{intellectual}} pacifist led to him joining the Japanese Communist Party, with whom he worked to organize laborers in poor parts of Tokyo. Soon after his reception of the Akutagawa Prize in 1951, Abe began to feel {{the constraints of the}} Communist Party's rules and regulations alongside doubts about what meaningful artistic works could be created under the title of [...] "socialist realism." [...] By 1956, Abe began writing in solidarity with the Polish rebels and their freedom movement, drawing the ire of the Japanese Communist Party. The Party's criticism reaffirmed his stance: [...] "The Communist Party put pressure on <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the content of the article and apologize. But I refused. I said I would never change my opinion on the matter. This was my first break with the Party." [...] The next year, Abe traveled to Eastern Europe for the Twentieth Convention of the Soviet Communist Party. Here, Abe saw little of interest, but the arts gave him some solace. He visited Kafka's house in Prague, read Rilke and Karel Čapek, reflected on his idol Lu Xun, and was moved by a Mayakovsky play in Brno.|$|E
2500|$|On April 16, 2008, rival mayoral {{candidate}} Leonard Padilla distributed a 2007 {{report of}} similar allegations made against Johnson at St. HOPE Sacramento High School. The allegations were investigated by local police, but no charges were filed. On April 29, 2008, {{a group of}} female civic leaders including former Sacramento Mayor Ann Rudin, Sacramento Municipal Utility District board member Genevieve Shiroma, and former State Senator Deborah Ortiz demanded {{the release of the}} police report on the matter. The teacher to whom the student initially brought the complaint subsequently resigned over the incident, claiming, [...] "St. HOPE sought to intimidate the student through an illegal interrogation and even had the audacity to ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> my story." [...] Sacramento Police Chief Rick Braziel responded, saying, [...] "I think the allegations at the school were handled in the way that you would want them handled. Immediately they followed all the normal protocols that they were supposed to follow. I think it was pretty clear there was nothing there... We did ask the young lady whether anyone had influenced her – her answer was no." [...] The Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinness said on May 30, 2008, that Johnson's actions, though ill-advised, were not illegal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was nothing to do with me. I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{widely used}} O*Net task {{database}} from the US has information {{for only one}} point in time, and thus, is not suitable for analysing changes over time.

60|$|It was in {{vain for}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the subject, as I used to try, only {{for the sake of}} novelty or perhaps because--but I need not be so particular. Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right."

60|$|I laughed, {{and replied}} that he must just submit to be crushed, as it was {{impossible}} for Jack and <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> our dispositions to suit his convenience; whereupon he sighed, lighted his pipe, and began to smoke vehemently.|$|E
6000|$|And whither went he? Ask himself, [...] 155 [...] Not <b>me!</b> <b>To</b> <b>change</b> of scene, I think. [...] Once {{sold the}} ware and pursed the pelf, [...] Chaffer was scarce his meat and drink, [...] Nor all his music--money-chink.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's rather soon {{to make up}} one's mind," [...] she said, [...] "but {{you seem}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have <b>changed.</b> Your voice sounds so different.

30|$|Using a {{different}} approach, this study {{looked at the}} technical and scale efficiencies of rice production in the Mekong Delta over the period 1998 to 2010, using the same sample sizes and same study methods.

60|$|As the duel {{continued}} I {{began to}} gain confidence, for, {{to be perfectly}} candid, I had not expected to survive the first rush of that monstrous engine of ungoverned rage and hatred.
