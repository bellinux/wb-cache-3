These operations are dependent on data transfer schedule, availability of resources and overall timing constraints. The migration process is implemented by establishing shared network storage and/or a network communication channel. Along with the execution context the security configuration of the VM need to be transferred. In this paper we have proposed a security context migration framework.

50|$|The C01 {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} Rafale A. Although superficially identical to the technology demonstrator, it was smaller and more stealthy due to the gold-coated canopy, a re-design of the fuselage-fin joint, {{and the addition of}} radar-absorbent materials (RAM). This aircraft also saw extensive application of composite and other materials, which both reduced the radar cross-section (RCS) and weight. Moreover, Dassault opted to reject variable engine inlets and a dedicated air brake, which lessens <b>maintenance</b> <b>loads</b> and saves weight. The B01, the only prototype of the two-seat B variant, made its maiden flight on 30 April 1993. It was 350 kg heavier than the single-seater, but carried 400 L less fuel. The aircraft was used for weapon-systems testing. Later it was tasked with validating weapon separation and, specifically, the carriage of heavy loads. The aircraft's typical loadout consisted of two 2000 L external tanks, two Apache/Scalp cruise missiles, in addition to four air-to-air missiles.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this event-related fMIU {{study was to explore}} the {{sensitivity}} of prefrontal cortex (PFC) to maintenance and manipulation processes in verbal working memory. While previous studies have manipulated these two factors in isolation (Esposito et al., 1999), we used a 2 x 2 factorial design to investigate the differential effect within subjects. Method: Imaging was carried out using a 3 Tesla Bruker Medspec scanner. A modified factorial version of D‚ÄôEsposito et al. ‚Äòs (1999) task was used on 12 healthy volunteers. The two factors were Maintenance (high vs low letter load) and Manipulation (letter strings were either maintained in the order that they were presented or were rearranged into alphabetical order). There were thus four conditions, namely, low <b>load</b> <b>maintenance,</b> low <b>load</b> manipulation, high <b>load</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and high <b>load</b> manipulation. Data were analysed using SPM 99, treating inter-subject variability as a random effect. For each of the 4 conditions, the delay period between task instructions (to manipulate or maintain) and a subsequent test probe was modelled as the event of interest. Parameter estimates for these condition-specific models were compared across conditions. We present two contrasts below: Figure 1 shows the effect of load (high vs low) and Figure 2 shows the effect of task type (manipulation vs maintenance). In view of our restricted area of interest, a threshold of p < 0. 001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) was set. Results: With respect to main effects, both contrasts (manipulation vs <b>maintenance,</b> and high <b>load</b> vs low load) were associated with activation of ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC. However, activation of these areas was clearly more pronounced for task type, ie, when manipulation processes were compared to maintenance processes, ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC activation appeared greater than the load effect. This dissociation was confirmed by the results of the interaction between load and task type. Conclusion: Both ventrolateral and dorsolateral PFC regions are important in maintenance and manipulation processes in verbal working memory. Manipulation processes seem to involve increased activation in these regions, independent of load...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between emotion and working memory <b>maintenance,</b> <b>load,</b> and performance {{has been investigated}} with mixed results. The effect of emotion on specific executive processes such as interference resolution, however, remains relatively unexplored. In this series of studies, we examine how emotion affects interference resolution processes within working memory by modifying the Recencyprobes paradigm (Monsel, 1978) to include emotional and neutral stimuli. Reaction time differences were compared between interference and non-interference trials for neutral and emotional words (Studies 1 & 3) and pictures (Study 2). Our results indicate that trials using emotional stimuli show a relative decrease in interference compared with trials using neutral stimuli, suggesting facilitation of interference resolution in the former. Furthermore, both valence and arousal seem to interact to produce this facilitation effect. These findings suggest that emotion facilitates response selection amid interference in working memory...|$|E

Although pre-copy is a predominantly used approach {{in the state of}} the art, it is difficult to provide quick migra-tion with low network overhead, due to a great amount of transferred data during migration, leading to large performance degradation of virtual machine services. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel memory-compression-based VM migration approach (MECOM) that first uses memory compression to provide fast, stable virtual machine migration, while guaranteeing the virtual machine services to be slightly affected. Based on memory page characteristics, we design an adaptive zero-aware compression algorithm for balancing the performance and the cost of virtual machine migration. Pages are quickly compressed in batches on the source and exactly recovered on the target.
