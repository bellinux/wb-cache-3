40|$|Abstract. In mineral <b>processing</b> {{the high}} <b>material</b> volumes yield {{the fact that}} {{benefits}} of even small improvements in the production quality and product efficiency are remarkable. During {{the operation of the}} mineral <b>material</b> <b>processing,</b> the grinding circuit (GC) is the key unit and its product particle size and circulating load are two controlled indexes directly related to the quality and efficiency of the whole mineral <b>material</b> <b>processing.</b> Therefore, an appropriate control of GC is especially significant to improve the operation performance of the mineral <b>material</b> <b>processing.</b> Due to the GCs are essentially multivariable dynamic systems with high interaction among process variables. It is hard to improve the quality and efficiency in the mineral <b>material</b> <b>processing</b> by controlling the grinding system with the conventional methods. In this paper, a novel multivariable decoupling control scheme is adopted to handle such intricate process. Simulations have shown the proposed method can greatly improve the production quality and product efficiency of the mineral <b>material</b> <b>processing...</b>|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{crystalline}} and amorphous materials can be engineered to increase their yield strength. By altering dislocation density, impurity levels, grain size (in crystalline materials), the yield strength of the material can be fine tuned. This occurs typically by introducing defects such as impurities dislocations in the material. To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied. This thus causes a higher yield stress in the material. While many material properties depend only on {{the composition of the}} bulk material, yield strength is extremely sensitive to the <b>materials</b> <b>processing</b> as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{attitude}} (orientation) of {{the station}} was independently determined {{by a set of}} externally mounted sun, star and horizon sensors. [...] Attitude information was conveyed between updates by rate sensors. Attitude control was maintained by a combination of two mechanisms; in order to hold a set attitude, a system of twelve control moment gyroscopes (CMGs, or [...] "gyrodynes") rotating at 10,000rpm kept the station oriented, six CMGs being located in each of the Kvant-1 and Kvant-2 modules. When the attitude {{of the station}} needed to be changed, the gyrodynes were disengaged, thrusters (including those mounted directly to the modules, and the VDU thruster used for roll control mounted to the Sofora girder) were used to attain the new attitude and the CMGs were reengaged. This was done fairly regularly depending on experimental needs; for instance, Earth or astronomical observations required that the instrument recording images be continuously aimed at the target, and so the station was oriented to make this possible. Conversely, <b>materials</b> <b>processing</b> experiments required the minimisation of movement on board the station, and so Mir would be oriented in a gravity gradient attitude for stability. Prior to the arrival of the modules containing these gyrodynes, the station's attitude was controlled using thrusters located on the core module alone, and, in an emergency, the thrusters on docked Soyuz spacecraft could be used to maintain the station's orientation.|$|E

With the availability of high power pico- and femtosecond laser sources, laser <b>material</b> <b>processing</b> is advancing into applications, which demand for highest accuracies such as laser micro milling or laser drilling. In order to enable narrow tolerance windows, a closedloop monitoring of the geometrical properties of the processed work piece is essential for achieving a robust manufacturing process.
