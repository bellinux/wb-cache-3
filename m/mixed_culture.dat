40|$|Ruminants {{saturate}} up to 80 % {{of dietary}} unsaturated fatty acids through the microbial processes of lipolysis and biohydrogenation, promoting {{the accumulation of}} saturated fatty acids in their meat and milk. Studies were conducted to characterize and define contributors to the ruminal saturation of fatty acids and determine a method to minimize this process. The lipase-producing bacteria Anaerovibrio lipolyticus 5 s, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Propionibacterium avidum and Propionibacterium acnes were characterized in the presence and absence of glucose, and glycerol. Accumulations of free fatty acids (FFA) were compared between ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures</b> and each individual pure culture; these ruminal lipase-producing bacteria behaved differently from ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures.</b> A subsequent study characterized heat-treated ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures</b> that was selective for Clostridium in the presence and absence of glycerol. Ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures</b> behaved similarly to heat-treated cultures {{in the presence of}} glycerol, suggesting that Clostridium species may contribute appreciably to ruminal lipolysis. In an attempt to reduce ruminal lipolytic activity, antibodies were generated against A. lipolyticus 5 s, B. fibrisolvens H 17 C, P. avidum, and P. acnes. Each antibody was tested against each bacterium in pure culture. An antibody generated against a purified Pseudomonas lipase also was tested against each pure culture to determine if an antibody against a purified lipase would be more effective than antibodies raised against whole cells. All five antibodies were effective at reducing lipolytic activity across all pure cultures of bacteria, with the anti-lipase antibody showing the greatest reduction. A subsequent study examined the four, whole cell antibodies against ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures</b> and demonstrated that whole cell antibodies also were effective at reducing lipolytic activity of ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures.</b> Uniquely, B. fibrisolvens participates in both lipolysis and biohydrogenation. Thus, anti-B. fibrisolvens H 17 C antibody also was examined to determine if it would be effective at reducing biohydrogenation against B. fibrisolvens H 17 C in pure <b>culture</b> and ruminal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures.</b> The anti-B. fibrisolvens H 17 C antibody depressed biohydrogenation in pure and <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures.</b> These studies demonstrated that ruminal bacteria responsible for freeing and hydrogenating ruminal unsaturated fatty acids can be immunologically inhibited in vitro...|$|R

Tannin extracts, tannic acid and gallic acid were used to enrich media to assess if rumen or faecal <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures</b> could degrade the phenolic compounds. Rumen fluid of Acacia-adapted sheep, sheep fed on wheat bran, bush duikers (Sylvicapra grimmia) and goats fed on Leucaena pallida and Sesbania goetzei were separately inoculated into Growth Study Medium (GSM) and incubated for 5 - 15 days.

40|$|Some of the {{conditions}} and parameters of the proliferative response in the mixed lymphocyte interaction have been studied {{with the use of}} culture inocula consisting of lymphoid cells from various immunogenetically diverse, isogenic strains of rats. Procedures are described by which consistent culture responses can be obtained which are measurable in terms of incorporation of radioactive thymidine into a trichloroacetic acid precipitable cell fraction. Results of experiments with this "mixed lymphocyte interaction" show that (a) Incorporation of thymidine into the <b>mixed</b> <b>cultures</b> is detectable only during and after the 4 th day of incubation. Use of culture inocula derived from the thoracic duct or partially purified suspensions of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood provides further evidence that it is the small lymphocyte which synthesizes DNA in these cultures.
