40|$|The chief points {{presented}} in this paper are: 1. Following the ingestion of buckwheat (plant or seed) varicolored guinea pigs, white swine and goats exhibited symptoms of photosensitization, the degree of sensitization being in the order given. 2. Rabbits, dogs, white mice and rats did not manifest symptoms of photosensitization. 3. The symptoms and reactions were: agitation, itching, scratching of the ears, weakness, urticaria with sloughing and symptoms similar to those in anaphylaxis. 4. Microscopic examinations showed the lack of marked pathologic change. The lesions, such as petechial hemorrhage of the lungs, brain, liver, stomach and kidneys, suggest that profound toxemia has been present. 5. Lesions were not found which appeared to be suggestive of malignant neoplasms. 6. Irradiation by a quartz mercury vapor lamp apparently develops a resistance to photosensitization, probably because of increased pigmentation induced by ultra-violet light. 7. From the nature of the physiologic and pathologic reactions produced under various filters and from a consideration of the percentages of transmission of solar energy in the visible spectrum, {{it would seem that the}} region of photosensitization lies between 580 <b>millimicrons</b> (yellow) and the red end of the spectrum. This conclusion, moreover, is substantiated by the fact that irradiation by a quartz mercury vapor lamp (which radiates no energy in the visible spectrum at a wave-length greater than 579 <b>millimicrons)</b> produces no symptoms or reactions. 8. Spectrophotometric determinations of alcoholic extracts of grass (non-toxic) and of buckwheat (toxic) show the presence of two additional bands in the absorption spectrum of buckwheat with maxima at about 540 and 600 <b>millimicrons,</b> respectively, together with the common absorption zones at 430 to 490 <b>millimicrons</b> and 630 to 690 <b>millimicrons.</b> 9. Spectrophotometric determinations of blood serums of sensitized animals show, besides the usual absorption bands peculiar to oxyhemoglobin (with maxima at 540 and 580 <b>millimicrons</b> respectively), two zones with maxima at 600 and 660 <b>millimicrons</b> respectively. 10. The fluorescence of chlorophyll per se, as suggested by previous investigators, is not, in all probability, the cause of the sensitization induced by buckwheat. 11. Hematoporphyrine is not the photodynamic substance in all probability. 12. Phylloporphyrine may be the photodynamic substance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1944 Spectrophotometric and chromatographic {{methods were}} {{employed}} to study the principal pigments in Evergreen blackberries and Alicante Bouschet grapes. Observations were made on the following items: 1. Juices expressed from the grape and blackberry 2. Principal pigments isolated from the grape and blackberry. 3. Wines made from the grape and blackberry. A Coleman Universal Spectrophotometer, Model No. 11, equipped with a single grating 35 <b>millimicron</b> fixed band, {{was used for the}} spectrophotometric study. Observations were made at the visible range of 400 millimicrons to 650 millimicrons at 50 <b>millimicron</b> intervals. Various concentrations of the juices, pigments, and wines were examined. The experiments were repeated with the samples made alkaline to pH 9 with sodium hydroxide. Blackberry wine mixed with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 per cent of grape wine were also examined in the sane manner. Results were shown graphically by plotting the E values against wave lengths. It was found that solutions of the higher concentrations always have the higher E values. In the spectrophotometric study, an absorption peak appeared at the 500 <b>millimicron</b> band in the blackberry juice which was not observed in the case of grape juice. The height of the peak was directly proportional to the concentration of the juice and it was unmeasurable when the juice was diluted to 5 per cent or lower. When the juices were made alkaline, all of them had the identical absorption curves except that the blackberry had its curves in higher positions than those of grape. Approximately twice the amount of anthocyanin pigments were isolated from the Evergreen blackberry than Alicante Bouschet grape. The principal pigments isolated from the blackberry were more intense in color than those from the grape. The isolated pigments of Evergreen blackberry and Alicante ouachet grape behaved similarly under the spectrophotometer, indicating that, qualitatively, the same pigments were obtained from blackberry and grape while using the same isolation procedure. Spectrophotometric study of the wines showed that the E values of blackberry wine were inversely proportional to the addition of grape wine. This appeared to be true in both acid and alkaline solutions. By adding 80 per cent of the alkali required to bring the wine to pH 9, more differences in E values between the various mixtures were observed. During the chromatographic atudy, using corn starch as adsorption material, a green band of approximately 1 cm deep was observed in the case of grape wine, which was absent in blackberry wine. The process of wine making changed the quality of pigments as demonstrated in the chromatographic adsorption tubes. The use of acid solution and alumina adsorption mixture as studied by Hamill and Simonds seems more promising than alkaline solution as {{used in the present study}} for the detection of in grape wine blackberry wine...|$|E

40|$|The non-metabolizable {{amino acid}} alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) {{has been used}} to study the effects of insulin and a number of {{membrane}} stabilizers on amino acid transport in rat soleus muscle in an attempt to characterize the mechanisms present. 2. Insulin (5 [...] 100 <b>millimicron.</b> /ml) increases the net uptake of AIB two- to threefold. Since insulin is without significant effects on AIB efflux, stimulation of net uptake appears to result directly from an increased AIB influx. 3. All classes of membrane stabilizer tested affected AIB fluxes but the responses observed varied for different classes of compounds. 4. The total anaesthetic, tetracaine, reduced AIB accumulation both in the absence and presence of insulin by a similar proportion. The effects on AIB efflux were dependent on the concentration of tetracaine used. Efflux was suppressed by concentrations up to 1 mM whereas 4 mM-tetracaine caused a massive stimulation of AIB efflux. Other local anaesthetics and barbiturates produced similar effects. 5. Another group of membrane stabilizers, exemplified by chlorpromazine, also suppressed AIB uptake, but at no concentration did they reduce AIB efflux. In fact, efflux of AIB began to be increased at concentrations of chlorpromazine which were giving only a modest inhibition of uptake. 6. Measurement of the initial rate of uptake showed that it involved two components. Tetracaine appears to inhibit the saturable component whilst leaving the non-saturable component relatively unaffected. 7. The active uptake of AIB was shown to be Na+-dependent, and under Na+-free conditions tetracaine had no effect on the initial rate of uptake. The non-saturable component was also shown to be Na+-sensitive, uptake from high extracellular concentrations of AIB being reduced in Na+-free media. 8. The possibility of the presence of a carrier-mediated AIB efflux mechanism was investigated. AIB efflux was stimulated by extracellular AIB (homo-exchange) or glycine (hetero-exchange), but not mannitol. This suggests the involvement of a carrier-mediated process in AIB efflux. 9. The present study has demonstrated a heterogeneity among different classes of membrane stabilizers in their actions on AIB efflux which is in marked contrast to previous observations of sugar and cation transport in this preparation. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the distribution of zinc in the various leukocyte forms and to make comparisons of its concentration therein with acid and alkaline phosphatases in the same tissues. It was also expected to correlate zinc and enzyme levels in rabbit leukocytes under such stress conditions as induced leukocytosis and after Versene (EDTA) administration. It was desired to determine whether the zinc levels parallel the known effects of stress on the enzymes, whether the altered activities result from changes in the pH maxima, and whether zinc functions as an activator in vivo. Histochemical detection of zinc A histochemical technique for the detection of zinc in blood cells, which had been previously partially developed, was further developed and extended to permit a survey of other tissues. Specificity for zinc was achieved by means of a dithizone complex-forming solution. Zinc in prostate and stomach sections could be clearly differentiated from other metallic constituents. In all prostate sections studied, the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells showed a distinct red-orange color with red-purple granules. In all areas the apical portions of these secretory cells were often most deeply stained. Connective tissue and smooth muscle did not stain. The anterior and posterior lobes of dog, human, and monkey prostates exhibited no essential difference in dithizone-staining properties. In all sections of stomach from dog, man, monkey, and rabbit the parietal cells were clearly demarcated when stained for zinc and exhibited dark red cytoplasm in addition to red granules. Epithelial cells displayed variable shades of color, from light pink to an intense orange-red, while connective tissue was unstained. Dithizone in aqueous acetone solution demonstrated metallic non-specific staining in stomach, prostate, pancreas, and erythrocytes of dog, man, rabbit, and rat. Metallic staining as contrasted with concentration of the dye by fat was shown by loss of stain in tissues previously chelated with ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). staining of phagocytized zinc oxide in macrophages indicated penetration of the cellular membranes by dithizone. Zinc acetate given intravenously to rabbits showed a marked concentration of zinc in the epithelial cells of small and large intestines. This experiment indicated that the intestines, particularly the small intestine, were a possible excretory route for zinc. Many attempts to utilize the staining technique on leukocytes produced such infrequent success it is not as yet possible to employ routinely the procedure to detect the zinc in such cells. Zinc distribution in rabbit blood Zinc was determined quantitatively in polymorphonuclear leukocytes obtained from rabbit intraperitoneal exudates, in lymphocytes obtained by cannulation of the thoracic duct, in leukocytes obtained from peripheral blood by fibrinogen sedimentation, in normal erythrocytes and plasma, and in peripheral leukocytes, erythrocytes, and plasma obtained from rabbits treated with Versene and DNA. Cell suspensions and plasma were analyzed for zinc by extracting with dithizone in carbon tetrachloride and measuring the optical densities at two wave lengths (525 and 625 <b>millimicron).</b> The absorption maxima were verified and the required experimental constants evaluated. The average distribution values for zinc in millimicrograms per million cells and the standard error were mononuclear leukocytes 346. 6 (calculated), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (from peritoneal exudates) 11. 8 ± 1. 5, immature lymphocytes (from thoracic duct) 1. 81 ± 0. 3, erythrocytes 4. 32 ± 0. 47, and plasma 268 (micrograms per 100 ml) ± 39. No statistically significant difference was found betvreen zinc levels of peripheral leukocytes from normal rabbits and those treated with Versene. The zinc content of mixed leukocytes from untreated rabbits was 1. 7 times greater than in DNA-treated rabbits, and this dif ference was significant at the 0. 05 level of probability. The zinc in normal plasma was 2. 3 times greater than in the DNA animals, which corresponded to a P value of 0. 02. Erythrocytes were statistically significantly depleted of zinc by Versene treatment. Correlation analysis of zinc per million cells vs. per cent mononuclear leukocytes gave a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 629 and a P value of 0. 01. Thus, a high correlation exists between per cent non-granular leukocytes and total zinc content. Since the per cent of polys present is equal to 100 minus the per cent of mononuclear cells, r is equal to - 0. 629 for zinc levels vs. per cent polys. Thus, a negative correlation exists for this latter system. The regression equation was found to be: Y(zinc) = -. 0054 + 0. 0035 X(mononucl.) These data indicate that unit zinc content of rabbit peripheral leukocytes is confined to the mononuclear cells. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes have essentially no zinc. The exudate studies showed zinc levels of 11. 8 millimicrograms per million cells; however, this level is probably a reflection of the 5 per cent or less mononuclear cells present in most exudate samples. It was calculated that 5 per cent non-granular leukocytes corresponds to 15. 0 millimicrograrns. Distribution of acid and alkaline phosphatases in rabbit blood Enzyme levels, in mgm phosphorus liberated per hour per 10 ^ 10 cells, were determined on the same samples obtained for zinc analysis. The pH optima for acid and alkaline phosphatases, using sodium beta-glycerophosphate as substrate, in exudate leukocytes and lymphocytes was established at 5. 0 and 9. 9. This is an essential agreement with reported values for other substrates. The average values for the acid and alkaline phosphatases of rabbit blood were polymorphonuclear leukocytes 12. 8 and 155, immature lymphocytes 1. 9 and 1. 6, and per 100 ml plasma 0. 29 and 1. 38. The low values obtained for the lymphocyte samples were unaltered by the addition of glycine, zinc ion, change of substrate, or by varied incubation conditions. The same pH optima, pH 5. 0 and 9. 9, were observed in the lew~ocytes of leukemia patients. The phosphatase activities of these cells remained unchanged when treated as the lymphocyte samples. Fibrinogen sedimented leukocytes from peripheral blood of either Versene or DNA-treated rabbits showed no significant difference with samples from normal animals. However, a trend toward higher values of alkaline phosphatase in DNA-treated animals was apparent. The acid phosphatase activity of peripheral leukocytes showed a positive correlation which approached significance with the mononuclear leukocytes, while no correlation could be established for alkaline phosphatase. A correlation coefficient of 0. 625 was obtained for the concentration of zinc per million white cells and its acid phosphatase level. This corresponded to a P value between 0. 01 and 0. 02. No statistically significant correlation existed between alkaline phosphatase and zinc concentration. The composite data aside from that given in the histochemical section warrants the following conclusions: The zinc in peripheral leukocytes is mainly in the mature mononuclear leukocytes, there being nruch less in the young lymphocyte and granular leukocytes. The metal is firmly bound, as noted in the similarity in zinc levels of both normal cells and those subject to chelating agents. This may be contrasted with the more labile zinc of the erythrocyte, which is removed by chelating agents. The weight of evidence from the literature and from these experiments, both analytical and histochemical, showed the acid phosphatase and zinc to be non-nuclear constituents...|$|E

The absorbance changes at 438 to 455 <b>millimicrons</b> and 603 to 620 <b>millimicrons</b> are suitable for recording the time course of cytochrome a oxidation; the half-time is 2. 0 milliseconds at 24 Celsius. This half-time does not change over the range 0 to 300 μm KCN, but the fraction of cytochrome a oxidized falls to a limiting value of 0. 3 at the higher cyanide concentrations. The absorbance changes at 445 to 455 <b>millimicrons</b> record the time course of both cytochrome a and cytochrome a 3 oxidation; the former contributes 60 % of the absorbance change and the latter 40 %. The half-time for a 3 oxidation is calculated as 0. 9 milliseconds at 24 Celsius. This half-time increases slightly to 1. 3 milliseconds at 300 μm KCN. Reduced cytochrome a 3, whether uncomplexed or complexed with cyanide, becomes fully oxidized. The dissociation constant for the reduced cytochrome a 3 -cyanide complex is estimated to be 30 μm, whereas that for the oxidized a 3 -cyanide complex which inhibits electron transport is estimated to be 2 μm. This suggests two different binding sites for cyanide on the reduced and oxidized forms of cytochrome a 3. The fact that a limiting fraction of reduced cytochrome a can be oxidized at high cyanide concentrations implies that there is no interference by cyanide with electron transport from a to a 3, if cyanide remains bound to the site it occupies on reduced a 3 after this carrier becomes oxidized on reaction with molecular oxygen. Rearrangement of cyanide from this noninhibitory site to the inhibitory site occurs rapidly enough to compete with cytochrome a oxidation.

40|$|SUMMARY - The phase PKIIKP, {{reflected}} once {{from the}} lower surface of theinner core boundary, was most probably recorded by LAS A from the Faultlessunderground nuclear explosion at 10 °. 9 angular distance. The array beam detecteda P onset, with the correct slowness, within 2 sees of the theoretical travel time. The ground amplitude is 3 + 1 <b>millimicrons</b> at a dominant period of 1. 5 sec. By comparison, the PKiKP ground amplitude from Faultless is 75 millimicronsat a dominant period of 1. 1 sec. This detection again confirms the sharpness of the inner core boundaryand the 1968 core travel times for PKiKP. The additional attenuation ofPKIIKP over PKiKP yields, from direct and spectral measurements, Q = 4 5 0 + 1 00 for P waves in the inner core. This value sharpens the earlier estimates of I. Sacks, G. Buchbinder, A. Qamar, and A. Eisenberg and is almost independentof core structure and rigidity. On the assumption of a constant velocity in the inner core, the observeddifferential PKIIKP minus PKiKP travel time requires an average P velocityof 11. 4 + 0. 02 km/sec for an inner core radius of 1216 km...|$|R

Bacteriol. 89 : 159 – 169. 1965. —For some time, streptomycete taxonomists have been seeking to describe more accurately {{the colors of}} aerial mycelium. Some of the descriptive systems involve many different color names and groups. Others combine many colors into a few groups. All the systems and methods leave much to be desired. To obtain an accurate description, a colorimeter with a reflectance attachment {{was used to examine}} streptomycete aerial mycelium of 37 strains, representing all of the major aerial mycelium color groups. Each color was characterized by three values: dominant wavelength in <b>millimicrons,</b> and purity and brightness in percentages. All colors of aerial mycelium were of low purity (< 25 %). Most of the dominant wavelengths were in the yellow to yellow-green bands of the spectrum. Most of the color tabs matched visually with the streptomycete strains had purities of a higher value than those of the cultures. The reflectance instrument seems to allow an objective description, and its use may help to clarify the color problem with streptomycetes. It is concluded that present color descriptions are inadequate and that the significance of color in speciation requires critical examination...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1940 The yellow {{discoloration}} in canned oysters, {{which appeared}} {{after several months}} of storage, has been proven {{to be due to}} carotenoid pigments which were contained in the liver of the oyster. It was found after making carbon disulfide extractions of the liver and of the discolored tissue from canned oysters obtained from four different areas that the yellow pigments in the discolored tissue and in the livers of these oysters were identical. This conclusion was drawn following ten separate chromatographic analyses of these extracts. Analysis with the spectrograph further showed that the pigments responsible for the major portion of the discoloration was carotene. The absorption bands of this pigment in a carbon disulfide solution were found to lie at 521 and 485 <b>millimicrons.</b> These lines corresponded to those for beta carotene. It was also observed that these carotenoid pigments from the liver diffused slowly through the surrounding tissue and that the time required for the color to reach the surface of the oyster depended upon the thickness of the tissue. In a preliminary test it was also found that higher temperatures in storage tended to hasten the discoloration while samples held at zero degree Fahrenheit inhibited the diffusion of the color to the surface...|$|R

The expt. was conducted at CIAT with the following treatments: (1) naturally inoculated plots, (2) artificially inoculated plots, and (3) plots periodically protected with fungicide. Day/night av. temp. and RH during the exptl. period were 28 / 26 degrees C and 75 / 99 percent, resp., optimum conditions for rust development in beans. Var. with type 3 pustules (BAT 93, BAT 308, and EMP 81) showed the lowest areas under the curve in disease progress. Var. with type 5 pustules (Jamapa, ExRico 23, and BAT 883) showed the largest areas and var. with type 3, 4, or 5 pustules (BAT 41, BAT 527, and BAT 153) showed areas with intermediate value. In the fungicide-protected treatments, disease was not controlled in ExRico and BAT 883 (highly susceptible var.). With natural infection, small-pustuled var. yielded an av. of 334 kg/ha more than large-pustuled var. (1. 5 times more). Disease control with fungicide allowed an increase of 770 kg/ha in the av. yield of large-pustuled var., equivalent to 3. 4 {{times more than the}} increase in the av. yield potential of the small-pustuled var.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{effect of}} soil {{temperature}} and {{soil water suction}} on the rate of phosphorus uptake and growth rate of wheat (Triticum aestivum VILL., Host) was studied. Plants were grown in perlite slabs separated from an osmotic solution by a semi-permeable membrane. Measurements were made at temperatures of 10. 0, 18. 3, 23. 9, 32. 2, and 35. 0 °C, and soil water suctions of 0. 35 and 2. 5 bars. Five week old wheat seedlings were exposed to these conditions. The dry weight of shoots and roots was determined at two day intervals. Plant material extracted was analyzed for phosphorus concentration. The color intensity was measured on a Bausch and Lomb spectronic 20 spectrophotometer of 420 <b>millimicrons.</b> In general, a constant growth rate, which was approached exponentially during the experimental period was found in all treatment combinations. Growth rate for both shoots and roots was slow at low root temperatures and had a maximum rate at a root temperature of 24. 0 °C. High soil water suction was a limiting factor in growth rate. Phosphorus concentration of shoots and roots was found to approach a constant value during the experimental period according to the equation y = a+be[superscript]- 0. 07 t[superscript] 3 / 2 where y is the phosphorus concentration, t is the time in days, and a and b are constants. Over {{the entire range of}} soil temperatures considered the phosphorus concentration of the shoots increased linearlly with the root temperature, but the phosphorus concentration of the roots slightly decreased by increasing soil temperature and did not increase until the root temperature was about 32. 0 °C. There was no evidence of much variation in percent of total phosphorus uptake transported to the shoot in the experiments. Trans location of phosphorus from roots to shoots {{did not appear to be}} a limiting factor for phosphorus uptake at the low root temperature. It was suggested that the low rates of phosphorus uptake at the low root temperatures resulted from the low level of metabolic activity...|$|R
40|$|Macrophages {{isolated}} from the rabbit peritoneal cavity extract radioactive colloidal gold from solutions in vitro. This reaction (ultraphagocytosis) involves two phases: the reversible adsorption of gold on the cell surface and the subsequent irreversible removal of surface-bound colloid into the cell. The latter process (called ingestion) appears to proceed at a rate which is proportional at any moment {{to the amount of}} gold attached to the cell surface; the latter in turn can be related to the concentration in extracellular fluid by a simple adsorption isotherm. In terms of rate, therefore, ingestion is related to the extracellular gold concentration {{in the same way that}} many enzyme reactions are related to the substrate concentration. Although enzyme kinetics are useful in describing rates of ultraphagocytosis, there is no evidence that enzymes participate in either adsorption or ingestion or that metabolic energy is required of the macrophage. Exudative leucocytes of the heterophilic series show little or no interaction with these finely dispersed gold sols (mean particle diameter 6 to 9 <b>millimicrons).</b> 37 °C. three parameters are sufficient to characterize the reaction between gold and a suspension of macrophages, namely an affinity constant (1 /Ks), an adsorption maximum (L), and a rate constant of ingestion (k 3). Although numerical values differed markedly among cells of different exudates, all three parameters were estimated in three instances. In these suspensions between 2 and 20 per cent of the surface-bound gold was ingested each minute (37 °C., pH 7. 4). Under conditions of surface saturation, it was estimated that tens of thousands of gold particles were attached to the surface of an average macrophage; this amount of colloid, however, occupied less than 1 per cent of the geometric area of the cell surface. Although surface saturation imposed an upper limit on the rate of ingestion, no practical limit was noted in the capacity of macrophages to continue the reaction. Optical measurements imply that within the cell agglutination of colloidal gold began promptly after its ingestion. These data are compared with published kinetic studies on the phagocytosis of microscopic particulates and on the parasitism of bacteria by virus...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University, 1950 Since {{representative}} alipahtic N-Nitrocarbamates {{have been}} found by Dr. J. Philip Mason and Mr. Robert T. Pollock to be suitable additives for Diesel fuels, it was thought desirable to synthesize {{several members of the}} series not recorded in the literature. 	Accordingly plans were made for the synthesis of a series of nitrocarbamates having various aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and heterocyclic groupings within the molecule. 	The carbamates were usually prepared by treating a mixture of an amine and aqueous sodium hydroxide with ethyl chloroformate but in some cases where this procedure failed to give a satisfactory yield or a reasonably pure product, the carbamates were prepared either by mixing the amine and ethyl chloroformate in an organic solvent or by the Hoffman rearrangement of an amide in alcohol solution. 	The carbamates were nitrated with mixtures of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1. 49) and acetic anhydride. In general, it was observed that one and one-half equivalents of nitric acid were sufficient to effect complete nitration when acetic anhydride were employed as the dehydrating agent. 	Earlier investigators found that large excesses of nitric acid were required if this latter substance were used by itself as a nitrating agent. 	In the aliphatic and alicyclic series the carbamates were easily nitrated to yield the corresponding N-nitro carbamates. However, nitration of aromatic carbamates, such as ethyl N-phenyl carbamate, led to the introduction of a nitro group into the ortho and para positions of the benzene nucleus. When the ortho and para positions were blocked with methyl groups, {{as in the case of}} ethyl N-(2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) carbamate, nitration then took place in the meta position to yield ethyl N-(3, 5 -dinitro- 2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) carbamate. This latter compound, since all ring positions were blocked, was nitrated to yield ethyl N-nitro-N-(3, 5 -dinitro- 2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) carbamate, the only aromatic N-nitrocarbamate which was obtained during the course of this investigation. 	In the heterocyclic series attempts at nitrating ethyl N-[4 -(1, 2, 4 -triazolyl) ] carbamate, ethyl N-(2 -thiazolyl) carbamate, ethyl N-(2 -pyridyl) carbamate and ethyl N-(s-pyridyl) carbamate with fuming nitric acid and acetic anhydride resulted in each case in recovery of the original material. Attempts at nitrating ethyl N-(2 -furfuryl) carbamate and ethyl N-(2 -thenyl) carbamate resulted in the formation of dark, viscous tarry substances. 	However ethyl N-(2 -pyridyl) carbamate and ethyl N-(3 -pyridyl) carbamate were nitrated in the nucleus by refluxing them with a mixture of fuming nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid to yield ethyl N-[2 -(5 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate and ethyl N-[3 -(2 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate respectively. 	In the case of ethyl N-[2 -(5 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate the position of the nitro group was ascertained by hydrolyzing it to 5 -nitro- 2 -aminopyridine, a known compound. The ethyl N-[3 -(2 -nitropyridyl) ] carbamate was hydrolyzed to 2 -nitro- 3 -aminopyridine, a new compound, and the latter substance was reduced to 2, 3 -diaminopyridine, a compound which has previously been reported. 	Earlier investigators has employed N-nitro-carbamates as intermediates in the synthesis of N-nitroamines. The nitrocarbamates in ethereal solution were treated with gaseous ammonia which caused them to undergo ammonolysis to the ammonium salt of the nitroamine, which substance precipitated from the ethereal solution. 	It was thought that a similar reaction could be effected by means of primary and secondary amines. Investigation of the reaction showed that this was indeed the cases and the resulting amine salts of N-nitroamines serve as excellent derivatives of either amines or N-nitroamines since they all have melting points within the range 50 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius. These salts can also be precipitated simply by mixing ethereal solutions of the amine and the nitroamine. 	The insolubility of theses substances in organic solvents and the fact that the majority of them were easily soluble in water was a good indication that they were true salts. This fact was born out by conductance measurements on several of these compounds which indicated that they were good electrolytes, comparable in strength with such salts as sodium acetate and sodium propionate. 	The ultra-violet absorption spectra of several N-nitrocarbamates and amine salts of N-nitroamines were investigated and it was observed that the maxima of the N-nitrocarbamates fell in the range 235 - 240 <b>millimicrons</b> with the extinction coefficients in the range 233 - 235 <b>millimicrons</b> with extinction coefficients ranging from 8080 to 8210. The carbamates themselves did not absorb at all in the entire region that was investigated (220 - 400 <b>millimicrons).</b> 	The overall picture of the results indicates that there is a slight shift toward the visible in the spectra of the N-nitrocarbamates, although the shift is not of such magnitude to serve as a means of distinguishing N-nitrocarbamates from N-nitroamines. 	The behavior of one member of the series of aliphatic nitrocarbamates, ethyl N-nitro-N-isopropyl carbamate was studied in the presence of various oxidizing agents. It was predicted that in the presence of alkaline potassium permanganate, this substance would be oxidized to acetone, acetic acid, oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. However it was found that the oxidation products were isopropyl N-nitroamine, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. In the presence of acidic potassium permanganate the nitrocarbamate appears to be oxidized completely to carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and water. 	Ethyl N-nitro-N-isopropyl carbamate is also oxidized to water soluble gaseous products if it is mixed with fuming nitric acid at room temperature, although such mixtures of nitric acid and the nitrocarbamate were observed to stand for extended periods without reacting perceptibly at temperature of 0 degrees Celsius or below. 	The new carbamates which have been prepared during the course of this investigation and their physical constants are listed below. The carbamate and its physical constants are arranged in the following order: name of carbamate, boiling point, density at 20 degrees Celsius compared to water at 20 degrees Celsius, the refractive index at 20 degrees Celsius, or if it is a solid the name of the carbamate and its melting point.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityOver {{the past}} ten to fifteen years much {{work has been done}} on {{oxidation}} and reduction reactions of coordination complexes in aqueous solution. Relatively little attention has been devoted, however, to the study of reactions in which ligands of these complexes are oxidized or reduced. In the present work an investigation was carried out on the bromine oxidation of the isothiocyanatopentamiminechromium(III) ion and of tetraisothiocyanatodiamminechromate(III) ion. 		Werner (16) studied the bromine oxidation of ammonium reineckate, and after extensive treatment of the reaction solution isolated the green salt [Cr(NH 3) 2 (Br) 2 (H 2 O) 2]Br. In the present study, an attempt was made to establish the stoichiometry of the bromine oxidations of the Reineckate ion and the [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 ion. Work was done on the identification of the oxidation products and on correlation of these products with the observed stoichiometry. The oxidation of the Reineckate ion was carried out in both buffered solution, at a pH of 4. 5 - 5, and acidic solution, with a pH of 1 - 2, in order to note any difference in the measured stoichiometries with the change in acidity. Measurements were also made to determine if dissociation of the complex preceded the initial oxidation step. 		[Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS](ClO 4) 2 was prepared from [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl] by a procedure based on the method of Adamson and Wilkins (3). The [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl]Cl 2 was prepared by the reduction of chromic ion to chromous ion by zinc in the presence of acid. The chromous ion by zinc in the presence of acid. The chromous ion was then oxidized by air in the presence of ammonium chloride in aqueous ammonia. This solution was treated with hot hydrochloric acid to obtain the internediate [Cr(NH 3) 5 Cl]Cl 2. 		The following procedure was used to determine the rate of consumption of bromine and extablish the stoichiometry of the reactant species. Definite volumes of solution containing complex ion and hydrochloric acid or acetate buffer were placed in one flask, and the same volumes of blank solution containing hydrochloric acid or buffer, but no complex, wwere placed in another flask. A certain volume of aqueous bromine was added to each flask, and after a certain selected time, the remaining bromine was quenched with protassium iodide. The liberated iodine was titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution using starch as an indicator. The stoichiometries (the moles of bromine consumed per mole of complex ion) were determined using this same method. The chromium content of each solution of complex was determined by destroying the complex in hot alkali, oxidizing the chromite ion solution to chromate ion by hot hydrogen peroxide, and measuring the absorbance of the resulting chromate solution at a wave length of 372 <b>millimicrons.</b> 		From the measurements made on the bromine oxidation of Reineckate ion, it appears that there is an initial rapid reaction followed by a slower consumption of bromine. 		From the available data concerning the oxidation of [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2, there also appears to be an initial rapid consumption of bromine. Measurements did not indicate a slower consumption of bromine. 		Allowing the buffered oxidation of Reineckate ion by bromine to take place for 10 minutes, at a pH of 4. 5 - 5, the observed stoichiometry was 14. 2 moles of bromine per mole of Reineckate ion. In acidic solution, at a pH of 1 - 2, the apparent stoichiometry of the Reineckate ion oxidation was 14. 0 moles of bromine per mole of Reineckate ion. 		The stoichiometry of the [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 ion oxidation, allowing the reaction to take place for 15 minutes, was 3. 2 moles of bromine consumed per mole of complex ion. 		Sulfate ion and nitrate ion were both identified as products of the Reineckate ion oxidation. The cyanide ion and the ammonium ion were not detected and are thus ruled out as possible oxidation products. No suitable test was devised for the identification of carbon dioxide. 		More work should be done on the study of the slower secondary oxidation by bromine of Reineckate ion. The bromine oxidation of [Cr(NH 3) 5 NCS]+ 2 should be investigated in more detail and perhaps a comparison of the oxidation rates of it and the Reineckate ion could be made where possible. A reaction apparatus should be designed which would trap any gaseous oxidation products formed and a correlation could be made between the reaction products formed during each reaction interval and the observed stoichiometries...|$|R
