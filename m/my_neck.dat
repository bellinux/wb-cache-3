The Ephrons wove {{together}} {{a collection of}} stories adapted from the book with recollections of friends, including Rosie O'Donnell.

500|$|Five {{months after}} the Olympic session, with the Beatles having now broken up, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison {{recorded}} for his All Things Must Pass triple album. It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> out on the chopping block because now I would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at the same time I thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E

The reissued album was produced by music historian Andy Zax and producer Bill Inglot.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{was elected}} in November 1888 over President Cleveland. [...] By 1889, Foraker was openly opposed by a faction of Ohio Republicans, led by Hanna, Sherman and McKinley. [...] Foraker felt {{relieved}} at the break, writing to a friend, [...] "From Toledo to Chicago, <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> was under a yoke, but now I am free." [...] Despite the factional opposition, he sought a third term in 1889, hoping that if Republicans kept their majority in the legislature, he could be elected to the Senate as Sherman's junior colleague in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1890. [...] He was renominated at the 1889 state convention in Columbus on the second ballot, as the opposition to him was divided.|$|E
500|$|On March 6, 2007, Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Angle's name {{was found in}} the client database of a Florida wellness center suspected of being a front for distributing performance enhancing drugs. The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for trenbolone (which is not approved for human use by the FDA) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle responded on his official website: [...] "I did not improperly receive prescriptions. It is well documented that in my career I have broken vertebrae in <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> on five occasions and each time the course of treatment was under the care and supervision of my doctors. Any attempt to link me to the athletes in the current news accounts who may have improperly sought performance-enhancing drugs is without foundation".|$|E

500|$|During a 1994 interview, a visibly {{intoxicated}} Frusciante {{noted that}} he wrote the album {{in order to create}} [...] "interesting music", which he felt no longer existed. He felt contemporary artists were not writing material he deemed worth listening to and the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity. Drugs were another significant topic Frusciante based Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt on. According to Frusciante, he [...] "was stoned for every single note [...] played on the album." [...] He increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression that was caused by leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent isolation. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Chili Peppers' success, such as the album's eleventh track, [...] "Blood on <b>My</b> <b>Neck</b> From Success".|$|E
500|$|The Navy's report blamed an {{external}} cause, believed {{by many to}} be a Spanish mine or bomb, for the sinking of Maine (modern reports have suggested an internal explosion within a coal bunker). [...] Despite the increased calls for war, McKinley hoped to preserve peace. [...] However, {{when it became clear that}} the United States would accept nothing but Cuban independence, which the Spanish were not prepared to grant, negotiations broke off. [...] On April 11, McKinley asked Congress for authority to secure Cuban independence, using force if necessary. [...] Hanna supported McKinley in obtaining that authority, though he stated privately, [...] "If Congress had started this, I'd break <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> to stop it." [...] Spain broke off diplomatic relations on April 20; Congress declared war five days later, retroactive to April 21.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{considered}} the track {{one of the}} album's highlights. Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne gave Love. Angel. Music. Baby. a C+ rating but called the track [...] "one of the album's undeniable highs". In its review of the album, Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork believed that [...] "we can't expect 12 more cuts as personal or urgent as debut single 'What You Waiting For'", while naming it [...] "one of the best electro songs this year". Lisa Haines of BBC Music stated that it [...] "stands out as the best track on the album for the way it pits storming beats against enthusiastic lyrics" [...] and compared the song to Goldfrapp's 2003 single [...] "Strict Machine". Eric Greenwood of Drawer B, who felt that the album [...] "fails on every level", also commented that [...] "if this album had even two more songs this immediate and catchy, then I'd stick <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> out for it, but, sadly, it's the only song worth listening to." [...] In 2009, The Daily Telegraph listed the song at number 82 on their list [...] "100 songs that defined the Noughties." ...|$|E

500|$|Store Frøen's rural {{surroundings}} {{shaped the}} nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E

I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that she had so much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E

Somehow, during the last Genesis tour, I dislocated some vertebrae in my upper neck and that affected my hands.
