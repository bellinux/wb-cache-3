40|$|Observations of the {{transport}} of magnetic elements across the Sun's surface indicate that, in general, the meridional flow extends {{all the way to}} the poles. Furthermore, the speed of this flow varies systematically over each solar cycle faster at minimum and slower at maximum. The flow speed on the approach to this (Cycle 24) minimum was substantially faster than it was at the last minimum. This increased flow speed should have produced a short Cycle 23 with strong polar fields in the flux transport dynamos used to predict Cycle 24. This is contrary to what we have seen. The increased flow speed does produce weak polar fields in the surface flux transport models like those used to estimate past irradiance variations. However, these surface flux transport models use <b>meridional</b> flow <b>profiles</b> that do not agree with the observations.

The NDVI in Siberia shows a large value around the 60 °N zone, and it gradually decreases toward the southern arid region and the low temperature polar region. This <b>meridional</b> <b>profile</b> (south–north regionality) of the NDVI was analysed in two meridional transects, along 75 °E (arid–forest transect) and 110 °E (forest–tundra transect). A modified warmth index (WI(0)) was utilized as a temperature index. In the 75 °E transect, high positive (0. 79) and negative (0. 58) correlations {{were found in the}} NDVI–precipitation and the NDVI–WI(0) meridional profiles, respectively.

40|$|Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) is an {{excellent}} tracer of large-scale atmospheric transport, because it has slowly increasing sources mostly confined to northern midlatitudes, and has a lifetime of thousands of years. We have simulated the emissions, transport, and concentration of SF, for a 5 -year period, and compared the results with atmospheric observations. In addition, we have performed an intercomparison of interhemispheric transport among 11 models to investigate {{the reasons for the}} differences among the simulations. Most of the models are reasonably successful at simulating the observed meridional gradient of SF 6 in the remote marine boundary layer, though there is less agreement at continental sites. Models that compare well to observations in the remote marine boundary layer tend to systematically overestimate SF 6 at continental locations in source regions, suggesting that vertical trapping rather than meridional transport may be a dominant control on the simulated meridional gradient. The vertical structure of simulated SF 6 in the models supports this interpretation. Some of the models perform quite well in terms of the simulated seasonal cycle at remote locations, while others do not. Interhemispheric exchange time varies by a factor of 2 when estimated from 1 - dimensional <b>meridional</b> <b>profiles</b> at the surface, as has been done for observations. The agreement among models is better when the global surface mean mole fraction is used, and better still when the full 3 -dimensional mean mixing ratio is used. The ranking of the interhemispheric exchange time among the models is not sensitive to the change From station values to surface means, but is very sensitive to the change from surface means to the full 3 -dimensional tracer fields. This strengthens the argument that vertical redistribution dominates over interhemispheric transport in determining the meridional gradient at the surface. Vertically integrated meridional transport in the models is divided roughly equally into transport by the mean motion, the standing eddies, and the transient eddies. The vertically integrated mass flux is a good index {{of the degree to which}} resolved advection vs. parameterized diffusion accomplishes the meridional transport of SF 6. Observational programs could provide a much better constraint on simulated chemical tracer transport if they included regular sampling of vertical profiles of nonreactive trace gases over source regions and <b>meridional</b> <b>profiles</b> in the middle to upper troposphere.

Area and temporal mean differences between calculated and measured tropopause pressures lie in most of the case in the #+-# 10 hPa range. Only in the sub-tropics, where the tropopause shows strong meridional gradients, significant deviations of up to 60 hPA occur occasionally.

Although it has long been recognized that the meridional flow is predominantly poleward at the Sun’s surface and in its shallow interior, the location of the equatorward return flow and the <b>meridional</b> flow <b>profile</b> in the deeper interior remain unclear. Using the first 2 yr of continuous helioseismology observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager, we analyze travel times of acoustic waves that propagate through different depths of the solar interior carrying information about the solar interior dynamics.

An equatorward flow of a speed of 10 m s− 1 is found between 0. 82 and 0. 91 R ⊙ in the middle of the convection zone. Our analysis also shows evidence of that the meridional flow turns poleward again below 0. 82 R⊙, indicating an existence of a second meridional circulation cell below the shallower one.

The nonlinear dynamics near different resonances is studied considering both wave-wave and wave-zonal flow interactions. It is shown that Hopf bifurcations from stationary to periodic flows are possible due to the nonlinear instability of nonzonal, topographically forced flow. Low-frequency, finite-amplitude oscillations arise due to a combination of two factors: (1) nonlinear wave-wave interactions, which tend to reduce the Rossby wave frequency; and (2) wave-zonal flow interactions, which reflect the importance of wave momentum transport in shifting the westerly jet and of the topographic form drag.

These simulations have been constructed so as to span the transition between solar-like differential rotation (fast equator/slow poles) and ``anti-solar' differential rotation (slow equator/fast poles). Solar-like states of differential rotation, arising when convection is rotationally constrained, are characterized by a very different convective Reynolds stress than anti-solar regimes, wherein convection only weakly senses the Coriolis force. We find that the angular momentum transport by convective Reynolds stress plays a central role in establishing the <b>meridional</b> flow <b>profiles</b> in these simulations. We find that the transition from single-celled to multi-celled <b>meridional</b> circulation <b>profiles</b> in strong and weak regimes of rotational constraint is linked to a change in the convective Reynolds stress, a clear demonstration of gyroscopic pumping. Latitudinal thermal variations differ between these different regimes, with those in the solar-like regime conspiring to suppress a single cell of meridional circulation, whereas the cool poles and warm equator established in the anti-solar states tend to promote single-celled circulations. Though the convective angular momentum transport becomes radially inward at mid-latitudes in anti-solar regimes, it is the meridional circulation that is primarily responsible for establishing a rapidly-rotating pole. We conclude with a discussion of how these results relate to the Sun, and suggest that the Sun may lie near the transition between rapidly-rotating and slowly-rotating regimes.

40|$|Evidence {{strongly}} {{indicates that}} {{the strength of the}} Sun's polar fields near the time of a sunspot cycle minimum determines the strength of the following solar activity cycle. We use our Advective Flux Transport (AFT) code, with flows well constrained by observations, to simulate the evolution of the Sun's polar magnetic fields from early 2016 to the end of 2019 [...] - near the expected time of Cycle 24 / 25 minimum. We run a series of simulations in which the uncertain conditions (convective motion details, active region tilt, and <b>meridional</b> flow <b>profile)</b> are varied within expected ranges. We find that the average strength of the polar fields near the end of Cycle 24 will be similar to that measured near the end of Cycle 23, indicating that Cycle 25 will be similar in strength to the current cycle. In all cases the polar fields are asymmetric with fields in the south stronger than those in the north. This asymmetry would be more pronounced if not for the predicted weakening of the southern polar fields in late 2016 and through 2017. After just four years of simulation the variability across our ensemble indicates an accumulated uncertainty of about 15 %. This accumulated uncertainty arises from stochastic variations in the convective motion details, the active region tilt, and changes in the <b>meridional</b> flow <b>profile.</b> These variations limit the ultimate predictability of the solar cycle.
