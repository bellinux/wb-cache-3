5000|$|Ground tackle {{includes}} {{equipment such as}} <b>mooring</b> <b>winches,</b> windlasses, and anchors. Anchors {{are used}} to moor ships in shallow water. They {{are connected to the}} ship by a rope or chain. On larger vessels, the chain runs through a hawsepipe.|$|R
25|$|Mooring {{requires}} {{cooperation between}} {{people on a}} pier and on a vessel. Heavy mooring lines are often passed from larger vessels to people on a mooring by smaller, weighted heaving lines. Once a mooring line {{is attached to a}} bollard, it is pulled tight. Large ships generally tighten their mooring lines using heavy machinery called <b>mooring</b> <b>winches</b> or capstans.|$|R
50|$|When {{the class}} was ordered, no port in the Americas could handle ships of their size. Suitable ports include Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen, Qingdao, Yantian, Hong Kong, Tanjung Pelepas, Singapore and Colombo in Asia, and Rotterdam, Gothenburg, Wilhelmshaven, Bremerhaven, Southampton, London Gateway, Le Havre, Felixstowe, Gdańsk, Antwerp and Algeciras in Europe. The ships will be {{too big for the}} New Panamax-sized locks on the Panama Canal, and their main route is {{expected}} to be Asia-Europe (through the Suez Canal). The draft of the Triple-E is 14.5 m, less than the SuezMax requirement of 55.9 ft at 59 m beam. Handling equipment at ports was the main constraint on size, rather than the dimensions of canals or straits. The container port handling speed can be 29 moves per hour in Tanger-Med, or 37 in Rotterdam (215 per ship).Anchor and <b>mooring</b> <b>winch</b> systems are being supplied by TTS Marine.|$|E
5000|$|The ships {{have the}} {{capability}} to supply fuel and other liquid cargo to vessels using replenishment rigs on port and starboard beams and through a Hudson reel-type stern rig. When providing support for amphibious operations, the ships are also able to deliver fuel to dracones positioned alongside. The equipment load includes cranes (for stores handling and abeam replenishment), steering and rudder gear, thyristor-controlled winch/windlasses and double drum <b>mooring</b> <b>winches.</b> Up to [...] of liquids and [...] of general solids can be carried. In addition, reverse-osmosis equipment is fitted enabling the production of [...] of drinkable water per day.|$|R
5000|$|Offshore Petroleum Distribution System (OPDS) {{provides}} a semipermanent, all-weather facility for bulk transfer of refined bulk petroleum (e.g., JP5 and JP8) directly from an offshore tanker to a beach termination unit (BTU) located immediately inland from the high-water mark. POL then is either transported inland or {{stored in the}} beach support area. Major OPDS components are: the OPDS tanker with booster pumps and spread <b>mooring</b> <b>winches,</b> a recoverable single-anchor leg mooring (SALM) to accommodate four tankers up to 70,000 DWT, ship to SALM hose lines, up to four miles of six-inch (internal diameter) conduit for pumping to the beach, and two BTUs to interface with the shoreside systems.|$|R
25|$|At this time, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett—Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics and staunch {{advocate}} of the airship—was discussing {{the possibility of using}} Shenandoah to explore the Arctic. He felt such a program would produce valuable weather data, as well as experience in cold-weather operations. With its endurance and ability to fly at low speeds, the airship was thought to be well-suited to such work. President Calvin Coolidge approved Moffett's proposal, but Shenandoahs upper tail fin covering ripped during a gale on 16 January 1924, and the sudden roll tore her away from the Lakehurst mast, ripping out her <b>mooring</b> <b>winches,</b> deflating the first helium cell and puncturing the second. Zeppelin test pilot Anton Heinen rode out the storm for several hours and landed safely while the airship was being blown backwards. Extensive repairs were needed, and the Arctic expedition was scrapped.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{equipment}} on board ships is common. It assists in the work of: steering gear, pitch propellers, watertight doors, cargo hatch covers, cargo and <b>mooring</b> <b>winches,</b> deck cranes, stern ramps etc. The damage caused by transient flows (which include among others water hammer) are often impossible to repair at sea. Hence, {{it is very important}} to estimate the correct pressure runs and associated side effects during their design. The presented study compares the results of research on the impact of a simplified way of modeling the hydraulic resistance and simplified effective weighting functions build of two and three-terms on the estimated results of the pressure changes. As it turns out, simple effective two-terms weighting functions are able to accurately model the analyzed transients. The implementation of the presented method will soon allow current automatic protection of hydraulic systems of the adverse effects associated with frequent elevated and reduced pressures...|$|R

40|$|NEREUS (novel, efficient, rapid {{evaluation}} of underwater spectra) is a self-contained underwater mass-spectrometer system capable of continuous measurements of gases and vapors dissolved {{in the water}} column. Rapid in-situ measurement minimizes or eliminates artefacts that are often a problem when collecting and storing samples for analysis of volatile constituents, and provides higher spatial and temporal resolution of chemical patterns than is possible with conventional techniques. NEREUS is designed to operate either independently on a <b>mooring</b> or <b>winch</b> line, or aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), such as the Sea Grant Odyssey class submersible. Underwater mass spec-trometers such as NEREUS have many important applications to practical problems, such as pollution monitoring, {{as well as to}} fundamental Earth system...|$|R
50|$|In the 2001 conversion, it {{was fitted}} with seven {{thrusters}} and a J-lay system. The 98 m J-Lay tower, designed and constructed by Huisman Itrec, {{is capable of}} laying pipe in water depths to 3000 m. Balder was also equipped with class III Dynamic Positioning system and a <b>Mooring</b> Line Deployment <b>winch.</b> The winch is {{the largest in the}} world, with a diameter of 10.5 meters and a Safe Working Load (SWL) of 275 t.|$|R
40|$|This note {{describes}} a profiling mooring with an interdisciplinary suite of sensors taking profiles between 180 and 30  m depth. It {{consists of an}} underwater <b>winch,</b> <b>moored</b> below 180  m depth, and a profiling instrumentation platform. In its described setup it can take about 200 profiles at pre-programmed times or intervals with one set of batteries. This allows for studies {{over an extended period}} of time (e. g.  two daily profiles over a time of 3 months). The Gotland Deep Environmental Sampling Station (GODESS) in the Eastern Gotland Basin of the Baltic Sea is aimed at investigations of redoxcline dynamics. The described system can be readily adapted to other research foci by changing the profiling instrumentation platform and its payload...|$|R
