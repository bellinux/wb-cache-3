25|$|As the <b>Malaysian</b> <b>dollar</b> {{replaced}} the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par and Malaysia was a participating {{member of the}} sterling area, the new dollar was originally valued at 8.57 dollars per 1 British pound sterling. In November 1967, {{five months after the}} introduction of the <b>Malaysian</b> <b>dollar,</b> the pound was devalued by 14.3%, leading to a collapse in confidence for the sterling area and its demise in 1972. The new currency was not affected but earlier notes of the Malaya and British Borneo dollar were still pegged at 8.57 dollars per 1pound; consequently these notes were reduced in value to 85 cents per dollar.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{emergence}} of new currencies in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, the Interchangeability Agreement which the three countries adhered to as original members of the currency union meant the <b>Malaysian</b> <b>dollar</b> was exchangeable at par with the Singapore dollar and Brunei dollar.

40|$|The paper {{tests for}} the {{systematic}} empirical {{relationship between the}} <b>Malaysian</b> Ringgit/US <b>Dollar</b> real exchange rate and the real interest rate differential between Malaysia and the US using the Johansen maximum likelihood cointegration procedure. The results indicate {{the existence of a}} fairly robust long-run relationship between the real exchange rate and the real interest rate differential. The estimated error correction models also indicate the existence of stable adjustment dynamics when either the real exchange rate or the real exchange rate differential deviates from their long-run equilibrium position. ...|$|R

We find that the monetary fundamentals are significant in explaining the dynamics of Malaysian exchange rate in a longer forecast horizon as the performance of monetary exchange rate models outperformed the random walk benchmark model. The results also revealed that Malaysian exchange rate market provides profitable short-term arbitrage opportunities with lagged observations, and the integration of autoregressive terms into the monetary exchange rate models enhanced the out-of-sample forecasting performance.

40|$|The {{predictive}} {{power of}} the monetary model for the <b>Malaysian</b> ringgit/US <b>dollar</b> (RM/USD) rate is analysed using quarterly data ending in 2006 :Q 3. We find compelling evidence of a long-run relationship between exchange rates and the economic fundamental determinant. Macroeconomic factors systematically affect the long-run movement of the RM/USD rate. Additionally, the RM/USD rate was overvalued by about 10 % several quarters before the 1997 crisis; after the crisis, rates fluctuated close to the equilibrium value. The out-of-sample forecasts demonstrate that the monetary model outperforms the naive random walk model. The monetary and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) models do well at the four to eight quarters horizon. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{reports of}} {{nosocomial}} infection (NI) prevalence {{have come from}} developed countries with established infection control programs. In developing countries, infection control is often not as well established {{due to lack of}} staff and resources. We examined the rate of NI in our institution. METHODS: A point-prevalence study. of NI and antibiotic prescribing was conducted. On July 16 and 17, 2001, all inpatients were surveyed for NI, risk factors, pathogens isolated, and antibiotics prescribed and their indication. NIs were diagnosed according to CDC criteria. Cost of antibiotic acquisition was calculated by treatment indication. SETTING: Tertiary-care referral center in Malaysia. PATIENTS: All inpatients {{during the time of the}} study. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-eight patients were surveyed. Seventy-five had 103 NIs for a prevalence of 13. 9. The most common NIs were urinary tract infections (12. 2), pneumonia (21. 4), laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infections (12. 2), deep surgical wound infections (11. 2), and clinical sepsis (22. 4). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA, and MSSA were the most common pathogens. Two hundred thirty-seven patients were taking 347 courses of antibiotics, for an overall prevalence of antibiotic use of 44. NI treatment accounted for 36 of antibiotic courses prescribed but 47 of antibiotic cost. Cost of antibiotic acquisition for NI treatment was estimated to be approximately 2 million per year (<b>Malaysian</b> <b>dollars).</b> CONCLUSION: Whereas the rate of NI is relatively high at our center compared with rates from previous reports, antibiotic use is among the highest reported in any study of this kind. Further research into this high rate of antibiotic use is urgently required...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{conditional}} volatility of the exchange rates of two Asia-Pacific currencies. These are the <b>Malaysian</b> ringgit-US <b>dollar</b> and the Singapore dollar-US dollar exchange rates. Both currencies are under relatively intervention-free managed-float systems. We employ the new class of APARCH model of Ding et al. (1993) to capture the possibly asymmetric effects of exchange shocks on future volatilities. In addition, we {{take account of the}} nonnormality in the residuals by using f-distributed errors. Similar to the findings for the major currencies under flexible exchange rate systems, the exchange rates of the two Asia-Pacific currencies demonstrate conditional heteroscedasticity and are adequately described by the APARCH model. We also find that a depreciation shock in the Malaysian ringgit against the US dollar has a greater effect on future volatilities than an appreciation shock of the same magnitude. However, such asymmetric effects are not significant in the Singapore market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} double gamma {{distribution}} {{as a means}} of modelling asymmetry in the conditional distribution of financial data. To do this the model is applied to ten exchange rate series covering mature and emerging market countries. A second contribution {{of this paper is to}} highlight the link between the double gamma distribution and the measurement of the second lower partial moment (or semi-variance). The resulting empirical performance of the double gamma model is found to be mixed when compared to a symmetric GARCH-t model. Estimates of conditional downside risk based on the double gamma model are constructed for each series. The results for the <b>Malaysian</b> Riggit, Zimbabwe <b>Dollar</b> and the Korean Won demonstrate the extreme downside volatility experienced by these countries during the emerging markets currency crisis.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the Southeast Asian {{currency}} turmoil on some ASEAN countries demonstrates the {{need to understand the}} regional currency movements. In view of the growing interest in the Southeast Asian currency turmoil, this paper investigates the relationship between the main ASEAN currencies namely, Thai Bhat, <b>Malaysian</b> Ringgit, Singapore <b>Dollar,</b> Indonesia Rupiah and the Philipines Peso by applying the cointegration test to determine the long run dynamics between the currencies. The causality test is also performed to determine the influence of each currency on each other. The results show that the currencies are non-stationary and at most there are four cointegrating vectors for the periods before and during the turmoil. The Granger causality test shows that Malaysian currency seems to have the most significant causalities on the ASEAN currencies during the turmoil. However, the variance decomposition and the multivariate vector autoregression reveal that the past information of each currency contributed the most to its forecast erro...|$|R

This paper empirically analyses the exchange rate movements and {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) relationship using annual data on ASEAN economies, that is, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore. By employing ARDL bounds test approach, the empirical results show the existence of significant long-run cointegration between exchange rate and FDI for the case of Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines with all countries recording negative coefficient implying that the appreciation of Singapore <b>dollar,</b> <b>Malaysian</b> ringgit, and the Philippine peso has {{a positive impact on}} FDI inflows. Using the ECM based ARDL approach for causality test, both Singapore and the Philippines show long-run bidirectional causality between exchange rate and FDI whereas long-run unidirectional causality running from the exchange rate to FDI in Malaysia. Furthermore, this study also found that short-run unidirectional causality running from the exchange rate to FDI exists in Singapore...|$|R

Generally, the purpose of this research is to observe this relationship in Malaysian context. In order to achieve the objective, an estimation of Vector Auto Regression (VAR) method was applied on the created research model. The variables involved in this research are Kuala Lumpur Syariah Index (KLSI), Industrial Production Index (IPI), Consumer Production Index (CPI), Aggregate Money Supply (M 3), Islamic Inter Bank Rate (IIR) and Exchange Rate of <b>Malaysian</b> Ringgit-United States <b>Dollar.</b> This research used monthly data from April 1999 to October 2007 taken from authorized sources. The findings showed that Islamic stock prices are co-integrated with the selected macroeconomic variables in which the stock price is related positively and significantly with IPI and CPI variables but related negatively and significantly with M 3 and MYR variables. Meanwhile, its relation with IIR variables is found negative but insignificant. From the aspect of Granger causal relationship it is found that variables of CPI, M 3 and MYR are the Granger cause for KLSI and the KLSI is the Granger cause for IPI, CPI and MYR...|$|R
