40|$|Recently the {{definition}} of <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> seems to have engendered a debate {{among a number of}} scholars in the field. We suggest that the controversy stems from confusion about whether <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> is a product or a process.

METHODS: Observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study with 795 Brazilian infants from zero to 18 months of age, assessed by the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) at day care centers, nurseries, basic health units and at home. The Brazilian infants' motor scores were compared {{to the results of}} two population samples from Greece (424 infants) and Canada (2, 400 infants). Descriptive statistics was used, with one-sample t-test and binomial tests, being significant p&# 8804; 0. 05. RESULTS: 65. 4 % of Brazilian children showed typical <b>motor</b> <b>development,</b> although with lower mean scores.

40|$|Introduction: Motor {{developmental}} stimulation is {{an activity}} undertaken {{to stimulate the}} children basic skills and so they can grow and develop optimally.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze mother’s behavior about motor stimulation with fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> in toddler age 4 - 5 years old. Method: Design have been  used in this study was cross sectional. Population were mothers and their toddler in Group A of Dharma Wanita Persatuan Driyorejo Gresik Preschool. Sample were 51 respondents recruited by using purposive sampling technique according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The independent variable was mother’s behavior about motor stimulation whereas dependent variable was fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> in toddler. The data were collected using questionnaire and conducting observation on fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> based on Denver Development Screening Test (DDST). Data then analyzed using Spearman Rho (r) test to find relation between mother’s behaviors about stimulation motor on their toddler fine <b>motor</b> <b>development.</b> Result: Results  of this study showed that there were correlations between mother’s knowledge and fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> in toddler (p= 0. 000), between mother’s attitude and fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> in toddler (p= 0. 000), and between mother’s actions and fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> in toddler (p= 0. 000).

Additionally, a teacher survey which addressed the teacher-consultant relationship was developed and piloted {{within the context of}} the study for use in future research. Subjects were 31 children enrolled in two preschool programs including: a) the curriculum group (N= 16), and b) the non-curriculum group (N=l 5). The Peabody Motor Developmental Scales and the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance were used to assess the children's <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> and perceived competence, respectively.

40|$|Dyslexics {{have been}} found to have {{multiple}} co-occurring problems, of which language, motor and attention problems are among the most frequently named. This thesis examines the relationship between dyslexia and its possible precursors, with a specific aim to investigate claims about <b>motor</b> <b>development.</b> Infants with a familial risk of dyslexia were compared with a group of control infants. A parental questionnaire provided information about the medical history and development, speech and language <b>development,</b> <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> and attention. Additionally, language production and comprehension skills were assessed with the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories. As dyslexic children have shown impaired language, motor and attention abilities, the development of the at-risk group was expected to be delayed. Furthermore, correlations between the performance in language, motor and attention skills are examined. The at-risk children indeed obtained lower scores on measures of receptive vocabulary. No difference was found between the two groups on any of the <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> measures. Overall <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> was associated with vocabulary scores for both groups, but a relationship between oral <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> and vocabulary was only present for the at-risk group.

40|$|A {{contemporary}} view {{of early}} childhood <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> considers environmental influences as critical factors in optimal growth and behavior, with the home being the primary agent. However, minimal research exists examining the relationship between <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> and the home. The present dissertation addresses this gap {{with the goal of}} creating an innovative parental self-report instrument for assessing {{the quality and quantity of}} factors (affordances and events) in the home that are conducive to enhancing <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> in children ages 18 -to- 42 months. In Study 1, following initial face validity determination, expert opinion feedback and selective pilot-testing, construct validity was examined using 381 Portuguese families. Factor analysis techniques were used to (1) compare competing factorial models according to previous theoretical assumptions, and to (2) analyze the fit of the preferred model. Of the five plausible models tested, the 5 -factor solution provided the best fit to the data. Reliability was established through the scale reliability coefficient with a value of. 85. Study 2 tests for the content validity of the instrument, examining the relationship between the inventory and level of <b>motor</b> <b>development.</b> Fifty-one (51) participants from the original sample were assessed for <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales II (PDMS 2).

40|$|Background. Studies {{have often}} {{compared}} the postnatal <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> of 'small' versus 'normal' newborns. Not much {{is known about}} the associations between a broad spectrum of size at birth and <b>motor</b> <b>development.</b> The effect of early postnatal growth on <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> is little researched. Growth failure in terms of shortness and thinness should be differentiated, but not many studies have the data for this analysis. Methods. This is a longitudinal study of infants born in Lahore, Pakistan, between 1984 and 1987. Age at commencement of independent walking and age at 'building a 3 -cube tower' were taken as indicators of gross and fine <b>motor</b> <b>development,</b> respectively. Size at birth was captured by length and thinness as continuous variables; postnatal growth from birth to 6 months of age was measured by changes in length and thinness. Adjustment for covariates and handling of censored cases were performed by generalized log gamma regression. Results. Thinness at birth and postnatal stunting and wasting had a linear, inverse association with gross <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> (each P< 0. 05). Birth length had a non-linear, inverse association with this outcome (P< 0. 05). Birth length, thinness at birth and postnatal wasting had a linear, inverse association with fine <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> (each P< 0. 05). Conclusion. Both fetal and early postnatal growth over a broad spectrum may affect infants' <b>motor</b> <b>development.</b> It is not just the babies who were very small at birth that suffered.

The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) was used for <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> assessment. Results: Comparing the motor performance of preterm infants with infants from a standardized sample on the AIMS, it was found that, except for the age group of the newborn, preterm infants showed lower <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> scores in comparison with the AIMS normative sample in all age groups between 1 and 12 months.

Data source: Systematic review of studies published from 2006 to 2015, indexed in Pubmed, Scielo, Lilacs, and Medline databases in English and Portuguese. The search strategy included the keywords: Alberta Infant Motor Scale, prematurity, preterm, <b>motor</b> <b>development,</b> postural control, and follow-up. Data summary: A total of 101 articles were identified and 23 were selected, according to the inclusion criteria. The ages of the children assessed in the studies varied, including the first 6 months up to 15 or 18 months of corrected age. The percentage variation in motor delay was identified in the motor outcome descriptions of ten studies, ranging from 4 % to 53 %, depending on the age when the infant was assessed. The studies show significant differences in the <b>motor</b> <b>development</b> of preterm and full-term infants, with a description of lower gross scores in the AIMS results of preterm infants.

Methods: Data were obtained from the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Study.
