5|$|The Chinese were {{intrigued}} with European technology, but so were visiting Europeans of Chinese technology. In 1584, Abraham Ortelius (1527–1598) featured in his atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum the peculiar Chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages, just like Chinese ships. Gonzales de Mendoza also <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> {{a year later}} – noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes – while Gerardus Mercator (1512–94) featured them in his atlas, John Milton (1608–74) {{in one of his}} famous poems, and Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest (1739–801) in the writings of his travel diary in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} announced as Lords of Shadow with {{no connection to}} the Castlevania series <b>mentioned.</b> <b>This</b> was done to keep their plans to radically change {{the direction of the}} Castlevania mythos a secret and to prevent the announcement of the game from upstaging another series release, Castlevania Judgment. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series, helped produce the title. The music was composed by Spanish composer Óscar Araujo, who was acclaimed for his work on the game.|$|E
5|$|They {{probably}} {{first met}} personally in November 1881, though Narendra {{did not consider}} this their first meeting, and neither man <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> meeting later. At this time Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture. According to Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm lens, is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E
5|$|In August 937, Olaf {{crossed the}} Irish Sea with his army {{to join forces}} with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston's opinion this {{suggests}} that the battle of Brunanburh occurred in early October of that year. According to Paul Cavill, the invading armies raided Mercia, from which Æthelstan obtained Saxon troops as he travelled north to meet them. Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia. John of Worcester wrote that the invaders entered via the Humber but no other chronicler <b>mentioned</b> <b>this.</b> Because of the lack of sources supporting the claim, along with other issues, philologist Paul Cavill argues John's statement is not true. According to Symeon of Durham, Olaf had 615 ships but this number is likely exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|In general, Geographia Neoteriki, {{was welcomed}} with enthusiasm by western {{intellectual}} circles. Jean-Baptiste d'Ansse de Villoison, professor of modern Greek in the Ecole des Langues Orientales Vivantes, {{used it as a}} textbook for his students. French geographer Barbie du Bocage published a review after the book's publication along with a translated passage. Moreover, travellers who published accounts during the early 19th century, frequently cited the text. François Pouqueville, William Martin Leake, Henry Holland, and Lord Byron <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> work, and used it as a source of information. The book also enjoyed some popularity in the non Greek regions of the Balkan peninsula, while 19th century Bulgarian authors of geographic textbooks used it as a model.|$|E

5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the role}} of Scaramanga was offered to Jack Palance, but he turned the {{opportunity}} down. Christopher Lee, who was eventually chosen to portray Scaramanga, was Ian Fleming's step-cousin and Fleming had suggested Lee for {{the role of}} Dr. Julius No in the 1962 series opener Dr. No. Lee noted that Fleming was a forgetful man {{and by the time he}} <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> to Broccoli and Saltzman they had cast Joseph Wiseman in the part. Due to filming on location in Bangkok, his role in the film affected Lee's work the following year, as director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play Specialist in the 1975 film Tommy, a part eventually given to Jack Nicholson.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} then opened in Japan cinemas on 12 December 2009. It was officially {{released}} {{at a ceremony}} held at Marunouchi Piccadilly in Yurakucho, Tokyo, on 12 December 2010. The entire cast of the film, together with the film's director Joji Matsuoka, were present at the ceremony. Also, at the ceremony, it was revealed to the media that negotiations for the film's distribution rights overseas were ongoing. It was announced that distributors from 25 different countries in Asia and Europe were interested in releasing the films in their home countries, though these were not specifically <b>mentioned.</b> <b>This</b> is a high number as, usually, Japanese films will only receive around 10 to 15 different offers. During its debut weekend, Snow Prince debuted in 234 cinema screens across Japan. It grossed a total of $362,879 in the opening week, making it the 10th highest grossing movie over the weekend of 12 and 13 December. Overall, it earned $837,724 in Japanese cinemas.|$|E

5|$|The railway claimed {{its first}} lives when two contractor's {{locomotives}} collided in thick fog near Eastoft on 4 January 1901. Both of the locomotives were damaged, {{and the crew}} of one were scalded when the boiler tubes burst. The driver died the following day, and the stoker {{a few days after}} that. Another inspection train was run on 26 June 1901, starting from Reedness Junction and visiting, according to the Crowle Advertiser, Creyke Siding, Garthorpe and Crowle. The train consisted of two first-class carriages and an open truck. A dinner was held at the Darby and Joan Hotel in Crowle, before the party returned to Reedness. Although Creyke siding was <b>mentioned,</b> <b>this</b> term was normally applied to a siding serving Creyke's peat works on the North Eastern Railway main line to the south of Marshland Junction.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{nomenclatural}} {{problems with the}} current use of the name Pachylemur. First, Filhol had himself used the name Pachylemur in 1874 {{for a group of}} primitive primates, including Adapis, that he considered intermediate between pachyderms and lemurs. Several other authors <b>mentioned</b> <b>this</b> name in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is questionable that any rendered the name available under the rules of zoological nomenclature. Still, this name potentially renders Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, invalid under the Principle of Homonymy. In addition, the generic name Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, predates Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, by half a century and thus takes precedence under the Principle of Priority, and Pachylemur Lamberton is itself unavailable because Lamberton failed to select a type species. To conserve the name Pachylemur, Jelle Zijlstra, Colin Groves, and Alex Dunkel submitted a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 2011. The petition asks the Commission to suppress the names Pachylemur Filhol, 1874, Pachylemur Palmer, 1904 (based on Filhol's name), and Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, and to make Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, retroactively available with Lemur insignis as its type species.|$|E
