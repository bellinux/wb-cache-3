50|$|Following {{the arrival}} of {{multimedia}} CALL, <b>multimedia</b> language <b>centres</b> {{began to appear in}} educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to individualise learning but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of <b>multimedia</b> <b>centres</b> has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1). There is therefore a danger that <b>multimedia</b> <b>centres</b> may go {{the same way as the}} language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p. 28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.|$|R

Security has also been improved, and a lighting well provides natural light to the restaurant and <b>multimedia</b> <b>centres.</b> The helipad was replaced by a cupola which houses the commission's meeting room, looking out over Schuman roundabout. The building also meets the strictest environmental standards, reusing light, power and heat throughout the building.|$|R
