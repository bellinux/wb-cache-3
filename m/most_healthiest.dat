40|$|Children from {{secondary}} {{schools in the}} UK selected from photographs, dishes for the meal they would be most likely to choose and the meal they {{perceived to be the}} <b>most</b> <b>healthy.</b> They gave reasons for their choices. The nutritional value of the two sets of meals was compared and the reasons for choice were analysed qualitatively. There was an inverse relationship between the foods most likely to be chosen, and those that were perceived to be the <b>most</b> <b>healthy.</b> Although the children's nutritional knowledge was sound, choices were made more on the basis of convenience and taste than on the 'healthiness' of the food. The 'preferred' meals were in <b>most</b> respects less <b>healthy</b> than the 'healthy' meals. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|<b>Most</b> <b>healthy</b> adults {{will have}} upper airway {{colonization}} with H. influenzae. This process is dynamic and the predominant strains are nontypeable.

30|$|NTHi {{is present}} in the {{nasopharynx}} of <b>most</b> <b>healthy</b> adults but only causes clinical disease in a minority of subjects it infects. Therefore the nature of the respiratory tract immune/inflammatory response may be very important in the pathogenesis of this bacterium. NTHi causes strong stimulation of both innate and adaptive immunity.|$|R

2500|$|Anterograde amnesia, colloquially {{referred}} to as [...] "blacking out", is another symptom of heavy drinking. This {{is the loss of}} memory during and after an episode of drinking.

50|$|Arginine is {{classified}} as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize or create arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. <b>Most</b> <b>healthy</b> people {{do not need to}} supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and their body produces sufficient amounts.|$|R
40|$|<b>Most</b> <b>healthy</b> {{individuals}} show a multisegmental {{control strategy}} during challenging standing conditions, whereas others show a rigid ankle-steered strategy, which is assumed as suboptimal.
