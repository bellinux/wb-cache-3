In order to make this technology <b>marketable,</b> many <b>issues</b> as cost reduction, durability and operational management have to be overcome. Therefore the understanding of thermodynamic and electrochemical mechanisms, that govern the SOFC behaviour in steady-state and in transient operation, becomes fundamental. In this context the modelling of fuel cell (FC) thermal transient is of great interest because it can predict the temperature time variation, useful to the dimensioning of auxiliary devices and to avoid unwanted operational states affecting cell durability. In the present study, a 0 -D model of SOFC thermal transients was developed by applying system identification techniques, starting from experimental tests carried out on a stack made up of four single cells. Moreover, it was successfully validated in reference to further experimental data. The model allows to evaluate, in term of dynamic response, the effect of the main operating parameters on fuel cell temperature.

40|$|Despite being {{thoroughly}} debunked, {{concern over}} high government debt-to-GDP ratios has hardly disappeared from policy debates. As such, an overlooked possibility for reducing a high debt burden is simply buying back bonds {{at a discount}} when interest rates rise, as is widely predicted. This issue brief calculates the potential savings to the government through a hypothetical buyback of government debt in 2017. Long-term bonds that are issued at low interest rates will sell at substantial discounts to their face value if market interest rates rise. Looking at publicly held <b>marketable</b> debt <b>issued</b> as {{of the end of}} February 2013, the face value of the debt is $ 3, 857 billion. The projected market value of this debt is $ 3, 399 billion for an implied debt reduction of $ 458 billion, or just under 2. 3 percent of the GDP projected for 2017. The interest burden on the Treasury will not change through these transactions. The only effect will be to lower the official value of outstanding debt.

40|$|Treasuries {{represent}} {{an important part}} of the financial securities universe and are indispensable in academic and industry research and in day-to-day financial decision making. Empirical Treasury data is therefore used in a variety of ways impacting research results and real-life actions. Completeness and integrity of data, convenience of access and opportunity to deploy relevant analytics are some of the vital components when working with Treasury securities catering to reliability and timeliness of achieving relevant goals. These components come together when using the US Treasury database available from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) in the SAS environment. Overview of the US Treasury database available form CRSP is provided in the paper.

40|$|In {{many large}} {{companies}} the widespread usage of computers has led {{a number of}} different application-specific databases to be installed. As company structures evolve, boundaries between departments move, creating new business units. Their new applications will use existing data from various data stores, rather than new data entering the organization. Henceforth, the ability to make data stores interoperable becomes a crucial factor for the development of new information systems. Data interoperability may come in various degrees. At the lowest level, commercial gateways connect specific pairs of database management systems (DBMSs). Software providing facilities for defining persistent views over different databases [6] simplifies access to distant data but does not support automatic enforcement of consistency constraints among different databases. Full interoperability is achieved by distributed or federated database systems, which support integration of existing data into virtual databases (i. e. databases which are logically defined but not physically materialized). The latter allow existing databases to remain under control of their respective owners, thus supporting a harmonious coexistence of scalable data integration and site autonomy requirements [9]. Federated systems are very popular today. However, before they become <b>marketable,</b> many <b>issues</b> remain to be solved. Design issues focus on either human-centered aspects (cooperative work, including autonomy issues and negotiation procedures) or database-centered aspects (data integration, schema/database evolution).

40|$|The first essay [“Twin Deficits and Free Lunches: Macroeconomic Outcomes In Anticipation of Foreign Aid”] {{concerns}} {{itself with}} {{situations in which}} private agents anticipate a future windfall (free lunch) that will help service the debt resulting from a present fiscal expansion (implemented via a temporary tax cut). Such expectations of a windfall can arise {{in the context of}} natural resource discoveries or, more interestingly, due to perceptions by agents in “too important to fail” countries that will be bailed out through higher foreign aid or debt relief. We employ an overlapping generations model featuring credit constraints to study the real effects of such free lunch expectations in a small open economy, drawing contrasts with the standard tax and money finance closure rules. The model is solved analytically and shows that anticipated aid is equivalent to current aid when agents have perfect foresight, so that a temporary tax cut is seen as permanent. Accordingly, agents raise their consumption and indebtedness (at the expense of future generations) by an amount that is an increasing function of their “impatience” (subjective rates of time preference plus probability of death). A worsening of the current account obtains (twin deficits) across a range of plausible closure rules, including those featuring money finance. The introduction of credit constrained households (we study the variant where myopic agents spend their current disposable incomes) does not alter the basic result in the case of full aid finance, but does matter for mixed tax-aid regimes, in more complex settings where agent expectations and donor promises on aid diverge, and when governments face borrowing constraints so that the timing of aid delivery matters. The second essay [“The Role of Domestic Debt in Economic Growth: An Empirical Investigation For Developing Economies”] focuses on the remaining source of government financing, i. e. domestic debt, and the role it can play in mobilizing private savings, facilitating credit intermediation in higher risk settings (i. e. serving a “collateral” function on bank balance sheets), developing financial markets and supporting economic growth in general. To investigate this question empirically, we set up a new domestic debt database covering about 100 developing economies, going back three decades to 1975; explore Granger causality links between domestic debt and key macroeconomic and institutional variables; and estimate the growth impact of domestic debt using panel regressions, allowing for non-linear effects. Domestic debt, as a share of GDP is found to exert a significant positive impact on economic growth, with potential channels including domestic savings mobilization, provision of risk-insurance on banks’ balance sheets; and greater institutional accountability of the state to its citizens. Although this result countervails more established arguments against domestic debt (i. e. that it leads to crowding out and banks to become lazy), {{there is some evidence that}} above a ratio of 35 percent of bank deposits, domestic debt does begin to undermine economic growth. The growth payoff also depends on debt quality, with higher payoffs observed for positive interest-rate bearing <b>marketable</b> debt <b>issued</b> to nonbank sectors. The third and final essay [“Why Do Banks in Developing Economies Hold Domestic Government Securities?”] explores demand-side determinants of domestic debt, by focusing on commercial bank holdings of government paper, discriminating carefully between voluntary factors (such as mean-variance portfolio optimization) and statutory ones (cash reserve and capital adequacy requirements). The analysis is made possible by the construction of a dataset on government and private returns (real and nominal) for almost 600 banks from 70 emerging and low-income economies, spanning the (pre-Basel II) period 1995 - 2005. A battery of structural cross-section regressions indicates that banks’ portfolio decisions are at least as significantly influenced by mean-variance considerations as regulatory factors: the actual portfolio share of government securities (λ) responds intuitively, and sizably, to variations in the moments of the distributions for government and private returns as well as in the minimum-variance portfolio share (λ*). Higher cash reserve requirements tilt portfolios away from government securities toward riskier private lending, while higher capital adequacy requirements work the other way. The association between actual portfolios and the identified determinants is noticeably weaker at lower ends of the λ distribution, suggesting the domination of non-CAPM factors in those contexts.

40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between public debt, external and internal disequilibrium and inflation in Hungary through changes {{in the public sector}} borrowing requirement and in the structure of budget financing. The analysis is based on data from the 1986 - 1997 period in order to put the changes in true perspective. Policy constraints stemming from high indebtedness and their macroeconomic consequences are analysed by comparing different measures of fiscal deficit, as well as by quantifying the factors determining the evolution of the public debt/GDP ratio. We focus on the operational deficit (which is derived from the nominal deficit by eliminating the inflation compensation component of interest payments) and on its financing. The study presents a detailed empirical analysis of the evolution of the financing structure (seigniorage - debt) {{as well as of the}} role and structural changes of debt financing. The calculations are based on net consolidated public debt, which includes the combined debt of the budget and the central bank to other sectors net of claims. The consolidation of budget and central bank balances is unavoidable in order to get reliable indicators of the fiscal stance since in Hungary the central bank has been responsible for borrowing abroad in its own name. We introduced the category of ?extended??consolidated public debt (including the stock of central bank’s sterilisation instruments) which enabled us to analyse the past eleven years in a consistent framework, and to reveal the trends as well as the dynamic relationships of the debt accumulation process. The analysis shows that the shift to a new regime of deficit financing based on <b>issuing</b> <b>marketable</b> government securities (in 1992) did not increase the fiscal burden, it merely revealed its true magnitude by separating monetary and fiscal functions and by increasing transparency. The analysis of consolidated debt revealed that throughout the last ten years the implicit real interest rates on public debt exceeded the growth rate of the economy, which led to the continuous increase of the debt ratio (the gross debt/GDP around 90 % in the middle of nineties). This effect was mitigated only from 1995 by the fiscal adjustment resulting a primary surplus in the budget. The seigniorage did not play an important role in financing after 1992, it amounted to 1 - 2 % of GDP. However, the major element in the significant (over 15 percentage points) reduction in the debt-to- GDP ratio over the last three years was the devotion of privatisation revenues to retire public debt. Analysing past developments, we came to the conclusion that despite the significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the last few years, the debt burden is still significant and a further reduction of the debt to GDP ratio is inevitable in order to create the conditions for sustainable growth and to ensure the continuous convergence to developed countries. This requires a structural primary surplus of 1. 5 - 2 % of GDP in the medium run, if we take into account the requirement of sustainability, the goal of further reductions in the inflation rate and the fact that with the end of the privatisation process privatisation revenues will not provide additional sources for financing. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} perception of fit {{in the context of}} Cause-related marketing (referred to as CRM). The research seeks to develop an understanding of {{the perception of}} fit and investigates the role it plays in the evaluation and support for CRM campaigns. This research aims to address the overarching research problem: How does the congruence of nonprofit-forprofit pairings influence consumers' perceptions of fit and consequently their evaluation and support for CRM campaign alliances? To assist in addressing this research problem, a number of focal theories are integrated in a CRM conceptual framework including congruity theory, social alliance principles, co-branding, attribution theory, message framing and message claim vividness and the transfer (spill-over effect). These theories assist in addressing the key research questions: • What {{is the role of the}} perception of fit in a CRM context? • How do consumer perceptions of fit between the nonprofit-forprofit pairings affect consumers' evaluation and intent to support a joint CRM campaign? • How do the different information cues and attributes embedded in CRM advertising stimuli affect the perception of the participating organisations and the evaluation of a joint CRM alliance? • Does perceived fit in isolation or in combination with other factors play a significant role in consumers' attitude toward a joint CRM campaign? The nonprofit sector in Australia faces major challenges -the lack of government and philanthropic funding to support the charitable organisations and the increasing demand for nonprofit services in the wider community. The sector must diversify its revenue stream to avoid becoming over-reliant on government funding. This is to ensure sustainability into the future and to continue to provide social value to the community. One strategy increasingly used is cross-sector alliances between forprofit and nonprofit organisations. Despite CRM campaigns becoming quite prominent in the retail landscape, it is still predominantly the domain of high profile charitable organisations such as breast cancer, children's hospitals, and cancer research. The focus on prominent social issues is also prevalent in the CRM and co-branding literature. As such, this research seeks to determine whether a congruent CRM campaign aligned with a less <b>marketable</b> social <b>issue</b> (such as obesity) is perceived as a better fit than an incongruent campaign aligned with a social issue (such as environment preservation). It is clear from the exploratory research the perception of fit does not operate in isolation. After a review of the literature (congruity theory, attribution theory, message framing and message claim vividness), a number of factors are identified that have the potential to influence the perception of fit and the consumer's evaluation of, and intent to support, a CRM campaign. These factors include the role of the product type and charity type and the perception of the forprofit and nonprofit organisations engaging in CRM campaigns. In addition message persuasiveness is assessed based on the provision of supporting evidence. The supporting evidence consists of either statistical evidence, or a narrative, or a combination of both, or a neutral message (no evidence provided). The message structure is important in a CRM context as there may be instances when the consumer has limited knowledge about the cause or brand or the reasoning behind the formation of the social alliance, for which they may seek further clarification. Therefore, it is essential to determine whether specific message structures are more effective under different congruent and incongruent conditions. As a precursor to the conclusive stage of the research, Study 1 was an exploratory phase. This phase included a literature review, commercial CRM campaign assessment and a newspaper content analysis. This allowed a deeper insight into the social phenomena at hand. The conclusive stage of the research adopted a positivist research paradigm through a scenario-based experiment using a sample of 935 respondents. The results of the study were quite mixed. It was clear the initial perception of obesity as a social issue was quite negative but when aligned with either a hedonic restaurant or utilitarian cafe, the perception of fit was perceived as better than the incongruent counterpart of the hospitality organisations aligned with environment preservation. A key contributor to this perception was the importance of conveying a similar philosophical mission across the CRM partners (such as a hospitality outlet promoting and delivering healthy eating options). However, from a CRM campaign evaluation and support perspective, the results indicate that a favourable perception of fit transfers to a positive evaluation of the respective CRM promotion when the campaign has a similar mission but does not transfer to the overall support. A mediation analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting CRM campaigns conveying a similar philosophical underpinning enhance consumers' perceptions of fit and result in a positive evaluation of this type of CRM campaign. The findings also demonstrate the role of the advertising message. The message plays a role in the favourable evaluation of the perception of fit especially when the message contains statistical evidence and focusses on the mission of the campaign. It is also evident that when the organisational missions are not aligned, the CRM campaigns are less effective. This also holds true for campaigns that provide no information pertaining to the services the charity provides to the community (neutral claim). In relation to forprofit and nonprofit organisations. the CRM campaign message using statistical evidence or vivid message claims (statistical evidence in combination with a narrative), by highlighting a similar mission, significantly enhanced the attributions of the nonprofit organisation. On the other hand, the perceived motive of the forprofit organisation for participating in the CRM campaign had no effect. In terms of the perceptions of the forprofit and nonprofit organisations' motivations transferring to the evaluation and support for the CRM campaign, the findings showed no such effects. In summary, individuals recognise the perception of fit is greater when the campaign clearly articulates mission similarity using statistical and narrative supporting evidence, which transfers to a positive evaluation of the CRM campaign. The message tends to be more in favour of the role of the nonprofit organisation than the forprofit organisation. However, this does not persuade individuals to purchase the CRM product to assist the charitable organisation. Given the prevalence and longevity of CRMs in the marketplace, the importance of understanding the cues and attributes which influence consumers' perceptions and evaluations of fit and subsequent evaluations and support of the CRM campaign, is paramount. This is particularly so when lesser-known or less marketable charities are involved. Overall, this research contributes to the field of CRM as it provides a better understanding of the factors influencing consumer perception of fit. The findings assist decision-makers in the development of effective message frames that clearly communicate the objectives of the campaign to potential target consumers. This better elucidates the process through which consumers respond to CRMs thus helping strategic partners meet their societal goals and objectives...|$|R
