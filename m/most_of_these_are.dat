5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, {{and are in}} fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 262 species of bird have been {{recorded}} living in the wild {{on the island of}} Tasmania, nearby islands and islands in Bass Strait, 182 of which are regularly recorded, while another 79 are vagrants and one is extinct. Birds of Macquarie Island are not included in this list. Twelve species are unique (endemic) to the island of Tasmania, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> common and widespread. However, the forty-spotted pardalote is rare and restricted, while the island's two breeding endemic species, the world's only migratory parrots, are both threatened. Several species of penguin are late summer visitors to Tasmanian shores. Tasmania's endemic birds have led to it being classified as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA), one of 218 such areas worldwide. Priority regions for habitat-based conservation of birds around the world, they are defined by containing two or more restricted-range (endemic) species.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all members}} of the Council are members of a {{political}} party at national level, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> members of a European-level political party. However the Council is composed to represent the EU's states rather than political parties and the nature of coalition governments {{in a number of states}} means that individual configurations would vary on which domestic party was assigned the portfolio. However the broad ideological alignment of each state does have a bearing on the nature of the law the Council produces and the extent to which the link between domestic parties puts pressure on the members in the European Parliament to vote a certain way.|$|E

5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> tropical and live on islands.

In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market.

Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. In Scotland <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> located {{in the south of}} the country {{in the area of the}} British successor states that would be known as the Hen Ogledd, or the Old North. From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland. The earliest is the so-called Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to around 450. A slightly later stone at Kirkmadrine commemorates sacerdotes, which may be bishops. Among the key indicators of Christianisation are cemeteries containing long cists, which are generally east-west in orientation, like Christian graves. These cemeteries are suspected, or known to be Christian, because of their proximity to a church, or because they have Christian inscriptions. They are found from between the end of the Roman era in the early fifth century and the twelfth century. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the River Tay, in the modern East and Borders of Scotland. Writing in the sixth century, St. Patrick also mentioned Coroticus, who probably ruled from the fort at Dumbarton rock and who had already accepted Christianity. The poem Y Gododdin, set in the early sixth century and probably written in what is now Scotland, indicates that the warriors of Gododdin, probably a kingdom based the site of modern Edinburgh, were Christian, receiving communion and confessing their sins before battle.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the eyes, with three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E
