5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a <b>mesophilic</b> anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. <b>Mesophilic</b> anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in <b>mesophilic</b> and {{thermophilic}} environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mesophilic</b> {{digestion}} {{takes place}} optimally around 30 to 38°C, or at ambient temperatures between 20 and 45°C, where mesophiles {{are the primary}} microorganism present.|$|E
25|$|Composting toilets {{greatly reduce}} human waste volumes through psychrophilic, {{thermophilic}} or <b>mesophilic</b> composting. Keeping the composting chamber insulated and warm protects {{the composting process}} from slowing due to low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Composting toilets {{produce a}} humus-like endproduct {{that can be}} used to enrich soil if local {{regulations}} allow this. A secondary stage is often needed to allow <b>mesophilic</b> composting to further reduce potential pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, <b>mesophilic</b> vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a <b>mesophilic</b> system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{pathogen}} destruction {{rates are}} usually low, particularly helminth eggs, such as Ascaris eggs. This carries {{the risk of}} spreading disease if a proper system management is not in place. Compost from human excreta processed under only <b>mesophilic</b> conditions or taken directly from the compost chamber is not safe for food production. High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill helminth eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens. Helminth infections are common in many developing countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{residence}} {{time in a}} digester varies with the amount and type of feed material, and with {{the configuration of the}} digestion system. In a typical two-stage <b>mesophilic</b> digestion, {{residence time}} varies between 15 and 40days, while for a single-stage thermophilic digestion, residence times is normally faster and takes around 14days. The plug-flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event, digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.|$|E
25|$|Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and {{acidogenesis}} {{occur within}} the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either <b>mesophilic</b> or thermophilic) prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to {{the rate at which}} feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste. In this instance, there may be a pasteurisation or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably, {{it is not possible to}} completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.|$|E
2500|$|A limit {{case has}} been reached in Bolivia, with {{anaerobic}} digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking {{more than three times}} the normal <b>mesophilic</b> time process. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks, a 1,000 litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from [...] "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" [...] has produced 200–300litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates. <b>Mesophilic</b> species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. <b>Mesophilic</b> systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast, while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of <b>mesophilic.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In some systems, carbon {{additives}} such as sawdust, coconut coir, or {{peat moss}} is added after each use to create air pockets {{in the human}} excreta, improve the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and reduce potential odor. Most composting toilet systems rely on <b>mesophilic</b> composting as well as retention time to destroy pathogens. A secondary composting of the endproduct in another system {{is often used to}} [...] "finish" [...] the compost.|$|E
2500|$|Slow {{composting}} toilets [...] {{employ a}} passive approach. Common applications involve modest and often seasonal use, such as [...] remote trail networks. They are typically designed {{such that the}} materials deposited can be isolated from the operational part. The toilet can also be closed to allow further <b>mesophilic</b> composting. Slow composting toilets rely on long retention times for pathogen reduction and for decomposition of excreta or on the combination of time and/or the addition of red wriggler worms for vermi-composting. Worms can be introduced to accelerate composting. Some jurisdictions of the US consider these worms as invasive species.|$|E

Thermophilic digesters are less than 10% of digesters in the world. <b>Mesophilic</b> digesters are used to produce biogas, biofertilizers and sanitarization mainly in tropical countries such as India and Brazil.|$|E
