An alternative proposal is that these structures represent adult stages of the multicellular organisms of this period.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Sif's hair <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> fields of golden wheat, that she {{may be associated with}} fertility, family, wedlock and/or that she is connected to rowan, and that there may be an allusion to her role or possibly her name in the Old English poem Beowulf.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{proposed}} that Sól, as a goddess, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> an extension of an earlier Proto-Indo-European deity due to Indo-European linguistic connections between Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Common Brittonic Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, Latin Sol, and Slavic Tsar Solnitse.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the less}} common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> the remains of {{individuals}} who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E
5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an H <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> high pressure, implying clear skies and relatively warm weather. An L, {{on the other}} hand, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E

5|$|The Asian subspecies, the {{relatively}} large intermedius also differs in structure and voice, and <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> a distinct species.

5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may have witnessed this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E
5|$|There {{were about}} 100 {{reliably}} reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century, compared to about 1,500 from jellyfish stings. Many alleged cases of spider bites <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> incorrect diagnoses, {{which would make}} it more difficult to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites.|$|E

However, if we are prepared to admit (though we should not do) this method of reasoning as valid, I'll {{show that the}} analogy between life and information to the effect that artificial mind <b>may</b> <b>represents</b> an expected advance in the life evolution in Universe seems suggest some type of reductionism of life to information, but biology respectively chemistry or physics are not reductionist, contrary to what seems to be suggested by the analogy between life and information...|$|R

5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> the Moon, {{which would}} be the {{earliest}} depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E

This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> a new undescribed species.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. These <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> two independent polypeptides (such as two parts of a heterodimer), or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.|$|E

5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to suspicions that it <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would {{be shown to be}} a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E
