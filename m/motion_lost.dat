25|$|The last Legislative Council {{meeting that}} Bland {{attended}} was on 11 April 1910. Among the articles for discussion was {{the decision that}} had been made to reduce the Status of Malacca and its head official. Unofficial Member the Hon. T. S.

50|$|Hall was {{an early}} leader of the American Longshoremen's Union in New York City, {{established}} {{with the help of}} British socialist and trade unionist Tom Mann as part of a cross-Atlantic organizing drive for all maritime workers. In 1898, serving as general treasurer of that labor organization, he drew condemnation from delegates to New York City's Central Labor Union because he submitted a motion to oppose opening a Spanish-American War inasmuch as the latter country had agreed to arbitration in the Havana, Cuba, sinking of the battleship Maine. The <b>motion</b> <b>lost</b> by a small margin.|$|E

5000|$|Icing {{and other}} topical anesthetics may {{decrease}} the reflexive activity for {{short period of}} time in order to facilitate motor function. Inhibitory pressure (applying firm pressure over muscle tendon) and promoting body heat retention and rhythmic rotation (slow repeated rotation of affected body part to stimulate relaxation) have also been proposed as potential methods to decrease hypertonia. Aside from static stretch casting, splinting techniques are extremely valuable to extend joint range of <b>motion</b> <b>lost</b> to hypertonicity. [...] A more unconventional method for limiting tone is to deploy quick repeated passive movements to an involved joint in cyclical fashion; this has also been demonstrated to show results on persons without physical disabilities. [...] For a more permanent state of improvement, exercise and patient education is imperative. [...] Isokinetic, aerobic, and strength training exercises should be performed as prescribed by a physiotherapist, and stressful situations that may cause increased tone should be minimized or avoided.|$|E
5000|$|At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Andrássy {{obtained}} the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, {{and he also}} {{obtained the}} right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open {{the way for a}} dash to Salonika that [...] "would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence." [...] "High Austro-Hungarian military authorities desired an... immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective."On 28 September 1878, the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, backed by the Archduke Albert, were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution with his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The <b>motion</b> <b>lost</b> 179 to 95. The gravest accusations were raised by the opposition rank and file against Andrassy.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the reliability, {{validity}} and usefulness of three outcome measures: cervical ranges of motion, sagittal neck muscle strength and presence or absence of the flexion relaxation phenomenon (FRP) in the neck. The literature search included the Index Medicus and computerized database of MEDLINE for relevant material. Articles were selected if they contained primary data on neck range of motion, sagittal muscle strength and FRP. The results of 59 articles and 2 textbooks were analyzed. Normative values of cervical ROM have been reported in healthy subjects ranging in age from 18 to 74 years. The extent of degrees of <b>motion</b> <b>lost</b> per year did not differ between male or female subjects, but females started with higher degrees of active range of motion, which they maintained throughout life. Instrumented methods of recording muscle strength have included strain gauge dynamometers and modified sphygmomanometers. Parameters such as gender, age and stature were also observed to have important effects on muscle strength. The ratio of extension to flexion maximum isometric peak force has been estimated to range between 1. 40 - 1. 70 in normal subjects. Therefore, the extensor muscles of the neck are approximately 40 % stronger then the neck flexor muscles. Evidence suggested that neck pain sufferers have weaker neck flexors than normal subjects. The FRP refers to the absence of myoelectrical activity in extensor muscles upon full forward flexion and has been documented in the cervical spine of asymptomatic subjects. In conclusion, inclinometric methods used for measurements of cervical range of motion were found to be safe, effective and reliable. The Cervical Range of Motion Device appeared to be well suited for clinical practice. The ratio of cervical extension-flexion maximum isometric voluntary contraction has been determined in asymptomatic subjects. The presence of the FRP in the neck has also been observed in normals. Future study is needed to investigate the functional limitations relating to acute and chronic mechanical neck pain which account for a portion of total neck disability...|$|E
