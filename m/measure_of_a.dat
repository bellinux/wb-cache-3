5|$|Like other {{multiplayer}} Xbox 360 titles, Halo 3 uses {{a customized}} version of TrueSkill ranking system for its matchmaking on a per-playlist basis. A linear <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player's {{experience with the}} matchmade portion {{of the game and}} each particular playlist is also tracked (denoted as EXP). To help players have an enjoyable time online, several peace-of-mind features are implemented within easy reach, such as avoid/feedback options on a player's service record, as well as voice chat mute straight from the in-game scoreboard. Like Halo 2, Halo 3 supports downloadable content and updates.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} {{of a star}} determines its spectral type via {{its effect on the}} physical properties of plasma in its photosphere. A star's energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the color index, B−V, which measures the star's magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. This difference in magnitude provides a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star's temperature.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, these roads {{remained}} rudimentary {{and were}} impassible {{in bad weather}} and a nuisance in good weather, which limited the economic possibilities of those regions of Delaware and Maryland. The Good Roads Movement in the 1890s and 1900s spurred investment and advocacy for constructing all-weather roads that connected the population centers of the states, although the instigating forces in each state were different. State agencies in Maryland spearheaded the tasks of studying the issues and recommending increasingly effective courses of action. In Delaware, it was the philanthropic <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> worldly man of one of Delaware's leading families that brought good roads {{to much of the}} state.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{difference}} between optimality and universality. The sequence <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universal test is well studied. To analyze the sequence <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal Martin-Löf test, we introduce uniform Solovay reducibility. Solovay reducibility is <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> relative randomness between two reals. In contrast uniform Solovay reducibility is <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> relative randomness between two sequences of reals. Finally we prove that a sequence is uniform Solovay complete iff it is the sequence <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal Martin-Löf test...|$|R

5|$|Hit points (HP) are a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> character's {{vitality}} {{and health and}} {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E

He and the 2003 Winner Ruben Studdard were both offered recording contracts by RCA Records, and his multi-platinum debut album <b>Measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Man was released in October 2003. He released four more albums on the RCA label: Merry Christmas with Love (2004), A Thousand Different Ways (2006), and the Christmas EP, All is Well (2006).

25|$|Rational {{numbers are}} the {{quotient}} field of integers. Rational expressions are the quotient {{field of the}} polynomials (over some integral domain).

25|$|As {{with all}} other cricket {{statistics}}, batting statistics and records are given much attention and provide a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player's effectiveness. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average.

With a sufficiently high sampling rate (more than about 10kHz), depth electrodes can also measure action potentials. In which case the spatial resolution is down to individual neurons, and the field of view of an individual electrode is approximately 0.05-0.35mm.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} (k, also denoted as λ or κ) is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> material's {{ability to}} conduct heat. Heat transfer across materials of high thermal conductivity occurs {{at a higher}} rate than across materials of low thermal conductivity. In the International System of Units (SI), thermal conductivity is measured in watts per meter Kelvin (W/(m•K)). In the Imperial System of Measurement (British Imperial, or Imperial units), thermal conductivity is measured in Btu/(hr•ft⋅F).|$|E
25|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCOE) is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power source which attempts to compare different methods of electricity generation on a consistent basis. It is an economic assessment of the average total cost to build and operate a power-generating asset over its lifetime divided by the total energy output of the asset over that lifetime. The LCOE can also {{be regarded as the}} average minimum cost at which electricity must be sold in order to break-even over the lifetime of the project.|$|E

25|$|Essence is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> living being's lifeforce. All {{humans and}} metahumans {{start with a}} value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower Essence). It powers magic, and as essence fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of {{substance}} addiction, and other major changes to a being's body can damage its essence as well. Generally, if a being's essence ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an essence rating of zero or less.|$|E
25|$|Betweenness is a {{centrality}} <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertex {{within a}} graph (there is also edge betweenness, {{which is not}} discussed here). Betweenness centrality quantifies {{the number of times}} a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. It was introduced as a measure for quantifying the control of a human on the communication between other humans in a social network by Linton Freeman In his conception, vertices that have a high probability to occur on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen vertices have a high betweenness.|$|E

Many other peaks that are far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of demilitarising Antarctica and its adjacent waters {{is achieved by}} the Antarctic Treaty primarily through the prohibition of 2 ̆ 7 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military nature 2 ̆ 7 and the reservation of the region for peaceful purposes only. 2 These principles may be threatened in the future by: strategic competition within a multipolar world, particularly between China and India as the rising powers of Asia; increased problems with defining 2 ̆ 7 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military nature 2 ̆ 7; and the greater use of bases in Antarctica for scientific research that has utility for military purposes, including possibly for the command and control of offensive weapon systems.
