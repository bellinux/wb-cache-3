25|$|Diethylstilbestrol is a nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} that is {{no longer}} used medically. It {{is a member of the}} stilbestrol group. Other stilbestrol estrogens that have been used clinically include benzestrol, dienestrol, dienestrol acetate, diethylstilbestrol dipropionate, fosfestrol, hexestrol, and methestrol dipropionate. Chlorotrianisene, <b>methallenestril,</b> and doisynoestrol are nonsteroidal estrogens structurally distinct from the stilbestrols that have also been used clinically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methallenestril</b> (INN) (brand names Cur-men, Ercostrol, Geklimon, Novestrine, Vallestril), {{also known}} as methallenoestril (BAN) and as methallenestrol, as well as Horeau's acid, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} and a derivative of allenolic acid and allenestrol (specifically, a methyl ether of it) that was formerly used to treat menstrual issues but is now no longer marketed. It is a seco-analogue of bisdehydrodoisynolic acid, and although <b>methallenestril</b> is potently estrogenic in rats, in humans it is only weakly so in comparison. Vallestril was a brand of <b>methallenestril</b> issued by G. D. Searle & Company in the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|Allenestrol, or allenoestrol, {{also known}} as α,α-dimethyl-β-ethylallenolic acid or as methallenestrilphenol, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} and a derivative of allenolic acid that was never marketed. A methyl ether of allenestrol, <b>methallenestril</b> (methallenestrol), is also an estrogen, but, in contrast to allenestrol, has been marketed.|$|E
50|$|Doisynolic acid is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogens with high oral activity. The synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogens <b>methallenestril,</b> fenestrel, and carbestrol were all derived from doisynolic acid and are seco analogues of the compound. Doisynoestrol, also known as fenocycline, is cis-bisdehydrdoisynolic acid methyl ether, and is another estrogenic derivative.|$|E

50|$|Allenolic acid, or allenoic acid, is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} {{discovered in}} 1947 or 1948 that, although studied clinically, was never marketed. It is an open-ring or seco analogue of steroidal estrogens like estrone and equilenin. The compound {{was named after}} Dr. Edgar Allen, {{one of the pioneers}} in estrogen research. Although described as an estrogen, allenolic acid probably is totally inactive at the receptor, whereas a derivative, allenestrol (α,α-dimethyl-β-ethylallenolic acid), is reported to be a potent estrogen. Another derivative of allenolic acid (specifically 6-methoxy-allenestrol), <b>methallenestril</b> (brand name Vallestril), is also a potent estrogen and, in contrast to allenolic acid and allenestrol, has been marketed.|$|E
