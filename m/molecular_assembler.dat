5000|$|He was {{an outspoken}} skeptic {{of the idea}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers,</b> as {{advocated}} by K. Eric Drexler.

500|$|The {{debate has}} {{received}} technical criticism as well. Steven A. Edwards in The Nanotech Pioneers {{noted that the}} ambiguity of the specifications and even definition of a <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler</b> makes {{an evaluation of the}} argument difficult and minimizes its scientific implications. He remarked that [...] "nowhere in it does Nanosystems contain a blueprint for a <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler...</b> We are told, for instance, that a manipulator arm would involve 4,000,000 atoms, but we are not told which atoms, or how they would be put together." [...] He concludes that [...] "the debate over mechanosynthesis so far is huge to the participants, but mainly an entertaining academic diversion to most nanotechnologists." ...|$|E
500|$|Drexler's {{vision of}} nanotechnology, now called {{molecular}} nanotechnology, {{is based on}} the concept of the <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler,</b> a molecular machine which would manufacture molecules and molecular devices atom-by-atom. Drexler drew a distinction between wet nanotechnology based on biological systems, and [...] "second-generation" [...] dry nanotechnology which would be based on mechanosynthesis, positional control of molecules through principles more related to mechanical engineering. Drexler and his followers have focused almost exclusively on the latter form of molecular nanotechnology, but Drexler has stated that both are valid pathways to creating molecular machine systems.|$|E
500|$|He {{referenced}} {{the idea}} of a <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler,</b> a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of {{how long it would take}} such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material, but self-replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a grey goo scenario, or, referring to Bill Joy's previous article [...] "Why the future doesn't need us", that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense.|$|E

50|$|One {{potential}} {{scenario that}} has been envisioned is out-of-control self-replicating <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> {{in the form of}} grey goo which consumes carbon to continue its replication. If unchecked such mechanical replication could potentially consume whole ecoregions or the whole Earth (ecophagy), or it could simply outcompete natural lifeforms for necessary resources such as carbon, ATP, or UV light (which some nanomotor examples run on). However, the ecophagy and 'grey goo' scenarios, like synthetic <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers,</b> are based upon still-hypothetical technologies that have not yet been demonstrated experimentally.|$|R

5000|$|Molecular {{assemblers}} are {{a popular}} topic in science fiction, for example, the matter compiler in The Diamond Age and the cornucopia machine in Singularity Sky. The replicator in Star Trek {{might also be}} considered a <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler.</b> A <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler</b> is also {{a key element of}} the plot of the computer game Deus Ex (called a [...] "universal constructor" [...] in the game).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler,</b> {{as defined}} by K. Eric Drexler, is a [...] "proposed device able to guide {{chemical}} reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision". A <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler</b> {{is a kind of}} molecular machine. Some biological molecules such as ribosomes fit this definition. This is because they receive instructions from messenger RNA and then assemble specific sequences of amino acids to construct protein molecules. However, the term [...] "molecular assembler" [...] usually refers to theoretical human-made devices.|$|E
2500|$|Smalley criticized Drexler's work on {{nanotechnology}} as naive, {{arguing that}} chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions {{are hard to}} control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. [...] Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" [...] and the [...] "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> being able to precisely select and place individual atoms.

50|$|Beginning in 2007, the British Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has funded {{development}} of ribosome-like <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers.</b> Clearly, <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> are possible in this limited sense. A technology roadmap project, {{led by the}} Battelle Memorial Institute and hosted by several U.S. National Laboratories has explored a range of atomically precise fabrication technologies, including both early-generation and longer-term prospects for programmable molecular assembly; the report was released in December, 2007. In 2008 the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council provided funding of 1.5 million pounds over six years for research working towards mechanized mechanosynthesis, {{in partnership with the}} Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, amongst others.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} debate, Eric Drexler and Richard Smalley have {{discussed}} the chemical and physical possibility of constructing <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> - devices that guide chemical reactions by placing, with atomic precision, reactive molecules. Drexler insisted on the mechanical feasibility of such assemblers, whereas Smalley resisted the idea that such devices could be chemically constructed, {{because we do not}} have the required control. Underlying the debate, there are differences regarding the appropriate goals, methods, and theories of nanotechnology, and the appropriate way of conceptualizing <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers.</b> Not surprisingly, incommensurability emerges. In this paper, I assess the main features of the debate, the levels of the emerging incommensurability, and indicate one way in which the debate could be decided...|$|R

50|$|After a 16-year {{absence from}} the Jensen Project, a secret {{community}} of scientists conducting advanced underground experiments to resolve the world's problems, Matt (Brady Smith) and Claire Thompson (Kellie Martin) are asked {{to come back and}} stop Edwin Jensen (David Andrews) from using nanobots to take over other people. To create these nanobots, Edwin needs a <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler,</b> which he steals. With the help of Kendrick James (LeVar Burton), Ginny (Mylène Dinh-Robic) and Ingrid Jensen (Patricia Richardson), Matt and Claire use chemical traces of gold and silicon to track down the location of the assembler. They are misled, but Brody (Justin Kelly), and his new friend from the Project, Samantha (Alyssa Diaz), manage to trace Edwin through a voice tracker and retrieve the <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler.</b> Brody is caught and implanted with nanobots. Edwin threatens to kill Brody with the nanobots if the <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler</b> is not returned to him.

50|$|This protein {{flexibility}} {{allows the}} construction of biological machines. The first useful applications of these biological machines might be in nanomedicine. For example, they {{could be used to}} identify and destroy cancer cells. Molecular nanotechnology is a speculative subfield of nanotechnology regarding the possibility of engineering <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers,</b> biological machines which could re-order matter at a molecular or atomic scale. Nanomedicine would make use of these nanorobots, introduced into the body, to repair or detect damages and infections. Molecular nanotechnology is highly theoretical, seeking to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield and to propose an agenda for future inquiry. The proposed elements of molecular nanotechnology, such as <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> and nanorobots are far beyond current capabilities.|$|R
5000|$|One {{method to}} {{building}} <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> is to mimic evolutionary processes employed by biological systems. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation combined with culling of the less-successful variants and {{reproduction of the}} more-successful variants. Production of complex <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> might be evolved from simpler systems since [...] "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked[...] [...] [...] A complex system designed from scratch never works {{and can not be}} patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works." [...] However, most published safety guidelines include"recommendations against developing ... replicator designs which permit surviving mutation or undergoing evolution".|$|R
5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers,</b> which are <b>molecular</b> machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of <b>molecular</b> <b>assemblers</b> was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|R
5000|$|... "Molecular assemblers" [...] {{have been}} {{confused}} with self-replicating machines. To produce a practical quantity of a desired product, the nanoscale {{size of a}} typical science fiction universal <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler</b> requires an extremely large number of such devices. However, a single such theoretical <b>molecular</b> <b>assembler</b> might be programmed to self-replicate, constructing many copies of itself. This would allow an exponential rate of production. Then after sufficient quantities of the molecular assemblers were available, they would then be re-programmed for production of the desired product. However, if self-replication of molecular assemblers were not restrained then it might lead to competition with naturally occurring organisms. This has been called ecophagy or the grey goo problem.|$|E
