40|$|Reverse cycle {{defrosting}} is {{the most}} widely used standard defrosting method for air source heat pump (ASHP) units. It was suggested in previous experimental studies that downwards flowing of the melted frost over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit has negative effects on reverse cycle defrosting performance. To quantitatively study the negative effects, an experimental study and a modeling study on draining away locally the melted frost for an experimental ASHP unit with a three-circuit outdoor coil were carried out and separately reported. However, for exiting ASHP units, it is hardly possible to install water collecting trays between circuits. To alleviate uneven defrosting for a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an existing ASHP unit, an effective alternative is to vary the heat supply to each refrigerant circuit by varying the opening values of modulating valves installed at an inlet pipe to each circuit. In this paper, a modeling study on varying heat (via refrigerant) supply to each refrigerant circuit in a three-circuit outdoor coil to alleviate uneven defrosting is reported. Finally, in the designed three study cases, defrosting energy use could be decreased to 94. 6 %, as well as a reduction of 7 s in defrosting duration by fully closing the <b>modulating</b> <b>valve</b> on the top circuit when its defrosting terminated.

40|$|De-swirl nozzles are {{sometimes}} used in turbomachinery {{to reduce the}} pressure drop when air is drawn radially inwards through a rotating cavity. However, {{this can lead to}} non-unique steady state solutions with operating conditions achieved depending on how the steady point is approached. In the present study, a transient, 1 D model of flow in a rotating cavity has been created. The model allows the vortex profile to change with through flow rate, and links this to estimates of disk windage, tangential velocity and, consequently, the vortex pressure gradient. The model was applied to the simulation of de-swirl nozzle fed, rotating cavities with radial inflow. The steady vortex flow characteristics (non-dimensional flow versus pressure ratio) predicted by the model were validated for 2 distinct cases. For a smooth rectangular cavity the flow characteristic was predicted using the model's default parameters. For an engine-representative case with nonaxisymmetric geometric features, the flow characteristic of the cavity was reproduced with some alignment of the model. The transient model reproduced experimentally observed hysteresis, discontinuity in operating characteristics, and regions where no steady-state solution could be found. A transient model is required as a steady state model would choose one of the possible solutions without physical justification. In the case of the engine-representative rig, part of the flow characteristic could not be obtained in testing. This is determined to be due to the interaction of the negative resistance region of the vortex and the flow <b>modulating</b> <b>valve</b> characteristic.

40|$|The use of {{pressure}} control to reduce leakage is well known. The benefit is significantly increased if pressures are controlled {{in response to}} changes in demand or flow. To achieve this, {{it is necessary to}} enable the pressure controller to sense both flows and the corresponding pressures, thereby avoiding unnecessarily high system pressures. In the implementation of a pressure management scheme for leakage reduction, both steady state and dynamic aspects should be considered. The steady state aspects ensure that the set-points of a pressure reducing valve (PRV) are changed according to an optimal profile so as to minimize background leakage and to satisfy pressure requirements at critical points. The dynamic aspects ensure that excessive pressure changes (oscillations) caused by interactions between <b>modulating</b> <b>valves</b> and transients in water networks are not generated across the distribution networks. This paper will focus on the dynamic aspects {{of pressure}} control. A new control scheme is presented to achieve fully flow modulated dynamic pressure control. The proposed controller is based essentially on a PRV dynamic model, and the flow modulated pressure control is achieved using both pressure and flow information. Computer simulations are carried out to illustrate the operation and performance of the new controller. The simulation results show that the performance of the resulting PRV for pressure regulation is comparable with that of a recently proposed PID controlled PRV. The new scheme simplifies the controller design process and also gives better performance for flow modulated pressure control...|$|R

40|$|Servovalves are compact, accurate, high {{bandwidth}} <b>modulating</b> <b>valves</b> {{widely used in}} aerospace, defence, industrial and marine applications. However, manufacturing costs are high due to high part count and tight tolerances required, particularly {{in the first stage}} of the valve, and due to manual adjustments required as part of the setup process. In this research, a novel servovalve concept is investigated which {{has the potential to be}} more cost effective. In particular, for the first time a piezoelectric first stage actuator is developed to move a servovalve spool using the deflector jet principle; this is especially suited to aerospace actuation requirements. In the new valve the conventional electromagnetic torque motor is replaced by a multi-layer bimorph piezo-actuator. The bimorph deflects a jet of fluid to create a pressure differential across the valve spool; hence the spool moves. A feedback wire is used to facilitate proportional spool position control via mechanical feedback. The bimorph is directly coupled to the feedback wire and is immersed in hydraulic fluid. A high order nonlinear model of the valve has been developed and used to predict valve static and dynamic characteristics, and is described in this paper. This makes use of stiffness constants derived analytically for the bimorph-feedback wire assembly and cross-referenced to finite element (FE) analysis predictions. The model of the flow force acting on the deflector is an approximation of the force characteristic found from computation fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. The measured characteristics of the prototype valve are in good agreement with the simulation results, and prove that the operational concept is viable...|$|R

40|$|The {{aortic valve}} {{is a highly}} dynamic {{structure}} responding to actively to the chemical, mechanical and physical cues of the valve microenvironment. Valve interstitial cells are dispersed throughout the valve tissue and {{play an important role}} in maintaining the integrity and optimum function of the valve.

The effect of mechanical loading and chemical modulators on the behavior of the valve interstitial cells have largely been studied. However the role of valve interstitial cell shape as an intrinsic physical cue on cell behavior has not been considered yet. Based on the actively responsive nature of the valve interstitial cells and the evidence of the relationship between cellular shape and behavior for the other types of cells, we decided to investigate the effects of valve interstitial cells shape on the contractile function and phenotype modulation. Various cell shapes were designed by constraining the cells into different line/pattern widths (10 Âµm, 20 Âµm, 40 Âµm, 60 Âµm, and 80 Âµm) using soft lithographic techniques. Cells were aligned into the lines exhibiting varied cytoskeletal organizations. Orientation of the actin filaments significantly decreased with increasing the pattern width. A similar trend was observed for the cell aspect ratio and nuclear eccentricity. Contractile function of the cells was examined utilizing a custom valavular thin film assay. All the films of the tissue construct responded to the vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory drugs. Cellular maximum contraction did not reveal any specific trend while cell basal tone had some statistical variations showing the maximum value for 40 Âµm in which cell-cell contact and cell elongation may have interacted optimally. Analysis of the contractile and activated phenotype markers was performed using western blot on vimentin, Î±-smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The expression of these proteins did not change significantly for the patterns suggesting that the cell contractility may be more correlated to the cell shape than phenotype. In conclusion we were able to <b>modulate</b> <b>valve</b> interstitial cellular shape using soft lithographic techniques and cause alterations in cellular function.

One technique that has shown promise is impurity seeding, i. e., the injection of low-Z gaseous impurities (typically N 2 or Ne) to radiate and dissipate the power before it arrives to the divertor target plate. To this end, the Alcator C-Mod team has created a first-of-its-kind feedback system to control the injection of seed gas based on real-time surface heat flux measurements. Surface thermocouples provide real-time measurements of the surface temperature response to the plasma heat flux. The surface temperature measurements are inputted into an analog computer that "solves" the 1 -D heat transport equation to deliver accurate, real-time signals of the surface heat flux.

This is due to the small operational window for mitigated heat flux in the parameters of incident plasma heat flux, plasma density, and impurity density as well as the relatively slow response of the impurity gas injection system compared to plasma transients. Given the severe consequences for failure of such a system to operate reliably in a reactor, there is substantial risk that the conventional vertical target plate divertor will not provide an adequately controllable system in reactor-class devices.

Having a bicuspid aortic valve is the highest risk factor for developing calcification; it undergoes increased strain due to asymmetrical leaflet geometry. This investigation presents the mechanisms in which cyclic stretch affects inflammatory and osteogenic pathways of aortic valve disease. We show that human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) exposed to stretch express increased matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and interleukins (ILs), activate macrophages, and upregulate family members in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF[Beta]) signaling cascade. Multiple microRNAs are implicated to <b>modulate</b> aortic <b>valve</b> disease.

There are two conventional methods which are normally employed to achieve control through this intermediate temperature range: (1) single-pass flow where control {{is achieved by}} alternately pulsing hot gaseous nitrogen (GN 2) and cold LN 2 into the feed line to yield the setpoint temperature; and (2) closed-loop circulation where control is achieved by either electrically heating or LN 2 cooling the circulating GN 2 to yield the setpoint temperature. A third method, using a mass flow ratio controller along with <b>modulating</b> control <b>valves</b> on GN 2 and LN 2 lines, provides excellent control but equipment for this method is expensive and cost-prohibitive for all but long-term continuous processes. The single-pass method provides marginal control and can result in unexpected overcooling of the test article from even a short pulse of LN 2. The closed-loop circulation method provides excellent control but requires an expensive blower capable of operating at elevated pressures and cryogenic temperatures. Where precise control is needed (plus or minus 2 C), single-pass flow systems typically have not provided the precision required, primarily because of overcooling temperature excursions. Where several individual circuits are to be controlled at different temperatures, the use of expensive cryogenic blowers for each circuit is also cost-prohibitive, especially for short duration of one-of-a-kind tests.
