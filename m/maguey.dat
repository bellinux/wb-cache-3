5|$|Insects used in food include {{honey bee}} larvae and pupae, mopani worms, silkworms, <b>Maguey</b> worms, Witchetty grubs, crickets, {{grasshoppers}} and locusts. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, producing some 7,500 tons per year.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of pulque {{is complex and}} required {{the death of the}} <b>maguey</b> plant. As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to send up a single flower stalk, which may reach up to 20 feet in height. However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18inches in diameter. In this center, the <b>maguey</b> sap, known as aguamiel (honeywater), collects. It takes a <b>maguey</b> plant 12 years to mature enough to produce the sap for pulque.|$|E
25|$|In {{the state}} of Hidalgo, in which most <b>maguey</b> is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most <b>maguey</b> plants here serve as {{boundary}} markers between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An estimated 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the lower leaves for barbacoa or destroying them completely {{to look for the}} edible white grubs or ant eggs that can inhabit them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>maguey</b> plant, {{also called}} a “century plant” in English, {{is native to}} Mexico. It grows best in the cold, dry climates of the rocky central {{highlands}} {{to the north and}} east of Mexico City, especially in the states of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala. <b>Maguey</b> has been cultivated at least since 200 CE in Tula, Tulancingo and Teotihuacan, and wild plants have been exploited for far longer. The plant historically has had a number of uses. Fibers can be extracted from the thick leaves to make rope or fabric, its thorns can be used as needles or punches and the membrane covering the leaves can be used as paper or for cooking. The name <b>maguey</b> was given by the Spanish, who picked it up from the Taíno. This is still its common name in Spanish, with Agave being its scientific generic or technical name. The Nahuatl name of the plant is metl.|$|E
25|$|Aztec {{teachers}} (tlamatimine) propounded a spartan {{regime of}} education – cold baths in the morning, hard work, physical punishment, bleeding with <b>maguey</b> thorns and endurance tests – {{with the purpose}} of forming a stoical people.|$|E
25|$|In the {{municipal}} market {{one can find}} tlacoyos, quesadillas made with squash flowers, mushrooms, barbacoa, mixiote, mole and pulque. In season, {{a number of other}} unusual dishes are served such as <b>maguey</b> larvae, chinicuiles, escamoles and snails.|$|E
25|$|Tlacolula is a {{small city}} east of the state capital. It is also known for various cottage {{industries}} especially the production of mezcal and wrought iron, but also for some textiles. While mezcal is produced all over Oaxaca, Tlacolula is considered the center of production. The beverage is made from various types of <b>maguey</b> plant such as tobalá, espadín and arroquense, either found wild or cultivated. The drink comes {{in a number of}} varieties, depending on the <b>maguey</b> used, the roasting and fermentation processes used and the aging. Although not all types use it, the “worm” in the bottle (really a larva) is associated with mezcal, not tequila. Mezcal is bottled straight or combined with flavorings to create cream style liquors.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{distilled}} drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spanish Conquest. The Spaniards were introduced to native fermented drinks such as pulque, made from the <b>maguey</b> plant. Soon, the conquistadors began experimenting with the agave plant {{to find a way}} to make a distillable fermented mash. The result was mezcal.|$|E
25|$|Los Mudos (The Mute) {{takes its}} name from the fact that {{participants}} are forbidden to speak during the ceremony and in some cases throughout the festival. The costume is feminine in appearance using rustic wigs made of <b>maguey</b> fibers braided with ribbons of many colors. This dance is common among the Nahuas in Guerrero.|$|E
25|$|Most {{leatherwork}} can {{be found}} in Ejutla de Crespo and Jalatlaco, whose products are exported to other countries. Notable pieces include scabbards for machetes, saddles, wallets, belts, portfolios and more. The leather is made from the skins of local animals. Leather pieces such as belts and bags {{can be found}} embroidered with ixtle fiber, which is extracted from <b>maguey</b> leaves.|$|E
25|$|When Mara died at sea in 1861, {{there were}} {{inheritance}} problems yet again, with Thomas Gillow receiving the Chautla Hacienda. He sold off {{a small portion}} of the estate in 1870, the first lands to be separated. When Thomas died in 1877, the remaining lands were inherited by Eulogio. Under Eulogio, the hacienda specialized in wheat and <b>maguey</b> production, and he worked to introduce modern technology and organizational methods.|$|E
25|$|Ixtle (<b>maguey)</b> fiber {{is still}} worked to create {{utilitarian}} {{items such as}} knapsacks and carrying bags, which in Santa Cruz Tanaco and Tarecuato are generally undyed. In Pómaro, Ostula, el Naranjito and Cachán the same fiber is used for larger bags used to carry pitchers and cobs. Ixtle thread {{is also used to}} embroider leather items such as hats, bridles, reigns, cinches. In Paracho, this fiber is dyed before being worked.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipal}} {{market is}} located a bit further south {{at the intersection}} of Jesus Cardozo and Rivapalacio Streets. The market mostly sells staple products for local consumption. It also contains food stands which sell local and regional specialties such as barbacoa, mole, quelites (a name for various types of edible greens), and dishes which contains local specialty ingredients such as wild mushrooms, escamoles, <b>maguey</b> flowers, ant eggs and “cupiches” (a kind of butterfly larvae).|$|E
25|$|The {{regulations}} have been controversial, {{not only from}} small artisanal producers for whom the cost of certification is prohibitive, but also from traditional producers outside the chosen GI states. Not only are the latter prohibited from calling their product Mezcal, under the new regulation NOM 199 issued in late 2015, they must label it Komil, a little-known word for intoxicating drink from the Nahuatl language, and must not list the varieties of agave and <b>maguey</b> that are used.|$|E
25|$|Pulque, or octli is an {{alcoholic}} beverage {{made from the}} fermented juice of the <b>maguey,</b> and is a traditional native beverage of Mesoamerica. Though commonly {{believed to be a}} beer, the main carbohydrate is a complex form of fructose rather than starch. Pulque is depicted in Native American stone carvings from as early as AD 200. The origin of pulque is unknown, but because it has a major position in religion, many folk tales explain its origins.|$|E
25|$|Another {{quarter of}} the economy is from {{agriculture}} with corn and wheat as the principal crops, along with barley, beans and fava beans. Other crops include apples, peaches, pulque <b>maguey,</b> pears, and capulin. Livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and domestic fowl accounts for about five percent. It is the major source of income for a number of communities. There is still some very limited mining of copper, zinc, lead, iron, silver and gold, with some food processing and metal products.|$|E
25|$|Self-sacrifice {{was also}} quite common; people would offer <b>maguey</b> thorns, tainted {{with their own}} blood and would offer blood from their tongues, ear lobes, or genitals. Blood held a central place in Mesoamerican cultures. The 16th-century Florentine Codex by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún reports that {{in one of the}} {{creation}} myths, Quetzalcóatl offered blood extracted from a wound in his own genitals to give life to humanity. There are several other myths in which Nahua gods offer their blood to help humanity.|$|E
25|$|Traditional barbacoa {{involves}} {{digging a}} hole in the ground and placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so the juices can be used to make a broth. It is then covered with <b>maguey</b> leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the Mosquito People (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.|$|E
25|$|The Mezquital Valley has best {{preserved}} the state’s indigenous, especially Otomi, culinary heritage based {{a number of}} traditional native animal and vegetable products. One {{of these is the}} use of a number of edible insects, many of which are considered delicacies such as escamoles (ant eggs) and <b>maguey</b> larvae as well as others such as larvae found on nopal plants, “chacas” (beetles) and “chicharras” (cicadas). Other local animals still used for food include tadpoles (called atepocates), salamanders and their larvae, squirrels and rabbits. Plant species still commonly used include mesquite beans, nopal and other cactus, and various cactus fruit such as “tunas” (cactus pears) and “xoconostle.” These are often prepared in dishes that the state shares with {{most of the rest of}} Mexico such as tacos, tamales, moles and a specialty of central Mexico, mixiote. Another common central Mexican dish popular in the state is barbacoa. This dish has its origins in the pre-Hispanic period, when it was meat cooked in an underground pit. Today, it is most often cooked in pots in more conventional ovens, but the meat, today mostly pork, is still smothered in the alcoholic beverage pulque and wrapped in <b>maguey</b> leaves for flavor. This preparation of barbacoa is considered to be the state dish.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} pre-Conquest era, the Aztecs had absorbed {{many of the}} crafts and trades traditions from the Toltecs, Mixtecs, Zapotecs and the Maya. In some of his writings, Hernán Cortés {{describes}} the myriad of handcrafted goods available in Tenochtitlan’s markets such as textiles, feather art, containers made with gourds and objects made of precious metals. Bernardino de Sahagún describes the various items made from the <b>maguey</b> plant, {{the wide variety of}} pottery, as well as about the privileged place that artisans held in the native social hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|Because the apparition, and the purportedly miraculous {{transposition}} of the Virgin's image onto Diego's tilma ("mantle") of ayatl, or <b>maguey</b> cloth, {{are largely}} {{credited with the}} conversion of the Native American Mexica (Aztecs) and other peoples of Mexico to Roman Catholicism, all documents pertaining to the alleged miracle {{have been the subject of}} the intense scrutiny of the Roman Catholic Church, the colonial Spanish Crown (and after 1820, the Mexican government), scholars of Latin American religion and history, scholars of classical Nahuatl, as well as independent Guadalupanos, skeptics, and historians the world over.|$|E
25|$|Most of the municipality’s {{territory}} {{is dedicated to}} agriculture. Major crops include barley, corn, sorghum, wheat, <b>maguey,</b> and various vegetables. Orchards also exist there producing capulins, peaches, pears, figs, plums, white sapote, tejocotes and apricots. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. The second most important economic activity is industry, producing processed foods, drinks, tobacco products and leather goods. Mining is limited to gravel, sand and other construction materials. There are small deposits of gold, silver, copper, quartz and mercury, {{but they have not}} been exploited. Most mines are located near the communities of San Pedro Tepetitlan and Xometla. Commerce is mostly limited to serving local needs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 20,000 {{hectares}} of forest {{which can be}} cut and include species such as pine, oyamel, juniper, white cedar and red cedar, oak, poplar, strawberry trees, mesquite and more. In areas without logging, {{there are a number}} of species of plants with medicinal properties, including wild oregano, cat´s claws and more, which produce a harvest of about 500 tons per year. Wild foodstuffs include <b>maguey,</b> nopal cactus, pitayo fruit, yuccas and more, which usually give a more abundant harvest once every four years. Wild herbs area generally harvested between August and November. Another product is the production of willow branches, which is supplied as raw material to communities such as Tequisquiapan for crafts.|$|E
25|$|When the Spanish arrived, {{they noted}} the {{production}} of codices and paper, which was also made from <b>maguey</b> and palm fibers as well as bark. It was specifically noted by Pedro Mártir de Anglería. After the Conquest, indigenous paper, especially bark paper lost its value as a tribute item {{not only because the}} Spanish preferred European paper but also because bark paper's connection to indigenous religion caused it to be banned. The justification for the banning of amate was that it was used for magic and witchcraft. This was part of the Spaniard's efforts to mass convert the indigenous to Catholicism, which included the mass burning of codices, which contained most of the native history as well as cultural and natural knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Two {{other very}} {{important}} pre Hispanic handcrafts are textiles and ceramics, whose artisans {{could also be}} full-time and enjoy fairly high status. Purépecha weavers worked with white and brown cotton, {{as well as a}} rougher fiber from the <b>maguey</b> plant called ixtle. According to the Relación de Michoacán, an early colonial period document that describes Purépecha life before the Conquest, textile work was the purview of women, with skills passed down from generation to generation. The richest fabric had feathers or rabbit fur woven into the cotton, and pure white cloth was an easily traded commodity, used as a form of currency. Dyes were from natural sources such as insects and plants, and common colors included blue, black and red. Finished textile goods included shirts, caps, dresses, threads for tying headdresses and doublets worn by warriors.|$|E
25|$|The {{altitude}} {{varies from}} between 850 to 2,700 meters above sea level, {{with the town}} of San Miguel at 1910 masl. The municipality extends over two of the state's natural regions: the Sierras Volcanicas and the Cuencas Lacustres del Sur, {{with most of the}} territory over the latter. The entire municipality belongs to the national Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Most of the territory inclines gently from between zero and five percent, with some exceptions where inclines can be as high as 25%. This restricts urban development and agriculture in the area. Prominent elevations include Cerro La Silleta, Cerro Prieto, Cerro La Piena, Cerro La Campana, El Cerro de El Picacho, Tambula, El <b>Maguey,</b> Palo Colorado, Mesa el Peñón, Loma Cuacuato, Mesa la Junta, Loma La Trinidad, Cerro El Común, La Loma, El Cuache and El Carmen. These have an average altitude of 2,200 masl.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} generates about 29,000 jobs {{directly and}} indirectly. Certified production amounts {{to more than}} 2 million liters; 434,000 liters are exported, generating 21 million dollars in income. To truly be called mezcal, the liquor must come from certain areas. States that have certified mezcal agave growing areas with production facilities are Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas. About 30 species of agave are certified {{for use in the}} production of mezcal. Oaxaca has 570 of the 625 mezcal production facilities in Mexico, but some in-demand mezcals come from Guerrero, as well. In Tamaulipas, 11 municipalities have received authorization to produce authentic mezcal with the hopes of competing for a piece of both the Mexican national and international markets. The agave used here is agave Americano, agave verde or <b>maguey</b> de la Sierra, which are native to the state.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the land}} from the haciendas were broken up from 1915 to 1930 and made into communally held lands called ejidos. While the initial {{declarations}} were made in 1915, their implementation was delayed until 1930. These ejidos include Extortas, Rio Blanco, Las Enramadas, Peña Blanco, San Lorenzo, La Plazuela, <b>Maguey</b> Verde, El Pilón, Los Encinos, Agua Fria, Molinitos de Orozco, El Portugues, Camargo, La Higuera, El Tequizquite and San Isidro Boquillas. In 1936, much of the Peñamiller area was reformed as the Villa Zapata delegation of the municipality of Tolimán. In 1936, a rebel group led by Taurino López burned the municipal archives of Peñamiller. However, this rebel leader was found the next day hanged. The main church {{of the town of}} Peñamiller became a parish in 1937, and then it was named as head of its own municipality in 1941.|$|E
25|$|Another major craft {{category}} is textiles. Textiles from cotton and other fibers date to {{early in the}} pre-Hispanic period on backstrap looms. This form of weaving {{has been dominated by}} women since that time. The Spanish introduced the wide European frame loom, which is mostly used by men. Traditional clothing items such as huipils are still made on backstrap looms, while the European looms are used to produce larger and heavier items such as rugs, ponchos and blankets. Most items are produced with cotton or wool fibers, although some <b>maguey</b> fibers can be found and palm fronds are used to produce mats and hats. Embroidery {{is an important part of}} indigenous clothing, especially for women. One municipality noted for its indigenous and embroidered clothing is Santo Tomás Jalietza, just south of the city of Oaxaca. The Xochimilco neighborhood of the capital is known for its embroidered tablecloths, napkins and other tableware.|$|E
25|$|However, paper {{also had}} a sacred aspect and was used in rituals along with other items such as incense, copal, <b>maguey</b> thorns and rubber. For {{ceremonial}} and religious events, bark paper was used in various ways: as decorations used in fertility rituals, yiataztli, a kind of bag, and as an amatetéuitl, a badge used to symbolize a prisoner's soul after sacrifice. It was also used to dress idols, priests and sacrifice victims in forms of crowns, stoles, plumes, wigs, trusses and bracelets. Paper items such as flags, skeletons and very long papers, up {{to the length of}} a man, were used as offerings, often by burning them. Another important paper item for rituals was paper cut in the form of long flags or trapezoids and painted with black rubber spots to depict the characteristic of the god being honored. At a certain time of year, these were also used to ask for rain. At this time, the papers were colored blue with plumage at the spearhead.|$|E
25|$|Among the Aztecs, the god Xolotl was {{a monstrous}} dog. During the {{creation}} of the Fifth Sun, Xolotl was hunted by Death and escaped him by transforming himself first into a sprout of maize, then into <b>maguey</b> leaves and finally as a salamander in a pool of water. The third time that Death found Xolotl, he trapped and killed him. Three important foodstuffs were produced from the body of this mythological dog. Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Dead, had the bones of man in the underworld, kept over from the previous creations. Xolotl descended to the underworld to steal these bones so that man could be reborn in the new creation of the Fifth Sun. Xolotl managed to recover the bones and brought man to life by piercing his penis and bleeding upon them. Xolotl was seen as an incarnation of the planet Venus as the Evening Star (the Morning Star was his twin brother Quetzalcoatl). Xolotl was the canine companion of the Sun, following its path through both the sky and the underworld. Xolotl's strong connection with the underworld, death and the dead is demonstrated by the symbols he bore. In the Codex Borbonicus Xolotl is pictured with a knife in his mouth, a symbol of death, and has black wavy hair like the hair worn by the gods of death.|$|E
2500|$|Still another {{hypothesis}} offers that it {{is derived}} from Mectli, the goddess of <b>maguey.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a saying}} in Oaxaca, [...] "Para todo mal, mezcal, para todo bien, también" [...] (For {{everything}} bad, mezcal; for everything good, too.) Alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks (as well as food items) {{based on the}} <b>maguey</b> plant have been consumed {{in many parts of}} Mexico since early in the pre-Hispanic period. The tradition of the making of the distilled liquor called mezcal has been a strong tradition in the Oaxacan highlands since the colonial period. One reason for this is the quality and varieties of <b>maguey</b> grown here. Some varieties, such as espadín and arroquense are cultivated but one variety called tobalá is still made with wild <b>maguey</b> plants. It is made with the heart of the plant which is roasted in pits (giving the final product a smokey flavor) and is sometimes flavored with a chicken or turkey breast added to the mash. It is mezcal, not tequila, and may contain a [...] "worm," [...] which is really a larva that infests <b>maguey</b> plants. The final distilled product can be served as is or can be flavored (called cremas) with almonds, coffee, cocoa fruits and other flavors.|$|E
2500|$|Fertility. Formative period ballplayer figurines—most likely females—often wear maize icons. [...] At El Tajín, the ballplayer {{sacrifice}} {{ensures the}} renewal of pulque, an alcoholic <b>maguey</b> cactus beverage.|$|E
2500|$|Pulque is a milk-colored, {{somewhat}} {{viscous liquid}} {{that produces a}} light foam. [...] It is made by fermenting the sap of certain types of <b>maguey</b> (agave) plants. In contrast, mezcal is made from the cooked heart of certain agave plants, and tequila, a variety of mezcal, is made all or mostly from the blue agave. About six varieties of <b>maguey</b> are best used {{for the production of}} pulque. The name pulque is derived from Nahuatl. The original name of the drink was iztāc octli [...] (white pulque), the term pulque was probably mistakenly derived by the Spanish from the octli poliuhqui , which meant [...] "spoiled pulque".|$|E
2500|$|Pulque is a milky, foamy, {{alcoholic}} beverage native to central Mexico and made from fermented <b>maguey</b> sap, similar to tequila and mescal {{but with a}} much lower alcohol content, between 3 and 4%. The <b>maguey</b> plant flourishes in hot climates with little to no water, as the plant stores water very well, much like a cactus. The <b>maguey</b> grows slowly and the sap must be removed shortly before the plant flowers. Once the tapping begins, the plant produces [...] "about a half gallon [...] a day for three months." [...] With a tool {{that looks like a}} spoon and is called a tlaquiche, a worker known as a tlachiquero [...] "scrapes off the center of the plant to extract the liquid previously mentioned. He then collects it in a hollow bowl called an acocote, to then be placed in a container called an odre." [...] The containers used for the fermentation process are usually made from animal skins, often cow leather. Leather is popular because of its ability to thermoregulate; leather also provides the sap with necessary beneficial bacteria cultures that improve taste and consistency. Pulque naturally ferments in less than twenty-four hours. Because it will spoil quickly after this period, every step in the process must be taken in close sequence and physical proximity. The <b>maguey</b> plants, the production and distribution facilities, and the places to which the pulque is distributed must all be relatively close together geographically. The taste has been described as slightly sour. Pure pulque is often mixed with fruit juices and other foods to create different flavors.|$|E
