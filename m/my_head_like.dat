500|$|Dylan was {{rethinking}} {{the direction of}} his life while recovering from a sense of having been exploited. Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs are in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for {{some of the things that}} have happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilal {{recorded}} the song [...] "Butterfly" [...] with Robert Glasper, {{a friend of}} his since college who had played on each of his albums. Bilal had previously worked with Glasper on the latter's 2012 album Black Radio. For the song [...] "Back to Love", Bilal originally programmed the music's drums on his Logic, but decided to record them live after bringing in other musicians at Pine Studios in Philadelphia. While recording [...] "Astray", he persuaded his drummer to play in the parking lot and record him live, which he recalled in an interview for The Huffington Post: [...] "I just had this feeling in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like,</b> 'man, I want this shit to feel big!' And when I would park my car in the parking lot, the acoustics in there made you feel like was a Catholic church with all of the sounds echoing off of everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hallo, oldster!" [...] he replied, {{in a tone}} of {{the most}} insolent indignation, [...] "wot ever do you mean by runnin' agin <b>my</b> <b>'ead</b> <b>like</b> that? Hain't you got no genteel boys in the West-end to butt agin, that you come all the way to Vitechapel to butt agin me? I've a good mind to 'and you over to the p'leece.

5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the track}} <b>My</b> <b>Head</b> Feels <b>like</b> a Frisbee a sample of Ella Fitzgerald singing How High the Moon can be heard. The sample is sped up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno," [...] said Dan. [...] "They {{just kind}} of come into <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>like.</b> But of course I mean to thank God when I say my prayers to-night. That's only decent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Iss, sur. After six {{or seven}} hours I do feel <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> to split, an' my stummik as if it wor on fire; but what can us do? we must live, you knaw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{you call}} THAT a whisper?' cried the poor King, {{jumping up and}} shaking himself. 'If you {{do such a thing}} again, I'll have you buttered! It went through and through <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> an earthquake!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oho!' sez I, an' <b>my</b> <b>head</b> rang <b>like</b> a guard-room gong: 'fwhat is {{the blame}} {{that this young}} man must take to oblige Tim Vulmea?' For 'twas Tim Vulmea that shpoke.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! heavens, what bliss!" [...] said I; [...] "but {{do not be}} inhuman, Miss Fanshawe: to put such {{thoughts}} into <b>my</b> <b>head</b> is <b>like</b> showing poor outcast Cain a far, glimpse of Paradise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want just three," [...] said Mary, whose {{theological}} knowledge {{had increased}} notably since her residence with Mrs. Elliott. [...] "Just three--setting up on <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> a corownet, {{a big one}} {{in the middle and}} a small one each side." ...|$|E

"To pe sure, matam," [...] said Knockdunder, [...] "ye canna doubt Mrs. Putler will do that.--Mrs. Putler, this is Lady--Lady--these tamned Southern names rin out o' <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a stane trowling down hill--put I {{believe she}} is a Scottish woman porn--the mair our credit--and I presume her leddyship is of the house of--" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{thunder of}} the broadsides was {{followed}} by the most appalling shrieks I ever heard, and by the ceaseless rattle of musketry as the soldiers opened on us with deadly precision.

6000|$|... "'Pancake Avenue,' says I, with a wink, to {{show her}} that I was on about the family receipt, and couldn't be side-corralled off of the subject. 'Come, now, Miss Willella,' I says; 'let's hear how you make 'em. Pancakes is just {{whirling}} in <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> wagon wheels.

6000|$|Amyas {{understood}} the hint, and laughed. [...] "Then I'll pledge Frank {{out of the}} next ditch, if it please you and him. But first--I say--he must hearken to a parable; a manner mystery, miracle play, I have got in <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>like</b> what they have at Easter, to the town-hall.

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} Mary to stroke <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> that," [...] Ralph {{thought to himself}} suddenly, {{and he looked at}} Christopher, almost affectionately, for calling forth his sister's caresses. Instantly he thought of Katharine, the thought of her being {{surrounded}} by the spaces of night and the open air; and Mary, watching him, saw the lines upon his forehead suddenly deepen. He stretched out an arm and placed a log upon the fire, constraining himself to fit it carefully into the frail red scaffolding, and also to limit his thoughts to this one room.|$|E
6000|$|Gage {{seemed to}} have {{suddenly}} become old, almost childish. [...] "I never was lost before," [...] he muttered, sadly. [...] "I reckon something must have went wrong in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> 'Pears <b>like</b> I'm gettin' old and foolish." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I've had the shivers all day, and now <b>my</b> <b>head</b> is <b>like</b> a cannon-ball. I took ten {{grains of}} quinine, and my ears are singing like a kettle. But I {{want to sleep}} {{with you in the}} {{cooperage}} to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{at least}} I can show {{something}} for it," [...] said Fred; [...] "they allow me a lark's diet {{instead of a}} wren's, I can hold up <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> other people now, and I actually made my own legs and the table's carry me to the window yesterday, which is what I call getting on.

6000|$|... 'Just this, my dear fellow, {{that it is}} natural. As it is, she {{considers}} me only [...] "intelligent-looking." [...] If the beard were away, my face, she says, would be [...] "so refined!" [...] And, I suppose, if I {{was just a little}} more effeminate and pale, with a nice retreating under-jaw and a drooping lip, and a meek, peaking simper, like your starved Romish saints, I should be [...] "so spiritual!" [...] And if, again, to complete the climax, I did but shave <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a Chinese, I should be a model for St. Francis himself!' ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{although}} they stayed within a pace {{or two of}} where I rested, alas! it was not so. They seemed to kiss and to exchange swift thoughts about many things, high things of which I will not write, and common things; yes, even of the shining robes they wore, but never a one of me! I strove to rise and go to them, but could not; I strove to speak and could not; I strove to throw out my thought to them and could not; it fell back upon <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>like</b> a stone hurled heavenward.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Well, I don't {{suppose it}} matters. She doesn't know I'm {{speaking}} to you about that; it just came into <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> I <b>like</b> to help in a worthy object, you know. I hope you'll have a good night's rest." ...|$|R
