5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic <b>metal</b> <b>refining</b> is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E

500|$|In Spokane, {{wood and}} food processing, {{printing}} and publishing, primary <b>metal</b> <b>refining</b> and fabrication, electrical and computer equipment, and transportation equipment are {{leaders in the}} manufacturing sector. Gold mining company Gold Reserve, and Fortune 1000 company Potlatch Corporation– a forest products company that operates as a real estate investment trust– are headquartered in the city proper. Mining, forestry, and agribusiness remain important to the local and regional economy, but Spokane's economy has diversified to include other industries, including the high-tech and biotech sectors. Spokane is becoming a more service-oriented economy {{in the face of}} a less prominent manufacturing sector which declined in the 1980s, particularly as a medical and biotechnology center; Fortune 1000 technology company Itron, for instance, is headquartered in the area. Avista Corporation, the holding company of Avista Utilities, is the only company in Spokane that has been listed in the Fortune 500, ranked 299 on the list in 2002. Other companies with head offices in the Spokane area include technology company Key Tronic, vacation rental provider Stay Alfred, and microcar maker Commuter Cars. Despite diversification to new industries, Spokane's economy has struggled in recent decades. Spokane was ranked the #1 [...] "Worst City For Jobs" [...] in America in both 2012 and 2015, while also ranking #4 in 2014. Additionally, Forbes named Spokane the [...] "Scam Capital of America" [...] in 2009 due to widespread business fraud.

2500|$|Mining and <b>metal</b> <b>refining</b> {{technologies}} {{played a}} key role in technological progress. [...] Much of our understanding of fundamental chemistry evolved from ore smelting and refining, with De Re Metallica being the leading chemistry text for 180 years. [...] Railroads evolved from mine carts and the first steam engines were designed specifically for pumping water from mines. [...] The significance of the blast furnace goes far beyond its capacity for large scale production of cast iron. [...] The blast furnace was the first example of continuous production and is a countercurrent exchange process, various types of which are also used today in chemical and petroleum refining. [...] Hot blast, which recycled what would have otherwise been waste heat, was one of engineering's key technologies. [...] It had the immediate effect of dramatically reducing the energy required to produce pig iron, but reuse of heat was eventually applied to a variety of industries, particularly steam boilers, chemicals, petroleum refining and pulp and paper.|$|E
