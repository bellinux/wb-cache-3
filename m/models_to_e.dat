40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} the magnetic dipole transition for J = 2 - 3 in titaniumlike Rhenium in the 3 d 4 ground term at the Heidelberg EBIT. Different theoretical approaches {{are taken into account}} since {{it is the first time}} one has resolved the Hyperfinesplitting as well as the Zeeman–effect at the HD–EBIT. Moreover there was no case found in literature in which the Hyperfinesplitting of this transition was resolved for any titaniumlike element. The results are given by two independent, theoretical <b>models</b> <b>to</b> <b>E</b> 1 = 3; 433666 (23) eV and E 2 = 3; 433676 (19) eV.

40|$|Accepted Manuscript (54 p.) International audienceThe {{whitening}} and opacifying {{properties of}} titanium dioxide are commonly exploited {{when it is}} used as a food additive (E 171). However, the safety of this additive can be questioned as TiO$_ 2 $ nanoparticles (TiO$_ 2 $-NPs) have been classed at potentially toxic. This study aimed to shed some light on the mechanisms behind the potential toxicity of E 171 on epithelial intestinal cells, using two in vitro models: i) a monoculture of differentiated Caco- 2 cells, and ii) a coculture of Caco- 2 with HT 29 -MTX mucus-secreting cells. Cells were exposed to E 171 and two different types of TiO$_ 2 $-NPs, either acutely (6 to 48 h) or repeatedly (twice a week for 3 weeks). Our results confirm that E 171 damaged these cells, and that the main mechanism of toxicity was oxidation effects. Responses of the two <b>models</b> <b>to</b> <b>E</b> 171 were similar, with a moderate, but significant, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and concomitant downregulation of the expression of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase. Oxidative damage to DNA was detected in exposed cells, proving that E 171 effectively induces oxidative stress; however, no endoplasmic reticulum stress was detected. E 171 effects were less intense after acute exposure compared to repeated exposure, which correlated with higher Ti accumulation. The effects were also more intense in cells exposed to E 171 than in cells exposed to TiO$_ 2 $-NPs. Taken together, these data show that E 171 induces only moderate toxicity in epithelial intestinal cells, via oxidation...|$|E

In particular, recently proposed methods based on dimensionality reduction techniques and using a symmetrical representation of users and items have shown promising results. Following this line of research, we propose a probabilistic collaborative filtering model that explicitly represents all items and users simultaneously in the model. Experimental results show that the proposed system obtains significantly better results than other collaborative filtering systems (evaluated on the MovieLens data set).

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a hierarchical approach for multicomponent tracking, where the object-to-be-tracked is modeled {{as a group}} of spatial related parts. We propose to use a robust particle filtering framework for tracking the individual components and outline how the spatial coherency between the parts can be efficiently integrated by analyzing a two-level hierarchy of particle filters. Including spatial information allows to handle common tracking problems like occlusions, clutter or blur. Furthermore, the dynamic calculation of particle set uncertainties allows a dynamic adaption of stiffness values for the spatial <b>model</b> <b>to</b> <b>e.</b> g. force occluded parts to stay in spatial relation. The experimental section proves the robustness of the proposed tracker on challenging sequences of the VIVID-PETS database. ...|$|R

40|$|Measures of {{the quantum}} {{efficiency}} of photosynthesis (phi(PSII)) across an irradiance (E) gradient are an increasingly common physiological assay and alternative to traditional photosynthetic-irradiance (PE) assays. Routinely, {{the analysis and}} interpretation of these data are analogous to PE measurements. Relative electron transport rates (rETR = E x phi(PSII)) are computed and fit to a PE curve to retrieve physiologically meaningful PE parameters. This widespread approach is statistically flawed as the response variable (rETR) is explicitly dependent on the predictor variable (E). Alternatively the E-dependency of phi(PSII) can be modeled directly while retaining the desired PE parameters by normalizing a given PE <b>model</b> <b>to</b> <b>E.</b> This manuscript presents a robust analysis {{in support of this}} alternative procedure. First, we demonstrate that scaling phi(PSII) to rETR unnecessarily amplifies the measurement error of phi(PSII) and using a Monte-Carlo analysis on synthetic data induces significantly higher uncertainty in computed PE parameters relative <b>to</b> <b>modeling</b> the E-dependency of phi(PSII) directly. Next a large dataset is simultaneously fitted <b>to</b> four PE <b>models</b> implemented in their original and E-normalized forms. Four statistical criteria used to evaluate the efficacy of nonlinear models demonstrate improved model fits and more precise PE parameters when data are modeled as E-dependent changes in phi(PSII). The analysis presented in this manuscript clearly demonstrates that modeling the E-dependency of phi(PSII) directly should be the norm for interpreting active fluorescence measures...|$|R

CONTEXT In addition to being empirically relevant, treatment heterogeneity has been important in the de-velopment of econometric thought.

40|$|Timed Petri nets are {{considered}} in this paper, {{with the aim}} of providing an efficient tool for the modelling and the analysis of timed models, such as automated manufacturing systems (AMS) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In the proposed model, timings are associated with transitions, and firing times are deterministic values. Such a model, the deterministic-timed Petri nets (DTPN), is characterized by a certain number of assumptions. In a DTPN the system state is represented by the joint information consisting of the marking of places and of the residual firing times of timed transitions, and, under the assumptions which characterize the proposed model, it is possible to describe the evolution of the system state in a relatively simple way. In the paper, three subclasses of DTPN are also introduced, and two examples relevant to the application of the proposed <b>model</b> <b>to</b> AMS <b>e</b> ITS are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, we analyze {{nonlinear}} filtering {{problems in}} distributed environments, e. g., sensor networks or peer-to-peer protocols. In these scenarios, the {{agents in the}} environment receive measurements in a streaming fashion, and {{they are required to}} estimate a common (nonlinear) model by alternating local computations and communications with their neighbors. We focus on the important distinction between single-task problems, where the underlying <b>model</b> is common <b>to</b> all agents, and multitask problems, where each agent might converge <b>to</b> a different <b>model</b> due <b>to,</b> <b>e.</b> g., spatial dependencies or other factors.
