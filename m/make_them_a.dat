5|$|However, {{their larger}} sizes and very {{aggressive}} behavior also <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> {{serious threat to}} native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and {{have been replaced by}} C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 {{individual}} Navy SEALs from a West Coast {{team had}} been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E

5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E
5|$|Other than humans, tigers {{appear to}} be the only serious predators of wolves. Wolf and tiger {{interactions}} are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, where tigers depress wolf numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers. Proven cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks {{appear to be}} competitive rather than predatory in nature, with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never had the courage to give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E
