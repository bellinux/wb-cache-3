5|$|Most {{of these}} drugs are {{approved}} only for Relapsing-Remitting <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (RRMS).|$|E
5|$|Ataxia – Ataxia is an {{impairment}} {{that consists}} {{of a lack of}} coordination of muscle movements (e.g. cerebral palsy, Friedreich’s ataxia, <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis).</b>|$|E
5|$|Other, unusual {{types of}} MS have been described; these include Devic's disease, Balo {{concentric}} sclerosis, Schilder's diffuse sclerosis, and Marburg <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> There is debate {{on whether they}} are MS variants or different diseases. <b>Multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> behaves differently in children, taking more time to reach the progressive stage. Nevertheless, they still reach it at a lower average age than adults usually do.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{has contributed}} money {{and support for}} {{research}} and treatment of <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> from which her mother suffered before her death in 1990. In 2006, Rowling contributed a substantial sum toward {{the creation of a}} new Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Edinburgh University, later named the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic. In 2010 she donated a further £10million to the centre. For reasons unknown, Scotland, Rowling's country of adoption, has the highest rate of <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> in the world. In 2003, Rowling took part in a campaign to establish a national standard of care for MS sufferers. In April 2009, she announced that she was withdrawing her support for <b>Multiple</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> Society Scotland, citing her inability to resolve an ongoing feud between the organisation's northern and southern branches that had sapped morale and led to several resignations.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair was {{featured}} on the Canadian version of the EA Sports FIFA 16 video game. She {{was one of the}} first women to appear on the cover of an EA Sports game along with Portland Thorns FC teammates, Alex Morgan and Steph Catley. In July 2017, Sinclair partnered with A and the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> Society of Canada on a nationwide awareness campaign for <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, and ocrelizumab.|$|E
5|$|Because {{tumor cells}} are inefficient in {{processing}} ketone bodies for energy, the ketogenic diet {{has also been}} suggested {{as a treatment for}} cancer, including glioma, as well as <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and other neurological disorders.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Rowling {{established}} the Volant Charitable Trust, which uses its {{annual budget of}} £5.1million to combat poverty and social inequality. The fund also gives to organisations that aid children, one parent families, and <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> research.|$|E
5|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (MS) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} demyelinating disease {{that affects the}} central nervous system (CNS). Several therapies for it exist, although there is no known cure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> an {{inflammatory}} process that may produce {{a loss of}} the myelin sheathes which surround the cranial nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|Targeted {{monoclonal}} antibody therapy is employed to treat {{diseases such as}} rheumatoid arthritis, <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> psoriasis, and many forms of cancer including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|The French {{neurologist}} Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) was {{the first}} person to recognize <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> as a distinct disease in 1868. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease sclerose en plaques.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied. The {{same is true}} for aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from glaucoma to <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease. Cerebellar atrophy can also occur {{as a result of}} exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease {{is associated with a}} variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.|$|E
5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, {{studies have}} shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling {{said that}} the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death, which was {{influenced}} by her mother's death in 1990, from <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Lev Grossman of Time stated that the main theme of the series was the overwhelming importance of continuing to love {{in the face of}} death.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills have contradictory {{results from}} different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate {{in women with}} <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as carbamazepine (used to treat spasms and pain) and modafinil (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills less effective.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{has participated}} in several forms of charity to help raise {{awareness}} of <b>Multiple</b> <b>Sclerosis</b> following his diagnosis in 1996, including his own non-profit charity, Band Against MS, which he founded in 2003. In 2008, he received a Humanitarian Award for his charitable efforts in relations to MS and participated in a charity golf tournament benefiting his organization.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> several therapies have proven helpful. The primary aims of therapy are {{returning}} function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|Campbell has two sons: Christian and Tyler. Christian played {{high school}} {{football}} with Drew Brees, nephew of his father's former Longhorns teammate Marty Akins, at Westlake High and ran track for the University of Houston. Tyler was a running back for Pasadena City College and San Diego State but was forced {{to give up the}} sport due to <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (MS). He returned to Texas after graduation and divides his time between the family business and raising awareness of MS with his father.|$|E
5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E
5|$|Having just {{completed}} the tracks for his fourth album in 1996, Walker was playing basketball with a friend, {{when he began}} to experience numbness, facial spasms, and double vision. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that he had <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (MS). Walker subsequently began changing his diet and treating the disease with a daily injection of Copaxone, sending his MS into an arrested state.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis,</b> ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian {{retired from}} {{coaching}} in 1974 {{and began a}} broadcasting career calling college football games for ABC and CBS. He also dedicated himself to medical causes later in life after his daughter was diagnosed with <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and three of his grandchildren died of a rare genetic disease. Parseghian {{was inducted into the}} College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1980. His career coaching record is 170–58–6.|$|E
5|$|Relapsing-remitting MS is {{characterized}} by unpredictable relapses followed by periods of months to years of relative quiet (remission) with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits that occur during attacks may either resolve or leave problems, the latter in about 40% of attacks and being more common the longer a person has had the disease. This describes the initial course of 80% of individuals with MS. When deficits always resolve between attacks, this is {{sometimes referred to as}} benign MS, although people will still build up some degree of disability in the long term. On the other hand, the term malignant <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> is used to describe people with MS having reached significant level of disability in a short period. The relapsing-remitting subtype usually begins with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In CIS, a person has an attack suggestive of demyelination, but does not fulfill the criteria for <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> 30 to 70% of persons experiencing CIS later develop MS.|$|E
5|$|Shiller {{separated}} from her husband Mark Zalkin, one of the Mayor Harold Washington's assistant press secretaries, and with Shiller {{a leader of the}} 46th Ward Community Service Center (later the Uptown Community Service Center) and an editor of Keep Strong magazine, and with Shiller and Coleman an editor of All-Chicago City News. Zalkin passed on February 23, 1998 at age 49 due to complications from <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clinical presentation}} of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack {{of a single}} symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Treatment with interferons or glatiramer acetate after an initial attack decreases {{the risk of developing}} clinical definite MS.|$|E
5|$|The name <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> {{refers to}} the scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most {{commonly}} affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
5|$|When she {{had reached}} her Clapham Junction flat, {{she began to}} write immediately. In December, Rowling's mother Anne died after ten years {{suffering}} from <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Rowling was writing Harry Potter {{at the time and}} had never told her mother about it. Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing, and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.|$|E
5|$|After {{starring}} as {{a political}} cartoonist {{who falls in love}} in the 1990 film Funny About Love, Wilder performed in one final movie with Pryor, the 1991 feature Another You, in which Pryor's physical deterioration from <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> was clearly noticeable. It was Pryor's last starring role in a film (he appeared in a few cameos before he died in 2005) and also marked Wilder's last appearance in a feature film. His last two movies were not financially successful. Wilder's remaining work consisted of television movies and guest appearances in TV shows.|$|E
5|$|During {{a period}} of ill health, Susan hits Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon) with her car after passing out. Susan is unaware that she has struck Bridget and she leaves the scene. When she realises that she is responsible, Susan confesses and it causes a bitter feud between the Kennedys and the Parkers. However, during Susan's trial, Bridget remembers falling {{into the path of}} the car and that the {{collision}} was unavoidable. Soon afterwards, following a series of incorrect diagnoses, Susan is diagnosed with <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Susan is shocked and scared, and Karl and Libby try to help her. Susan collapses at Toadie and Steph's wedding rehearsal and she goes to a <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> retreat for professional help. Susan takes sick leave from the school and becomes a journalist for the Erinsborough News. After Libby is told she cannot have any more children, she and Dan decide to try surrogacy. Susan offers to be their surrogate, despite Karl's objections. Paul Robinson finds out about the surrogacy and writes a newspaper article about it, without knowing the identity of the family involved. When he finds out that Susan is the surrogate, he makes it public. The family face abuse and the hospital board decide to end the programme.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as <b>multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|Her storylines {{have seen}} her begin a {{relationship}} with a Priest, being married, divorced and widowed. Susan has become a stepmother and a grandmother and she has been central to three plots revolving around health issues: Retrograde amnesia, <b>Multiple</b> <b>sclerosis</b> and Surrogacy. She has also been central to a cyber-bullying plot. In October 2009, Susan became the longest-running female character in the show's history, having been in Neighbours for over fifteen years. Woodburne has garnered various award nominations for her portrayal of Susan and the character has been well received by viewers and television critics.|$|E
