Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the agents}} again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further {{discusses}} the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five {{people were killed}} at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Following his intuition, Mulder discovers that the birthdays of the four patients also <b>match</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the dates of the Witches' Sabbath but that Dr. Clifford Cox's birthday does not. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Franklin would look like had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces an image that looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Cox alone in a blood-spattered operating room, he uses uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Luckily, Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Cox, however, escapes; he is later seen removing {{the skin of his}} face and performing a ritual to make him appear younger. It is revealed that Cox murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-young Cox successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital.|$|E

5|$|Worried by the events, the {{hospital}} coordinator, Dr. Theresa Shannon, tells Mulder and Scully about a similar series of deaths that {{occurred at the}} same hospital ten years prior. They suspect Rebecca Waite (O-Lan Jones), a nurse who {{is the only person}} present at all the death scenes. The agents visit Waite's house, discovering evidence that she practices witchcraft; however, the audience learns that the evidence was planted there by a staff member of {{the hospital}}. Elsewhere, Dr. Jack Franklin (Richard Beymer) is non-fatally assaulted by Waite at his house. There, Waite is arrested and approached by the agents, who attempt to question Waite but are prevented when she starts to vomit pins, dying shortly thereafter. After the incident, Mulder visits Dr. Jack Franklin, hoping to learn more about Waite's possible motivation. Although Franklin is seemingly innocent, when Mulder leaves the room, he begins to levitate and devilishly smile. Later that night, Mulder deduces that the birthdays of all the victims <b>match</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the dates of the Witches' Sabbath and that Waite was actually trying to protect the victims from Dr. Jack Franklin (she had placed the pentagramsactually protective symbolson and around the victims in the hopes of protecting them from dark magic). This also explains why Waite tried to kill Franklin. Unfortunately, Mulder also realizes that because Waite was not the murderer, the spree of murders will continue. And as he suspected, another patient is murdered with acid back at the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Nebraska and Colorado share a disputed rivalry, {{sometimes}} {{considered a}} one-sided rivalry with Colorado placing more importance on the rivalry than Nebraska. The teams first met in 1898 and have met 69 times, with Nebraska winning a significant {{majority of the}} games (49). The rivalry became a conference <b>match</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Colorado's joining of the Big Eight in 1947 and would continue through {{their time in the}} Big 12. The rivalry briefly had a trophy, a mounted buffalo head named Mr. Chip, that was exchanged from 1951 until 1961; the exchange ended after Colorado misplaced the trophy. The rivalry is currently dormant, following both Colorado and Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 in 2011, but to different conferences. Future non-conference games are planned for 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024.|$|E
25|$|Route 303 {{originated}} as {{a proposed}} alignment of State Highway Route S-4-D, a spur of State Highway Route 4, a cross-state highway from Cape May to Paterson. The route was assigned in 1938, proposed {{to follow a}} highway known as the Liberty Road through the community of Teaneck. In 1941, the New Jersey State Legislature amended the proposal to include a highway known as the Liberty Road from Route 4 to New York State Route 303 (designated in 1930) at Northvale. The proposal sat around for twelve years, until January 1, 1953, when the New Jersey State Highway Department renumbered the state highways around New Jersey. As part of the renumbering, Route S-4-D was re-designated Route 303 to <b>match</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> NY 303. The route, as of 2007, has never been constructed, but the general alignment remains as County Route 505.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Governor Michael Dukakis (Massachusetts) chose Bentsen to be {{his running}} mate in that year's presidential election, beating out Ohio Senator John Glenn, who was {{considered}} the early favorite. Bentsen was selected {{in large part to}} try to lure away the state of Texas and its electoral vote for the Democrats, even with fellow Texan George H. W. Bush {{at the top of the}} Republican ticket. Because of Bentsen's status as something of an elder statesman who was more experienced in electoral politics, many believed Dukakis's selection of Bentsen as his running mate was a mistake in that Bentsen, number two on the ticket, appeared more presidential than did Dukakis. During the vice presidential debate (see below), Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle spent most of his speaking time criticizing Dukakis as too liberal while avoiding a <b>match</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the seasoned Bentsen. One elector in West Virginia even cast a ballot for him rather than Dukakis, giving Bentsen one electoral vote for president.|$|E
