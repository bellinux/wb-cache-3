40|$|Abstract Background Inhalation {{of diesel}} {{particulate}} matter (DPM) {{is known to}} {{have a negative impact on}} human health. Consequently, there are regulations and standards that limit the maximum concentrations to which persons may be exposed and the maximum concentrations allowed in the ambient air. However, these standards consider steady exposure over large spatial and time scales. Due to the nature of many vehicle exhaust systems, pedestrians in close proximity to a vehicle's tailpipe may experience events where diesel particulate matter concentrations are high enough to cause acute health effects for brief periods of time. Methods In order to quantify these exposure events, instruments which measure specific exhaust constituent concentrations were placed near a roadway and connected to the mouth of a mannequin used as a pedestrian surrogate. By measuring concentrations at the mannequin's mouth during drive-by events with a late model diesel truck, a representative estimate of the exhaust constituent concentrations to which a pedestrian may be exposed was obtained. Typical breathing rates were then multiplied by the measured concentrations to determine the mass of pollutant inhaled. Results The average concentration of diesel particulate matter measured over the duration of a single drive-by test often exceeded the low concentrations used in human clinical studies which are known to cause acute health effects. It was also observed that higher concentrations of diesel particulate matter were measured at the height of a stroller than were measured at the mouth of a mannequin. Conclusion Diesel particulate matter concentrations during drive-by incidents easily reach or exceed the low concentrations that can cause acute health effects for brief periods of time. For the case of a particularly well-tuned late-model year vehicle, the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> matter inhaled during a drive-by incident is small compared to the mass inhaled daily at ambient conditions. On a per breath basis, however, the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> matter inhaled is large compared to the mass inhaled at ambient conditions. Finally, it was determined that children, infants, or people breathing at heights similar to that of a passing vehicle's tailpipe may be exposed to higher concentrations of particulate matter than those breathing at higher locations, such as adults standing up. </p...|$|E

Raw exhaust particulate and its soluble organic extract were screened for biological activity using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay. Results are given for a test matrix made up of twelve steady-state operating conditions. For all conditions except the 1 / 4 rack (light load) condition, modest thermal efficiency gains were noted upon ethanol fumigation. Methanol showed the same increase at 3 / 4 and full rack (high load) conditions. However, engine roughness or the occurrence of severe knock limited the maximum amount of alcohol that could be fumigated.

30|$|Stormwater {{retention}} ponds, {{also called}} wet detention ponds, {{are among the}} most widely used Best Management Practices (BMP) for stormwater management (USEPA 1999; Scholes et al. 2003). Sedimentation is the primary removal mechanism in wet detention ponds for several stormwater pollutants, but depending on the substance properties, processes like adsorption, microbial degradation, and volatilization can also be important (Scholes et al. 2008). Removal of suspended solids (TSS) and other pollutants associated with solids via sedimentation depends mainly on the hydraulic retention time (HRT), with longer HRT leading to higher removal rates (e.g. USEPA 1999; Vollertsen et al. 2007). One of the major characteristics of stormwater runoff is the high temporal and spatial variability of hydraulic flow and pollutant concentrations (e.g. He et al. 2010; Gnecco et al. 2005; Jacobsen 2011; Wium-Andersen et al. 2011). Various relationships have been proposed in the literature to link stormwater quality to different catchment attributes such as land use, rainwater quality and traffic loads (especially for roads and highways), and to forcing functions such as rainfall intensity (when the release of pollutants from a surface is assumed to be linked to the raindrop energy), runoff volume (when pollutant release is assumed to be dependent on the runoff stress on the catchment surface), antecedent rainfall volume and antecedent dry periods (ADP) (e.g. Vaze and Chiew 2003; Ouyang 2003; Gnecco et al. 2005; Goonetilleke et al. 2005; Obropta and Kardos 2007; He et al. 2010, 2011). The latter is commonly used to estimate the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> pollutants that are available on the catchment surfaces, which, as confirmed by the measurements carried out by Vaze and Chiew (2002), increases during dry weather with an asymptotic behavior. The importance of ADP is magnified in areas characterized by long dry periods and high intensity rainfall events (Sabin et al. 2005).|$|E

During the measurements gravimetric mass in the MOUDI collections varied between 3. 4 and 55. 0 ?g m ? 3 and the WSOC concentration was between 0. 3 and 7. 4 ?g m ? 3. On average, water-soluble particulate organic matter (WSPOM, WSOC multiplied by 1. 6) comprised 25 ± 7. 7 % and 7. 5 ± 3. 4 % of aerosol PM 1 mass and the PM 1 ? 10 mass, respectively.

40|$|Soot toxification: The {{increasing}} chemical {{activity of}} the emitted soot particulate produced by modern diesel engines is an unwanted side effect of modification of the motors. This makes Euro IV and VI soots chemically and biologically highly active and hazardous. Taking these factors into consideration, the question arises whether the reduced net <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> diesel soot <b>particulate</b> emitted overcompensates for the induced micro- and nanostructure...|$|R
