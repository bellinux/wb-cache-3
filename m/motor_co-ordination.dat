This study was done in one of the primary schools found in Hillbrow. In this qualitative study, the contributions of three educators were recorded. They were interviewed and researcher observed in their classrooms. In addition, learners' workbooks were used to support data collect collected during interviews and researcher observations. Recommendations were made that educators need to have additional perceptual programmes {{that can be used in}} their classrooms to help these learners. This could be beneficial for learners who did not attend pre-primary schools. It has also been recommended that educators need to involve parents by educating them. Based on the findings, the study showed that educators had experiences with learners' fine and gross <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordinations,</b> classroom behaviour and educators' feelings and recommendations were made for both, educators and parents. These recommendations can be used by educators who want to implement them in their classrooms.

In this context, the present study, investigated the anxiolytic potential of warm black tea brew/ infusion (BTB) of Sri Lankan low grown orthodox Orange Pekoe (O. P.) grade tea made from Camellia sinensis (L) O. Kruntz (Theaceae). This was tested in rats using three models of anxiety (hole-board, neophobic suppression of eating and drinking tests). Different doses [223 mg/kg (equivalent to 1. 5 cups), 446 mg/kg (equivalent to 3 cups) and 1339 mg/kg (equivalent to 9 cups) ] or water was orally administered to rats (N = 6 - 10 /group) and anxiolytic effects were determined after 1 h. The results showed that BTB possesses dose-dependent anxiolytic action with quick onset (1 h). This anxiolytic action of BTB was not accompanied with undesirable side effects: muscle relaxation, <b>motor</b> in <b>co-ordination</b> or sedation. In addition, BTB produced no overt signs of toxicity. BTB induced significant {{increase in the number of}} entries, time spent in open arms, % open arm entries and % time on open arms and reduced the time spent in closed arms when tested in elevated plus maze model. This suggest that main mode of anxiolytic action of BTB is GABAergic. It is also suggested that, serotoninergic and dopaminergic mechanisms also play a part in mediating anxiolytic action. It is concluded that, O.

For reference purposes, an additional group of 36 age-and gender-matched healthy-weight (HW) children was included in the study. Anthropometric measures were recorded and gross <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> was assessed using the Korperkoordinationstest fur Kinder (KTK) on two occasions with an interval of 4 months. Regardless of the test moment, OW/OB participants displayed significantly poorer KTK performances (P < 0. 001). However, treatment was found to be efficacious in decreasing body weight (Delta 17. 9 +/- 3. 1 %, P < 0. 001) and generating a significant progress in gross <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> performance, with a greater increase in KTK score(s) from baseline to re-test as compared to HW peers (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Initial {{conceptualisation}} {{about the}} nature of vegetative state (VS) assumed at least temporary loss of the entire cortical functioning. Since a broad range of stimulus-related cortical activations was demonstrated in VS patients, this simplified idea is not tenable any longer, but no alternative concept emerges instead. Two recent hypotheses, empirically testable and well grounded, could fill this vacuum: (1) In VS, isolated cortical areas may work, but their integration into a distributed network is lacking. (2) In VS, complex stimulus processing is limited to primary sensory and <b>motor</b> areas; the <b>co-ordination</b> between them and the secondary and tertiary areas is lacking. To test these hypotheses, we estimated the frequency of occurrence of late event-related potential components P 3 and N 400, presumably indicating activity of complex distributed networks including high-level sensory and associative areas. Both components occurred in VS with above-chance frequencies, but less frequently than in two control groups. Besides these frequent normal brain activations, some VS patients exhibit highly significant but abnormal activations, whose functional meaning remains unclear. A methodological analysis leads to the conclusion that any neurophysiological assessment of VS patients is biased toward under-, rather than over-estimation, of their remaining information processing abilities...|$|R

The Dyspraxia Foundation defines dyspraxia as “an impairment or immaturity of the organisation of movement”. This difficulty with planning movements has also been described by Cermak (1991) and Ayres (1979) in their definitions of dyspraxia. Cermak in fact defines dyspraxia as “a difficulty in planning and carrying out skilled, nonhabitual motor acts in the correct sequence”. Dyspraxia is also frequently used to describe children who have difficulty in daily activities that require co-ordination of movement that is out of proportion to the child’s age and intelligence. As a result of these difficulties, it is a condition which threatens physical development and may reduce the child’s ability to reach her/his full potential.

40|$|MA (Child Kinetics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Visual-motor integration, visual {{perception}} and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> contribute to successful academic, school and career life. Literature {{also indicates that}} delays in the skills in above mentioned abilities could lead to delays in the mastering of object control skills. Furthermore, due to the developing needs of South Africa, there is a range of socio-economic challenges, and the effects on the above mentioned skills seem to lack development. Due to the possible effect that visual skills can have on academic performance, it seems important to further investigate the effect it may have on sport skills as well. The {{aim of this study}} was firstly, to determine the effect of gender differences and school types associated with different socio-economic conditions on the visual-motor integration, {{visual perception}} and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> abilities of Grade 1 boys and girls in the North West Province of South Africa. Secondly, the study aimed to determine the relationship between visual-motor integration, visual perception, <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> and object control skills of Grade 1 -learners in the North West Province of South Africa. For the purpose of the first objective 816 participants (419 boys and 397 girls) were evaluated and for the second objective, 806 participants (413 boys and 393 girls) were evaluated. The test instrument used to determine the level of the participants’ visual-motor skills was the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration – 4 th ed. (VMI- 4) which consisted of the visual- motor integration test and two subtests which included visual perception and motor co- ordination. The children’s object-control skills were tested with the Test of Gross Motor Development – 2 (TGMD- 2) which is designed to test the gross motor functioning of children from 3 to 10 years old. The STATISTICA software package (StatSoft, 2013) was used to analyse data. Data was analysed by means of descriptive statistics as well as a variation analyses (ANOVA). ANOVA was used to determine the interaction effect between gender and/or socio-economic status and visual-motor integration, visual perception and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> Independent t-testing was used to determine the effect of gender differences and socio-economic status in visual-motor integration, visual perception and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> Effect sizes (d) were used to calculate practical significance of differences. Two-way frequency tables were used to compare the classifications of the different school quintiles (Quintile 1 - 3 = schools associated with low socio-economic status and Quintile 4 - 5 = schools associated with high socio-economic status) among the VMI- 4 -classes. The Pearson Chi-square was used to indicate the significance of the differences and the level of statistical significance was set at p≤ 0. 05. Furthermore a Spearman rank order correlation was used to determine the correlations among visual-motor integration, visual perception, <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination,</b> striking a stationary ball, stationary dribble, catch, kick, underhand rolling and overhand throw, and an object control total. The results revealed that gender had no significant effect on visual-motor integration, visual perception and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> within the respective school types associated with different socio-economic conditions. Although {{there were no significant differences}} between the boys and girls, statistically significant higher mean scores were found in school types associated with higher socio-economic status (Quintile 4 and 5) with regard to visual-motor integration, visual perception and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> The object control skills total had small and medium correlations with visual- motor integration, visual perception and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> Visual perception had the highest correlation with the object control skills total. These results contribute to our understanding of the influence that visual-motor integration, visual perception and <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> have on sport skills and more specifically ball sport skills. This knowledge enables researchers to better address problems which present in early years with regard to visual skills, as well as the negative impact which low socio-economic circumstances have on these skills in order to improve academic and sport skills later.

40|$|International Symposium on Neural Control of Space Coding and Action Production, LYON, FRANCE, 2001 International audienceThis {{chapter is}} divided into three main parts. Firstly, on the basis of the, literature, we will shortly discuss how the recent {{introduction}} of the concept of internal models by Daniel Wolpert and Mitsuo Kawato contributes {{to a better understanding of}} what is motor learning and what is motor adaptation. Then, we will present a model of eye-hand co-ordination during self-moved target tracking, which we used as a way to specifically address these topics. Finally, we will show some evidence about the use of proprioceptive information for updating the internal models, in the context of eye-hand <b>co-ordination.</b> <b>Motor</b> and afferent information appears to contribute to the parametric adjustment (adaptation) between arm motor command and visual information about arm motion. The study reported here was aimed at assessing the contribution of arm proprioception in building (learning) and updating (adaptation) these representations. The subjects (including a deafferented subject) had to make back and forth movements with their forearm in the horizontal plane, over teamed amplitude and at constant frequency, and to track an arm-driven target with their eyes. The dynamical conditions of arm movement were altered (unexpectedly or systematically) during the movement by changing the mechanical properties of the manipulandum. The results showed a significant change of the latency and the gain of the smooth pursuit system, before and after the perturbation for the control subjects, but not for the deafferented subject. Moreover, in control subjects, vibrations of the arm muscles prevented adaptation to the mechanical perturbation. These results suggest that in a self-moved target tracking task, the arm motor system shares with the smooth pursuit system an internal representation of the arm dynamical properties, and that arm proprioception is necessary to build this internal model. As suggested by Ghez et al. (1990) (Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., 55 : 837 - 8471), proprioception would allow control subjects to learn the inertial properties of the limb...|$|R

The study was conducted in two parts. In the first part, responses to a screening questionnaire indicated that 86. 4 % of the 118 subjects had sustained TBI, 56. 7 % reported more than one TBI, and Maori subjects sustained 12 % more TBI than non-Maori. Subjects reported higher rates of illicit substance use than the general population, and Maori reported higher substance use than non-Maori. All subjects reported difficulties with general memory and socialisation on a Problem Rating Scale, but no differences were found in the level of difficulties reported due to severity of TBI sustained. Subjects with more severe substance use histories reported experiencing most problems with interpersonal relationships, family, and finances. In part two, 50 subjects from the original sample with a history of TBI and/or substance use, completed neuropsychological measures of short and long term verbal and visual memory, learning, information processing, <b>motor</b> speed and <b>co-ordination,</b> executive functioning, and malingering. All subjects performed below norms on tests of verbal memory and verbal abstract thinking, but overall, no differences were found due to either severity of TBI or level of substance use. Maori subjects obtained the lowest scores on tests of verbal ability, but also reported higher rates of TBI and substance use, which is presumed to account for this result. In conclusion, prison populations seem to have a disproportionably high TBI rate, recurrent TBI rate, and substance use rate, compared to the general population. Further, there are a group of individuals who have experienced both TBI and substance abuse, and consequently have impairments in verbal memory and learning, abstract thinking, and report problems with general memory and socialisation. These difficulties should be taken into account, since they may affect functioning both in prison and following release...|$|R

Albino Wistar rats were used as the experimental animals. Different neuropharmacological paradigms such as the <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> by the rotarod, pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time and the PTZ-induced convulsion were examined after administering deltamethrin orally at two doses, 150 mg/kg (LD 50) and 15 mg/kg (1 / 10 LD 50). The GABA level in the rat brain was estimated by HPLC after a single oral dose of 150 mg/kg deltamethrin. Deltamethrin significantly reduced the motor coordination, decreased the onset time and increased the sleeping time duration induced by pentobarbitone. In addition, it also decreased the onset time and increased the duration of convulsions induced by PTZ at 150 mg/kg (LD 50) and 15 mg/kg (1 / 10 LD 50), respectively.

Předchozí studie o pohybovém rytmu u člověka se vždy soustřeďovaly na schopnosti motorického provádění rytmu u subjektů. Nevysvětlovaly však mechanismus jeho provádění. Cílem této studie je představit rozsáhlý parametrický popis chování souvisejícího s pohybovým rytmem a změny, kterým toto chování během lekcí rytmického cvičení podléhá. Byl zkoumán pohybový rytmus 35 žen při lekcích aquaaerobiku. Lekce sestávaly z 52 cvičení, jejichž provádění jsme studovali s ohledem na rytmus. Subjekty prováděly rovněž tři testy rytmických dovedností. Zaznamenali jsme, že vlastnosti cvičící osoby, jako jsou rytmické dovednosti a věk, pouze částečně určují schopnost udržet rytmus během cvičení. Na pohybový rytmus měla velký vliv doba trvání cvičení. Rychlejší tempo cvičení podporuje udržení rytmu. Rytmus se udržuje snáze během cvičení, při kterém dochází k pohybu ve frontální rovině, než během cvičení ve středové rovině. Rytmus se udržuje snáze během cvičení se střídáním stran pohybu než během cvičení symetrických. Podobně se rytmus udržuje snáze při cvičení s během než při cvičení se skákáním. Použití vybavení při cvičení snižuje možnost udržet rytmus. V různých etapách byly zaznamenány zajímavé jevy "vstoupení do rytmu" a "ztrácení rytmu". Výsledky získané v rámci této studie naznačují složitost vlastnosti nazývané pohybový rytmus. Částečně vysvětlují jevy provázející provádění rytmických cvičení u žen. Výsledky studie mohou být užitečné pro instruktory při přípravě obsahu lekcí rytmického cvičení. The {{rhythm of}} {{movement}} {{which is a}} component of <b>co-ordination</b> <b>motor</b> abilities, present in practically every movement, is a little researched property. Previous studies on the rhythm of movement in humans have always focused on the abilities of motor performance of rhythm by the subjects. They did not explain the mechanism of this performance. The {{aim of this study}} is to present a wide, parametric description of behaviour related to the rhythm of movement, with changes to this behaviour taking place during rhythmic exercise classes. The rhythm of movement of 35 women in aquarobic classes was studied. The classes consisted of 52 exercises the performance of which was analysed in terms of rhythm. The subjects performed also three tests for rhythmic skills. It was noted that the properties of an exercising person such as rhythmic skills and age, only partially determine maintaining of the rhythm during the exercise. The duration of an exercise has a great effect on the rhythm of movement. A faster pace of an exercise favours maintaining the rhythm. Exercises in which the movement is in the frontal plane are easier to maintain in rhythm than exercises in the median plane. Exercises with alternating sides movement are easier to maintain in rhythm than symmetrical exercises. Similarly, running exercises are easier to maintain in rhythm than jumping exercises. Using equipment during exercises lowers the possibilities of maintaining the rhythm. An interesting phenomenon of "going into rhythm" and "losing rhythm" at various stages of exercises was noted. The results obtained in this study indicate the complexity of the property called the rhythm of movement. They partly explain the phenomena accompanying the performance of rhythmic exercises by women. The results of the study may be helpful for instructors in preparation of synopses of rhythmic exercise classes...|$|R

However, it was first essential to establish replicability, and since the Tang et al (1999) study used only male mice we wished to investigate possible sex differences. On the hidden platform watermaze, we found a trend for male NR 2 BOE mice to learn the task more quickly than male wildtype mice (as observed by Tang et al. 1999), but the opposite trend in female mice; female NR 2 BOE mice were slower to reach the hidden platform than female wildtype mice. This pattern of results was also observed on the spatial reference Y memory task and open field task (for anxiety), although not on the spatial working memory T maze task (despite a sex difference). However, wildtype and NR 2 BOE mice performed at similar levels on the novel object recognition task, the spatial novelty preference task, visible platform watermaze and visual discrimination task. A battery of tests considering some species typical behaviours of mice demonstrated that wildtype and NR 2 BOE mice were comparable on tests of <b>motor</b> ability, strength, <b>co-ordination,</b> anxiety, burrowing and nesting. This suggests that our behavioural results are not due to a general impairment or enhancement of species typical behaviours. We considered the possibility that the difference between the results of Tang et al (1999) and those we observed may be caused by age differences; hence we attempted to replicate our results on the hidden platform watermaze, spatial reference Y maze and open field test in age matched mice. However, the second cohort of NR 2 BOE mice performed at similar levels to wildtype mice, and at significantly improved levels compared to the mice of the first cohort. We also considered the effects of knocking out the NR 2 B subunit on learning and memory, and NR 1 subunit deletion within the hippocampus. On the spatial working memory T maze, these mouse strains performed similarly to their respective wildtype strains. Similarly, on a two beacon watermaze (with one indicating the platform position), mice lacking the NR 2 B subunit were able to locate the platform in a similar length of time. To ensure that the null results we had observed in the second cohort were not due to loss of the NR 2 B protein overexpression in the forebrain, we performed polymerase chain reactions (PCR), quantitative real-time PCR, and Western blots. We ascertained that the transgene was indeed present and that NR 2 B mRNA and protein levels were elevated in the hippocampi of the NR 2 BOE mice. In conclusion, it is unclear why the behaviours we observed in the NR 2 BOE mice are different to those published in the literature. It is possible that they may be due to differences in environmental enrichment, but the cause of the genotype by sex differences observed in the mice of cohort 1 is unclear. Nonetheless, we have advanced our knowledge of the effects of modifications in the levels of the NR 2 B subunit of the NMDA receptor on learning and behaviour.

40|$|Music {{theory has}} a long {{tradition}} of music-structural research with a methodology which is top-down, conceptual, relational and prototypical rather than bottom-up and experiential. As such it deals with music at a level of cognitive mediation, bypassing the actual experience of listening in favour of a strategy of conceptual and verbal labelling. Music, on this view, is “described” rather than “experienced” and music theory holds a formal-symbolic position which deals with music mostly out-of-time: the music is conceived in “objectivist” terms—as something which is “out there”—without reference to the music user, and is objectified in discrete-symbolic and highly compressed ways. The listening experience, however, is time-consuming and continuous in its unfolding. It is characterized by making epistemic contact with the perceptual flux of the sonic world, relying on mechanisms of sense-making that are not constrained by the limitations of existing descriptive and explanatory vocabularies. This is the basic distinction between presentational immediacy and symbolic representation. Listening, further, is a musical behaviour—such as listening, composing or performing—which can be conceived of in more general terms as “coping with the sonic world”. Music, on this view, is only a limited set of a more encompassing sonic universe, and listening strategies are ways of dealing with this universe. As such they are part of our biological equipment for coping with the world. This paper argues for an adaptive process of sense-making in the process of listening to music. It raises the question of epistemic autonomy—in that the music listener can arbitrarily choose what kinds of distinctions are to be made—and stresses the role of perceptual learning and listening strategies in an attempt to go beyond the fixed repertoire of cues and patterns which are so typical for cognitive “statics”. In order to do so, it tries to provide tools for better listening, by learning to make new distinctions, performing mental operations on the observables and creating different semantic relations with the sonic world. As such it considers the epistemic levels of sensory reception as well as the level of internal processing of the sound, combining both the syntactic and semantic dimensions of dealing with music. There is, in fact, a distinction between components and their organization. Traditional music theory has focussed mostly on the latter by stressing the syntactic nature of combinations of a limited set of discrete elements such as pitches, chords, scales, arithmetically related durations and other recognized groupings. This is essentially a “combinatorial” and “computational” approach which refers to the novelty that results from fresh combinations of pre-existing elements. It has a rather narrow applicablity in relying too exclusively on conventionally defined basic units. There is, however, another possibility of “creative emergence” which entails “de novo” creations of new kinds of elements which are the result of new distinctions. It allows us to broaden the formal-computational approach to music and to consider the functions of perception and action in the creation of new elements. A major claim, therefore, is to stress an “empiricist” approach to musical “semantics” as being concerned primarily with the sounding elements. This approachs holds an inductive position in musical knowledge acquisition, leaning heavily on musical heuristics and listening strategies. It allows us, further, to conceive of the music user as an adaptive device which functions as an informationally open system that interacts with the environment through sensory inputs, <b>motor</b> outputs and <b>co-ordinations</b> between them. The process of dealing with music is located at these three levels of functioning, but this paper focusses mainly on the input level and the basic mechanisms for modifying our semantic relations to the world. Critical in this process is the expansion of our perceptual repertoire either by extending the number of distinctions “between” and “within” things we can hear simultaneously or by considering the temporal resolution of single things which are extended in time. This is the hallmark of “having an experience”, as stressed already in the pragmatic philosophy of Dewey and James. In order to make these claims operational, we argue for the construction of tools for better listening, relying both on natural or internal tools as well as on artifical or external tools. The former are part of our biological equipment (perceptual and cognitiive tools) and can be activated by learning to direct our attention. They rely on principles of perceptual learning and on cognitive mechanisms that perform acts of categorization and conceptualization on the ontological categories that constitute the sonic world. The latter rely on technological means for better listening. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} about intra- and inter-individual variation can stimulate attempts at description, interpretation and prediction of <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> (MC). Aim: To analyse change, stability and prediction of <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> (MC) in children. Subjects and methods: A total of 158 children, 83 boys and 75 girls, aged 6, 7 and 8 years, were evaluated in 2006 and re-evaluated in 2012 at 12, 13 and 14 years of age. MC was assessed through the Kiphard-Schilling’s body co-ordination test and growth, skeletal maturity, physical fitness, fundamental motor skills (FMS), {{physical activity and}} socioeconomic status (SES) were measured and/or estimated. Results: Repeated-measures MANOVA {{indicated that there was}} a significant effect of group, sex and time on a linear combination of the MC tests. Univariate tests revealed that group 3 (8 – 14 years) scored significantly better than group 1 (6 – 12 years) in all MC tests and boys performed better than girls in hopping for height and moving sideways. Scores in MC were also higher at follow-up than at baseline. Inter-age correlations for MC were between 0. 15 – 0. 74. Childhood predictors of MC were growth, physical fitness, FMS, physical activity and SES. Biological maturation did not contribute to prediction of MC. Conclusion: MC seemed moderately stable from childhood through adolescence and, additionally, inter-individual predictors at adolescence were growth, FMS, physical fitness, physical activity and SES. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

In contrast, larval amphibians {{have been found}} to show excellent recovery of motor function in the form of ‘homologous or myotypic response’ (Weiss, 1936, 1941) following the cutting and regeneration of limb-nerves, limb transplantation, and the cross-connecting of limb nerves to foreign muscles.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of Valproic acid in diabetic neuropathy. Methods: Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). When STZ was administered tothe albino wistar rats then it showed marked Hyperglycemia & reduces the thermal Cold allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> which was compared to the animals of control group. Effect of valproic acid on biochemical parameters (Serum glucose level, Lipid peroxidation, SOD & GSH and Oxidative stress) was also assessed in the brain tissue of albino wistar rat. Results:After 28 days of treatment with valproic acid (150 and 300 mg/kg), rats showed significant reduction in serum glucose level. Valproic acid showed good results in different parameters such as Thermal Hyperalgesia, Thermal Allodynia (Hot and Cold) <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> in comparison with diabetic control group. The most profound effect was seen with 300 mg/kg of valproic acid after 28 th day of treatment. Treatment with valproic acid (150 & 300 mg/kg) resulted significant decrease in serum glucose level, lipid peroxidation and increase in the SOD and GSH level as compared to diabetic control. Conclusion: Thus valproic acid due to its antioxidant property can be concluded to be effective treatment or preventive option for diabetic neuropathy. STZ causes increase in the level of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and this is reverse by treatment with valproic acid and by reducing the generation of free radicals it also increase in SOD & GSH level significantly.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{cognitive and}} motor functioning in children treated for brain tumours. To also assess processing speed {{as a possible}} mediator in the outcomes of children treated for medulloblastoma in the posterior fossa. Design: A cross-sectional design was used. There were two groups. Children treated for medulloblastomas, and an age and gender matched non-CNS control group of children treated for Wilm's tumours. There were 14 participants in each group. Participants were aged between nine and 16 years old. Methods: Participants were assessed using measures for processing speed, attention, fine motor and visual <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> Long-term outcomes were assessed using measures of intelligence (IQ), academic achievement, adaptive functioning, social functioning, and resilience. Results: There were {{significant differences between the}} two groups. Participants treated for medulloblastoma were significantly impaired on measures of processing speed, attention, fine motor and visual <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination.</b> The medulloblastoma group performance was also significantly worse on measures of IQ, academic, adaptive, and social functioning. Interestingly, processing speed was found to be a significant mediator in the outcomes measured. When processing speed was co- varied, the group differences were no longer significant. Conclusion: The results of this study offer information on the impact of medulloblastoma on cognitive and motor abilities. It also offers novel information concerning the processing speed as a possible mediator in long-term outcomes of 3 children treated for medulloblastoma. This information will help with the design of interventions to target specific deficits. This will also provide additional information on the links between processing speed and outcomes. 4 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoids (GCs) such as {{dexamethasone}} (DEX) or betamethasone are repeatedly administered {{for up to}} a {{month to}} prematurely born infants as a treatment for chronic lung dysfunction. Results of clinical trials have shown that the use of GCs in these infants induces long-term deficits in neuromotor function and cognition. We have previously shown that a single exposure to clinically relevant doses of DEX or other GCs in the mouse during a period corresponding to the human perinatal period produces a dramatic increase in apoptotic cell death of neural progenitor cells in the developing cerebellum. To provide a model approximating more chronic clinical dosing regimens, we evaluated possible behavioral effects resulting from repeated exposures to DEX and subsequent GC-induced neuronal loss where neonatal mouse pups were injected with 3. 0 mg/kg DEX or saline on postnatal days 7, 9, and 11 (DEX 3 treatment). Adult, DEX 3 -treated mice exhibited long-term, possibly permanent, neuromotor deficits on a complex activity wheel task, which requires higher-order <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> skills. DEX 3 mice exhibited impaired performance on this task relative to saline controls in each of two independent studies involving separate cohorts of mice. Histopathology studies utilizing stereological neuronal counts conducted in behaviorally-tested mice showed that the DEX 3 treatment resulted in a significant {{decrease in the number of}} neurons in the internal granule layer (IGL) of the cerebellum, although the number of neurons in the Purkinje cell layer were unchanged. The results suggest that multiple neonatal DEX exposures can produce chronic deficits in fine <b>motor</b> <b>co-ordination</b> that are associated with cerebellar IGL neuronal loss...|$|E
