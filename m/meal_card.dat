40|$|Air {{transport}} {{is one of}} the world’s fastest-growing industries. Today’s {{worldwide tourism}} and international exchange of goods and services would not be possible without aircraft. Solid waste management and disposal {{is one of the}} most significant issues in the environmental management of the airline industry. In this study, a waste composition analysis was conducted for in-flight service waste, and potential waste minimisation measures were evaluated. The total in-flight waste was estimated to be up to 500 kg per flight, including food waste, and galley and cabin waste. The waste composition analysis showed that paper (mainly newspaper, <b>meal</b> menu <b>cards,</b> etc.) was the largest component, ranging from 32 to 71 % by weight of the total galley and cabin waste. Another major component was plastic items. Transparent polystyrene drinking cups and food covers accounted for up to 13 % of the total weight. Aluminium cans accounted for up to 4 % of the total waste. These recyclable materials can be sorted on board to facilitate the waste reduction and recycling programme. The proposed on board sorting and collection programmes can achieve a recycling rate of as much as 45 - 58 % of the total galley and cabin waste from in-flight services.

40|$|Using whole, {{unprocessed}} food (True Food) to {{make dinner}} for weeknights {{can often be}} a daunting task for busy families. There are several barriers that keep parents and children (ages 6 - 10) from cooking nutritious meals together on a regular basis—the main barrier being time. This thesis identified the narrow window of time between when a family arrives home and when they eat dinner {{as an opportunity to}} help members of the family to spend valuable time together. This research poses the question: Can a design system help families involve their six- to ten-year-old chidren in preparing True Foods for weeknight dinners? The result is Family Mise en Place, a set of collaborative Meal Cards. This collaborative cooking system seeks to organize meal preparation so children can contribute equally to cooking, supporting parents on busy weeknights. Family Mise en Place facilitates inclusive cross-generational cooking, helping families build dialogue and learn from one another. A secondary objective is to connect parents and children to the food they eat. Within this context, family members explore sustainability and health implicitly through the experience of cooking with True Foods. Family Mise en Place came together by pairing participant research with theories of systems thinking, constructivist learning and Information Interaction Design, supported by an investigation into the history of the North American food system. Research involved interviewing Current Parents (CP; those raising children ages 6 - 10) as well as Empty-Nesters (EN; those fifteen or more years removed from raising pre-teen children). It also involved a web survey of Current Parents and ethnographic cooking activities with Children (C). Finally, prototype testing consisted of observing families cooking together using the <b>Meal</b> <b>Card</b> prototypes. The outcome of this thesis is a toolkit that breaks the cooking experience into three stages: Gather, Prepare and Cook. Each stage is depicted through a Meal Framework, which is a series of Meal Cards that uses iconography children can understand, makes cooking accessible, and enables kids to contribute to preparing the family meal.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how school meals are {{organized}} in a selection of Stockholm's secondary schools and to examine the relationship between school meals and the different parameters that indicate each school's symbolic capital and educational capital.  By looking at the statistics from each school on the basis of the final grade average, percentage of pupils with foreign background and gender, I examine whether it is possible to see a relationship between how schools organize meals and which pupils attend the school.   In my study, I systematically went through each school's website and tried to identify how school meals at each school are organized.  To increase the validity of the study, I have also conducted a questionnaire survey by mail addressed to school principals.    In order to analyse and understand my results and put them in relation to my current knowledge about the schools in my sample, I am using Bourdieu's theoretical tools that a given aid, both in methodological and analytical purpose.  Based on Bourdieu's theories of symbolic capital, cultural capital and educational capital, I can understand and analyse school meals are organized and focused as part of schools' symbolic assets in competition with other schools.    The first part of the study shows that there are four different organizational models for school meals, fully equipped kitchen and canteen, heating kitchen and canteen, school meals in restaurants and school <b>meal</b> <b>card.</b>     In the second part, I have examined the relationship between the type of organization for school meals used and the symbolic resources available at the school.  I can conclude from the results that it is difficult to find a correlation between the symbolic resources and the different categories. But even though it is not possible to see all the schools' symbolic assets equally clear, there are still some very telling examples.  In many ways, these examples can be seen as polar opposites to each other based on Mikael Palme’s concepts ”goal rational” and ”education oriented” schools...|$|E
