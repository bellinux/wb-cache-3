40|$|Stratospheric ozone is {{of major}} {{interest}} as it absorbs most harmful UV {{radiation from the}} sun, allowing life on Earth. Ground-based microwave remote sensing is the only method that allows for the measurement of ozone profiles up to the mesopause, over 24 hours and under different weather conditions with high time resolution. In this paper a novel ground-based microwave radiometer is presented. It is called GROMOS-C (GRound based Ozone MOnitoring System for Campaigns), {{and it has been}} designed to measure the vertical profile of ozone distribution in the middle atmosphere by observing ozone emission spectra at a frequency of 110. 836 GHz. The instrument is designed in a compact way which makes it transportable and suitable for outdoor use in campaigns, an advantageous feature that is lacking in present day ozone radiometers. It is operated through remote control. GROMOS-C is a total power radiometer which uses a pre-amplified heterodyne receiver, and a digital fast Fourier transform spectrometer for the spectral analysis. Among its main new features, the incorporation of different calibration loads stands out; this includes a noise diode and a new type of blackbody target specifically designed for this instrument, based on Peltier elements. The calibration scheme does not depend on the use of liquid nitrogen; therefore GROMOS-C can be operated at remote places with no maintenance requirements. In addition, the instrument can be switched in frequency to observe the CO line at 115 GHz. A description of the main characteristics of GROMOS-C is included in this paper, as well as the results of a first campaign at the High Altitude Research Station at Jungfraujoch (HFSJ), Switzerland. The validation is performed by comparison of the retrieved profiles against equivalent profiles from MLS (<b>Microwave</b> <b>Limb</b> <b>Sounding)</b> satellite data, ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast) model data, as well as our nearby NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) ozone radiometer measuring at Bern...|$|R

50|$|On {{the third}} day of the mission, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) was {{deployed}} from Discovery's payload bay 350 statute miles above Earth to study human effects on the planet's atmosphere and its shielding ozone layer. The UARS mission objectives were to provide an increased understanding of the energy input into the upper atmosphere, global photochemistry of the upper atmosphere, dynamics of the upper atmosphere, the coupling among these processes, and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. This provided data for a coordinated study of the structure, chemistry, energy balance, and physical action of the Earth's middle atmosphere - thatslice of air between 10 and 60 miles above the Earth. The UARS was the first major flight element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a multi-year global research program that would use ground-based, airborne, and space-based instruments to study the Earth as a complete environmental system. UARS had ten sensing and measuring devices: Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES); Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS); <b>Microwave</b> <b>Limb</b> <b>Sounder</b> (MLS); Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI); Wind Imaging Interferometer (WlNDII); Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM); Solar/Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE); Particle Environment Monitor (PEM) and Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM II).

40|$|Since May 2009 {{high-resolution}} Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) {{solar absorption}} spectra are recorded at Addis Ababa (9. 01 ° N latitude, 38. 76 ° E longitude, 2443 m altitude a. s. l.), Ethiopia. The vertical profiles and total column amounts of ozone (O 3) are deduced from the spectra {{by using the}} retrieval code PROFFIT (V 9. 5) and regularly determined instrumental line shape (ILS). A detailed error analysis of the O 3 retrieval is performed. Averaging kernels analysis of the target gas shows that the major contribution to the retrieved information always comes from the measurement. We obtained 2. 1 degrees of freedom on average for signals in the retrieval of O 3 from the observed FTIR spectra. We have compared the FTIR retrieval of ozone Volume Mixing Ratio (VMR) profiles and column amounts with the coincident satellite observations of <b>Microwave</b> <b>Limb</b> <b>Sounding</b> (MLS), Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Atmospheric Infrared Sounding (AIRS) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME- 2) instrument. The mean relative differences are generally found below + 15 % in the altitude range of 27 to 36 km for comparison of VMR profiles made between MLS and MIPAS, whereas comparison with TES has shown below 9. 4 % relative difference. Furthermore, the mean relative difference is positive above 31 km, suggesting positive bias in the FTIR measurement of O 3 VMR with respect to MLS, MIPAS and TES. The overall comparisons of column amounts of satellite measurements with the ground-based FTIR instruments show better agreement exhibiting mean relative differences of ground-based FTIR with respect to MLS and GOME- 2 within + 0. 4 % to + 4. 0 % and corresponding standard deviations of 2. 2 to 4. 3 % whereas, {{in the case of}} OMI, TES, AIRS, the mean relative differences are from − 0. 38 to − 6. 8 %.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three different projects {{related to the}} remote sensing of Earth's atmosphere. The first part, comprising Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, focuses on the retrieval of Level 1 product, particularly the effect of aerosol scattering in the remote sensing of greenhouse gases. In Chapter 2, we study the aerosol induced bias in the retrieval of column averaged CO 2 mixing ratios (X CO 2). Ground based remote sensing data from the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS) are used. We employ a numerical radiative transfer model to simulate the impacts of neglecting aerosol scattering on the CO 2 and O 2 slant column densities (SCDs) operationally retrieved from CLARS-FTS measurements. These simulations show that the CLARS-FTS operational retrieval algorithm likely underestimates CO 2 and O 2 abundances over the LA basin in scenes with moderate aerosol loading. The bias in the CO 2 and O 2 abundances due to neglecting aerosol scattering cannot be canceled by ratioing {{each other in the}} derivation of the operational product of X CO 2. We propose a method for approximately correcting the aerosol-induced bias. Results for CLARS X CO 2 are compared to the direct-sun X CO 2 retrievals from a nearby Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) station. In Chapter 3, we explain why large X CO 2 retrieval errors are found over deserts in the space borne Orbiting Carbon Observatory- 2 (OCO- 2) data. We argue that these errors are caused by the surface albedo being close to a critical surface albedo (α c). Over a surface with albedo close to α c, increasing the aerosol optical depth (AOD) does not change the continuum radiance. The spectral signature caused by changing the AOD is identical to that caused by changing the absorbing gas column. The degeneracy in the retrievals of AOD and X CO 2 results in a loss of degrees of freedom (DOF) and information content (H). We employ a radiative transfer model to study the physical mechanism of X CO 2 retrieval error over a surface with albedo close to αc. Based on retrieval tests over surfaces with different albedos, we conclude that over a surface with albedo close to α c, the X CO 2 retrieval suffers from a significant loss of accuracy. In the Appendix, we put in a Chapter based on my work with Prof. Andrew Thompson on ocean The second part, mainly in Chapter 4, focuses on the application of Level 2 product. In this Chapter, we examine the uncertainties in middle atmospheric HO x chemistry by comparing the Aura <b>Microwave</b> <b>Limb</b> <b>Sound</b> (MLS) OH and HO 2 measurements with the simulations of the Caltech-JPL KINETICS photochemical model. The model using the standard chemical kinetics underestimates OH and HO 2 concentrations in the mesosphere. To resolve the discrepancies, we use MLS OH and HO 2 measurements as benchmark to adjust the involved chemical rate coefficients within reasonable uncertainty ranges with an optimal estimation algorithm. The results show that four key reaction rate constants and the O 2 cross section at Lyman-α (121. 6 nm) are the most sensitive parameters for determining the HO x profiles. We conclude that the rate coefficient of H + O 2 + M → HO 2 + M requires a very large adjustment beyond the uncertainty limits recommended in the NASA Data Evaluation, which suggests the need for future laboratory measurements. An alternative explanation is that radiative association plays a significant role in this process, i. e. H + O 2 → HO 2 + hv, which has never been measured or computed. In the Appendix, we put in a Chapter based on my work with Prof. Andrew Thompson on ocean submesoscale turbulence. ...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{radiometry}} requires solving an inversion problem due to {{the indirect}} nature of the measurements. Traditional iterative methods for non-linear inversions are computationally intensive and faster algorithms are desirable. This work contributes by developing a technique for fast inversion of <b>microwave</b> <b>limb</b> sounding observations of the atmosphere. The technique uses multilayer perceptrons, a type of neural network, to perform a non-linear regression between the spectra measured by the sensor and the atmospheric species to be retrieved. There is theoretical grounding to propose this inversion method, but its implementation is far from trivial and the practical realization can have a large impact on the solutions obtained. The retrieval algorithm is implemented by training a set of multilayer perceptrons {{with a set of}} species realizations and the corresponding spectra. The objective is to provide a model of the conditional distribution of the species state for each given measurement. The set is generated by first randomly disturbing a set of mean species states and then running a forward model on the generated species realizations. This is followed by an eigenvector expansion technique that reduces the dimensionality of the spectral space. Then the topology of the multilayer perceptrons is decided, followed by a training that finds the most probable weights for the given training set. The retrieval algorithm has been practically tested by inverting simulated and measured spectra from the sub-millimetre <b>limb</b> <b>sounder</b> Odin-SMR. First retrievals from simulated data showed that the new technique compared well with an iterative approach based on optimal estimation, but doing much faster inversions. First tests on real data confirmed the previous results, but also showed the sensitivity of the technique to spectral artefacts. The operational iterative inversions are much slower but seem to have an advantage here. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is a promising technique for fast inversion of well characterised <b>limb</b> <b>sounder</b> observations...|$|R

Simulated brightness temperatures most strongly depend on particle size, ice mass content and cloud altitude. The impact of particle shape is much smaller, but still significant.
