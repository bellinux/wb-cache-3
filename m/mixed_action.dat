40|$|Abstract. In {{probabilistic}} game structures, probabilistic alternating simulation (PA-simulation) relations preserve formulas {{defined in}} prob-abilistic alternating-time temporal logic {{with respect to}} the behaviour of a subset of players. We propose a partition based algorithm for com-puting the largest PA-simulation. It is to our knowledge the first such algorithm that works in polynomial time. Our solution extends the gen-eralised coarsest partition problem (GCPP) to a game-based setting with mixed strategies. The algorithm has higher complexities than those in the literature for non-probabilistic simulation and probabilistic simula-tion without <b>mixed</b> <b>actions,</b> but slightly improves the existing result for computing probabilistic simulation with respect to <b>mixed</b> <b>actions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>action</b> {{theories}} with chirally symmetric valence fermions exhibit very desirable features both at {{the level}} of the lattice calculations as well as in the construction and implementation of the low energy <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> effective field theory. In this work we show that when such a <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> effective field theory is projected onto the valence sector, both the Lagrangian and the extrapolation formulae become universal in form through next to leading order, for all variants of discretization methods used for the sea fermions. Our conclusion relies on the chiral nature of the valence quarks. The result implies that for all sea quark methods which are in the same universality class as QCD, the numerical values of the physical coefficients in the various <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> chiral Lagrangians will be the same up to lattice spacing dependent corrections. This allows us to construct a prescription to determine the <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> extrapolation formulae for a large class of hadronic correlation functions computed in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory at the one-loop level. For specific examples, we apply this prescription to the nucleon twist- 2 matrix elements and the nucleon-nucleon system. In addition, we determine the <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> extrapolation formula for the neutron EDM as this provides a nice example of a Θ-dependent observable; these observables are exceptions to our prescription. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss a}} Lattice QCD <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> {{investigation}} employing Wilson maximally twisted mass sea and overlap valence fermions. Using four {{values of the}} lattice spacing, we demonstrate that the overlap Dirac operator assumes a point-like locality in the continuum limit. We also show that by adopting suitable matching conditions for the sea and valence theories a consistent continuum limit for the pion decay constant and light baryon masses can be obtained. Finally, we confront results for sea-valence mixed meson masses and the valence scalar correlator with corresponding expressions of chiral perturbation theory. This allows us to extract low energy constants of <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> chiral perturbation which characterize the strength of unitarity violations in our <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> setup.

40|$|We {{calculate}} isospin 2 pion-pion scattering in chiral {{perturbation theory}} for a partially quenched, <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> theory with Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks and staggered sea quarks. We {{point out that}} for some scattering channels, the power-law volume dependence of two pion states in nonunitary theories such as partially quenched or <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> QCD is identical to that of QCD. Thus one can extract infinite volume scattering parameters from <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> simulations. We then determine the scattering length for both 2 and 2 + 1 sea quarks in the isospin limit. The scattering length, when {{expressed in terms of}} the pion mass and the decay constant measured on the lattice, has no contributions from mixed valence-sea mesons, thus it does not depend upon the parameter, C_Mix, that appears in the chiral Lagrangian of the mixed theory. In addition, the contributions which nominally arise from operators appearing in the <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> O(a^ 2 m_q) Lagrangian exactly cancel when the scattering length is written in this form. This is in contrast to the scattering length expressed in terms of the bare parameters of the chiral Lagrangian, which explicitly exhibits all the sicknesses and lattice spacing dependence allowed by a partially quenched <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> theory. These results hold for both 2 and 2 + 1 flavors of sea quarks. Comment: 27 pages, 3 figures. Mistakes corrected in Eqs. (37), (42). Improved discussion in section 4 and related results in Eqs.

40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>action</b> lattice {{calculations}} {{allow for}} an additive lattice spacing dependent mass renormalization of mesons composed of one sea and one valence quark, {{regardless of the}} type of fermion discretization methods used in the valence and sea sectors. The value of the mass renormalization depends upon the lattice actions used. This mixed meson mass shift is an important lattice artifact to determine for <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> calculations; because it modifies the pion mass, it plays {{a central role in the}} low energy dynamics of all hadronic correlation functions. We determine the leading order, O(a^ 2), and next to leading order, O(a^ 2 m_π^ 2), additive mass shift of valence-sea mesons for a mixed lattice action with domain-wall valence fermions and rooted staggered sea fermions, relevant to the majority of current large scale <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> lattice efforts. We find that on the asqtad improved coarse MILC lattices, this additive mass shift is well parameterized in lattice units by Δ(am) ^ 2 = 0. 034 (2) - 0. 06 (2) (a m_π) ^ 2, which in physical units, using a= 0. 125 fm, corresponds to Δ(m) ^ 2 = (291 ± 8 MeV) ^ 2 - 0. 06 (2) m_π^ 2. In terms of the <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> effective field theory parameters, the corresponding mass shift is given by a^ 2 Δ_Mix = (316 ± 4 MeV) ^ 2 at leading order plus next-to-leading order corrections including the necessary chiral logarithms for this <b>mixed</b> <b>action</b> calculation, determined in this work. Within the precision of our calculation, one can not distinguish between the full next-to-leading order effective field theory analysis of this additive mixed meson mass shift and the parameterization given above.

The decondensation of monopoles is responsible for this phase transition just as in the zero temperature case.
