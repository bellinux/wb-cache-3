40|$|A simple {{modification}} to Einstein’s {{theory of}} gravity {{in terms of}} a non-Riemannian connection is examined. A new tensor-variational approach yields field equations that possess a covariance similar to the gauge covariance of electromagnetism. These equations are shown to possess solutions analogous to those found in the Einstein-Maxwell system. In particular one finds gravi-electric and gravi-magnetic charges contributing to a spherically symmetric static Reissner-Nordström metric. Such Weyl “charges ” provide a source for the non-Riemannian torsion and metric gradient fields instead of the electromagnetic field. The theory suggests that matter may be endowed with gravitational charges that couple to gravity in a manner analogous to electromagnetic couplings in an electromagnetic field. The nature of gravitational coupling to spinor matter in this theory is also investigated and a solution exhibiting a plane-symmetric gravitational <b>metric</b> <b>wave</b> coupled via non-Riemannian waves to a propagating spinor field is presented...|$|E

30|$|Deterministic and {{probabilistic}} approaches reached commonly accepted formulations in use {{for assessing}} the tsunami hazard in various coastal zones around the world. The deterministic, also called scenario-based, approach uses a particular source scenario (maximum credible or worst-case scenario) to calculate the ensuing tsunami impact at the coastal areas of interest (Tinti and Armigliato 2003; Tinti et al. 2005; Løvholt et al. 2006; Lorito et al. 2008; Harbitz et al. 2012; Omira et al. 2013). The products of this method consist of maps depicting the wave height, the coastal inundation and the flow velocity. The probabilistic approach, on the other hand, estimates the likelihood of tsunami impact taking into consideration {{a broad range of}} near- and far-field potential sources as well as a treatment of the uncertainties on the hazard assessment (Geist and Parsons 2006). Probabilistic analysis involves full hazard curves at each coastal point of interest, from which the probability exceedance maps can be derived for any tsunami hazard <b>metric</b> (<b>wave</b> height, inundation depth, current speed, etc.) (Geist and Lynett 2014; Grezio et al. 2017).|$|E

40|$|Rhodotrons are {{electron}} accelerators {{based on}} the principle of "re-circulating" a beam through successive diameters of a single coaxial cavity resonating in <b>metric</b> <b>waves.</b> Such design makes it possible to achieve CW acceleration of electron beams to high energies. The original design principle of the Rhodotron was first proposed in 1989 by J. Pottier from the French Atomic Energy Agency (CEA), who suggested the use of a half-wavelength coaxial cavity, shorted at both ends to accelerate electrons. The principle of operation of the Rhodotron has already been described in length in previous articles. The first industrial Rhodotron (referred as model 1 T- 200) was built in 1993 at IBA Belgium. It exceeded its expected performances in 1994 with a maximum beam output power of 110 kW at 10 MeV (100 kW expected), and a high power efficiency of 38 % at full beam power (25 % expected). Three industrial Rhodotron systems ranging from 35 kW to 200 kW beam power at 10 MeV have been completely designed, and are routinely manufactured at IBA's facilities in Louvain-la-Neuve. Specifications of these industrial accelerators were chosen in order {{to address the needs of}} the market of industrial irradiation for simple, compact and reliable high-power EB units.

The microwave emission of the loop leg has less pulsation but stronger emission. Through the estimation of plasma density around the loop top from EUV observations, {{we find that the}} local plasma frequency would be 1. 5 GHz or even higher. Thus, type III bursts at 700 MHz originate above the loop top. Quasi-periodic acceleration or injection of energetic electrons is proposed to dominate these in-phase QPPs of nonthermal emission from footpoints, loop top, and above. In the overlying region, drifting pulsations (DPS) at 200 – 600 MHz oscillate at a distinct period (200 s). Its global structure drifts toward lower frequency, which is closely related to upward plasmoids observed simultaneously from EUV emission. Hence, nonthermal emission from overlying plasmoids and underlying flaring loops show different oscillating periods.

Today, however, 10 MeV RF electron linacs are frequently limited {{to an average}} beam power of only 20 or 30 kW. To achieve higher beam power, CW operation {{and the use of}} lower frequencies are necessary. In the last years, the principle for a new kind of electron accelerator was developed by the Atomic Energy Agency (CEA) in France. This accelerator is based on the principle of recirculating a beam throughout a single coaxial cavity resonating in <b>metric</b> <b>waves.</b> A 3. 3 MeV, 4 mA prototype has been built and successfully tested. The industrial accelerator developed by IBA in collaboration with the CEA is a 10 MeV, 100 kW beam power unit with an additional beam exit at 5 MeV.
