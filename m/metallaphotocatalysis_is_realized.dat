40|$|Tay [6] {{characterized}} the multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-bar frameworks. Subsequently, Tay [7] and Whiteley [11] independently {{characterized the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge frameworks. We adapt Whiteley’s proof technique {{to characterize the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-bar-and-hinge frameworks. More importantly, we obtain a sufficient condition for a multigraph to <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge framework in which all hinges lie in the same hyperplane. This result is related to a longstanding conjecture of Tay and Whiteley [8] which would characterize when a multigraph can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-andhinge framework {{in which all the}} hinges incident to each body lie in a common hyperplane. As a corollary we deduce that if a graph G has two spanning trees which use each edge of G at most twice, then its square can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid 3 -dimensional bar-and-joint framework...|$|R
