It's part of our TV heritage and definitely worthy of resuscitation." ...|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E

You don't meet many strangers an' I sort of hit you wrong--makin' you feel too much--an' talk too much. Who an' {{what you are}} is none of my business. But we met.... An' I reckon somethin' has happened--perhaps {{more to me than}} to you.... Now let me put you straight about clothes an' women. Reckon I know most women love nice things to wear an' think because clothes make them look pretty that they're nicer or better. But they're wrong. You're wrong. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>'d</b> be too much for a girl like you to be happy without clothes. But you can be--you axe just as nice, an'--an' fine--an', for all you know, a good deal more appealin' to some men." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a March 2009, {{interview}} with NME Radio, when discussing a potential Libertines reunion, Doherty revealed, [...] "He [...] was saying, 'Well, look, what if it's all gonna happen again?' and I said, 'One thing: <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will,</b> maybe it won't, {{but one thing}} that's {{going to help me}} not fuck up again is you, and doing all that together.' Because he means a lot..." [...] Referring to their relationship in a January 2010 interview, Barât said: [...] "...it's a deep love. Deep love does funny things to people".|$|E
2500|$|Iranian Jews {{might be}} related to their desire for {{survival}} and led to their overselling of their anti-Israel positions. Their response to the questions regarding Israel have been outright denial of Israel or staying quiet. An example of the dilemma of Iranian Jews can be observed in this example :"We hear the ayatollah say that Israel was cooperating with the Shah and SAVAK, and we would be fools to say we support Israel. So we just keep quiet about it... <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> work out. Anyway, what can we do? This is our home." ...|$|E
2500|$|While a {{recognized}} [...] "advocate for ordinary women", Lynn has often criticized upper-middle-class feminism for ignoring {{the needs and}} concerns of working-class women. She once stated, [...] "I'm {{not a big fan}} of Women's Liberation, but <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> help women stand up for the respect they're due". Along these lines, her music has ranged from [...] "The Pill" [...] and [...] "Rated X" [...] to more culturally conservative gospel albums. She allowed PETA to use her song [...] "I Wanna Be Free" [...] in a public service campaign to discourage the chaining of dogs outside.|$|E

The song lacks energy or a good melody, seemingly constructed without a real master plan. There is also a German CD single for [...] "Designing Heaven" [...] with mixes by Altern-8 and Georgio Moroder. Non of the remixes set the song on fire, but seem serviceable enough for clubs." ...|$|R

2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - I {{carefully}} move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> give you somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Stirling {{was nearly}} fifteen, {{his father was}} given command of the old sloop-of-war , the {{receiving}} ship at the Washington Navy Yard. CDR Stirling moved his family from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., where the family set up comfortable, but cramped living quarters on the Dale. Stirling was delighted with the change, and when he wasn't at school, enjoyed sailing on the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers in a boat that the Dale's sailors had rigged for him. Thrown in with the sons of naval officers at the Navy Yard, he soon realized that like himself, most aspired to naval careers. When Yates, Jr. was fifteen, his father had taken him to the White House {{for the purpose of}} meeting President Grover Cleveland and requesting an appointment to Annapolis for his son. Dressed in shorts, that Stirling later regretted wearing since they accentuated his youthful looks, he recalled Cleveland telling his father, [...] "Why, Commander, your son looks too young to go to Annapolis this year. <b>Maybe</b> next, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be possible. Shall I have his name put down for an appointment then?" ...|$|R

40|$|The Health Ministry's {{announcement}} {{last week}} that it is working on a proposal to cap the prices of more than 1, 000 essential medicines is welcome, though the move is long overdue. For a long time, the question of drugs has been a bone of contention between Malaysian health activists and consumers. The last time Malaysia discussed this issue was almost a decade ago but it was of little avail. <b>Maybe</b> this time <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be different. A survey recently (NST, May 9) showed that many Malaysians pay exorbitant prices for their medicines. In fact, drug prices in Malaysia are far above the international reference pricing, a guide on how much medicine should cost. The ministry's list of essential medicines will include antibiotics, aspirin and other painkillers, as well as medicines for high blood pressure and depression...|$|R
