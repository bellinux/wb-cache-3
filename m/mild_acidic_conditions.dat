50|$|The Dakin {{oxidation}} {{can occur}} in <b>mild</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions</b> as well, with a mechanism analogous to the base-catalyzed mechanism. In methanol, hydrogen peroxide, and catalytic sulfuric acid, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated (14), after which hydrogen peroxide adds as a nucleophile to the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate (15). Following an intramolecular proton transfer (16,17), the tetrahedral intermediate collapses, 1,2-aryl migration occurs, and water is eliminated (18). Nucleophilic addition of methanol to the carbonyl carbon forms another tetrahedral intermediate (19). Following a second intramolecular proton transfer (20,21), the tetrahedral intermediate collapses, eliminating a phenol and forming an ester protonated at the carbonyl oxygen (22). Finally, deprotonation of the carbonyl oxygen yields the collected products and regenerates the acid catalyst (23).|$|E

There exist many different reactions to oxidize aldehydes, but only a few are amenable to a broad range of functional groups. The Pinnick oxidation has proven to be both tolerant of sensitive functionalities and capable of reacting with sterically hindered groups. This reaction is especially useful for oxidizing α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, and another one of its advantages is its relatively low cost.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} {{optimization}} step using Ex 4 -yeasts {{as a model}} for our novel functional assay system, we remarkably found that DMEM buffered at neutral pH designed for mammalian cell culture was very suitable for yeast peptide secretion and GLP 1 R activation in mammalian cells, even though yeast cells could not grow in the medium. Another remarkable point in this culture system is a protection of the target peptides from degradation by yeast-derived proteases. Because heterologous proteins produced in yeasts could be degraded during several steps, including the intracellular secretory pathways and the post-secreted extracellular environment (Idiris et al. 2010), yeast-derived proteases such as Yps 1 p and Kex 2 p, which are most active at a <b>mild</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>condition</b> around pH 5.0, are considered accessible to heterologous proteins, especially when yeasts are incubated in SDC medium, which generally has pH 4.5 – 5.5 (Mizuno et al. 1989; Olsen et al. 1999).

Results suggest that thermal process at 100 ̊C increased the amount of free sucrose but significantly decreased the amount of lysine. Sweetness of soymilk could be simply enhanced. Evaporation of soymilk caused a higher reduction of lysine than thermal processing at 100 °C, indicating that complexation and Maillard reactions of lysine could be enhanced. The arginine content also decreased, albeit in less quantities. The changes of molecular conformation could also be monitored. In particular, resonances associated with the side-chain of valine were observed when most proteins were unfolded at high temperature. In <b>mild</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>condition</b> using glucono-delta-lactone as a coagulant, the amount of lysine was maintained higher than thermal process and evaporation while sucrose content was reduced.

Under <b>mild</b> <b>acidic</b> or neutral <b>conditions,</b> the lifetime ofcarbinol-amide is {{long enough to be}} fully characterized. This metabolitehas been characterized using specifically labeled 14 C-methyl tentoxin isotopomers,HPLC, HPLC-MS, MS-MS and NMR. Under stronger acidic conditions,the stability of this metabolite vanishes through deformylation. A theoretical mechanistic investigation reveals that the stability is governedby the accessibility of the nitrogen lone pair and its protonation state. Forcarbinol-amines, even in neutral conditions, the energy barrier for deformylationis low enough to allow rapid deformylation. Carbinol-amide behavesdifferently. Under neutral conditions, delocalization of the nitrogen lonepair increases the energy barrier of deformylation that is a slow processunder such conditions. After protonation, we were able to optimize adeformylation transition that is lower in energy and thus accounts for thelower stability of carbinol-amides observed experimentally in <b>acidic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Finally, by considering the protocol usually used for extraction andanalysis of this type of metabolite, carbinol-amide may thus be frequentlyignored in drug metabolism pathways...|$|R

Complete conjugation of the activated linkers to Cys 34 of human serum albumin was obtained in about 2 h.

The theme of this dissertation was to develop and use mass spectrometry based tools to solve five biologically oriented problems associated with protein architecture and extend the utility of these tools to study protein polymer conjugation. ^ The first problem involved elucidating the false negatives of how proteins with few basic residues, forms highly charged ions in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This study showed that the unfolding of polypeptide chains in solution leads {{to the emergence of}} highly charged protein ions in ESI MS mass spectra, even if the polypeptide chains lack a sufficient number of basic sites. In the second problem, a new technique was developed that can monitor small-scale conformational transitions that triggers protein activity and inactivity using porcine pepsin as a model protein. This work allowed us to revise a commonly accepted scenario of pepsin inactivation and denaturation. The physiological relevance of an enzyme-substrate complex was probed in our third problem. We observed by ESI MS that pepsin forms a facile complex with a substrate protein, N-lobe transferrin under mildly acidic pH. The observed complex could either be a true enzyme-substrate complex or may likely results from an electrostatically driven association. Our investigation suggested that the enzyme binds nonspecifically to substrate proteins under <b>mild</b> <b>acidic</b> pH <b>conditions.</b> The fourth problem dealt with the investigation of conformational heterogeneity of natively unstructured proteins using a combination of spectroscopic techniques and ESI MS as tools. It was observed that four different conformations of alpha-synuclein coexist in equilibrium. One of these conformations appeared to be tightly folded. Conclusions regarding the nature of these states were made by correlating the abundance evolution of the conformers as a function of pH with earlier spectroscopic measurements. The final problem was aimed at monitoring conformational transitions in polypeptide and polymer segments of PEGylated proteins using PEGylated ubiquitin as a model system. This studies suggested that for a PEGylated protein, polypeptides maintain their folded conformation to a greater extent whiles the polymer segments are bound freely to the protein. ...|$|R
