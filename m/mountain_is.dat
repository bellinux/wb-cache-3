5|$|The name Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>is</b> a {{reference}} to the gently sloping plateau surface of this large volcano. It was adopted on December 21, 1944 as identified in the Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. This name appeared on the National Topographic System (NTS) map 104/NE but was replaced with the name Level Mountain Range on August 14, 1952 upon production of NTS map 104J. The reason for this name change was that cartographers were uncertain as to what the name Level Mountain referred to. They cited H. S. Bostock's 1948 report Physiography of the Canadian Cordillera, With Special Reference to the Area North of the Fifty-Fifth Parallel in which Bostock stated that Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>is</b> a small prominent mountain range on the Nahlin Plateau. Despite this misinterpretation, Level <b>Mountain</b> <b>is</b> still the local name for the entire massif and the Level Mountain Range for a range of steep peaks centered on the volcano's summit.|$|E

Then theologians remembered that all God's works served a purpose, and that the purpose of <b>mountains</b> <b>was</b> supplying rivers with water and offering a home for goats. A century later mountains become objects of the highest aesthetic admiration. It <b>was</b> forgotten that <b>mountains</b> <b>are</b> agriculturally unproductive.|$|R
