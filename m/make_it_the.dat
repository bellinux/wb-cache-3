5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots.

Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They {{may have been some}} of the new mass books that were being written at this time.

Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E

5|$|While Dürr {{assumes that}} Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 15 July 1714, other scholars arrive at different dates. John Eliot Gardiner and others assume Oculi that year which would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> earliest cantata performed after the promotion. It {{is his first}} extant church cantata for a solo voice, followed by , for soprano. The cantata {{is the first of}} four written for a single alto soloist, the others, all composed in 1726, being , Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, BWV 170, and , BWV 169, two of which also have texts by Lehms.|$|E
5|$|As {{was often}} the case with Celtic churches from this period, the church was {{associated}} with a well. It was built by the monks of Penmon and was believed to have healing powers by some people visiting it. It {{is probably one of the}} oldest buildings in Penmon. It has been said that the lower stone walls near the well were part of Seiriol's church in the 6th century; if so, this would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> oldest remaining Christian building in Wales. A small chamber surrounds the well. In modern times, water from the well has been used as a symbol of Anglesey by the island's representatives at the launch ceremony of the 10th International Island Games (held in Guernsey in June 2003) and the 11th Island Games (held in the Shetland Islands in July 2005).|$|E
5|$|Major venues for concerts include BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy.

Its four auditoria <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> largest venue on the south coast. The O2 and Pavilion are older and are both Grade II listed buildings. The O2, which opened in 1895 as the Grand Pavilion Theatre, was initially used as a circus and later for music hall theatre. The Pavilion opened in 1929 as concert hall and tea room while also providing a venue for the municipal orchestra. It continues to provide traditional entertainment today, presenting West End stage shows, ballet and operas. Bournemouth has more than 200 listed buildings, mainly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, including three grade I churches; St Peter's, St Clement's and St Stephen's.|$|E

The second phase has attracted funding of £4 million from West Dorset District Council and includes new Marks & Spencer and Waitrose stores.|$|E
5|$|Today Birmingham's {{economy is}} {{dominated}} by the service sector.

5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E
