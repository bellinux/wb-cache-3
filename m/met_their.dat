The British armed schooner Diana was also destroyed and its weaponry was appropriated by the Colonial side. This was the first naval capture of the war, and it was a significant boost to the morale of the Colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|The Tasmania Coroner, Mr Sorell, {{investigated}} {{the deaths of}} the 21 people whose bodies had been recovered. He determined that the causes of their deaths were multiple fractures and injuries but he was unable to say how or in what manner they <b>met</b> <b>their</b> deaths.|$|E

5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They <b>met</b> <b>their</b> deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from overseas in 1921, Cooper {{got a job}} working the night shift at The New York Times. He was commissioned to write articles for Asia magazine. Cooper was able to travel with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the Wisdom II. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he <b>met</b> <b>their</b> prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for Asia was published in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are <b>met,</b> <b>their</b> private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already <b>met</b> <b>their</b> specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline {{with the addition of}} a guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages. The knife is not available for purchase outside of NASA.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, the Spurs began {{featuring}} Ginóbili more regularly, starting him in {{half of the}} 77 {{regular season}} games in which he played. His statistics improved in all major categories, as he averaged 12.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game. During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs <b>met</b> <b>their</b> perennial rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2. While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game {{as he did in}} 2003, his playoff statistics improved significantly, with 13.0 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game.|$|E
5|$|Polikarpov {{was arrested}} and imprisoned by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of {{industrial}} sabotage when neither the I-6 nor the I-5 projects <b>met</b> <b>their</b> stipulated deadlines, and this delayed the first flight of the I-6 until 30 March 1930. The second prototype was completed shortly thereafter and both aircraft appeared in that year's May Day fly-past over Moscow. Both aircraft likely used imported engines before they were replaced by the Soviet-built copy of the Jupiter, the Shvetsov M-22. One I-6 crashed on 13 June 1930 after the test pilot bailed out, without justification, {{in the opinion of}} the Soviet aviation historian Vadim B. Shavrov.|$|E

5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none <b>met</b> <b>their</b> {{need for a}} {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|They <b>met</b> <b>their</b> first top-flight {{opposition}} in the fourth round, hosting Everton. After 120 goalless minutes, the match went to a penalty shootout in which Mendieta scored the winner after Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer saved from Leon Osman. The quarter-final at another Premier League team, Tottenham Hotspur, also went to a shootout. Darren Anderton scored for the hosts within 63 seconds, the first goal Boro conceded for over 11 hours. With four minutes to play, Middlesbrough striker Michael Ricketts equalised after a cross from George Boateng. The shootout, in which Schwarzer denied Mauricio Taricco and Kasey Keller blocked from Mendieta, went to sudden death, in which Middlesbrough's goalkeeper saved from Gus Poyet and Franck Queudrue scored Boro's winner.|$|E
5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} <b>met</b> <b>their</b> contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E

Arsenal have recorded more league victories against Everton than against any other club, having beaten them 94 times out of 192 attempts.|$|E
5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits and activities of the people he <b>met,</b> <b>their</b> customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{first team}} have competed {{in a number}} of nationally contested leagues, and their record against each club faced in those {{competitions}} is summarised below.

The team that Birmingham have played most in league competition is Manchester City, whom they first met as Ardwick in the 1891–92 Football Alliance season; they and Wolverhampton Wanderers have both beaten Birmingham 60 times, though Wolves took fewer matches to do so, with 127 compared to City's 134. Everton have drawn 35 league encounters with Birmingham, more than any other club. Birmingham have recorded more league victories against Leicester City than against any other club, having beaten them 50 times out of 124 attempts.|$|E
