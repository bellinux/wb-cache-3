40|$|ABSTRACT: Influences {{of thermal}} cycling (100 cycles between 200 and 300 C) and {{isothermal}} exposure (80 h at 300 C) on tensile strength, <b>micro</b> Vickers <b>hardness</b> and fracture mechanism of T 6 -SiCp/Al 6061 composites (SiCp/Al) and base metal of T 6 -Al 6061 alloy(AA 6061) were studied under {{the condition of}} the same hardness of the base metal for isothermal exposure and thermal cycling. Both thermal cycling and isothermal exposure reduced 0. 2 % proof stress, tensile strength and <b>micro</b> Vickers <b>hardness</b> to one third through a half of those of the original SiCp/Al 6061 composites and mainly due to the softening of the matrix. In addition, the thermal cycling caused interfacial debonding between coarse particles and matrix in the SiCp/Al, which was confirmed from the observation of fracture morphology. The reduction in 0. 2 % proof stress and tensile strength increased with increasing SiC particle volume fraction. It was shown empirically that 0. 2 % proof stress and tensile strength of thermally degraded composites can be described as a linear function of hardness, which provides a useful tool for further study since 0. 2 % proof stress and ultimate tensile strength can be inferred by this relation without tensile test.

For this purpose we use the self-generated atmospheric plasma spray system for coating of aluminium on the carbon steel substrate. The different thicknesses of coating are created. To evaluate this effect we use the several analyses such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, <b>Micro</b> <b>hardness</b> analysis by Vickers method, Adhesion strength analysis and electrochemical polarization test. The results are very interesting and show that due to low porosity, thicker layers are more homogeneous. The nanoparticles are observed in the thicker layers. The <b>micro</b> <b>hardness</b> tests show that the thicker layers have the better <b>micro</b> <b>hardness</b> value.

Die material AISI H 13, with typical hardness {{in the range of}} 42 to 48 HRC, offers high wear and corrosion resistance. However the cyclic high temperature conditions along with exposure to high viscosity molten metal in semi 6 solid forming cause the die to wear and crack with resultant shortened die lifetime. In this study, the thermal stability of die material at elevated temperature was investigated through <b>micro</b> 6 <b>hardness</b> testing and a metallographic study. AISI H 13 samples were laser glazed using CO 2 continuous wave mode laser with 10. 6 9 m wavelength. Samples were attached to a specially designed rotating chuck to enable it to be rotated at speeds up to 1500 rpm and allow flat surface glazing to take place. The microhardness was measured for as 6 glazed samples and annealed samples which were held at temperatures ranging from 550 oC to 800 oC with 50 oC intervals. The metallographic study conducted examined the formation of three zones at different depths which were the glazed zone, the heat affected zone and the substrate. As a result of rapid heating and cooling from the laser glazing process, a metallic glass layer was developed which exhibited an average <b>micro</b> 6 <b>hardness</b> of 900 HV when exposed to 3. 34 E+ 10 W/m 2 laser irradiance within a range of 3. 64 to 5. 66 ms exposure time.
