5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} was far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more {{hostile to the}} constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E

She considered {{the writing of}} songs for Ketika Cinta Bertasbih to be <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> her previous work in teen romances, {{as it was a}} religious film. As such, she felt that she had to be extra careful.|$|E

5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> general relativity, with the {{equations}} of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked about}} the {{possibility}} of a European release, Nintendo representatives said there were no plans for one, and remarked that preparing an RPG for release in Europe is far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> other regions due to the need to optimize the game for PAL TV systems and translate it into multiple languages.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> {{it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees proved <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} casting process for Friday the 13th was <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because {{thirteen}} young actors {{were involved in}} Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. s Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the songs}} on Demolition J-7 were written while Scott Kannberg and Jason Fawkes were in their {{short-lived}} band, Pa. After Stephen Malkmus heard demos recorded by Pa, the songs turned into a Pavement project. The recording session for Demolition J-7 was <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> for Slay Tracks due to tension between producer Gary Young and Fawkes. The EP received favorable reception from critics and fans, and solidified the band's cult fanbase.|$|E
5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots {{turned out to be}} <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the {{aircraft}} for the aerial shots.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants are dark greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber. Although it is readily propagated by seed, experiments with in vitro propagation found Banksia menziesii to be <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> other species trialled.|$|E

5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> for his {{previous}} films, since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because of the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg's work {{and because of the}} thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and Digging for Fire.|$|E
5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrene monarchy was new; {{allegiance}} {{was based}} on loyalty to Odaenathus, making the transfer of power to a successor <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> {{it would have been}} in an established monarchy. Odaenathus tried to ensure the dynasty's future by crowning his eldest son co-king, but both were assassinated. Zenobia, left to secure the Palmyrene succession and retain the loyalty of its subjects, emphasized the continuity between her late husband and his successor (her son). Vaballathus (with Zenobia orchestrating the process) assumed his father's royal titles immediately, and his earliest known inscription records him as King of Kings.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> first imagined. Workers {{followed}} an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they {{discovered}} a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Echo & the Bunnymen is {{the fifth}} studio album by the English post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen, their last with drummer Pete de Freitas, who died in 1989 in a {{motorcycle}} accident, aged 27. The album was produced by Laurie Latham who recorded the album in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool; this followed an aborted attempt at recording the album without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer, and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording of the album was <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>than</b> the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string-heavy.|$|E
