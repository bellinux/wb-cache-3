5|$|Kala Capital owned 45 {{percent of}} the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company company SakHidroEnergoMsheni, a joint stock company {{incorporated}} in Georgia in 1998. His candidacy as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> and Natural Resources in October 2012 was therefore overshadowed by concerns about a serious risk that a conflict of interests might arise. Reports {{on the same day}} indicated that Kaladze might refuse the energy portfolio or sell off his shares in Georgia Hydropower Construction Company within 10 days of his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Kaladze became {{involved}} in the politics of Georgia {{as a member of the}} opposition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Energy</b> in the cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012. The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.|$|E
