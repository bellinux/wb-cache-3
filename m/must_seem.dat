5|$|It <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> to {{the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were the days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
25|$|All warfare {{is based}} on deception. Hence, when {{we are able to}} attack, we <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.|$|E
25|$|The {{most potent}} {{offering}} was animal sacrifice, typically of domesticated {{animals such as}} cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the harmonisation of the earthly and divine, so the victim <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> willing to offer its own life {{on behalf of the}} community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first edition}} of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions ended with a chapter titled [...] "Progress through Revolutions", in which Kuhn spelled out his views {{on the nature of}} {{scientific}} progress.

2500|$|It is {{probable}} {{that many of these}} reports were exaggerated. It is certain that the “White Terror” also committed terrible deeds, even though its program contained no analogy to the “extermination of the bourgeoisie”. Nonetheless, the following question <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> permissible, even unavoidable: Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an “Asiatic” deed merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential victims of an “Asiatic” deed? Wasn’t the 'Gulag Archipelago' more original than Auschwitz? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical and factual prius of the [...] "racial murder" [...] of National Socialism? Cannot Hitler's most secret deeds be {{explained by the fact that}} he had not forgotten the rat cage? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a past that would not pass? ...|$|E
2500|$|In oratory, the toga {{came into}} its own. Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria (circa 95 AD) offers {{advice on how}} best to plead cases at Rome's law-courts, before the {{watching}} multitude's informed and critical eye. Effective pleading was a calculated artistic performance, but <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> utterly natural. First impressions counted; the lawyer must present himself as a Roman should: [...] "virile and splendid" [...] in his toga, with statuesque posture and [...] "natural good looks". He should be well groomed – but not too well; no primping of the hair, jewellery or any other [...] "feminine" [...] perversions of a Roman man's proper appearance. Quintillian gives precise instructions on the correct use of the toga – its cut, style, and the arrangements of its folds. Its fabric can be old-style rough wool, or new and smoother if preferred – but definitely not silk. The orator's movements should be dignified, and to the point; he should move only as he must, to address a particular person, a particular section of the audience. He should employ to good effect that subtle [...] "language of the hands" [...] for which Roman oratory was famed; no extravagant gestures, no wiggling of the shoulders, no moving [...] "like a dancer".|$|E

2500|$|The expulsions created {{major social}} {{disruptions}} in the receiving territories, which were tasked with providing housing and employment {{for millions of}} refugees. West Germany established a ministry dedicated to the problem, and several laws created a legal framework. The expellees established several organisations, some demanding compensation. Their grievances, while remaining controversial, were incorporated into public discourse. During 1945 the British press aired concerns over the refugees' situation; {{this was followed by}} limited discussion of the issue during the Cold War outside West Germany.s indication that in World War II, [...] "3 million German civilians died, perhaps two-thirds of them in forced expulsions from Eastern Europe" [...] (22 May 1995, p. 30) <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> surprising to many readers.| isbn=978-0-8139-1992-8}} East Germany sought to avoid alienating the Soviet Union and its neighbours; the Polish and Czechoslovakian governments characterised the expulsions as [...] "a just punishment for Nazi crimes". Western analysts were inclined to see the Soviet Union and its satellites as a single entity, disregarding the national disputes that had preceded the Cold War. The fall of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany opened the door to a renewed examination of the expulsions in both scholarly and political circles. A factor in the ongoing nature of the dispute may be the relatively large proportion of German citizens who were among the expellees and/or their descendants, estimated at about 20% in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu wrote from Cannes in The Daily Telegraph {{that the}} film [...] "at times comes close to being a tragi-comic opera {{about the end of}} the world," [...] and that, [...] "the apocalypse, when it comes, is so beautifully {{rendered}} {{that the film}} cements the quality of fairy tale that its palatial setting suggests." [...] About the actors' performances, Sandhu wrote: [...] "all of them are excellent here, but Dunst is exceptional, so utterly convincing in the lead role—trouble, serene, a fierce savant—that it feels like a career breakthrough. Meanwhile, Gainsbourg, for whom the end of the world <b>must</b> <b>seem</b> positively pastoral after the horrors she went through in Antichrist, locates in Claire a fragility that ensures she's more than a whipping girl for social satire." [...] Sandhu brought up one reservation in the review, in which he gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars: [...] "there is, as always with Von Trier's work, a degree of intellectual determinism that can be off-putting; he illustrates rather than truly explore ideas." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, called the film [...] "clunky" [...] and [...] "tiresome", judging it to be [...] "conceived with real passion or imagination", and not [...] "well written or convincingly acted in any way at all", and gave it two stars out of a possible five.|$|E
