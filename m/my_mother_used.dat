The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be looking at her no matter where she sat.|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{explained}} Maxinquayes {{title in}} an interview with Simon Reynolds: [...] "Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off"; Reynolds interpreted this as a [...] "place name" [...] similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his [...] "unsentimental grasp on reality", which was reflected in Maxinquayes [...] "collision of beauty and violence". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it [...] "a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism, and sociopathy", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on [...] "Aftermath". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley-Bird: [...] "My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? <b>My</b> <b>mother...</b> <b>used</b> to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that." ...|$|E

She retired in 1984 to her childhood home in the Skåne province of southern Sweden, where {{her father had been}} a sixth-generation farmer and she had worked to grow beets and potatoes until she was 23. In an interview in the mid-1990s, she appeared happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. [...] "I've always tried to remember what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to tell me", she said. [...] "Stay close to the earth. Then when you fall down, it won't hurt so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Information and Broadcasting {{minister}} Manish Tewari said, [...] "The {{film industry}} has {{lost one of}} its most versatile singers. Shamshadji's style of singing set new benchmarks. Her melodious voice with powerful lyrics gave us songs that have remained popular even today." [...] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said [...] "She was an artist of extraordinary talent and abilities, and the songs she has left behind in her long career, which she started with AIR in 1937, will continue to enthral music lovers." [...] Her daughter Usha Ratra said [...] "She kept herself away from glamour of the industry despite being one of the top singers of her era as she did not like limelight. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to say that artistes never die.

2500|$|As a young singer Brown was {{influenced}} by older contemporaries such as Delroy Wilson (whom he later cited as the single greatest influence on his style of singing), Errol Dunkley, John Holt, Ken Boothe, and Bob Andy. Brown's first recording was an original song called [...] "Lips of Wine" [...] for producer Derrick Harriott, but when this was not released, he recorded for Clement [...] "Coxsone" [...] Dodd's Studio One label, and his first session yielded the single [...] "No Man is an Island", recorded when Brown was aged twelve and released in late 1969. The single received steadily increasing airplay {{for almost a year}} before becoming a huge hit throughout Jamaica. Brown recorded up to a dozen sessions for Dodd, amounting to around thirty songs, and also worked as a backing singer on sessions by other artists, including providing harmonies along with Horace Andy and Larry Marshall on Alton Ellis's Sunday Coming album. Brown was advised by fellow Studio One artist Ellis to learn guitar to help with his songwriting, and after convincing Dodd to buy him an instrument, was taught the basics by Ellis. These Studio One recordings were collected on two albums, No Man is an Island and If I Follow my Heart (the title track penned by Alton Ellis), although Brown had left Studio One before either was released. He went on to record for several producers including Lloyd Daley ("Baby Don't Do It" [...] and [...] "Things in Life"), Prince Buster ("One Day Soon" [...] and [...] "If I Had the World"), and Phil Pratt ("Black Magic Woman", [...] "Let Love In", and [...] "What About the Half"), before returning to work with Derrick Harriott, recording a string of popular singles including [...] "Silhouettes", [...] "Concentration", [...] "He Can't Spell", and [...] "Musical Heatwave", with the pick of these tracks collected on the Super Reggae and Soul Hits album in 1973. Brown also recorded for Vincent [...] "Randy" [...] Chin ("Cheater"), Dennis Alcapone ("I Was Lonely"), and Herman Chin Loy ("It's Too Late" [...] and [...] "Song <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>Used</b> to Sing") among others, with Brown still at school at this stage of his career.|$|E

5000|$|When Kendal was a {{young girl}} on school {{holidays}} in Wokingham, England—about 30 miles west of Central London—she would accompany her father to work at a television studio in the northern city of Carlisle England. Diane would hang around the makeup room, observing as the talent was prepared for the cameras; these visits ignited her desire to study theatrical makeup. She described this as her earliest makeup memory in Intermission Magazine, stating [...] "dad would drop my sister and me off in the makeup room during school holidays when he would take us in with him. I could only have been five or six at the time. I thought, 'G-d that looks kind of fun.' I always remember <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>using</b> Max Factor pan stick. I was fascinated, sticking my fingers in it." ...|$|R

"Of course not, child; I'm {{glad to see}} you fond of your book, and to find Rose {{helping you}} along. <b>My</b> blessed <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to sit at work with her maids about her, {{teaching}} them many a useful thing in the good old fashion that's gone by now.

60|$|So Aunt Emma {{had always}} said <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was badly <b>used,</b> {{especially}} in money matters--the money being all, when one came {{to think of}} it, her own or her first husband's;--and as a consequence, auntie was never invited to The Grange during my father's lifetime.|$|R
60|$|He {{promised her}} to soften his behaviour, and bid her assure {{me that he}} loved me as well as ever, {{and that he had}} so such design as that of sending me to a madhouse, {{whatever}} he might say in his passion; also he desired <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to <b>use</b> the same persuasions to me too, that our affections might be renewed, and we might lie together in a good understanding as we used to do.|$|R

6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> {{to say to}} me: [...] "Never {{expect to}} find brains in a pretty girl."

6000|$|... "I guess I must speak," [...] {{she thought}} wistfully. [...] "I hate to do it.

5000|$|Her {{writing has}} been crir. As {{works such as}} At the Bottom of the River and The Autobiography of <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>use</b> Antiguan {{cultural}} practices, some critics say these works employ “magical realism”. “The author claims, however, that work is ‘magic’ and ‘real,’ but not necessarily works of ‘magical realism.’” Other critics claim that her style is “modernist” because much of her fiction is [...] "culturally specific and experimental". It has also been praised for its keen observation of character, curtness, wit, and lyrical quality. Derek Walcott, 1992 Nobel laureate, described Kincaid's writing: [...] "As she writes a sentence, psychologically, its temperature is that it heads toward its own contradiction. It's as if the sentence is discovering itself, discovering how it feels. And that is astonishing, because it's {{one thing to be}} able to write a good declarative sentence; it's another thing to catch the temperature of the narrator, the narrator's feeling. And that's universal, and not provincial in any way". Susan Sontag has also commended Kincaid's writing for its [...] "emotional truthfulness," [...] poignancy, and complexity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Page 280," [...] he began. [...] "Law of {{husband and}} wife. Here's a bit I don't understand, to begin with: 'It may be {{observed}} generally {{that the law}} considers marriage {{in the light of}} a Contract.' What does that mean? I thought a contract was the sort of a thing a builder signs when he promises to have the workmen out of the house in a given time, and when the time comes (as <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>used</b> to say) the workmen never go." ...|$|R
