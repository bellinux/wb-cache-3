25|$|Megalencephaly (or <b>macrencephaly,</b> {{abbreviated}} MEG) is {{a growth}} development disorder {{in which the}} brain is abnormally large. It {{is characterized by a}} brain with an average weight that is 2.5 standard deviations above the mean of the general population. Megalencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth and is confirmed with an MRI. A mutation in the PI3K-AKT pathway {{is believed to be the}} primary cause of brain proliferation and ultimately the root cause of megalencephaly. This mutation has produced a classification of brain overdevelopment that consists of two syndromes including, megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH). Approximately 1 out of 50 children (2%) are said to have the characteristics of megalencephaly in the general population. There are several neuropsychiatric disorders linked with megalencephaly, however, studies have shown that autism is the most prevalent association with the malformation of MEG. Although no treatment currently exists for megalencephaly, management methods are focused at reducing deficits linked with autism. Most recent research is targeted at creating inhibitors to reduce the mutational pathway that causes megalencephaly.|$|E
40|$|A case of {{infantile}} onset Alexander&#x 2032;s {{disease in}} a {{two and a}} half year old male child is presented, who had progressively increasing <b>macrencephaly</b> since birth. A frontal lobe biopsy revealed collections of Rosenthal fibres in the subpial and perivascular areas with diffuse dysmyelination and presence of reactive astrocytes. The Rosenthal fibres were immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin. Electron microscopic examination showed the Rosenthal fibres as intra-astrocytic and extracellular granular osmiphilic collections...|$|E
40|$|Data were {{collected}} on 52 patients (30 males and 22 females) with neurofibromatosis. Using the volumetric method of Gordon, {{it was found that}} 44 % of the patients had cranial capacities above the 95 th percentile (70 % were above the 50 th percentile). The presence of intracranial tumors and/or hydrocephalus did not influence skull size. Four patients above the 95 th percentile had normal pneumoencephalograms and cerebral angiograms, indicating that the cause of the macrocranium, in some instances at least, is <b>macrencephaly.</b> Volumetric measurement of the sella turcica in 27 of the 52 patients gave results which strongly suggest that idiopathic enlargement of the sella in neurofibromatosis is uncommon, if not rare. Skull films of 26 patients with tuberous sclerosis did not show an increase in cranial capacity similar to that found in neurofibromatosis...|$|E
