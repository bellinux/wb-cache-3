500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they just looked at me as they gave me <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E
500|$|Santiago {{describes}} his guitar playing as [...] "angular and bent," [...] "all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up". Notable in his style {{is how he}} uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of There Goes <b>My</b> <b>Gun.</b> He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as The Beatles' [...] "Savoy Truffle", where [...] "George Harrison played that bent note that I {{fell in love with}} and later milked it for all it was worth." [...] He used such techniques with the Pixies: Doolittle's [...] "Dead" [...] begins with Santiago's guitar [...] "squawking" [...] on an E-flat like [...] "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.|$|E

500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the way you look at things. I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I had {{to learn}} in the 18 years of my life, that one can only be happy when you bulk blends, society adapts. But it could and I did not. I am free! No person shall engage in my life, and he does it {{but he has to}} face the consequences! No {{politician}} has the right to legislate, which prohibit me things, not a cop has the right to take away <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> to me, and certainly not while he's wearing the belt." ...|$|E
2500|$|A soldier from New York: [...] "The town of Titatia was {{surrendered}} to {{us a few}} days ago, and two companies occupy the same. Last night one of our boys was found shot and his stomach cut open. Immediately orders were received from General Wheaton to burn the town and kill every native in sight; which was done to a finish. About 1,000 men, {{women and children were}} reported killed. I am probably growing hard-hearted, for I am in my glory when I can sight <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> on some dark skin and pull the trigger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duterte has {{repeatedly}} admitted to killing three people {{while he was}} the Mayor of Davao. In December 2015, Duterte recounted shooting three gunmen dead only months into his first mayoral term in 1988 after they had kidnapped and raped a Chinese girl. He justified his actions, saying [...] "they were committing a crime in my presence and I was the person in authority under the law". In an interview with BBC on December 16, 2016, he said: [...] "I killed about three of them, because {{there were three of}} them. I don't know how many bullets from <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> went inside their bodies. It happened, and I said, I cannot lie about it".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{threw down}} <b>my</b> <b>gun,</b> rushed out some 30 {{yards to the}} color bearer of the 18th and said to him 'Let us rally these men or the whole left is gone.' The brave fellow stopped and waved his flag. I sounded to the colors. The men cheered. They rushed into line. Still {{sounding}} the rally, I passed back and forth of the forming line, and what {{a few minutes before}} seemed a hopeless disastrous rout, now {{turned out to be a}} complete victory. The retreat had been checked and the enemy driven back with awful slaughter. So severe was their repulse, that within a few minutes we were firing toward our rear into the enemy who were pressing Beatty's troops back." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the local}} {{publication}} City Pages description of the BCA conversation, Yanez [...] "could never state definitively ... that he saw a firearm that day". Yanez uses [...] "various terms to suggest {{the presence of a}} firearm". Yanez states, [...] "it appeared to me that he was wrapping something around his fingers and almost like if I were to put my hand around <b>my</b> <b>gun.</b> It was dark inside the vehicle ..." [...] At another point [...] "it seemed like he was pulling out a gun and the barrel just kept coming." [...] "I know he had an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand."He added: [...] "It was, to me, it just looked big and apparent that he's gonna shoot you, he's gonna kill you." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{destroying}} Hill's Ironworks {{and putting}} the rebel garrison there to flight, Huck convened a compulsory meeting of the remaining male residents of the New Acquisition District (mostly men too old to fight), and proclaimed that [...] "God almighty had become a rebel, but if there were twenty gods on that side, {{they would all be}} conquered." [...] Huck then stated that [...] "even if the rebels were as thick as trees, and Jesus Christ would come down and lead them, he would still defeat them," [...] following which he and his troopers confiscated all the men's horses. Actions like these quickly earned Huck the nickname [...] "the swearing captain" [...] and further angered the Presbyterian inhabitants of the backcountry. After witnessing Huck's tirade, one resident, Daniel Collins, told his wife, [...] "I have come home determined to take <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> and when I lay it down, I lay down my life with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{details were}} {{released}} in the days preceding the finale. Michael Weatherly disclosed, [...] "The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes." [...] De Pablo added, [...] "We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [...] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I want to shoot you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> on your knee' anger….He does something to her that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little does he know that he almost kills her." [...] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, [...] "I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, as they learn {{a lot more about}} each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I lifted my rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered <b>my</b> <b>gun</b> again." ...|$|E

5000|$|I saw four jets {{attacking a}} lone B-17 from another group. The B-17 knocked {{down one of}} the enemy fighters before it flew in a {{crippled}} manner towards the Russian lines. The remaining three fighters came at our plane. Two of them came right behind each other at my position. They were about 1000 yards away when I started cutting loose with <b>my</b> <b>guns.</b> The first (Me 262) made a pass at 200 yards and my tracers were going right into its fuselage. Suddenly it went down in flames. The second came into my sights after the first had dropped. I kept shooting away because he was getting into my hair. Suddenly, it also spiraled down. Upon hitting the ground, it burst into flames. Because I had <b>my</b> <b>guns</b> spitting lead so rapidly, they jammed.|$|R
