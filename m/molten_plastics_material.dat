30|$|Over recent years, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} and public outcry related {{to the use of}} plastination to exhibit the human body and aid in medical training [13]. For the process of plastination, body parts are immersed in acetone chilled to 13 °F, and the water removed from every cell. The water is then replaced with a <b>molten</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>material</b> that later hardens. The parts retain their colour and shape, and many organs have a plastic appearance [13]. However, plastination requires the use of human bodies and therefore raises issues of acceptability; the rapid prototyping technique we describe does not involve use of any human tissue.|$|R
500|$|Injection {{moulding}} uses a ram or screw-type plunger {{to force}} <b>molten</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>material</b> into a mould cavity; this solidifies into a shape that has conformed to the contour of the mould. It is {{most commonly used}} to process both thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, with the volume used of the former being considerably higher. Thermoplastics are prevalent due to characteristics which make them highly suitable for injection moulding, such as {{the ease with which}} they may be recycled, their versatility allowing them to be used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, [...] and their ability to soften and flow upon heating. Thermoplastics also have an element of safety over thermosets; if a thermosetting polymer is not ejected from the injection barrel in a timely manner, chemical crosslinking may occur causing the screw and check valves to seize and potentially damaging the injection moulding machine.|$|R

As thermal conductivity {{is one of}} the main factors for conductive heat transfer in cooling phase of IMP, a cooling channel made by higher thermal conductive material will allow faster extraction of heat from the <b>molten</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>materials,</b> thus resulting in shorter cycle time and higher productivity.

This process consists of vulcanizing rubber during its melt-mixing with <b>molten</b> <b>plastic.</b> These <b>materials</b> show conventional elastomers behaviour at low temperatures and the processability of thermoplastics at high temperatures.

Among the several conventional conductive loads, the polyaniline possess great prominence. The polyaniline used as an intrinsic conducting polymer is based on its high conductivity, synthesis easiness, and stability to the heat and the air. Another advantage is the low production cost [2]. Mechanicals sensors are device that detect force, deformation and / or acceleration. In these materials, it takes place a decrease of the electric resistance as the force applied perpendicularly in its surface increase [3].

40|$|Injection molding is a {{standard}} manufacturing process for plastic parts. The most important process step, mold filling, involves unsteady nonisothermal flow of a non-Newtonian <b>molten</b> <b>plastic.</b> Mold-filling flow largely determines molecular orientation within the final part and thereby influences final part properties. This article describes techniques for successfully applying particle image velocimetry (PIV) to <b>molten</b> <b>plastic</b> flow during injection molding. The primary experimental challenges include the following: engineering optical access to the <b>molten</b> <b>plastic</b> flow at elevated temperatures (230 – 245 °C) and pressures (∼ 20 MPa), finding particles that survive the thermal-mechanical environment that melts the plastic, and developing experimental and data-reduction techniques that allow multiple imperfect planar PIV measurements to be combined.
