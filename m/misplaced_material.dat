40|$|The spiral {{performed}} well in cleaning the coarse 8 x 16 mesh size fraction, {{as demonstrated by}} the Ep ranging from 0. 091 to 0. 177. This is in line with typical spiral performance. In addition, the presence of the coarser size fraction did not significantly affect spiral performance on the typical 16 x 100 mesh fraction, in which the Ep ranged from 0. 144 to 0. 250. Changes in solids concentration and flow rate did not show a clear correlation with spiral performance. However, for difficult-to-clean coals with high near-gravity material, such as this anthracite, a single-stage spiral cleaning such a wide size fraction {{may not be able to}} achieve the clean coal ash and yield specifications required. In the first place, while the performance of the spiral on the coarse 8 x 16 mesh fraction is good with regard to Ep, the cutpoints (SG 50 s) are high (1. 87 to 1. 92), which may result in a clean coal with a higher-than-desired ash content. And second, the combination of the spiral's higher overall cutpoint (1. 80) with the high near-gravity anthracite results in significant <b>misplaced</b> <b>material</b> that increases the clean coal ash error. In a case such as this, one solution may be to reclean the clean coal and middlings from the first-stage spiral in a second stage spiral...|$|E
30|$|A {{cost impact}} of OSD, {{which is not}} very well {{researched}} or understood, is the impact it may have on clean coal quality. Conventional wisdom suggests that OSD being heavier than coal gets rejected in the preparation plant and does not impact clean coal quality. However, density separation in preparation plants is not a 100  % efficient process. Some of the heavy <b>material</b> may <b>misplace</b> to the float and some of light <b>material</b> may <b>misplace</b> to the sink. Even though the misplaced percentages are small for heavy-media systems, the high amount of OSD in the ROM coal can still cause {{a significant amount of}} this material to report to the clean coal. The impact can be particularly severe when lighter OSD materials such as carbonaceous (black) shale (SG ~  1.8) associated with No. 6 coal seam in Illinois or similar lithologies are encountered. On top of this, the OSD material is known to contain significantly higher amounts of pyrite, mercury and other trace elements (Gluskoter et al. 1977). Therefore, due to this <b>misplaced</b> OSD <b>material</b> reporting to the clean coal product, the impact on product quality and hence the cost can be very high. Luttrell et al. (1996) has analyzed the effect of OSD on blending operations.|$|R
40|$|Textbook is a {{reference}} {{which is used}} by teachers in schools as a guide in teaching learning process. It contains materials which must be eligible to the standard as stated on the standard competence and basic standard {{as one of the}} criteria of BSNPÂ’s standard to be fulfilled. However, some facts show that some textbooks which are used in schools do not meet the criteria yet and have not been evaluated by BSNP. Dealing with the phenomena, this study was aimed at finding out whether or not a textbook entitled Get Along with English for Vocational School Grade X Novice Level which was used in Tourism Department Vocational High School 2 Malang meets the criteria of BSNPÂ’s standard in terms of the completeness of the material content. This study used a qualitative research which focused on the content analysis that attempted to analyze the eligibility of the English textbook in terms of the completeness of its content materials which covers four units of the textbook. Meanwhile, the instrument used were document analysis by using a checklist and an interview. Based on the result of the analysis of the textbook, {{it was found that the}} textbook was categorized as sufficiently complete with the score of 2. 36 in terms of the completeness of the material. The textbook presented all of the minimum materials and had fulfilled minimu criteria of a good textbook. However, it was found that there were <b>misplace</b> and inappropriateness <b>materials</b> that were found in several units of the textbook...|$|R
