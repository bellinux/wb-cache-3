40|$|The Sixth and Seventh Conference of the Parties (COP 6 and 7) at The Hague, Bonn and Marrakesh {{came to a}} final Agreement on the Kyoto Protocol, {{which is}} thus ready for {{ratification}} by the individual nations. The Agreement was only achieved by allowing countries to offset their fossil fuel emission targets (on average 95 % of the 1990 emissions) by increasing biological carbon sequestration, and by trading carbon credits. Activities that would count as increasing biological carbon sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, and changes in management of agriculture and forestry. According to the Agreement reached in Marrakesh, biological carbon sequestration may reach an offset of up to 80 % of the required reduction in fossil fuel emissions (4 % of the 5 % reduction commitment). We explain why the allowable offset rose as high {{during the course of}} the negotiations. It is highlighted that major unintended consequences may be a result of the policy as it stands in the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accord.</b> Major losses of biodiversity and primary forest are expected. We present scientific concerns regarding verification, which lead to scientific doubts that the practices encouraged by the Agreement can actually increase sequestration under a full carbon accounting scheme. We explain that there is a 'win-win' option that would protect high carbon pools and biodiversity in an economically efficient way. But, this is not supported by the Agreement. Despite the very positive signal that most nations of the United Nations will devote major efforts towards climate protection, there remains a most urgent need to develop additional rules to avoid unintended outcomes, and to promote the 'win-win' options that we explain...|$|R
40|$|Substituting {{fossil fuel}} with woody biomass for bioelectricity {{production}} has great potentials for carbon emission reductions while increasing forest productivity to increase carbon sequestration and improve ecological functionalities. Until recently, study on such potentials was very limited. Beginning in 2007, Japan&# 8217;s special budgets were allocated for a 6 -year intensive thinning on about 3. 3 million ha of young stands for increasing carbon sinks in Japanese forests {{to meet the}} capped amount of 47. 7 Tg CO 2 year- 1 allowed under the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accord.</b> Because of only 30 % of the thinned wood were used for sawntimber, CO 2 and CH 4 must have been emitted from the disposed thinned wood and wood waste. Such emissions and reduction potentials need to be assessed to provide future alternatives for climate change mitigation. We assessed carbon emission reduction potentials when woody biomass from thinned wood is fully utilized for bioelectricity production {{as compared with the}} generation of the same amount of energy produced under coal, oil, and natural gas scenarios. Our analytical results show that if all disposed thinned wood and wood waste are utilized to generate energy, about 62. 6, 58. 3, and 37. 8 Tg CO 2 year- 1 could be prevented from emitting depending on emission scenarios or about 33. 2, 30. 9, and 20. 0 % of Japan&# 8217;s reduction commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. On the other hand, if thinned wood and wood waste are not utilized, about 13. 4 Tg CO 2 year- 1 would be released due to thinning. Our results suggest that incentives to reducing emission reductions in forest sector in the future climate change mitigation agreements will likely lead to large emission reductions, otherwise leakages due to thinning are unavoidable...|$|R

However, these states also wish to preserve their individual integrity and unique features. For example, in contrast to other Kyoto-compliant systems, some states propose other types of greenhouse gas sources, different measurement methods, setting a maximum on the price of allowances, or restricting access to CDM projects.

Especially the project-based mechanisms CDM and JI are likely to entail considerable costs of baseline development, verification and certification. The AIJ pilot phase and the PCF programme give indications {{about the level of}} these costs. Under current estimates of world market prices for greenhouse gas emission permits, projects with annual emission reductions of less than 50, 000 t CO 2 equivalent are unlikely to be viable; for micro projects transaction costs can reach several hundred per t CO 2 equivalent. Thus the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accord</b> rule to have special rules for small scale CDM projects makes sense, even if the thresholds chosen advantage certain project types; projects below 1000 t CO 2 equivalent per year should get further exemptions. An alternative solution with no risk for the environmental credibility of the projects would be to subsidise baseline setting and charge lower, subsidised fees for small projects for the different steps of the CDM/second track JI project cycle. Transaktionskosten verringern die Attraktivität der Kyoto-Mechanismen im Vergleich zu heimischen Verringerungsmaßnahmen. Besonders die projektbasierten Mechanismen CDM und JI bringen voraussichtlich erhebliche Kosten für Referenzfallentwicklung, Verifizierung und Zertifizierung mit sich. Die AIJ-Erprobungsphase und das Programm des PCF geben Anhaltspunkte für die Höhe dieser Kosten. Bei den derzeitigen Schätzungen der Weltmarktpreise für Treibhausgasemissionsrechte sind Projekte mit weniger als 50, 000 t CO 2 -Äquivalent pro Jahr ökonomisch nicht attraktiv; für Kleinstprojekte können die Transaktionskosten mehrere Hundert - pro t CO 2 - Äquivalent betragen. Daher sind die Marrakesch-Beschlüsse, Sonderregeln für CDMKleinprojekte auszuarbeiten, sinnvoll, wenn auch die dort gewählten Schwellenwerte bestimmte Projekttypen begünstigen. Projekte unter 1000 t CO 2 -Äquivalent pro Jahr sollten weitere Vergünstigungen erhalten.

40|$|This article reviews basic {{insights}} about compliance and “hard” enforcement {{that can be}} derived from various non-cooperative equilibrium concepts, and evaluates the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accords</b> in light of these insights. Five different notions of equilibrium are considered – the Nash equilibrium, the subgame perfect equilibrium, the renegotiation proof equilibrium, the coalition proof equilibrium, and the perfect Bayesian equilibrium. These various types of equilibrium have a number of implications for effective enforcement: (1) Consequences of non-compliance should be more than proportionate. (2) To be credible punishment needs to take place on the Pareto frontier, rather than by reversion to some suboptimal state. (3) An effective enforcement system must be able to curb collective as well as individual incentives to cheat. (4) A fully transparent enforcement regime could in fact turn out to be detrimental for compliance levels. It is concluded that constructing an effective system for “hard” enforcement of the Kyoto Protocol is a formidable task that has only partially been accomplished by the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accords.</b> A possible explanation is that the design of a compliance system for the climate regime involved a careful balancing of the desire to minimize non-compliance against other important considerations...|$|E

Since the Parties had already agreed to use 2 the IPCC Guidelines for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals, the role of good practice guidance was not to replace the IPCC Guidelines, but rather to provide advice consistent with them. The IPCC finished its work in time for the first volume of the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPG 2000) 3 to be accepted at the IPCC Plenary meeting held in Montreal in May 2000. The Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC as well as its Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) subsequently endorsed 4 GPG 2000.

40|$|The two {{project-based}} Kyoto mechanisms, {{joint implementation}} (JI) and the clean development mechanism (CDM), require {{a determination of}} the “baseline”, the development of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions {{in the absence of}} the project.

Accuracy of the GHG emission reduction and manageability of GHG emission balances are used as evaluation criteria. The results show that relative baselines are a more accurate instrument for the estimation of emission reductions in JI/CDM projects in the energy sector without posing significant additional risks to the management of GHG emission balances for large entities. In comparison to absolute baselines, relative baselines indicate in a more realistic and conservative manner the amount of emission reductions obtained in the energy system and give more appropriate incentives to project sponsors.

The analysis is structured according to the major steps in the international negotiation process. The results are compared with earlier research, which covered only CO 2. Compared to the analysis for CO 2 only, including all Kyoto gases results in a decline of the international permit price for the Bonn-Marrakesh Accords (from 6 US$/tCeq in the CO 2 -only case towards 2 US$/tCeq including all Kyoto gases). Consistent with earlier research, banking is of absolute importance for the development of a viable emission trading market. Banking 80 % of the total amount of hot air results in an increase of the environmental effectiveness with an emission reduction of 9. 4 % compared to base-year emission level. The international permit price rises towards 11 US$/tCeq and the annual Annex I abatement cost to 3. 3 bUS$. The multi-gas analysis indicates a stronger reduction of CH 4 than CO 2 due to its lower cost and large potential. Furthermore, trading results in a shift in abatement options towards even larger reductions for CH 4, and smaller reductions for CO 2. Most CH 4 abatement takes place in the gas sector due to leaking pipelines in the Annex I FSU. In absolute terms, however, most reductions still occur for CO 2 emissions from energy use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Kyoto Protocol {{adopted in}} 1997 has three {{flexible}} mechanisms {{in order to}} prevent the earth from global warming. One of them is emissions trading. Saijo and Kusakawa (2002) designed some trading systems and conducted emissions trading experiments in order to evaluate them. Such human-based experiments, however, have several basic problems. First, any single experimental result might depend on a particular set of subjects. Second, a considerable number of repetitions are needed to have statistically robust results. In order to avoid these drawbacks, we construct an agent-based emissions trading simulation model that does not use human subjects, but artificial computer agents. It is relatively easy to repeat many simulations with many different parameters when we use the simulation method. Our focus is learning through the trading and we employ the Genetic Algorithm (GA). We evaluate two trading designs: the penalty against non-compliance and the Commitment Period Reserve (CPR) adopted in the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>accords.</b> The former has a question how much penalty should be imposed on countries with non-compliance. We have two cases. Case 1 is that the penalty is fixed, and Case 2 is that the penalty depends on the average contract price of emissions permits. We found that in Case 1 all countries tried to comply with their target, while in Case 2 demand countries had some incentive not to comply the protocol on purpose. The latter has a question whether we should adopt the CPR or not to the emissions trading system. We found that the CP...|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has set {{legally binding}} {{emissions}} targets for {{a basket of}} six greenhouse gases and timetables for industrialised countries. It has also incorporated three international flexibility mechanisms. However, the Articles defining the flexibility mechanisms carry wording that their use must be supplemental to domestic actions. This {{has led to the}} open debates on interpretations of these supplementarity provisions. Such debates ended at the resumed sixth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC, held in Bonn, July 2001, and at the subsequent COP- 7 in Marrakesh, November 2001. The final wording in the Bonn Agreement, reaffirmed in the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accords,</b> at least indicates that domestic policies will have an important role to play in meeting Annex B countries’ emissions commitments. Carbon taxes have long been advocated because of their cost-effectiveness in achieving a given emissions reduction. In this paper, the main economic impacts of carbon taxes are assessed. Based on a review of empirical studies on existing carbon/energy taxes, it is concluded that competitive losses and distributive impacts are generally not significant and definitely less than often perceived. However, given the ultimate objective of the Framework Convention, future carbon taxes could have higher rates than those already imposed and thus the resulting economic impacts could be more acute.

Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accords</b> is now sufficiently clear to be implemented. Apart from the U. S. and Australia, all industrialised countries have now stated that they will ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Industrial countries are subject to binding greenhouse gas emissions targets for the commitment period 2008 - 2012. Several countries profit from exceptions that weaken the targets. The availability of forestry and agricultural sinks will further lower the necessity for emission reductions. A world market for emission rights will form as the Kyoto Mechanisms can be used without limits; the only category apart are sinks CDM credits that are capped. Given the U. S. position {{to stay out of the}} Kyoto Protocol, overall demand for emission rights is likely to be lower than supply of "hot air" from Russia and Ukraine. Thus the world market price will be very low, probably between 1 and 5 - / t of CO 2. The price could be higher if sellers form a cartel or some sellers are excluded from the market when they do not fulfil the relatively strict reporting rules agreed in Marrakesh. Under a low price the CDM whose institutional structure is rather cumbersome will only have a chance if it concentrates on the cheapest project types and most effective host countries. Especially attractive are projects collecting and burning landfill methane while most renewable energy projects are too expensive, unless they are implemented in very favourable locations.

40|$|According to art. 3. 4 of the Kyoto Protocol (KP), Italy has elected forest {{management}} as additional human-induced activity {{to attain the}} goal of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The whole forest area not subjected to afforestation, reforestation or deforestation processes since 1990 will be considered as managed forest. In order to analyse different management strategies, the Carbon-Pro Project, involving 9 partners of the European CADSES area, considered a young beech high forest (ex-coppice, defined as "transitory silvicultural system") as a common case study for the Pre-alps region. Using data collected with forest plans during the period 1983 - 2005, aboveground and belowground forest carbon stock and sink of a specific forest compartment were estimated by the Carbon Stock Method proposed by the IPCC Guidelines. In order to apply this approach 41 trees were cut and a species-specific allometric equation was developed. Considering the aboveground tree biomass, the carbon sink amounts to 1. 99 and 1. 84 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 for the period 1983 - 1994 and 1994 - 2005 respectively. Adding the belowground tree biomass, the estimated sink amounts to 2. 59 and 2. 39 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1 for each period. Taking the harvested wood products (firewood), the total carbon sequestration during the second period is 0. 16 Mg C ha- 1 y- 1. The case study highlights the possible rules for the different management strategies. In effect, the utilisation of the entire increase in aboveground biomass as firewood gives an energy substitution effect but, according to the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accords,</b> it cannot be accounted for the KP. On the other hand, an accumulation strategy gives the maximum possible carbon absorption and retention...|$|E
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has set legally binding {{emissions}} targets for a basket of six greenhouse gases and timetables for industrialised countries. It has also incorporated three international flexibility mechanisms. However, the Articles defining the flexibility mechanisms carry wording that their use must be supplemental to domestic actions. This {{has led to the}} open debates on interpretations of these supplementarity provisions. Such debates ended at the resumed sixth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC, held in Bonn, July 2001, and at the subsequent COP- 7 in Marrakesh, November 2001. The final wording in the Bonn Agreement, reaffirmed in the <b>Marrakesh</b> <b>Accords,</b> at least indicates that domestic policies will have an important role to play in meeting Annex B countries' emissions commitments. Carbon taxes have long been advocated because of their cost-effectiveness in achieving a given emissions reduction. In this paper, the main economic impacts of carbon taxes are assessed. Based on a review of empirical studies on existing carbon/energy taxes, it is concluded that competitive losses and distributive impacts are generally not significant and definitely less than often perceived. However, given the ultimate objective of the Framework Convention, future carbon taxes could have higher rates than those already imposed and thus the resulting economic impacts could be more acute. In this context, {{it has been shown that}} how to use the generated fiscal revenues will be of fundamental importance in determining the final economic impacts of carbon taxes. Finally, we briefly discuss carbon taxes in combination with other domestic and international instruments...|$|E
