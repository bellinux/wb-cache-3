40|$|A C_ 3 -symmetric crystal-field {{potential}} in the Fe(II) Fe(III) bimetallic oxalates splits the L= 2 Fe(II) multiplet into two doublets and a singlet. In compounds that exhibit <b>magnetic</b> <b>compensation,</b> one of the doublets was predicted to lie lowest in energy and carry a non-quenched orbital angular momentum ±, where exceeds a threshold value. In a range of, a Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion increases the energy splitting of the low-lying doublet and breaks the C_ 3 symmetry of the bimetallic planes around the ferrimagnetic transition temperature. At low temperatures, the JT distortion disappears in compounds that display <b>magnetic</b> <b>compensation</b> due to the competition with the spin-orbit coupling. A comparison with recent measurements provides strong evidence for this re-entrant, low-temperature JT transition and a prediction for the normal, high-temperature JT transition. The size of the JT distortion is estimated using first-principles calculations, which suggest that the long-range ordering of smaller, non-C_ 3 -symmetric organic cations can eliminate <b>magnetic</b> <b>compensation.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Journal of the American Chemical Societ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{compositional}} and temperature dependence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>compensation</b> in amorphous GdFeCo films. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>compensation</b> {{is attributed to}} the competition between antiferromagnetic coupling of rare-earth with transition-metal (TM) ions and ferromagnetic interaction between the TM ions. The low-Gd region from 20 to 34 at. % was found to exhibit compensation phenomena characterized by a low saturation magnetization and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) near the compensation temperature. Compensation temperature was not observed in previously unreported high-Gd region from 52 to 59 at. %, in qualitative agreement with results from recent model calculations. However, low magnetization was achieved at room temperature, accompanied by a large PMA with coercivity reaching ~ 6. 6 kOe.

In these admixed rare-earth (RE) intermetallics, the compensation phenomenon is characterized by a crossover of the M = 0 axis in the low field thermomagnetic response, and a turnaround behavior due to the field-induced reversal in the orientations of the RE moments at high fields. While the characteristic attributes are present in Nd(0. 8) Gd(0. 2) Al(2), a repeated/multiple <b>magnetic</b> <b>compensation</b> behavior stands observed in Nd(0. 8) Tb(0. 2) Al(2).
