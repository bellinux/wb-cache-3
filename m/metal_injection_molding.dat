40|$|<b>Metal</b> powder <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> is a shaping {{technology}} that has achieved solid scientific underpinnings. It is from this science base that recent progress {{has occurred in}} titanium powder <b>injection</b> <b>molding.</b> Much of the progress awaited development of the required particles with specific characteristics of particle size, particle shape, and purity. The production of titanium components by <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> is stabilized by {{a good understanding of}} how each process variable impacts density and impurity level. As summarized here, recent research has isolated the four critical success factors in titanium <b>metal</b> powder <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> (Ti-MIM) that must be simultaneously satisfied—density, purity, alloying, and microstructure. The critical role of density and impurities, and the inability to remove impurities with sintering, compels attention to starting Ti-MIM with high quality alloy powders. This article addresses the four critical success factors to rationalize Ti-MIM processing conditions to the requirements for demanding applications in aerospace and medical fields. Based on extensive research, a baseline process is identified and reported here with attention to linking mechanical properties to the four critical success factors...|$|R

50|$|The {{window of}} {{economic}} advantage in <b>metal</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molded</b> parts lies in complexity and volume for small-size parts. MIM materials {{are comparable to}} metal formed by competing methods, and final products are used in {{a broad range of}} industrial, commercial, medical, dental, firearms, aerospace, and automotive applications. Dimensional tolerances of ±0.3% are common and machining is required for closer tolerances. MIM can produce parts where it is difficult, or even impossible, to efficiently manufacture an item through other means of fabrication. Ideally, at least 75 dimensional specifications in a component of just 25 mm maximum size and 10 g mass is best - as for example required for watch cases, cellular telephone plugs, and laptop computer hinges. Increased costs for traditional manufacturing methods inherent to part complexity, such as internal/external threads, miniaturization, or identity marking, typically do not increase the cost in a MIM operation due to the flexibility of <b>injection</b> <b>molding.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{galvanic}} coupling of conventional and <b>metal</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molded</b> (MIM) brackets with commonly used orthodontic archwires. Materials and Methods: Six {{of each type}} of bracket were suspended in lactic acid along {{with a sample of}} orthodontic wire (three nickel-titanium and three copper-nickel-titanium) for 28 days at 37 °C. The potential differences between the wires and brackets were recorded per second throughout the duration of the experiment. Results: The MIM brackets exhibited potential differences similar to those seen for the conventional brackets. The greatest potential difference was found for MIM brackets with nickel-titanium wires (512 mV), whereas MIM brackets with copper-nickel-titanium wires had the smallest difference (115 mV). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) -energy-dispersive spectroscopic analysis of the tie-wing area of each bracket type indicated similar elemental composition in both brackets, but in slightly different percentages by weight. The MIM bracket exhibited extensive internal porosity, whereas the conventional bracket was more solid internally. Conclusion: The composition and manufacturing processes involved in fabricating MIM brackets impart corrosive properties similar to those seen in the bracket-wing area of conventional brackets and may provide a measurable benefit when taking into account the increased corrosion between the bracket and brazing alloy of conventional brackets. © 2006 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of lightweight structures especially in automobile {{industry is a}} major factor for reduction of fuel consumption and related CO 2 emissions. Beside the implementation of lightweight materials such as Ultra-High Strength Steel, Aluminum, Magnesium or Fiber Reinforced Polymers there is an upcoming request of Hybrid Materials. Metal Plastic Hybrid Structures are an efficient solution to use the right material at the right place in design space. State of the art regarding production technologies for hybrid structures is that metal components are produced separately in conventional forming processes. These parts are engaged in the molding die and the core <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> process is only responsible for shaping plastic ingredient and joining. Such process chains are complex and extensive. The paper shows a new approach of the process combination of conventionally metal forming technologies and the {{application of}} the fluid plastic from molding process as a forming media in the meaning of hydroforming. By this the aim is a process combination of <b>metal</b> forming and <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> in one die and one process step to produce high complex hybrid metal-plastic components in an high efficient way.

30|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of a full}} density W-Cu composite is very difficult. Because of the big difference between melting points of tungsten (approximately 3, 400 °C) and copper (approximately 1, 083 °C), there is no overlap of sintering temperature ranges. Also, tungsten-copper system has no mutual solubility which means poor sinter ability [1]. The infiltration of a porous-sintered tungsten skeleton by liquid copper {{is one of the}} most common methods for producing W-Cu composite. However, in this method defects like pores, copper lakes, and tungsten agglomerates form easily, so this technique results in a poor quality [2, 3, 4].

5000|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> [...] (MIM) is a {{metalworking}} {{process by}} which finely-powdered metal is mixed with a measured amount of binder material to comprise a [...] "feedstock" [...] capable of being handled by plastic processing equipment through {{a process known as}} injection molding. The molding process allows dilated (oversized due to binder) complex parts to be shaped in a single step and in high volume. After molding, the powder-binder mixture is subjected to steps that remove the binder (debinding) and sinter densify the powders. End products are small components used in various industries and applications. The nature of MIM feedstock flow is defined by a physics called rheology. [...] Current equipment capability requires processing to stay limited to products that can be molded using typical volumes of 100 grams or less per [...] "shot" [...] into the mold. Rheology does allow this [...] "shot" [...] to be distributed into multiple cavities, thus becoming cost-effective for small, intricate, high-volume products which would otherwise be quite expensive to produce by alternate or classic methods. The variety of metals capable of implementation within MIM feedstock are broad, but mostly stainless steels, as common in powder metallurgy; they contain the same alloying constituents found in industry standards. However, oxygen is often a difficulty and is often not specified, but can be a problem for corrosion resistance. Subsequent conditioning operations are performed on the molded shape, where the binder material is removed and the metal particles are diffusion bonded and densified into the desired state with typically 15% shrinkage in each dimension.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the CQ 5'56, the CQ-311 or the CQ M-311, this is the select-fire assault rifle version {{intended}} for military and police use. It is a gas-operated, rotating-bolt full-automatic firearm that feeds from factory-made 20- or 30-round magazines (STANAG magazine clones), firing the M193 [...] "Ball" [...] 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge (manufactured in China by Norinco as the Type CJ cartridge). The Type CQ rifle has a three-position fire selector: Safe, Single Shot, and Full-Automatic fire. The weapon sports a 508mm (19.9 inches) barrel with a 1:12 rifling twist. The main differences within this weapon and the original American-made M16 are {{in the shape of}} some metal and plastic parts (namely the stock, the grip, the handguard, and the flash suppressor), and in the type of metal the rifle is made of. While the American AR-15/M16 rifles are built in T70-74 aluminum, the Chinese Type CQ is built in T60-60 aluminum, used to allow the process of <b>Metal</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>Molding</b> to be used instead of forging.According to the manufacturer's website, the Type CQ assault rifle can be equipped with an under-carried grenade launcher. Norinco manufactures several models of grenade launchers in different calibers, generally clones of the American M203 ({{known as the}} LG2-I and LG2-II) or to the Russian GP-25/GP-30 (known as the LG-1, seen mated to the QBZ-95 assault rifle), and a wide array of anti-riot underbarrel launchers. However, seen the lack on the Type CQ assault rifle of a quick-attachment/detachment design hand guard as instead present on the American M16A2 assault rifle and M4 carbine, the installation of an underbarrel grenade launcher on the Type CQ assault rifle requires partial replacement of the handguard.|$|E

The synthesis process results in survival of cenospheres and provides low density syntactic foams. The microstructure of the materials is investigated as well as the mechanical performance under quasi-static and high strain rate compressive loads. The compressive stress-strain curves of syntactic foams reveal a continuous strain hardening behavior in the plastic region, followed by a densification region. The results reveal a strain rate sensitivity in cenosphere-based Invar matrix syntactic foams. Differences in properties between cenosphere- and glass microsphere-based materials are discussed in relation to the findings of microstructural investigations.
