I had a lot to get off <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; I want to feel buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song that}} heavily {{incorporates}} synthesizers, {{and has a}} running duration of four minutes and 15 seconds. It contains elements of hip hop music, and its production was compared {{to the one in}} Kelly Rowland's [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Usher is contemplating on what he is going to do when he [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom", in the line: Hey girl, I’m debating if I should take you home. During the pre-chorus, he comes to the conclusion: I decided to take my shirt off / and show <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to Nicholson, [...] "we {{never did}} shoot {{the end of}} the scene. This movie was pre-lit. You'd go in, plug in the lights, roll the camera, and shoot. We did the take outside the office and went inside the office, plugged in, lit and rolled. Jonathan Haze was up on <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> pulling my teeth out. And in the take, he leaned back and hit the rented dental {{machinery}} {{with the back of his}} leg and it started to tip over. Roger didn't even call cut. He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{recorded}} a demo {{of the track}} that leaked in full on December 30, 2010. The song was rumored to be a leftover cut from her Teenage Dream recording sessions, and fans speculated that the track might be included in an as-yet-unconfirmed re-release of the LP. This re-release was confirmed in January 2012, when Perry announced through her official website that the album would contain all twelve songs from the original album, plus three new songs and a remix, and would be released on March 26, 2012. Perry's press release stated: [...] "This is the complete story of Teenage Dream. It was an incredible honor to tie the King of Pop's Billboard Hot 100 record, but I'm moving forward and had a few things left to get off <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> So this is the complete special edition of my album for my fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Photos of Parks and Recreation {{producers}} {{were included}} among {{the photos of}} past city council members on the town hall walls. The photo of Norm Hiscock is the one Leslie said she believes, [...] "No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> Mark's social networking site featured in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] included the character {{with a wide range}} of promiscuous women. The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're going to take your picture now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Madame is forgetting," [...] whined the Signorina in {{a broken}} nosy English over her {{outspread}} fan, [...] "Madame is forgetting. It's alive! Oh, truly!"

500|$|On 30 August 2005 Ratu {{released}} a compilation album entitled Ratu & Friends which included two new {{songs from the}} group, [...] "Teman Tapi Mesra" [...] ("Friends With Benefits") and a cover of Vina Panduwinata's [...] "Di Dadaku Ada Kamu" [...] ("In <b>My</b> <b>Chest</b> there is You"). [...] "Teman Tapi Mesra" [...] was an overnight hit in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore and enjoyed by both adults and children alike. The term [...] "Teman Tapi Mesra", often abbreviated TTM, became widely used to describe those in a physical relationship without an emotional one. The ringback tone for [...] "Teman Tapi Mesra" [...] held the top position in Malaysia for several weeks. In Indonesia, the ringback tone saw {{more than a million}} downloads. The album sold more than 400,000 copies and was certified double platinum. Ratu then put on a forty-city concert tour throughout Indonesia with the band Radja; the Rock in Love tour began with a concert at the Jakarta Convention Center on 20 February 2006.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} by several reviewers, some found {{the game to}} be unnecessarily long, repetitive and unforgiving. In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that the game does not offer many options of survival, requiring players {{to spend most of}} their time hiding in lockers [...] "staring at the motion tracker". Polygon criticised the overexposure to the alien creature, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, [...] "Every time I thought I heard the monster, every blip on my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness in <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore — I was annoyed." [...] Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered a [...] "brave" [...] title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs. As of January 2015, Alien: Isolation has sold over one million copies worldwide according to Sega. As of March 2015, the game has sold over 2.1 million copies in Europe and the US.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E

"I {{knew you}} would like to see my casts and antiquities," [...] said Hans, after the first hearty {{greetings}} and inquiries, [...] "so I didn't scruple to unlade <b>my</b> <b>chests</b> here. But I've found two rooms at Chelsea not many hundred yards from my mother and sisters, and I shall soon be ready to hang out there--when they've scraped the walls and put in some new lights. That's all I'm waiting for. But you see I don't wait to begin work: you can't conceive what a great fellow I'm going to be. The seed of immortality has sprouted within me." ...|$|R

500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Since President Barack Obama's {{election}} {{there was}} speculation that Sotomayor {{could be a}} leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat. New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term. The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, {{about the possibility of}} her nomination. On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009. On May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, [...] "I had my [...] over <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> trying to calm my beating heart, literally." [...] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her. She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents. The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had [...] "the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old." ...|$|E
500|$|Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog {{described}} the song as a [...] "rap/singing mash-up." [...] Coined as a [...] "new brand of hood majesty," [...] {{the song is}} accompanied by a simple beat, which includes finger snaps and [...] "xylophone clings." [...] Lean Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Rap's spitfire explores her softer side, sampling Annie Lennox on her honey-tongued ode to a good man." [...] Greenblatt went on to compare the song to Jay-Z's [...] "kindred" [...] "Young Forever." [...] Minaj makes several references in her lines to well known people, which includes Bruce Willis in Die Hard, as well as Adam and Eve. Minaj makes several connections to Superman including in the pre-chorus, [...] "'S' on <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> let me get my cape on." [...] The official remix featuring Cash Money labelmate Jay Sean was leaked via-internet on August 2, 2010, and later made available for purchase in Australia via iTunes. American rapper Flo Rida released an unofficial remix to the song, in which he adds a verse. Reggae recording artist Sean Paul also did a remix to the song where he ad-libs his verse throughout the original and later adds his own verse. Other remixes to the song include those done by American rapper Rick Ross and American R singer Chris Brown.|$|E

60|$|She was {{the first}} in the house; and while I was still without I saw a match flash and the lamplight kindle in the windows. The station was a {{wonderful}} fine place, coral built, with quite a wide verandah, and the main room high and wide. <b>My</b> <b>chests</b> and cases had been piled in, and made rather of a mess; and there, {{in the thick of the}} confusion, stood Uma by the table, awaiting me. Her shadow went all the way up behind her into the hollow of the iron roof; she stood against it bright, the lamplight shining on her skin. I stopped in the door, and she looked at me, not speaking, with eyes that were eager and yet daunted; then she touched herself on the bosom.|$|R
60|$|I sat {{thinking}} of the pain in <b>my</b> own <b>chest,</b> and wishing I could remember hearing Annable's jaw smash, and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were—though that was bad enough. I got up, and helped George to rise. He swayed, almost pulling me over. But in a while he could walk unevenly.|$|R
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

2500|$|In some sonnets {{addressed}} to the youth, such as Sonnet 52, the erotic punning is particularly intense: [...] "So is the time that keeps you as <b>my</b> <b>chest,</b> Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, To make some special instant special blest, By new unfolding his imprisoned pride." [...] In Elizabethan bawdy, 'pride' is a euphemism for penis, especially an erect one.|$|E
60|$|The next day, on {{my return}} from a long walk, I found, as I entered my bedroom, an {{unexpected}} change. In, addition to my own French bed in its shady recess, appeared in a corner a small crib, draped with white; {{and in addition to}} <b>my</b> mahogany <b>chest</b> of drawers, I saw a tiny rosewood chest. I stood still, gazed, and considered.|$|R

60|$|There was {{a pretty}} country {{simplicity}} in this that made some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion. I believe {{he knew it was}} his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe; nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it must have involved the loss of his conveyance; and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice. At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate. I was thinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged with him to send on <b>my</b> <b>chests</b> by track-scoot to an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.|$|R
2500|$|The {{officers}} did {{not open}} the cupboard, but asked Nilsen {{if there were}} any other body parts to be found, to which Nilsen replied: [...] "It's a long story; it goes back a long time.

He was then arrested and cautioned on suspicion of murder, before being taken to Hornsey Police Station.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in <b>my</b> <b>chest.</b> But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 62 or thereabouts, Torquemada died {{suddenly}} on New Year's Day, 1624, in choir in the convent at Tlatelolco after having sung matins with the community at midnight.

The {{cause of death was}} likely a heart attack, given that an indigenous witness said he said [...] "Help me, unloose <b>my</b> <b>chest</b> where my heart is." [...] He died in the presence of his brother friars and of the guardian of the convent of San Francisco. [...] His body was conducted in solemn procession from Tlatelolco to Mexico City accompanied by many mourners who paused at seven places on the way in order to sing responses. [...] On arrival at the church of San Francisco (the mother church of the province), it was interred in the sanctuary, on the right-hand side near the high altar.|$|E
