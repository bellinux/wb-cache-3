The new colour was first called Berlin blue, but later became known as Prussian blue. By 1710 it was {{being used by the}} French painter Antoine Watteau, and later his successor Nicolas Lancret. It became immensely popular for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wallpaper,</b> and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{discusses the}} different uses <b>of</b> reproduction <b>wallpaper</b> in historic buildings, starting with reasoning about {{the concepts of}} heritage, authenticity, reconstructions and copies. In order to apply these notions on wallpapers is the historic development <b>of</b> <b>wallpapers</b> presented. This {{is followed by a}} presentation of the function <b>of</b> <b>wallpapers</b> in environments <b>of</b> cultural significance, their conservation and preservation, as well as the most common causes of deterioration. Different manners of reproduction is introduced and later on discussed based on terms of authenticity and value. Four cases <b>of</b> <b>wallpaper</b> reconstructions in historic interiors are discussed in conjunction with previously presented facts. The use <b>of</b> reconstructed <b>wallpapers</b> appears to be relatively differently targeted and differs in every particular case. This could be a possible risk in the continued preservation and presentation <b>of</b> historic <b>wallpapers</b> in the built heritage because of the risk of subjective decisions without support in the general ethical guidelines within the field of preservation.

The final goal is the development of a web-based calculator open for use to both Mini Max staff and the general public. We propose an approach for reducing the studied problem to the one-dimensional cutting-stock problem. We show this in details for the case <b>of</b> plain <b>wallpapers</b> {{as well as for the}} case <b>of</b> patterned <b>wallpapers</b> with straight match. The one-dimensional cutting-stock problem can be formulated as a linear integer programming problem. We develop an approach for calculating the needed number <b>of</b> <b>wallpapers</b> for relatively small problems, create an algorithm in a suitable graphical interface and make different tests. The tests show the efficiency of the proposed approach compared with the existent (available) wallpapers’ calculators...|$|R

40|$|Wallpaper is {{the biggest}} {{commitment}} we make to design in our homes. It is a statement of colour and patternity bigger than any other. And more than anything else, the wallpaper we choose instantly communicates our taste. For craft makers, wallpaper is a huge canvas that requires many stages of design, planning and making. Modern digital printing techniques have allowed new designs <b>of</b> <b>wallpapers</b> to be <b>manufactured,</b> designs that rely less on repeats than traditional wallpapers. But as this exhibition will show, many makers are drawn to traditional hand screen or lino printing techniques for the different quality of finish they allow. This exhibition will explore and celebrate the hand printed techniques <b>of</b> <b>wallpaper</b> production, showcasing the most exciting designers and makers across the UK who champion a return to this better quality <b>of</b> <b>wallpaper</b> production. 23 makers will be on show in the exhibition, including hand–blocked beauties by octogenarian designer Marthe Armitage, St Jude’s delicate, illustrative wallpapers and Mini Moderns’ graphic <b>wallpaper</b> lusciousness.
