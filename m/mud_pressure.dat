50|$|The {{downhole}} fluid {{pressures are}} controlled in modern wells through the balancing of the hydrostatic pressure {{provided by the}} mud column. Should {{the balance of the}} drilling <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> be incorrect (i.e., the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and/or water) can begin to flow into the wellbore and up the annulus (the space between the outside of the drill string and the wall of the open hole or the inside of the casing), and/or inside the drill pipe. This is commonly called a kick. Ideally, mechanical barriers such as blowout preventers (BOPs) can be closed to isolate the well while the hydrostatic balance is regained through circulation of fluids in the well. But if the well is not shut in (common term for the closing of the blow-out preventer), a kick can quickly escalate into a blowout when the formation fluids reach the surface, especially when the influx contains gas that expands rapidly with the reduced pressure as it flows up the wellbore, further decreasing the effective weight of the fluid.|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of applying a self-adaptive filter to eliminate {{noise in the}} downhole <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> phase shift keying (PSK) signals is studied. The self-adaptive filter with carrier wave as the filter input signal and <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signal including noise as the filter expected input signal in structure was adopted to process the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signals with the broadband signal characteristic in communication. Mathematical model of the filter was built to reconstruct the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signals based on the evaluation criterion of least mean square error (LMS) and the mathematical model of <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signals. According to the filter mathematical model, a special self-adaptive control algorithm was adopted to realize the filter by adjusting the filter weight coefficients self-adaptively and the impacts of the filter step-size factor on {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) and distortion factors of the reconstructed <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signals were analyzed. Numerical calculation and simulation show that the self-adaptive filter can efficiently eliminate random noise in the signal frequency band and reconstruct the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signals. In addition, low distortion factors of the reconstructed <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> PSK signals can be obtained by reasonable selecting the filter step-size factor...|$|E
30|$|The mud density (<b>mud</b> <b>pressure)</b> is a {{dominant}} parameter that greatly influences {{the stability of}} wells, especially while drilling is being performed (Pašić et al. 2007). Pressure exerted by the drilling fluid (mud) instigates an additional concentration of stresses in the surroundings of the wellbore. Since the presence of effective stresses impacts on rock material behaviour, including failure, stability is highly dependent on {{the management of the}} <b>mud</b> <b>pressure.</b> The magnitude of <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> applied has to be adequate to avoid damage. Optimal values are usually in the high range; however, if the pressure is too high it may result in tensile fracturing and fluid loss, which are typical causes of instability. On the other hand, a <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> that is below the threshold (critical) value may not be sufficient in providing the necessary stress counterbalance to forestall collapse due to a preponderance of shear failure. The appropriate range of safe <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> is dependent on the local factors controlling individual cases and may differ for each scenario.|$|E

30|$|The {{probabilistic}} approach, on {{the other}} hand, recognises the existence of inherent uncertainties arising due to factors such as (Bulleit 2008) material heterogeneity, time, human error, statistical limits, restrictions in models and randomness. Uncertainty is considered the norm {{rather than the exception}} (Kirchsteiger 1999), and even when the level of statistical certainty is set to as high as 0.95, there is still a large degree of flexibility that stretches the limits of the band of safe <b>mud</b> <b>pressures.</b> The inconsistency in the design parameters implemented via variable values of input rock properties—elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and void ratio—permits the realisation of a broader range of safe operating conditions vis-à-vis where consistent and/or uniform values of rock properties are employed.|$|R
30|$|ECD {{is defined}} as the sum of the <b>mud</b> {{hydrostatic}} <b>pressure</b> and the annulus pressure loss acting on the formation (Haciislamoglu 1994).

30|$|The system {{designed}} includes two parts: the down-hole part {{and the surface}} part. The down-hole part modulates the data from both down-hole sensors and the embedded computing module, creating <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> pulses to carry encoded down-hole data to the surface. At the surface, the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> pulses are detected, transformed, processed, and decoded.|$|E
30|$|For a {{designated}} pair of compressive and tensile stability criteria, {{the probability of}} generated tensile strains exceeding the given tensile strain criterion reduces as the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased, while the probability of the compressive strains exceeding the specified compressive strain criterion rises as <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> is increased. However, {{the magnitude of the}} produced strains taken into account during stochastic analyses is lower in comparison with those from deterministic analyses, thus permitting a wider safe <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> window. The stochastic approach implicitly refines the definition of the compressive and tensile stability criteria by providing for uncertainties and variable geo-mechanical conditions.|$|E
30|$|Wellbore {{stability}} {{problems are}} known to cost {{the oil and gas}} industry billions of dollars each year. However, these costs can be significantly reduced through the application of comprehensive geomechanical models. This paper is relevant and is appropriate in {{the oil and gas industry}}. The objective of this paper is the comparison of four rock failure criteria, named the Mohr–Coulomb, Mogi–Coulomb, Modified Lade and Tresca yield criterion and to apply them to determine the optimum drilling direction and <b>mud</b> <b>pressure.</b> The stability models has been applied to a well located in Iran oil field and leads to easily computed expression for the critical <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> required to maintain wellbore stability. Then the finite difference method was used to show the validation and accuracy of predicted <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> and investigate the wellbore stability in different states of vertical, horizontal and deviated. The results showed that the Mohr–Coulomb and Tresca criteria estimate the highest minimum <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> required for wellbore stability while the Mogi–Coulomb and the Modified Lade criteria estimate the lowest minimum <b>mud</b> <b>pressure.</b> Nevertheless, the mud pressures predicted by all these four criteria are acceptable and can be used.|$|E

50|$|In modern rotary drilling, mud is {{circulated}} {{down the}} drill pipe and {{back up the}} well bore to the surface. The goal is to equalize the pressure through the shaft and to monitor the returning mud for gas. Without the counter-pressure provided by the circulating <b>mud,</b> the <b>pressure</b> in the formation allowed oil to fill the well column, blowing out the well. The oil caught fire, and Sedco 135 burned and collapsed into the sea.|$|R
30|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of any type}} of stress around the wellbore depends on the stresses generated by the applied <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> in conjunction with those generated by drawdown.

According to analyze the characteristics of <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> pulses, the scheme applied negative pulses to transmit downlink instructions was established. Furthermore, the receiving system which identified instructions by detecting the time difference between falling edges of adjacent pulses was developed.

30|$|In this paper, we {{will use}} first the Mohr–Coulomb, Mogi–Coulomb, Modified Lade and Tresca {{criteria}} to determine the optimum drilling direction and <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> for a well located in Iran oil field.

40|$|Lost {{circulation}} {{can cause}} {{an increase in}} time and cost of operation. Pipe sticking, formation damage and uncontrolled flow {{of oil and gas}} may be consequences of lost circulation. Dealing with this problem is a key factor to conduct a successful drilling operation. Estimation of lost circulation amount is necessary to find a solution. Lost circulation is influenced by different parameters such as <b>mud</b> weight, pump <b>pressure,</b> depth etc. <b>Mud</b> weight, pump <b>pressure</b> and flow rate of mud should be designed to prevent induced fractures and have the least amount of lost circulation. Artificial neural network is useful to find the relations of parameters with lost circulation. Genetic algorithm is applied on the achieved relations to determine the optimum <b>mud</b> weight, pump <b>pressure,</b> and flow rate. In an Iranian oil field, daily drilling reports of wells which are drilled using UBD technique are studied. Asmari formation is the most important oil reservoir of the studied field and UBD is used only in this interval. Three wells with the most, moderate and without lost circulation are chosen. In this article, the effect of mud weight, depth, pump pressure and flow rate of pump on lost circulation in UBD of Asmari formation in one of the Southwest Iranian fields is studied using drilling data and artificial neural network. In addition, the amount of lost circulation is predicted precisely with respect to two of the studied parameters using the presented correlations and the optimum <b>mud</b> weight, pump <b>pressure</b> and flow rate are calculated to minimize the lost circulation amount...|$|R
30|$|In {{optimizing}} processes {{the variation}} in parameters such as annulus volume, penetration rate, flow rate of mud pump, <b>mud</b> pump <b>pressure,</b> hydrostatic <b>pressure,</b> viscosity of <b>mud</b> filtration, solid content, plastic viscosity, yield point, initial gel strength, and final gel strength after 10  min is allowable, whereas well coordination, depth, characteristic of formation, {{and the depth of}} formation tip should be constant. To minimize the function of loss circulation, two optimizing algorithms are examined. The best results are pertinent to particle swarm algorithm.|$|R
30|$|The {{molecular}} weight {{can be calculated}} from gas-specific gravity. Gas-specific gravity can be calculated from shut-in drillpipe pressure, shut-in casing <b>pressure,</b> <b>mud</b> density, and pit gain, or from offset well gas property. Bottomhole temperature and temperature at any depth can be estimated using regional temperature gradient. Gravity force of gas column is constant during the gas migration.|$|R
3000|$|Case 4 Partial {{loss and}} total loss in natural {{fractures}}: Once the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is greater than}} the minimum stress (p mud > σ min) in the preexisting uncemented fractures, the fractures will open and the mud will flow into the natural fractures. The degree of mud loss depends on both fracture properties (e.g., fracture aperture and spacing) and the difference of the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> and the minimum stress.|$|E
3000|$|If {{we assume}} the {{pressure}} gradient to be hydrostatic at this site, the pressure difference between borehole and rock pore {{is generated by}} drilling <b>mud</b> <b>pressure,</b> because the drilling mud density was 1.024 (Kinoshita et al. 2009). A temporal increase in the <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> can {{be observed by the}} average annular pressure (APRS) profile in Figure  4, which has the effect of increasing S [...]...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, the mud {{pressures}} {{predicted by}} all these criteria are acceptable {{and can be}} used with exception of Tresca criterion, since it overestimates the required <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> for wellbore stability. Therefore, a <b>mud</b> <b>pressure</b> range of 40.38 – 43  MPa is recommended for drilling the vertical section and 49.53 – 55.14 for horizontal sections of the mentioned well. This is 0.38 – 3  MPa higher than reservoir pressure. This difference is enough to guarantee wellbore stability conditions.|$|E
30|$|The input {{parameters}} {{used to evaluate}} wellbore stability are derived from data that tend to be inconsistent. The uncertainty in data is thus manifested in the results of predicted safe <b>mud</b> <b>pressures.</b> The variability of each input parameter should be accounted for {{in a manner that}} properly represents their uncertainties. This can be accomplished by employing quantitative risk analysis (QRA), where, as applied by Moos et al. (2003) and McLellan and Hawkes (1998), cumulative distribution density (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) curves are used to measure uncertainties in {{input parameters}}. Where actual/real data are accessible, CDF and PDF curves that more accurately portray disparities in values of input parameters are used. In the absence of reliable data, the values of input parameters are varied between upper and lower bounds with the PDF defined by an appropriate distribution function. Examples of continuous distribution supported on bounded intervals are uniform distributions, truncated normal distributions, logit-normal distributions, logarithmic distributions and triangular distributions. An example of a continuous distribution supported on semi-infinite intervals is the log-normal distribution, and an example of a continuous distribution that takes values over the whole “real line” is the generalised normal (generalised Gaussian) distribution. At one end, if there is absolutely no indication of the likely values, the uniform distribution is adopted because of the high degree of caution required. At the other end, it is pertinent to use the triangular distribution where a specific value has been identified as most likely to occur.|$|R

30|$|Latter studies (Al-Ajmi and Al-Harthy 2010; Al-Khayari et al. 2016; Niño 2016; Sheng et al. 2006) have {{included}} {{some aspects of}} sensitivity analyses using, for instance, the one-at-a-time (OAT) technique, to identify critical parameters. To quantify uncertainties in input data (rock properties), Niño (2016) applied four approaches: expert judgement; spatial variability; indirect measurement [a procedure borrowed from Holzberg (2001)]; and inconsistency of data sources, using Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation was applied in the model output uncertainty analyses and used to derive safe mud windows based on probability estimates. Sensitivity analyses were also completed using both the one-at-a-time (OAT) method and the response surface methodology (RSM). The maximum horizontal stress and cohesion were key to determining collapse pressure, since they had the most influence, while the maximum and minimum stresses played a similar role in estimating the fracture pressure. The Poisson ratio and vertical stress were perceived to have trivial effects on responses. Similarly, critical <b>mud</b> <b>pressures</b> have been estimated through probabilistic wellbore stability analysis where Monte Carlo sampling techniques were used to capture uncertainties in in situ stresses, wellbore trajectory, cohesion, friction angle, Poisson ratio (Al-Ajmi and Al-Harthy 2010; Al-Khayari et al. 2016; Sheng et al. 2006), pore water pressure and rock strength (Sheng et al. 2006). Wellbore trajectory was determined as the most influential parameter causing wellbore collapse (Al-Khayari et al. 2016), while other critical parameters impacting on wellbore stability were identified as friction angle, cohesion and maximum horizontal stress (Al-Ajmi and Al-Harthy 2010). Comparisons between Mogi–Coulomb and Mohr–Coulomb failure criteria indicate that the former produces greater (conservative) magnitudes of minimum overbalance pressures (Al-Ajmi and Al-Harthy 2010).|$|R
