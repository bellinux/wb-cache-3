40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> by Central Banks, {{as a means}} of promoting financial stability, has raised many questions regarding the interaction between them. Given the limited number of studies available, this paper sheds light on this issue by providing a critical and systematic review of the literature. The paper begins with a discussion of the trade-off between price stability and financial stability. We find that financial intermediation acts as the main channel in connecting monetary and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies.</b> We find that the theoretical and empirical studies are grouped around four main mechanisms in explaining this interaction: cost of funds, collateral constraint, financial intermediaries and payment systems. By examining these mechanisms, it is argued that monetary policy alone is not sufficient for maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> need to supplement monetary policy to achieve price and financial stability. We also find that the role of the exchange rate is critical in the implementation of monetary and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> in emerging markets. Volatile capital flows pose another challenge for the implementation of monetary and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies.</b> The arrangement of monetary and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> also varies across countries, depending on the challenges and institutional arrangements in a particular country. Consequently, a number of implications for theory, policy and practice are proposed...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> in mitigating liquidity traps. When constrained households engage in deleveraging, the interest rate needs to fall to induce unconstrained households {{to pick up the}} decline in aggregate demand. If the fall in the interest rate is limited by the zero lower bound, aggregate demand is insufficient and the economy enters a liquidity trap. In this environment, households' ex ante leverage and insurance decisions are associated with aggregate demand externalities. Welfare can be improved with <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> targeted toward reducing leverage.

40|$|The {{enormous}} and prolonged economic {{fallout from the}} global financial crisis and the subsequent deleveraging have convincingly demonstrated the need to mitigate the risk of crisis. We should have known this {{from the work of}} Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff (2009), but the lesson has finally stuck. My topic this afternoon centers on the role of monetary policy in avoiding financial crises. The conventional wisdom can be stated as follows: The first line of defense against financial instability is strong and robust micro and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies.</b> Monetary policy should only be a last resort. I agree with the first statement that micro and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> are the appropriate first lines of defense. But I am also concerned that these defenses can be breached, and, as a result, monetary policy will likely need to play a more active role. Therefore, we must think hard about how to design monetary policy strategies that complement <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policies</b> and contribute to financial stability, and thereby contribute to macroeconomic stability. This afternoon, I will aim to make three basic points: First, despite serious reforms to strengthen our financial system, significant risk remains that another asset bubble could develop. Moreover, the financial system and the economy are still vulnerable to such an event. Second...|$|R

5000|$|Following Borio (2003), the macro- and microprudential {{perspectives}} {{differ in}} terms of their objectives and understanding on the nature of risk. Traditional microprudential regulation seeks to enhance the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, as opposed to the macroprudential view which focuses on welfare of the financial system as a whole. Further, risk is taken as exogenous under the microprudential perspective, in the sense of assuming that any potential shock triggering a financial crisis has its origin beyond the behavior of the financial system. The macroprudential approach, on the other hand, recognizes that risk factors may configure endogenously, i.e., as a systemic phenomenon. In line with this reasoning, <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policy</b> addresses the interconnectedness of individual financial institutions and markets, as well as their common exposure to economic risk factors. It also focuses on the procyclical behavior of the financial system in the effort to foster its stability.|$|E
50|$|As an {{economist}} at the OECD, Thorgeirsson was the co-author of several Economic Surveys for Finland and Norway, respectively, wherein he developed fiscal and monetary policy advice for these countries. In his capacity as chief economist for the Federation of Icelandic Industries in 2001-2004, Thorgeirsson was a participant in the debate in Iceland concerning membership in the European Union. During this time Thorgeirsson emphasised the advantages of the euro while warning about potential problems with the króna especially if monetary policy became restrictive. He advised the examination of other ways to adopt the euro if EU membership was a sticking point. He said the challenge for economic policy with a single European currency was overstated due to normal adjustment in a market economy. He warned against calls for a multi-currency system and advised of the benefits of the euro for financial stability. He presented an estimate of the potential benefit of EU membership for Iceland and suggested that small states benefited more from EU membership. In 2003, while calling for restraint in fiscal policy, bank lending and private sector decisions, Thorgeirsson warned of an exchange rate rise and subsequent collapse of the króna following the expected high interest rate policy path of the Central Bank during a FDI-led boom. At the same time, he suggested a moderate monetary policy path be considered (where domestic interest rates do not devitate too much from international rates). In May 2004, the central bank began to raise its policy interest rates from 5.3%, and by December 2007 it stood at 13.75%. Over this period, significant inflows of foreign capital took place, the exchange rate appreciated, bank lending surged and debt levels rose. The Icelandic króna and the oversized banking system collapsed in the Autumn of 2008 when global financial markets seized up. While serving as Director-General in the Ministry of Finance, Thorgeirsson suggested that the efficacy of fiscal policy was underrated in the upswing while that of monetary policy was overrated. More recently, while at the Central Bank,he has written about institutional reform in financial surveillance, with a focus on <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policy.</b> He has also performed research into the policy responses to the Icelandic banking collapse, finding that the government selected the optimal path to emerge from the crisis.|$|E

Within this model, welfare-maximizing monetary policy aims to stabilize only inflation and <b>macroprudential</b> <b>policy</b> only stabilizes credit. Two aspects of the model account for this dichotomy. First, credit stabilization is welfare improving because lower volatility is compensated by higher mean equilibrium credit and capital.
