5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, <b>meandering</b> air {{currents}} in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main jet streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a <b>meandering</b> shape.

5|$|Upon exiting Columbia County, Little Catawissa Creek enters Union Township, Schuylkill County. It {{continues}} {{east and}} its valley becomes narrower and shallower. Over {{the next several}} miles, the creek turns east-northeast and its valley gets broader again. It then turns abruptly north and passes through a ridge. The creek briefly turns northeast before turning north-northeast after a few hundred feet. Approximately a mile downstream, it receives its first named tributary, Trexler Run. At this point, the creek turns abruptly east-northeast. After some distance, it begins <b>meandering</b> northeast for a few miles, receiving the tributary Stony Run.

5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the <b>meandering</b> in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E

50|$|Some {{research}} has been done to show the importance of <b>meander</b> cutoffs. Cutoffs have been shown to limit the age of a river <b>meander</b> and how large that <b>meander</b> can get. <b>Meander</b> cutoffs influence the formation of a river’s floodplain and continue to do so as the river evolves. Cutoffs can also affect the way that other river bends adjacent to the cutoff evolve over time which can then affect other bends further downstream throughout the river. <b>Meander</b> cutoffs reduce a river’s sinuosity, thus straightening out a river’s channel. Understanding the processes that form <b>meander</b> cutoffs can allow one to predict how a river will evolve in the future which is important for agricultural businesses and controlling future floods.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Bingiza {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, which resulted in a slow, <b>meandering</b> motion toward the southwest. Its motion turned to the south on February10, with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification. After two days of <b>meandering</b> without strengthening, Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar. Around the same time, upper-level conditions began improving, which allowed the convection to increase in coverage. Based on the improved appearance, MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600UTC on February12 about 335km (210mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery, signaling the beginning of a rapid deepening trend. Late on February12, MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity, which is the equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon. With minimal wind shear and warm waters, the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Continuing to strengthen, Bingiza attained 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) early on February13. Similarly, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph), noting a contracting eye 37km (23mi) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle.|$|E
5|$|While Connie was <b>meandering</b> in {{the western}} Atlantic Ocean, its {{potential}} track posed problems for forecasters. On August7, a hurricane warning was issued from North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia, with a hurricane alert further north to New York City. The Weather Bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to Delaware Breakwater, with storm warnings further northeast to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The alert for North Carolina was up for about three days until Connie moved inland.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed {{from the area}} of convection, which was also deteriorating. After <b>meandering,</b> the storm began to move westward. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as high pressure {{to the south of}} Bermuda was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the Azores. By 1800UTC on August14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant low, and the National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August18.|$|E

5|$|Cyclonic Storm Keila (IMD designation: ARB 02, JTWC designation: 03A) was {{the first}} named storm of the 2011 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.

The remnants soon after moved offshore, dissipating on November4.|$|E
5|$|Further {{intensification}} was slowed {{because of}} strong wind shear, which caused the storm's center of circulation to be displaced from {{the bulk of}} convection. Due {{to the lack of}} atmospheric steering currents at the time, Odile assumed a slow, <b>meandering</b> course towards the west. Continued wind shear caused the tropical storm to become disorganized on September11 before abating, allowing for thunderstorms to rebuild over Odile's circulation center on September12. The relaxed wind shear enabled the growth of intense rainbands encircling the tropical cyclone as well as improved outflow aloft. The following day, Odile quickly attained a large central dense overcast; in accordance with Dvorak-derived satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the storm to hurricane intensity.|$|E

50|$|Bank erosion at cutbanks on {{the outside}} of <b>meanders</b> {{combined}} with deposition of point bars on the inside of <b>meanders</b> cause channel migration. The greatest bank erosion often occurs just downstream of the <b>meander</b> apex, causing downstream migration as the high velocity flow eats away at the bank as it is forced around the <b>meander</b> curve. Avulsion is another process of channel migration that occurs much more rapidly than the gradual migration process of cutbank erosion and point bar deposition. Avulsion occurs when lateral migration causes two <b>meanders</b> to become so close that the river bank between them is breached, causing the joining of the <b>meanders</b> and the creation of two channels. When the original channel is cut off from the new channel by the deposition of sediments, oxbow lakes are formed. Channel migration is important to sustaining diverse aquatic and riparian habitats The migration causes sediments and woody debris to enter the river, and creates areas of new floodplain {{on the inside of the}} <b>meander.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of the Kuroshio large <b>meander</b> in summer 2004 was investigated by using the cruise data, Argo profiles data, and satellite remote sensing data. We validated the point that cyclonic eddy contributes to the large <b>meander.</b> Besides, the impacts of typhoons on Kuroshio <b>meanders</b> were studied. From 29 July to 4 August, the typhoons stirred the ocean and upwelled the deep water, which enhanced the existed cyclonic eddy, and immediately made a drastic <b>meander</b> of the Kuroshio. Moreover, the unexpected typhoons in June 2004 {{also contributed to the}} initial <b>meander</b> at Tokara Strait. The result suggests an alternative <b>meander</b> mechanism of Kuroshio path via typhoon-eddy-Kuroshio interactions. It is argued that typhoons accompanied with cyclonic eddies, might play crucial roles in <b>meanders</b> of the Kuroshio. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the west boundary flows like the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream, and will be useful in eddy-resolution models.
