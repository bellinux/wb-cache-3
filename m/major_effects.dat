5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic innervation to {{a very large number of}} structures. <b>Major</b> <b>effects</b> of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
5|$|A large {{volcanic}} eruption from any volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> on the Sea-to-Sky Highway and municipalities such as Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton and probably Vancouver. Because of these concerns, the Geological Survey of Canada {{is planning to}} create hazard maps and emergency plans for Mount Cayley, as well as Mount Meager north of the volcanic field, which experienced a major {{volcanic eruption}} 2,350years ago similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} the genetic component controlling liability to alcoholism, complex segregation analysis was performed on 35 multigenerational families each ascertained through a pair of male alcoholics. The results suggest that liability to alcoholism is, in part, controlled by a <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> with or without additional multifactorial effects. Mendelian transmission of this <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> was rejected, as was the hypothesis that the <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> is due to a single major locus. Absence of this <b>major</b> <b>effect,</b> leaving only multifactorial effects, was also rejected. Some sources for the non-Mendelian character of the <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> are suggested, such as a combination of two or more Mendelian loci, the presence of phenocopies, sex-dependent differences in the underlying liability model, or heterogeneity in the alcoholism phenotype. Evidence for and against each is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with <b>major</b> <b>effects,</b> or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 30, as {{the system}} moved towards the east-southeast, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for the Cook Islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia, while issuing strong wind {{warnings}} and tropical cyclone alerts {{for the rest of}} the Southern Islands. The warnings were subsequently maintained until later that day, as Sina spared the Cook Islands its <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> and re-curved sharply towards the south-southeast. Only minor damage to shallow rooted crops and weak structures was reported, after high seas and gale force winds buffeted the northern side of Rarotonga.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions have been significantly altered {{from the original}} conditions {{by the presence of}} life-forms, which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods, and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.|$|E

40|$|<b>Major</b> <b>effect</b> {{genes are}} often used for {{germplasm}} identification, for diversity analyses and as selection targets in breeding. To date, only a few morphological characters have been mapped as <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> genes {{across a range of}} genetic linkage maps based on different types of molecular markers in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). This study aims to integrate all available previously mapped <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> genes onto a complete genome map, linked to the whole genome sequence, allowing sorghum breeders and researchers to link this information to QTL studies and {{to be aware of the}} consequences of selection for major genes. This provides new opportunities for breeders to take advantage of readily scorable morphological traits and to develop more effective breeding strategies. We also provide examples of the impact of selection for <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> genes on quantitative traits in sorghum. The concepts described in this paper have particular application to breeding programmes in developing countries where molecular markers are expensive or impossible to access...|$|R

5|$|Josephine {{also caused}} <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> to marine interests. High waves, {{estimated}} to have exceeded 15ft (4.6m), disabled a sailboat with a crew of six on it. They were quickly rescued after issuing a distress signal to a nearby tanker vessel. The storm caused the loss of 1,799bags of sorghum from water damage when a freighter encountered Josephine en route to Baltimore, Maryland. The major shipping lanes of North America were severely impacted, with more than 25 ships reporting winds of at least 58mph (93km/h) {{over a period of}} nine days. Furthermore, at least five of those ships reported hurricane force winds during a period of six days. The highest wind speed reported from a ship was 92mph (148km/h), which was observed on October16.|$|E
5|$|While no new locales were {{introduced}} in Episode One, large alterations {{were made to the}} appearance of both City 17 where the game takes place and the Citadel from the end of Half-Life 2 to reflect the changing shape of the world and remind the player that their actions have <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> on the story line. The Citadel has degenerated from the cold, alien, and imposing fortress of the previous game into an extremely unstable state. This provides a visual cue to the player of the catastrophic damage they inflicted, and it allows for the introduction of new gameplay elements that accentuate the dangers which come with the Citadel's imminent collapse. In addition, it serves a thematic purpose by highlighting the weakening of the Combine's dominance in City 17. Likewise, City 17 has been altered to reflect the aftermath of the resistance's open rebellion, with vast swathes of destroyed buildings, and the introduction of foes previously kept outside its confines in Half-Life 2 to emphasize the scale of the uprising.|$|E

25|$|Constructivism was {{an artistic}} and {{architectural}} philosophy that originated in Russia beginning in 1913 by Vladimir Tatlin. This was {{a rejection of}} the idea of autonomous art. He wanted 'to construct' art. The movement was in favour of art as a practice for social purposes. Constructivism had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements. Its influence was pervasive, with <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> upon architecture, graphic design, industrial design, theatre, film, dance, fashion and to some extent music.|$|E

40|$|Commingling and {{segregation}} of age-sex-adjusted {{systolic blood pressure}} (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were examined in 1, 560 individuals from 374 French-Canadian nuclear families. After correction for skewness, evidence in favor of two commingled distributions was found for SBP in the combined data (parents and offspring) and in parents, but not in offspring. Segregation analysis (using the computer program POINTER) suggested that a multifactorial contribution to all three phenotypes was greater in offspring than in parents, which could {{be the result of}} either polygenic or shared environmental components relevant to sibships, or both. Statistical evidence was found for a <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> on SBP. However, Mendelian transmission of the <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> was rejected, and no transmission of the <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> (equal tau's) was not. This is just the opposite to what would be expected if the <b>major</b> <b>effect</b> was due to a major gene, and it would ordinarily be considered as sufficient evidence to refute a <b>major</b> gene <b>effect</b> on SBP. However, the commingling in parents but not in offspring (who are all below 26 years of age), and the finding of equal transmission probabilities (nearly equal to 1), are compatible with an alternative interpretation. It is possible that there is a real <b>major</b> gene <b>effect</b> on SBP but that the genotype for elevated SBP has not yet expressed itself in the offspring as they have not yet gone through the risk period. Accordingly, this possibility needs to be evaluated further in additional studies involving older offspring...|$|R
25|$|Mine collapses (or mine subsidences) {{have the}} {{potential}} to produce <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> above ground, which are especially devastating in developed areas. German underground coal-mining (especially in North Rhine-Westphalia) has damaged thousands of houses, and the coal-mining industries have set aside large sums in funding for future subsidence damages as part of their insurance and state-subsidy schemes. In a particularly spectacular case in the German Saar region (another historical coal-mining area), a suspected mine collapse in 2008 created an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, causing some damage to houses. Previously, smaller earthquakes had become increasingly common and coal mining was temporarily suspended in the area.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl transdermal patches (Durogesic/Duragesic) {{are used}} in chronic pain management. The patches work by slowly {{releasing}} fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage {{is based on the}} size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have <b>major</b> <b>effects.</b> The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opiate (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E was {{the final}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season. The storm developed out of a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on October 8. The wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific on October 18. The system began to gradually organize, and on October 25 it was classified as a tropical depression. The storm did not significantly intensify, as wind shear prevented it from attaining tropical storm status. The short-lived depression moved northward, and made landfall in Mexico on October 26. Quickly deteriorating, the system dissipated shortly thereafter, although its remnants persisted for a couple more days. The depression had no <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> on land. However, it produced heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, and the remnants triggered thunderstorms over the southwestern United States.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> of {{the fort}} was its role in {{expanding}} the Chouteau trade operation. While commander {{of the fort}}, Pierre Chouteau (along with his son, Auguste Pierre Chouteau) expanded trade from Fort Carondelet to other Osage settlements near the Arkansas River by 1796. By 1800 rivals to the Chouteau operation began demanding that the government break its contract monopoly. That same year, new Spanish Governor General Juan Manuel de Salcedo gave the Chouteau's trade rights {{to one of their}} Spanish rivals, Manuel Lisa. In 1802, abandoning his effort to maintain his monopoly, Pierre Chouteau sold Fort Carondelet to Lisa, who withdrew the garrison and abandoned the fort. During the transfer of the Louisiana territory to the possession of the United States in 1804, Auguste Chouteau was employed by Spain to remove any remaining Spanish property from the fort.|$|E
25|$|Mergers {{with and}} sales to other breweries {{occurred}} over the years. A merger with competitor Portland Brewing brought the Blitz name into the formal name of the brewery. Arnold Blitz, who had owned Portland Brewing, became Chairman of the new Blitz-Weinhard company. The new company took 20 years to modernize the brewery and recover from Prohibition, which ended in 1933. In 1979, Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company. Pabst then sold the brewery to Stroh Brewing Company in 1996. The last and final sale of the company in 1999 had <b>major</b> <b>effects</b> on the brewery building. Stroh's sold the Henry Weinhard's brand to Miller Brewing Company, and moved all Henry's brewing operations to the Olympia Brewery in Tumwater, Washington. After nearly 135 years of continual operations, the Weinhard Brewery brewed its last beer on August 27, 1999. It was put up for sale the following month.|$|E
