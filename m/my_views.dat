25|$|In his {{references}} {{to my own}} work, Gould includes at least nine citations that involve {{more than just an}} expression of Gould's opinion; in these citations Gould purportedly paraphrases <b>my</b> <b>views.</b> Yet in eight of the nine cases, Gould's representation of these views is false, misleading, or grossly caricatured. Nonspecialists could {{have no way of knowing}} any of this without reading the cited sources. While an author can occasionally make an inadvertent mistake in paraphrasing another, it appears Gould's paraphrases are consistently slanted to serve his own message.|$|E
500|$|The 1990s are remembered, {{by many in}} the West, as a time of {{relative}} prosperity and satisfaction. [...] According to some historians, visionary politics appeared to be on the decline. [...] However, even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992, he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post-liberal, post-Marxist ideology. [...] He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach. [...] "I knew <b>my</b> <b>views</b> (and I personally) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition", he wrote.|$|E
500|$|In 1926 Pankhurst {{joined the}} Conservative Party {{and two years}} later ran as a {{candidate}} for Parliament in Whitechapel and St George's. Her transformation from a fiery supporter of the ILP and window-smashing radical to an official Conservative Party member surprised many people. She replied succinctly: [...] "My war experience and my experience {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic have changed <b>my</b> <b>views</b> considerably." [...] Her biographers insist that the move was more complex; she was devoted to a programme of women's empowerment and anti-communism. Both the Liberal and Labour parties bore grudges for her work against them in the WSPU, and the Conservative Party had a victorious record after the war and a significant majority. Pankhurst's membership of the Conservative Party may have had as much to do with ensuring her aims of obtaining the vote for women were achieved as with ideology.|$|E

500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because <b>my</b> <b>views</b> have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Desha, the {{outgoing}} governor, {{refused to believe}} that his party had lost the election. He disliked Metcalfe not only due to his party affiliation, {{but also because of}} his occupation as a stonemason, which he believed was too low a calling for a governor. Metcalfe's opponents made slights on the quality of his stone work and his views on the Old Court-New Court controversy. When told about these charges, Metcalfe remarked [...] "They may say what they like about <b>my</b> <b>views,</b> but the first man that dares to attack my character, I will cleave his skull with my stone hammer, as I would cleave a rock." [...] As word of this remark spread, Metcalfe was given the nickname [...] "Old Stone Hammer." [...] Despite his threats to remain in the governor's mansion until the legislature convened, Desha respected the will of the people, and left the residence on September 2, 1828.|$|E
500|$|... "During {{many years}} I {{collected}} {{notes on the}} origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against <b>my</b> <b>views.</b> It seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." [...] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: [...] "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man." ...|$|E

He also felt that Rhys becoming aware of Torchwood [...] "adds a new and interesting dynamic to the show." [...] Stephen Frank, writing for the gay and bisexual male entertainment site AfterElton indicated that he was [...] "all in favour" [...] of getting [...] "to know our favorite Cardiff cuckold [...] a little bit better". Though critical of Gwen's characterisation in previous episodes, he praised her defense of Rhys' memories {{at the end of the}} episode as her [...] "finest moment on this show" [...] and stated that it [...] "helps rehabilitate her". He stated overall that [...] "Meat" [...] had [...] "performed something of a minor miracle in the way it’s made me reassess <b>my</b> <b>views</b> of both Gwen and Rhys and their relationship." [...] Alasdair Stewart of Firefox News felt that Tregenna had written some of the strongest episodes of the series in the past and stated the episode [...] "should be one of the highlights of the series" [...] but [...] "instead, it's a mess". He criticised the plausibility of the villains, the poor special effects of the alien and the incompetency of the Torchwood team, describing the episode as containing a [...] "total lack of consistency" [...] and [...] "a total lack of basic understanding of what Torchwood are supposed to be capable of". He felt Kai Owen provided [...] "a bright spot in the episode" [...] describing him as [...] "clearly a powerhouse of an actor" [...] and opining that [...] "the scenes where he uncorks on first Eve Myles and then John Barrowman" [...] also brought out [...] "the best in both actors". Conversely, io9's Charlie Jane Anders felt the alien half of the episode to be [...] "one of the best examples of a humans-are-the-real-monsters story ever" [...] but felt that [...] "the other half of the episode was Torchwood at its rock-bottom worst". She criticised the argument scenes stating: [...] "I was having psychic chunks carved off me by a man in a yellow helmet, every time Gwen screamed at Rhys or Jack" [...] and felt overall that the episode contained [...] "too much screaming". She enjoyed the innuendos made by Jack, but criticised the scene where Gwen stared [...] "psycho-killerishly" [...] at him whilst kissing Rhys.|$|E
