25|$|This {{church has}} a fine 19th-century <b>mosaic</b> <b>paving</b> {{depicting}} the Tree of Jesse. It {{was designed and}} executed by Aston Webb.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time he was known for the many {{articles}} he published on Greek vases. In 1806, appeared his Dictionnaire des Beaux-Arts. From 1807 to 1811, appeared the four volumes of his Voyage dans les départemens du Midi de la France, accompanied by an atlas. In 1811 he travelled in Italy and Sicily, and afterwards published designs of the <b>mosaic</b> <b>paving</b> in the cathedrals of Apulia.|$|E
50|$|Portuguese {{pavement}} (in Portuguese, Calçada Portuguesa) {{is a kind}} of two-tone stone <b>mosaic</b> <b>paving</b> {{created in}} Portugal, and common throughout the Lusosphere. Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. Lisbon in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.|$|E
50|$|The apse is 10.8 m in {{diameter}} and the central nave is separated by two rows of 13 columns standing on hectagonal bases. Beneath the filling, there are earlier construction phases of the naves. The recent sondage shows traces of an arched foundation on both sides. Possibly the second floor was carried on this. These vaults were subsequently filled and the columns of the Optimus phase erected on this filled surface. Three gates {{were added to the}} north wall of which the central one is 4 m wide and two were added to the south wall. The northern entrances open onto the central ceremonial court which is surrounded with an L - shaped portico. All the material of this court is reused from earlier buildings. In the north of the court a baptistery pool was added to the basilical complex and the foundations of a <b>mosaic</b> <b>paved</b> building beside the pool may possibly be a bishops residence.|$|R
50|$|The {{fittings}} are of {{the highest}} quality, the original oak pews, a pulpit fashioned by Scott from carved panels acquired on his travels, a richly-decorated limestone font and the tomb of Francis Egerton and brasses and memorials to later {{members of the family}} in the Ellesmere Chapel. Additions were made in the 1880s including an ornate Italian marble and <b>mosaic</b> reredos, <b>paving</b> in the choir and sanctuary, carved choir stalls by R. Knill Freeman and a vestry when choral services were introduced. In 1894 a lectern designed by John Douglas was installed.|$|R
50|$|Oberlinden square {{features}} a well {{as well as}} a lime tree planted in 1729. A <b>mosaic</b> made of <b>paving</b> stone is still proof of this fact. As the tree is now diseased, it has to be felled and replaced. This will be carried out once the tram line refurbishment is complete.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on a}} historical-cultural {{analysis}} and field reconnaissance aimed at examining an iconography depicted in <b>mosaic</b> <b>paving</b> and figurative friezes. The iconographic cycle of the unicorn in the various Italian mediaeval artistic contexts summarizes a comprehensive network of historical links that, from India to the Mediterranean, attests the vitality of an imaginary figure spread by iconographic tradition...|$|E

5000|$|The {{rapid growth}} and {{accompanying}} pollution in Victorian cities caused great problems for architects including denial of light, overcrowding, awkward sites, noise, accessibility and visibility of buildings, and air pollution. Provision for [...] "the sufficiency of window light supplied throughout the building" [...] was {{addressed by the}} use of architectural devices: suspended first floor rooms, made possible {{by the use of}} iron-framed construction, skylights, extra windows and dormers, [...] "borrowed lights" [...] for interior spaces and glazed white bricks in conjunction with <b>mosaic</b> marble <b>paving</b> in areas where the light was [...] "less strong". Clear glass was used in important rooms, with light-coloured tints for coloured glazing, as [...] "the sky of Manchester does not favour the employment of deeply stained glass." ...|$|R
50|$|The Lebrija Palace or el Palacio de la Condesa de Lebrija can {{be found}} in one of Seville city centre’s busiest streets, Calle Cuna, {{parallel}} to the Calle Sierpes. Dating from the 16th century, it {{is considered one of the}} best residences in Seville. The palace is characterised by its collection of Roman <b>mosaics,</b> which <b>paved</b> almost the entire ground floor and lead the palace to be considered the ‘best paved house-palace in Europe’. There is also a great collection of well paraphets, amphoras, columns and sculptures of huge artist value.Its walls are a palette of architectural styles with elements such as Arabic-style arches, Plateresque decoration, tiles retrieved from ruined convent, a coffered ceiling from a 16th palace and a renaissance frieze, while its façade and layout remain true to typical Andalusian style.|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Maltese {{archaeologist}} Sir Themistocles Zammit led an exploratory excavation in government-owned fields in the valley of Ghajn Tuffieha (probably apple-tree spring) (Wettinger 2000 : 191), Mgarr, wherein passes the eponymous perennial spring. There, {{with the help of}} eight workmen, he uncovered, through a series of exploratory, shafts, several structures dating back to the Roman period in Malta, as well as several <b>mosaic</b> pavements and <b>paved</b> passageways. The finds were of such importance that on July 1930 the investigation on this site resumed, leading to further discoveries. N/...|$|R
50|$|Fisher has invented several brick <b>paving</b> and <b>mosaic</b> tiling systems. For the Orang Utan Pavement Maze at Edinburgh Zoo, {{he invented}} a new paver {{tessellation}} using 7-sided and 5-sided (regular pentagon) bricks. The 'Fisher Paver', his second paving system uses 7-sided and 4-sided bricks {{and has been}} installed within paving projects {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. Its benefits include being able to achieve dynamic and intriguing designs straight off the pallet with no cutting, thus offering excellent labour productivity when laying; it only requires one new 7-sided paver shape, yet its modular scale matches all industry-standard paving systems. Adrian’s third paving system is the Mitre System, which he invented and patented together with the American mathematician Ed Pegg. Used for both <b>mosaics</b> and <b>paving,</b> their distinctive angular shapes create unique and pleasing images. Notable examples of its use in England include four Historic Mosaics with the Millennium Maze in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and the 24 ft high SciTec Mosaic at Oundle School, Northamptonshire; and in America, the Tree of Life Mosaic in a private garden in Roxbury, Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|The most {{significant}} find {{is the great}} <b>mosaic</b> which <b>paved</b> all of the basilica, it {{was found in the}} left nave, in most of the middle nave and also in the right nave. There are different designs next to each other, among which, next to the usual four leafed rosettes and nods in circles or octagons (accompanied by Christian symbols like a Latin cross and a goblet), the especially intricate coats of arms with lozenges inscribed between them that take up most space in the middle nave; in it, an epigraph with the names of 14 sponsors is inscribed. The image of a peacock is of remarkable quality between the emblem {{in the center of the}} adjacent panel with the name of the sponsor Obsequentius. The motifs of the pavement belong to the usual repertoire of the era of the Roman Empire (Solomon's nods appear in Florence in the mosaics of the building underneath the baptistery) and the juxtaposition of different panels is found in many other examples in the Adriatic area.|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} {{pool and}} deck area, with restored tile <b>mosaics</b> and stone <b>paving,</b> is within a landscaped enclosure below the beach level. Facing {{the pool is}} a freestanding white colonnade that defines the location and scale of the mansion’s façade. The footprint of the huge structure is delineated on the parking lot behind the Pool House. Behind the colonnade, a series of 14 concrete pillars, each 30 feet high, is the new Pool House with changing rooms, restrooms and built-in cabana areas lined with wood stained in colors taken from the pool tile. On the second floor is a glass-enclosed event room and open terrace that overlooks the pool, with views along the coast from the Santa Monica Pier to the Santa Monica Mountains and back to Palisades Park.|$|R
