After briefly {{threatening}} to sue for libel and calling the report [...] "journalistic terrorism", Pérez Balladares later stated {{that it had been}} correct, describing it as [...] "the first time, perhaps in <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have had to swallow my words." [...] When Gorriti's work visa expired the following year, however, the Panamanian government refused to renew it, triggering a storm of criticism from international press NGOs and domestic opposition parties. Under pressure, the Pérez Balladares government later relented, and Gorriti's visa was renewed.|$|E
500|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} at first went to Kaunas but, after {{the formation of the}} ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Teeth" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Taja Riley, Pete Wyoming Bender, and Teddy Riley, and was {{produced}} by Gaga and Teddy Riley. It {{has been described as}} a [...] "perverse march" [...] and a [...] "gospel ode" [...] to sadomasochism. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is [...] "part musical, part country, and a little bit tribal in spots". Popjustice described [...] "Teeth" [...] as a [...] "wobbly, stompy, bouncy marching song" [...] that opens with the lyric [...] "don't want no money, just want your sex" [...] and later chants, [...] "show me your teeth!" [...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and I think that for a long time in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E

Davis later commented, [...] "There are few accomplishments in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am sincerely proud of. The Hollywood Canteen is one of them." [...] In 1980, she was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Medal, the United States Department of Defense's highest civilian award, for her work with the Hollywood Canteen.|$|E
2500|$|The narrator's {{situation}} {{throughout the}} essay {{is one of}} little prospect or prominence. He comments on how, {{even though he is}} of the ruling class, he finds himself either largely ignored by the Burmese people or hated. He remarks in the first sentence, [...] "I was hated by large numbers of people—the only time in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been important enough for this to happen to me." [...] Only with the expectation of a killing do the locals find him [...] "momentarily worth watching." [...] He describes how, as a police officer, he was often a target for mockery from the locals, as was any European who provided an easy target.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said. 'That's right. Quite right.

2500|$|When T.I. {{was asked}} about titling his album the same name {{as that of a}} Marvin Gaye song he said: [...] "I felt like at that moment in time, Marvin Gaye's life {{embodied}} what the word 'Trouble Man' and what the song meant in all senses of the word. And today... I feel like the past six, seven years of my life, and the adversity...in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have endured and overcame, that is synonymous and it embodies what the word 'Trouble Man' means today. Marvin Gaye did it for them back then, and I'm doing it for us right now," [...] added T.I.. [...] "Nothing but love and respect, and nothing but salutations and respect to Marvin Gaye and his whole family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Instead of Cambridge, Byron {{originally}} {{wanted to}} go to Christ Church, Oxford but there were no vacancies. Instead, he chose Cambridge at Drury's recommendation. The choice did not matter, since college life in general did not suit his personality. He wrote in his diary, [...] "I was so completely alone in this new world that it half broke my spirits... It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was no longer a boy". However, this did not mitigate his contempt towards the other students, and he quickly grew dissatisfied with the society surrounding Cambridge: [...] "It is the Devil or at least his principal residence. They call it the University, but any other appellation would have suited it better, for Study is the last pursuit of the Society".|$|E
2500|$|Becker and Fagen {{began playing}} in local groups. One such group, {{known as the}} Don Fagen Jazz Trio, the Bad Rock Group and later the Leather Canary, {{included}} future comedy star Chevy Chase on drums. They played covers of songs by the Rolling Stones ("Dandelion"), Moby Grape ("Hey Grandma"), and Willie Dixon ("Spoonful"), {{as well as some}} original compositions. Terence Boylan, another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the beatnik life while attending college: [...] "They never came out of their room, they stayed up all night. They looked like ghosts— black turtlenecks and skin so white that it looked like yogurt. Absolutely no activity, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes and dope." [...] Fagen himself would later remember it as [...] "probably the only time in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> actually had friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] I answered, {{taking the}} sabre in my hands, {{and making a}} sign to the princess to fear nothing, as it was <b>my</b> own <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was about to sacrifice, and not hers. But the look of {{gratitude}} she gave me shook my courage, and I flung the sabre to the earth.|$|R

2500|$|... 1 Jan. 1779 – This morning {{very early}} about 1. o'clock a most dreadful Storm of Wind with Hail & Snow {{happened}} {{here and the}} Wind did not quite abait till the Evening. – A little before 2. o'clock I got up, my bedstead rocking under me, and never in <b>my</b> <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know of, did I remember the Wind so high or of so long continuance – I expected every Moment that some Part or other of my House must have been blown down, but blessed be God the whole stood, only a few Tiles displaced... My Chancel received great Damage as did my Barn— the Leads from my Chancel were almost all blown up with some Parts of the Roof – the North West Window blown in & smashed all to pieces.|$|E
2500|$|Game later {{revealed}} Dr. Dre and Pharrell Williams {{would be}} {{serving as the}} executive producer on the album. However, later Game stated he was now [...] "unclear" [...] if Dr. Dre would be producing on the album at all. In January 2010, Game revealed to Billboard; DJ Khalil has contributed the production on the album. He revealed to Rap-Up; an American R singer Chris Brown and Dr. Dre would be featured on the album. R singer Akon also was confirmed to be featured on a track titled [...] "Would I Be Wrong?" [...] along with production from Polow da Don. Game later confirmed a collaboration with pop singer Justin Timberlake saying that [...] "I never thought in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would ever work with Justin, and then for it to turn out and be as catastrophic as it was amazing." [...] He also confirmed that he enlisted upcoming female rapper Nicki Minaj for a feature. Game recorded a song with both rappers Jim Jones and Jadakiss titled [...] "Gangs in New York" [...] which highlighted production from new and upcoming record producer Scoop DeVille.|$|E
2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, yes, yes, yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
