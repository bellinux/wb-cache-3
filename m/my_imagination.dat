Considine highlighted [...] "I could tie up the bed sheets and slide down the house / Be gone before the morning comes" [...] as lyrics exemplificative of Ellis-Bextor's [...] "artistic freedom" [...] in Wanderlust. Reviewing the song for Loud and Quiet, Stuart Stubbs wrote that it [...] "sees our protagonist pull herself out of squalor and onto a road of self discovery."

500|$|At {{the age of}} 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the Steinach {{operation}} {{which was}} performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For {{the last five years}} of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: [...] "I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon <b>my</b> <b>imagination.</b> If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935.|$|E

[...] Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to {{introduce}} her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalled: [...] "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style.

I loved using <b>my</b> <b>imagination.</b> I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

She also thought more critically about Sévérine's relationship with Silva, saying: [...] "I just built everything with <b>my</b> <b>imagination,</b> and that is very exciting, too, because there's room for accidents on set." [...] GMA Network's Mikhail Lecaros wrote that Marlohe approached the character with a [...] "bemused cynicism". Daniel Craig praised Marlohe's approach to the character, saying she [...] "brought a huge amount of depth to what is essentially a very small part" [...] and [...] "gave her an awful lot of history in the way she played it". He added that he felt her preparation made the scenes easier to act, and would make the interactions between Bond and Sévérine more appealing to the audience. While discussing her working relationship with Craig, Marlohe described him as [...] "funny, very humble...".|$|E

I had just watched the first episode of Thunderbirds. I felt as though the whole landscape of what passes for <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> had been changed... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday night was a renewal of the miracle."

500|$|Lawrence Morton, in a {{study of}} the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's {{collection}} Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is [...] "Yarila" [...] which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: [...] "The likeness is too close to be coincidental". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music {{rather than the other way}} round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One day , when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision... I saw in <b>my</b> <b>imagination</b> a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".|$|E

[...] During the bridge, they performed a fragment of Motown group The Temptations' 1971 hit [...] "Just <b>My</b> <b>Imagination</b> (Running Away with Me)". In his review of the concert in New York City, The New York Timess Jon Pareles felt that during the performance the music was reminiscent of [...] "Motown, girl groups and James Brown." [...] After the song was finished, an interlude, featuring a pierrot and several dancers dressed in black outfits and holding umbrellas began. Set to an instrumental version of the song, the interlude featured a choreography partially inspired in the classic Gene Kelly musical Singin' in the Rain.
