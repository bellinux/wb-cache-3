40|$|Industry {{demands on}} cheap, full scale tactile sensors, capable to be {{embedded}} into material or structure being monitored. Previous research reported polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon black composite (PNCBC) as a promising {{material for this}} use. PNCBC is made when certain concentration of high-structure nano-size extra conductive carbon, close {{to that of a}} percolation threshold, is well dispersed into a rubber matrix before vulcanizing. In such case reversible tenso-resistance effect as well as piezo-resistance effect with up to 4 orders of magnitude is observed. During previous research, it was concluded that technological parameters like <b>mold</b> <b>pressure,</b> vulcanizing time and filler distribution have a critical effect on final properties of PNCBC. In this work we have ascertained, how the <b>mold</b> <b>pressure</b> during vulcanizing have an effect on electric properties of PNCBC. Extra conductive carbon black was mixed into polyisoprene matrix by means of cold rolls for 20 minutes at room temperature. Afterwards the raw material was vulcanized using different <b>mold</b> <b>pressures.</b> Specific electric resistance and piezo-resistance effect were determined depending on filler concentration and <b>mold</b> <b>pressure.</b> By evaluating results, conclusions were made, that not always the best conductivity and piezo-resistance effect of PNCBC are gained using typical <b>mold</b> <b>pressures,</b> used in classic rubber industry.

Semi-analytical, numerically inexpensive models of the processes and structure enable a thorough investigation of the couplings between process and structure by comparing four design for-mulations: in decoupled problems, either the process or the structure is optimized; then, the process is optimized with targetted low or high structural performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: X-truss/foam {{sandwich}} structure with prominent compression and shear strength has broad application prospects as primary structure in aircraft, truck, and other fields. But unsuitable <b>molding</b> <b>pressure</b> usually causes quality defects such as poor skincore adhesion or broken Z-pins, which seriously decreases the structure’s mechanical property and induces too much thickness error. In {{order to obtain}} a suitable <b>molding</b> <b>pressure,</b> the hot pressing process was analyzed. It {{was found that the}} suitable <b>molding</b> <b>pressure</b> is mainly determined by the property of the foam core, the resisting force of Z-pin inserting into the face sheets, as well as Z-pin inserting angle and density. In the calculated suitable <b>molding</b> <b>pressure,</b> X-truss/ foam {{sandwich structure}}s were successfully fabricated using carbon fiber Z-pins and face sheets together with polymethacrylimide foam core.

It was considered that the resin impregnation saturated at that points. As for the MB method, molding time necessary for resin impregnation saturation was longer than for the other molding methods. This is considered to be because the aspect ratio of the MBY is smaller than the carbon fiber yarn for the plain woven fabric used for the other method because braided resin yarns constrained the carbon fiber yarn at the center before weaving. The smaller aspect ratio resulted in the longer resin impregnation distance.|$|E
