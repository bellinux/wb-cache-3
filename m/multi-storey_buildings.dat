5|$|The 1974 Nav Nirman agitation– {{a protest}} against a 20% hike in the hostel food fees at the L.D. College of Engineering in Ahmedabad– snowballed into a {{movement}} to remove Chimanbhai Patel, then chief minister of Gujarat. In the 1980s, a reservation policy {{was introduced in the}} country, which led to anti-reservation protests in 1981 and 1985. The protests witnessed violent clashes between people belonging to various castes. The city suffered some {{of the impact of the}} 2001 Gujarat earthquake; up to 50 <b>multi-storey</b> <b>buildings</b> collapsed, killing 752 people and causing much damage. The following year, a three-day period of violence between Hindus and Muslims in the western Indian state of Gujarat, known as the 2002 Gujarat riots, spread to Ahmedabad; refugee camps were set up around the city.|$|E

This {{resulted in}} risk managers subsequently demanding a [...] "clear desk" [...] policy {{at the end of each}} working day to improve information security. The attack also prompted British and American financial companies to prepare disaster recovery plans in case of future attacks.|$|E

40|$|Shear wall {{systems are}} one of the most {{commonly}} used lateral load resisting systems in high-rise buildings. Shear walls have very high in plane stiffness and strength, which can be used to simultaneously resist large horizontal loads and support gravity loads, making them quite advantageous in many structural engineering applications. There are lots of literatures available to design and analyze the shear wall. However, the decision about the location of shear wall in <b>multi-storey</b> <b>building</b> is not much discussed in any literatures. In this paper, therefore, main focus is to determine the solution for shear wall location in <b>multi-storey</b> <b>building.</b> A RCC building of six storey placed in HYDERABAD subjected to earthquake loading in zone-II is considered.
