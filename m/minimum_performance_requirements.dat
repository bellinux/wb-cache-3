50|$|When {{measurements}} {{started to}} be used in reviews of consumer equipment in the late 1960s it became apparent that they did not always correlate with what was heard. In particular, the introduction of Dolby B noise-reduction on cassette recorders was found to make them sound a full 10dB less noisy, yet they did not measure 10dB better. Various new methods were then devised, including one which used a harsher weighting filter and a quasi-peak rectifier, defined as part of the German DIN45 500 ‘Hi Fi’ standard.

40|$|Despite initial enthusiasm towards {{electronic}} {{noses and}} their possible application in different fields, {{and quite a}} lot of promising results, several criticalities emerge from most published research studies, and, as a matter of fact, the diffusion of electronic noses in real-life applications is still very limited. In general, a first step towards large-scale-diffusion of an analysis method, is standardization. The aim of this paper is describing the experimental procedure adopted in order to evaluate electronic nose performances, with the final purpose of establishing <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirements,</b> which {{is considered to be a}} first crucial step towards standardization of the specific case of electronic nose application for environmental odor monitoring at receptors. Based on the experimental results of the performance testing of a commercialized electronic nose type with respect to three criteria (i. e., response invariability to variable atmospheric conditions, instrumental detection limit, and odor classification accuracy), it was possible to hypothesize a logic that could be adopted for the definition of <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirements,</b> according to the idea that these are technologically achievable...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{range of}} first {{detection}} {{of an approaching}} target {{is among the most}} important parameters defining sensors and defensive surveillance systems. A demonstration of capability therefore typically includes a demonstration of a sensor’s detection range, to show that the range of first detection occurs at notably greater range than competing systems, or to show that it exceeds <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> Such demonstrations are often carried out for the commercial sonars designed for underwater surveillance in port protection. Like any measurement, the observation of detection range is subject to unpredictable random variability, and this variability is important whenever practical conclusions are to be drawn from observed detection ranges, such as comparing the performance of one sonar against another or against <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> The variability also has implications for operations because the response measures taken by security forces against underwater intruders must be robust against the degree of variability that can be expected in their detection range. Here we report a sequence of detection ranges observed for repeated diver approaches for a commercially available sonar under realistic conditions during military experimentation for port protection. A probabilistic model is fit to the observations to explain much of their variance, and to extend the implications of such variance to performance evaluations and waterside security operations more generally...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} several distributed real-time applications. The applications are real-time {{in that they}} require per-connection end-to-end performance bounds. These bounds, in terms of throughput, delay, and delay-jitter, are provided by the network via two mechanisms: admission control to limit access to the network and priority scheduling to enforce the guarantees. Within this frame-work, we perform a deterministic analysis on the applications and investigate, via the admission control criteria, the resulting utilization of the network. A deterministic analysis must analyze the worst-case properties of the sources {{in order to provide}} absolute bounds on throughput and delay. Three distributed real-time applications are analyzed in this paper: a video conferencing tool, a tool for combustion modeling using distributed computing, and an MPEG video archival system.

40|$|Starting {{with the}} {{end-user}} requirements, {{it is argued}} that the most appropriate performance metric with which to evaluate video-based tracking methods, in the public transport domain, is to measure the information gained through their use. This is equivalent to the reduction in uncertainty about a passenger’s whereabouts, after tracking and appearance-based measurements have been taken into account. In this paper, we present a framework for the performance evaluation of such a system. Error propagation analysis is performed to investigate the impact of each system component on the final uncertainty, and allows an end-user requirement to be propagated through the system to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirement</b> for each component. This proposed analysis framework is demonstrated on a simulated system. ...|$|R

40|$|Air {{transportation}} {{has been}} suering for decades from delays caused by air trac congestion. This paper presents the eect of aircraft performance dierences on air trac delays. Rate of climb and cruising speeds of 70 dierent aircraft types are compared to demonstrate performance dierences {{in the current}} transport aircraft fleet. The eect of these performance dierences on air trac delays is proved by a deterministic calculation of delays for a departure queue consisting of 3 dierent types of aircraft. In addition, it is shown how a slower cruising speed can cause excessive fuel consumption in an aircraft that is obliged to follow a slower aircraft in an enroute queue. It is concluded that air trac flow management units should take into account aircraft performance dierences for sequencing, and that aviation authorities should consider establishing <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> for each altitude for each aircraft category...|$|E

40|$|A {{combination}} of four qualitative SYBR®Green qPCR screening assays targeting {{two levels of}} discrimination: Listeria genus (except Listeria grayi) and Listeria monocytogenes, is presented.

The paper also proposes a new validation procedure to specifically validate qPCR assays applied to food microbiology according to two guidelines: the ISO 22118 norm and the "Definition of <b>minimum</b> <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> for analytical methods of GMO testing". The developed assays target the iap, prs and hlyA genes that belong to or neighbour the virulence cluster of Listeria spp. The selected primers were designed to amplify short fragments (60 to 103 bp) in order to obtain optimal PCR efficiency (between 97 and 107 % efficiency). The limit of detection of the SYBR®Green qPCR assays is two to five copies of target genes per qPCR reaction. These assays are highly accurate (98. 08 and 100 % accuracy for the Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes assays, respectively) ...|$|E
