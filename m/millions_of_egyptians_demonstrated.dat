5000|$|After the {{revolution}} against Mubarak and {{a period of}} rule by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the Muslim Brotherhood took power in Egypt {{through a series of}} popular elections, with Egyptians electing Islamist Mohamed Morsi to the presidency in June 2012. However, Morsi's government encountered fierce opposition after his attempt to pass an Islamist constitution that followed extreme Islamist views, Morsi's attempted also to change laws granting himself unparalleled powers like no other president in Egyptian history. It sparked general outrage from secularists and members of the military, and mass protests broke out against his rule on 28 June, 2013. On 3 July, 2013, Morsi was deposed by a coup d'état led by the minister of defense, General Abdel Fattah El-Sisi as <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egyptians</b> took to the streets in support of early elections.

Unlike the imposition of martial law which followed the 2011 resignation of Hosni Mubarak, on 4 July 2013, a civilian senior jurist Adly Mansour was appointed interim president and was sworn in over the new government following Morsi's removal. Mansour {{had the right to}} issue constitutional declarations and vested executive power in the Supreme Constitutional Court, giving him executive, judicial and constitutional power. Morsi refused to accept his removal from office, and many supporters vowed to reinstate him. They originally intended their sit-ins to celebrate Morsi's one-year anniversary, but they quickly became opposed to the new authorities.

40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the challenges {{to the emergence of}} democratic governance in the aftermath of Egypt’s 25 January Revolution. Much political science scholarship as well as many Western politicians conceptualized the 25 January Revolution as the beginning of a transition from authoritarian rule to democracy. Yet, what emerged in the period until 30 June 2013 is a ‘grey zone’ (Carothers 2002) between democracy and authoritarianism, where the institutions of democracy existed in name (elections, constitutions, parliaments) but in reality functioned as vehicles for securing obedience to the ruling regimes of SCAF, followed by that of former President Mohammed Morsi. During this period, human rights abuses continued, security forces acted with impunity, civilians were tried before military courts and the constitution of December 2012 undermined rather than extended many rights (Human Rights Watch 2012). <b>Millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egyptians</b> participated in the June 30 uprising with the hope of resurrecting the original aims of the 25 January Revolution, for freedom, social justice and dignity (Ezzat 2013) ...|$|R

50|$|On January 25 of 2011, mass protests {{began in}} Cairo, Egypt, protesting the long reign <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> President Hosni Mubarak, the high {{unemployment}} rate, government corruption, poverty, and oppression within society. This 18-day revolution {{did not begin}} with guns, violence, or protests, but rather {{with the creation of}} a single Facebook page which quickly gained the attention of thousands, and soon <b>millions,</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egyptians,</b> spreading into a global phenomenon. The internet empowered protesters and allowed for anyone with access to the internet be involved in the democratization process of their government. In order to have a democratic, free nation, all information that can be shared, should be shared. Protestors communicated, organized, and collaborated through the use of this technology with real time, real impacts. Technologies played an enormous role on the world stage during this time. Even when the regime eliminated all access to the Internet in a failed attempt to halt further political online forums, Google and Twitter teamed up, making a system that would get information out to the public without having access to the internet. The interactivity of media during this revolution boosted civic participation and played a monumental role in the political outcome of the revolution and the democratization of an entire nation.|$|R

5000|$|European {{exploration}} and travel writings of ancient Egypt commenced from the 13th century onward, with only occasional detours {{into a more}} scientific approach, notably by Claude Sicard, Benoît de Maillet, Frederic Louis Norden and Richard Pococke. In the early 17th century, John Greaves measured the pyramids, having inspected the broken Obelisk of Domitian in Rome, then destined for the Earl of Arundel's collection in London. He went on to publish the illustrated Pyramidographia in 1646, while the Jesuit scientist-priest Athanasius Kircher was perhaps the first to hint at the phonetic importance <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> hieroglyphs, <b>demonstrating</b> Coptic as a vestige <b>of</b> early <b>Egyptian,</b> {{for which he is}} considered a [...] "founder" [...] of Egyptology. In the late 18th century, with Napoleon's scholars' recording <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> flora, fauna and history (published as Description de l'Egypte), the study of many aspects of ancient Egypt became more scientifically oriented. The British captured Egypt from the French and gained the Rosetta Stone. Modern Egyptology is generally perceived as beginning about 1822.|$|R
2500|$|Former Ambassador to Egypt [...] Frank Wisner said:"It wasn’t the {{military}} that plotted the seizure {{of the government and}} grabbed it. It was a massive public uprising that, left unchecked, would have produced great violence. It would have left {{the military}} in the miserable position of having to control those demonstrations by force. The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have to ask ourselves, then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we want to be very, very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egyptians.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ovarian {{inactivity}} is {{the major}} constraint for proper productivity in buffaloes in Egypt and most of developing countries having buffaloes. This disorder causes great economic losses due to decreased calf crop and milk yield. The current study was carried out to monitor {{the current status of}} ovarian inactivity in Egyptian buffaloes during the last decade. Special emphases were given to some economic aspects and the evaluation of a novel mixture of phosphorus, traces, vitamins and Lasalocide, which could be used as feed additives and we refereed to it as Ovitone. Field investigations were carried out from 2004 to 2011 on 2723 female buffaloes raised at Lower Egypt. Ovitone was tried for treatment of ovarian inactivity in comparison to the current commercially used hormonal preparations. Results indicated that ovarian inactivity averaged 41. 53 % among the studied animals, fluctuated during different years of that period, showing higher prevalence in heifers and primiparous cows. The syndrome was highly correlated with mange and coccidiosis. Ovarian inactivity predispose to national economic losses estimated as 3. 296 and 3. 938 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egyptian</b> pounds during 2009 and 2010. It was recommended to pay more attention for this syndrome to minimize the money spent on meat and milk importation.

5000|$|Couch Party (Arabic: حزب الكنبة, ALA-LC: Ḥizb al-Kanabah) is a {{political}} term widely used in Egyptian politics referring to the <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egyptians</b> who avoid participating in protests and have no political affiliation. It started to appear {{during and after the}} 2011 revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. People who self-describe or are described by others as belonging to this imaginary [...] "party" [...] have been the target of many political forces in the country due to their number that could easily influence electoral process by changing the balance in favor of a particular vote. Many have accused them of being supportive of Mubarak's regime and were displeased with the demonstrations against him, while others said they supported anti-regime protests but chose to watch the events on television instead of participating. The general description however, is that they are the silent majority that either opposes all political entities or prefers to follow events while isolating itself without taking part in any political process the country goes through. Despite this, some of those described as being part of the Couch Party made their first move during the June 2013 Egyptian protests with masses rarely taking to the streets against newly elected President Mohamed Morsi and called for his resignation following his temporary constitutional declaration of 22 November 2012 which sparked months of protests. Many of them simply say they want stability in their country and call {{for an end to the}} economic downfall and the rise of criminal activity which became rampant following Mubarak's resignation.|$|R
