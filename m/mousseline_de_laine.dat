6000|$|This {{not being}} exactly the reply that Miss <b>de</b> <b>Laine</b> expected, she {{momentarily}} hesitated: but the duchess profited by it {{to walk over}} to the piano and introduce herself.

50|$|Although Brown {{resulted}} in a legal victory for the NAACP, it was a hollow victory for those associated with Briggs. Reverend Joseph <b>De</b> <b>Laine,</b> the generally acknowledged leader of Summerton's African-Americans at the time, was fired from his post at a local school in Silver. His wife Mattie was also fired from her position at Scott's Branch, as were all the other signers. <b>De</b> <b>Laine's</b> church was also burned and he moved to New York City in 1955 after surviving an attempted drive-by shooting. Harry and Eliza Briggs, on behalf of whose children the suit was filed, both lost their jobs. Harry {{spent more than a}} decade working in Florida to support the family.

A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and {{springing}} down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light <b>mousseline</b> <b>de</b> soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing question.|$|R

Old Hasluck himself had to be fetched every time he was wanted. At the conclusion of the ceremony, seeking him, I found him sitting on the stairs leading to the crypt.|$|R
