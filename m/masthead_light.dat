60|$|Presently, {{perhaps because}} there was nobody to watch them, or they had been regaled too freely with factory gin, the Krooboys left to tend the fire curled {{themselves}} up beside it, and when an hour had passed, only a thin column of vapor rose up from the bluff. The stokers slumbered peacefully, as did the comrades they should have awakened, when the twinkle of a <b>masthead</b> <b>light</b> crept nearer from out at sea. It rose until the black patch beneath it lengthened into a line of wallowing hull; but the fresh land breeze and the clamor of the surf between them rendered the hoot of the steamer's whistle but faintly audible at the factory.

This drew out and lengthened as she came abreast of them, but now {{he could see the}} tiers of passenger decks, one above the other, there was something mysterious in the gloom that reigned on board. No ring of light pierced her long dark side and the gangways behind the rails and rows of stanchions looked like shadowy caves. In the open spaces, forward and aft, however, bodies of men were gathered, their clothes showing faintly white, but they stood still in a compact mass until a whistle blew and the indistinct figures scattered across the deck.|$|E

50|$|The ship reached Pointe-au-Père, Quebec (or Father Point) {{near the}} town of Rimouski {{in the early hours of}} 29 May 1914, where the pilot disembarked. Empress of Ireland resumed a normal outward bound course of about N76E, and soon sighted the <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> of , a Norwegian collier, on her {{starboard}} bow at a distance of several miles. Likewise, Storstad, which was abreast of Métis Point and on a course W. by S., sighted Empress of Irelands <b>masthead</b> <b>lights.</b> The first sightings were made in clear weather conditions, but fog soon enveloped the ships. The ships resorted to repeated use of their fog whistles. At about 02:00 local time Storstad crashed into Empress of Irelands starboard side at around midships. Storstad remained afloat, but Empress of Ireland was severely damaged. A gaping hole in her side caused the lower decks to flood at an alarming rate to the crew.|$|R
50|$|To avoid collisions, vessels mount {{navigation}} lights that permit other vessels {{to determine the}} type and relative angle of a vessel, and thus decide {{if there is a}} danger of collision. In general sailing vessels are required to carry a green light that shines from dead ahead to 2 points (°) abaft the beam on the starboard side (the right side from the perspective of someone on board facing forward), a red light from dead ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side (left side) and a white light that shines from astern to two points abaft the beam on both sides. Power driven vessels, in addition to these lights, must carry either one or two (depending on length) white <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> that shine from ahead to two points abaft the beam on both sides. If two <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> are carried then the aft one must be higher than the forward one. Hovercraft at all times and some boats operating in crowded areas may also carry a yellow flashing beacon for added visibility during day or night.|$|R

50|$|In 1838 the United States {{passed an}} act {{requiring}} steamboats running between sunset and sunrise to carry {{one or more}} signal lights; color, visibility and location were not specified.In 1848 the United Kingdom passed regulations that required steam vessels to display red and green sidelights {{as well as a}} white <b>masthead</b> <b>light.</b> In 1849 the U.S. Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels.In 1889 the United States convened the first International Maritime Conference to consider regulations for preventing collisions. The resulting Washington Conference Rules were adopted by the U.S in 1890 and became effective internationally in 1897. Within these rules was the requirement for steamships to carry a second mast head light.The international 1948 Safety of Life at Sea Conference recommended a mandatory second <b>masthead</b> <b>light</b> solely for power driven vessels over 150 feet in length and a fixed sternlight for almost all vessels. The regulations have changed little since then.|$|E
5000|$|Two very {{different}} {{accounts of the}} collision were given at the Inquiry. The story of Empress of Ireland was that after the pilot had been dropped at Father Point, the ship proceeded to sea at full speed {{in order to obtain}} an offing from the shore. After a short time the <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> of a steamer, which subsequently proved to be Storstad, were sighted on the starboard bow, approximately 6 miles away, the weather at that time being fine and clear. After continuing for some time, Empress of Ireland altered her course with the object of proceeding down the river. When making this change, the <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> of Storstad were still visible, about [...] miles away, and according to Captain Kendall it was intended to pass Storstad starboard to starboard and there was no risk of collision. The green light of Storstad was then sighted, but a little later a fog bank was seen coming off the land that dimmed Storstads lights. The engines of Empress of Ireland were then stopped (and put full speed astern) and her whistle blown three short blasts signifying that this had been done. About a minute later the fog shut out the lights of Storstad completely. After exchanging further whistle blasts with Storstad, her <b>masthead</b> and side <b>lights</b> were seen by Captain Kendall about 100 feet away almost at right angles to Empress of Ireland and approaching at high speed. In the hope of possibly avoiding or minimizing the effect of a collision the engines of Empress of Ireland were ordered full speed ahead, {{but it was too late}} and Storstad struck Empress of Ireland amidships. Captain Kendall placed the blame firmly on Storstad for the collision. Famously, the first words he said to Storstads captain after the sinking were, [...] "You have sunk my ship!". He maintained for the rest of his life that it was not his fault the collision occurred.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} this station is {{somewhat}} confusing, {{but it appears that}} a light station was first established on Jordan Point in 1855. This consisted of a keeper's house with a <b>masthead</b> <b>light</b> on the roof.

He found no damage, but was later intercepted by the ship's carpenter, who informed him that the ship was taking water. A mail clerk confirmed this to Boxhall and Captain Smith. Later, it was Boxhall who calculated the Titanics position so that a distress signal could be sent out. It was also Boxhall who sighted the <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> of a nearby vessel (possibly the [...] ) and attempted in vain to signal by Morse lamp and distress flares.|$|R
60|$|Dick nodded {{agreement}} and signed the fireman {{to turn on}} more steam as he followed the tug outshore. The swell got steadily higher and broke in angry surges. The launch plunged, and rattled as she swung her screw out of the sea, but Dick kept his course abreast of the tug, which he could only distinguish at intervals between the clouds of spray. Her <b>masthead</b> <b>lights</b> reeled wildly to and fro, but the low red gleam from the barges was hidden {{and he began to}} wonder why her captain was steering out so far. It was prudent not to skirt the reef, but the fellow seemed to be giving it unnecessary room. The lighters would tow badly through the white, curling sea, and there was a risk of the hawsers breaking. Besides, the engineer had complained that his machinery was not running well.|$|R
50|$|The log of the Bywell Castle {{described}} the incident:The master and pilot {{were on the}} upper bridge, and the lookout on the top-gallant forecastle; light airs prevailed; the weather was a little hazy; at 7:45 oclock P. M. proceeded at half speed down Gallions Reach; when about at {{the centre of the}} reach observed an excursion steamer coming up Barking Reach, showing her red and <b>masthead</b> <b>lights,</b> when we ported our helm to keep out toward Tripcock Point; as the vessels neared, observed that the other steamer had ported her helm. Immediately afterward saw that she had starboarded her helm and was trying to cross our bows, showing her green light close under our port bow. Seeing that a collision was inevitable, we stopped our engines and reversed them at full speed. The two vessels came in collision, the bow of the Bywell Castle cutting into the other steamer with a dreadful crash. We took immediate measures for saving life by hauling up over our bows several passengers, throwing overboard ropes ends, life-buoys, a hold-ladder, and several planks, and getting out three boats, at the same time keeping the whistle blowing loudly for assistance, which was rendered by several boats from shore, and a boat from another steamer. The excursion steamer, {{which turned out to be}} the Princess Alice, turned over and sank under our bows. We succeeded in rescuing a great many passengers, and anchored for the night.|$|R

50|$|This {{light was}} erected in 1855 {{to mark the}} western edge of the channel. Ice damaged the light in the {{following}} year, and again in 1867; in the latter case the light had to be rebuilt completely, at which time the light was upgraded to a sixth-order Fresnel from the previous <b>masthead</b> <b>light.</b> During the Civil War the light was extinguished by confederate forces; relit in 1862, the Lighthouse Board reconsidered and removed the lighting apparatus to Fort Monroe for safekeeping.|$|E
5000|$|During Edinburgh's {{time with}} the Mediterranean Fleet, Scott noted the {{difficulties}} experienced by the flagship in making signals to the fleet (rather than to individual ships). He developed an arrangement with a <b>masthead</b> <b>light</b> which {{could be seen in}} all directions and which because of its height was not lost in the confusion of the other lights within the flagship's superstructure. The flagship adopted the design but the Admiralty then introduced a changed design for general issue which failed to work. Only after several years of [...] "trial and waste of money" [...] was Scott's original design adopted.|$|E
50|$|For VHF and UHF operation, {{one option}} is to mount a small yagi antenna to a pole 1-2 m (3-6 ft) long and haul this to the {{masthead}} using a flag halyard. If the halyard is correctly knotted to the middle {{and bottom of the}} pole, it is easy enough to make the antenna project above the clutter at the masthead into clear air. The problem is in rotating it - it usually needs to be lowered and re-raised to alter the direction of its beam. For the safety of <b>masthead</b> fittings and <b>lights</b> it is better if these yagis are light in weight and made largely of, for example, plastic tubes supporting internal wire conductors. Operating in this way is best reserved for when in harbour or at anchor, to avoid interfering with the operation of the boat. Repeated loss of signal due to rolling and pitching would make it impractical for useful communication at sea anyway.|$|R

He got clear and saw three indistinct figures standing along in the fainter darkness under the arched foot of the mainsail, that rose above their heads like a convex wall of a high edifice. Donkin hissed:--"Go for them... it's dark!" [...] The crowd took a short run aft in a body--then there was a check. Donkin, agile and thin, flitted past with his right arm going like a windmill--and then stood still suddenly with his arm pointing rigidly above his head. The hurtling flight of some heavy object was heard; it passed between the heads of the two mates, bounded heavily along the deck, struck the after hatch with a ponderous and deadened blow. The bulky shape of Mr. Baker grew distinct. [...] "Come to your senses, men!" [...] he cried, advancing at the arrested crowd. [...] "Come back, Mr. Baker!" [...] called the master's quiet voice. He obeyed unwillingly. There was a minute of silence, then a deafening hubbub arose. Above it Archie was heard energetically:--"If ye do oot ageen I wull tell!" [...] There were shouts. [...] "Don't!" [...] "Drop it!"--"We ain't that kind!" [...] The black cluster of human forms reeled against the bulwark, back again towards the house. Ringbolts rang under stumbling feet.--"Drop it!" [...] "Let me!"--"No!"--"Curse you... hah!" [...] Then sounds as of some one's face being slapped; a piece of iron fell on the deck; a short scuffle, and some one's shadowy body scuttled rapidly across the main hatch before the shadow of a kick. A raging voice sobbed out a torrent of filthy language...--"Throwing things--good God!" [...] grunted Mr. Baker in dismay.--"That was meant for me," [...] said the master, quietly; [...] "I felt the wind of that thing; what was it--an iron belaying-pin?"--"By Jove!" [...] muttered Mr. Creighton. The confused voices of men talking amidships mingled with the wash of the sea, ascended between the silent and distended sails-seemed to flow away into the night, further than the horizon, higher than the sky. The stars burned steadily over the inclined <b>mastheads.</b> Trails of <b>light</b> lay on the water, broke before the advancing hull, and, after she had passed, trembled for a long time as if in awe of the murmuring sea.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} Storstad {{was that the}} {{masthead}} lights of Empress of Ireland were first seen on the port bow about 6 or 7 nm away; the lights were at that time open to starboard. A few minutes later, the green side light of Empress of Ireland was seen apparently from 3 to 5 miles away. The green light remained for an interval, and then Empress of Ireland was seen {{to make a change}} in her course. Her masthead lights came into a (vertical) line, and she showed both the green and the red side lights. She then continued to swing to starboard, shutting out the green and showing only the red light. This light was observed for a few minutes before being obscured by the fog. At this moment, Empress of Ireland was about two miles away and Storstads Chief Officer (Mr. Toftenes) assumed that it was Empress of Irelands intention to pass him port to port (red to red), which the vessels would do with ample room if their relative positions were maintained. After an exchange of whistle blasts with Empress of Ireland, Storstad was slowed and Captain Andersen (who was asleep in his cabin at the time) was called to the bridge. When he arrived Captain Andersen saw a <b>masthead</b> <b>light</b> moving quickly across Storstads course from port to starboard whereupon he ordered the engines full speed astern. Immediately after Andersen saw the <b>masthead</b> <b>light,</b> he saw the green light, and a few moments later saw Empress of Ireland and the vessels then collided.|$|E
