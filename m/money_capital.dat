25|$|Economics is {{a social}} science which studies the production, distribution, trade, and {{consumption}} of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers {{the economy as a}} whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for <b>money,</b> <b>capital</b> and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to France, the British {{government}} relied more {{on short-term}} financing {{in the form}} of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I. Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%. Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: [...] "LEND YOUR MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk. If you invest in Exchequer Bonds your <b>money,</b> <b>capital</b> and interest alike, is secured on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, the premier security of the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{advanced}} capitalist societies {{such as the}} United States, {{the stock}} of constant capital applied in private sector productive activities represents only about 20–30% {{of the value of}} the total physical capital stock, and perhaps 10–12% of total capital assets owned, and therefore it is unlikely that a fall in the industrial rate of profit could by itself explain economic crises. Marxists ignored this reality, because they tacitly assumed in their economic model that the economy consists just of factories, and that Marx's analysis of the capitalist mode of production was a complete analysis of the whole economy, which is not true. For example, the famous Marxist scholar David Harvey claims that [...] "Money, land, real estate and plant and equipment that are not being used productively are not capital". In his original 2001 Phd thesis in economics, the leading Dutch Marxist Robert Went borrows an idea from Christian Palloix, and transplants the categories of Capital, Volume II summarily to the whole world economy. Went claims that there exist only three circuits of capital (commodity capital, <b>money</b> <b>capital</b> and production capital), even although, according to Marx himself, these circuits refer only to the capitalist mode of production. In Japan, Kozo Uno equated Marx's theory of the capitalist mode of production with the theory of capitalist society.|$|E

6000|$|Care {{should be}} taken to {{distinguish}} between wealth, capital, and [...] <b>money.</b> <b>Capital</b> may be succinctly defined as saved wealth devoted [...] to reproduction, and the relations of the three terms mentioned [...] may be illustrated by the following figure: The area of the [...] circle, A, represents the wealth of a country; the area of the [...] inscribed circle, B, the quantity out of the whole wealth which is [...] saved and devoted to reproduction and called capital. But money is [...] only one part of capital, as shown by the area of circle C. [...] Wherefore, it can be plainly seen that not all capital, B, is [...] money; that not all wealth, A, is capital, although all capital is [...] necessarily wealth as included within it. It is not always [...] understood that money is merely a convenient article by which [...] other forms of wealth are exchanged against each other, and that a [...] man may have capital without ever having any actual money in his [...] possession. In times of commercial depression, that which is [...] capital to-day may not to-morrow satisfy any desires (i.e., not be [...] in demand), and so for the time it may, so to speak, drop entirely [...] out of our circles above. For the moment, not having an exchange [...] value, it can not be wealth, and so can the less be capital.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to shed some light on the legal aspects of <b>money</b> and <b>capital.</b> For many years there has been much {{emphasis}} on the technicalities of the production function, resulting in a neglect of its legalities, while the latter not only precedes the former but also transforms <b>money</b> into actual <b>capital.</b> Conventionally, <b>money</b> and <b>capital</b> markets (both considered to be of a loan character) are distinguished on the basis of the duration of their loan period. Failure to distinguish the legal difference(s) of <b>money</b> and <b>capital</b> has become the source of many essential confusions and misunderstandings. As a result, Islamic banks are rightly alleged of operating on usurious activities. Unlike the way the conventional and Islamic banks operate today, the supply of money and the emerging institution become endogenous to economic structure as a result of the elimination of money markets; hence guaranteed stable Islamic system...|$|R

The autor concludes, that the modern <b>money</b> and <b>capital</b> markets represent one of the instruments of allocation of money resources {{as well as of}} mobilization of savings for economic growth. At present the national credit markets are strongly connected with those abroad thait there is little possibility for a self-governing conjuncture or credit policy. The analysis of modern credit markets enables us to understand the financing mechanism of economic growth processes in the present capitalism.

50|$|In 1845, no {{less than}} three {{memorials}} were circulated requesting {{the establishment of a}} penal colony in Western Australia. Two of them were aborted, but the third resulted in a petition by the York Agricultural Society to the Legislative Council on the subject. The York Agricultural Society, which consisted mostly of pastoralists, argued that the colony's economy was on the brink of collapse due to an extreme shortage of labour. Pamela Statham has examined these claims, and found that the colony was in fact oversupplied with labour at the time, the main obstacles to progress being a shortage of <b>money</b> <b>capital,</b> and the lack of markets for the colony's produce. Only in the pastoral sector was there a severe labour shortage. The York Agricultural Society can therefore be seen as an influential lobby group representing the interests of a small but influential minority.|$|E
50|$|Par. 108. Under {{the concept}} of {{financial}} capital maintenance where capital is {{defined in terms of}} nominal monetary units, profit represents the increase in nominal <b>money</b> <b>capital</b> over the period. Thus, increases in the prices of assets held over the period, conventionally referred to as holding gains, are, conceptually, profits. They may not be recognised as such, however, until the assets are disposed of in an exchange transaction. When {{the concept of}} financial capital maintenance is defined in terms of constant purchasing power units, profit represents the increase in invested purchasing power over the period. Thus, only that part of the increase in the prices of assets that exceeds the increase in the general level of prices is regarded as profit. The rest of the increase is treated as a capital maintenance adjustment and, hence, as part of equity.|$|E
