50|$|Lockett {{was born}} in Stoke-upon-Trent and was {{appointed}} <b>manager-secretary</b> of Stoke in 1884 replacing Walter Cox. He was Stoke manager when professionalism was introduced in August 1885, agreeing to pay his players, half-a-crown (13p) a week. However following a threat of strike action amongst the players when the club wished to introduce different pay levels, it was increased to five shillings (25p).|$|E
5000|$|His {{professional}} manner {{seemed to}} indicate a bright future as manager and in May 1937 he took up the management position at Northampton Town, later being the <b>manager-secretary.</b> Under his stewardship the [...] "Cobblers" [...] finished ninth in the Third Division South in 1937-38 and seventeenth in 1938-39.

5000|$|During the pre-season, <b>manager-secretary</b> Joe Schofield stated that: [...] "the future {{policy of}} Port Vale {{is to go}} ahead". He duly signed {{experienced}} full-back Bob Pursell, brother of Peter, from Liverpool. The capacity of The Old Recreation Ground was increased to 30,000; mainly due to the fund raising activities of the Supporters' Club. Of the 1919-20 squad, only William Aitken was let go, for a fee of £2,500 to Newcastle United. That money helped to pay for £400 Tom Page from St Mirren, and right-half Freddy Price from Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} playing career with Stoke in 1883, having moved from Burslem Port Vale. He {{spent the next}} {{fourteen}} years with Stoke, playing 251 games in all competitions, helping them to the Football Alliance title in 1890-91. In 1897 he signed with Manchester City via Port Vale, before returning to Vale for a three-year spell in 1898, helping them to the Staffordshire Senior Cup on his arrival.

50|$|Easily the club's top scorer was Bobby Blood with 26 goals, 24 {{of which}} were in the league (Second Division). Blood was playing in the Football League {{for the first time}} at the age of 25. Billy Briscoe scored eight goals in seven Central League games, but failed to {{transfer}} this success to the Football League. Peter Pursell played 49 of 51 games, with fellow Scotsman William Aitken also rarely missing game. Tom Lyons and Alfred Bourne missed just four Second Division games between them. Tom Holford was another crucial player, who also acted as manager for much of the season. In March 1920, Joe Schofield was appointed <b>manager-secretary.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, {{he moved}} to Sunderland, when <b>manager-secretary</b> Bob Kyle {{authorised}} a then-world record fee of £5,500. The record was not broken again until Bob Kelly joined him at Sunderland for £6,500 in December 1925. The [...] "Black Cats" [...] finished as First Division runners-up in 1922-23, six points behind champions Liverpool. They came closer to the title in 1923-24 despite finishing third, as they ended up four points behind champions Huddersfield Town. They then dropped to seventh in 1924-25, before another third-place finish in 1925-26; in the latter campaign they were nine points behind first placed Huddersfield Town. His last full campaign at Roker Park, 1926-27, ended up with Sunderland again in third place, seven points behind rivals Newcastle United. He made a total of 190 appearances for the club in league and cup competitions.|$|E
5000|$|He {{moved to}} Everton in 1927 for £7,000, {{at the age}} of 30, where he played {{alongside}} goal machine Dixie Dean. He won the league title in 1927-28, his first season at Goodison Park. They then won the subsequent Charity Shield in 1928, before finishing a disappointing 18th in 1928-29, just three places above the drop. Everton then finished bottom of the division in 1929-30, though were just one point behind third-from-bottom (and therefore not relegated) Sheffield United. The [...] "Toffees" [...] made an immediate return to the top-flight, marching to the Second Division title in 1930-31, seven points ahead of runners-up West Bromwich Albion; they scored 121 goals in their 42 league games. They continued their success into the First Division, winning the title in 1931-32 after finishing two points ahead of Arsenal. Their success continued in the Charity Shield in 1932, as they beat Newcastle United 5-3 at St James' Park. They dropped to eleventh in 1932-33, but lifted the FA Cup in 1933. The final, held in front of 92,950 spectators at Wembley, finished in a 3-0 victory over Manchester City, and the Manchester Guardian described Cresswell as giving [...] "an almost perfect display". The club's final two seasons under <b>manager-secretary</b> Thomas H. McIntosh ended with a whimper however, with a 14th-place finish in 1933-34 and an eighth-place finish in 1934-35. Theo Kelly led Everton to a 16th-place finish in 1935-36, Cresswell's last as a professional footballer. Retiring {{at the age of}} 38 having made 306 appearances for the club, after his death he was inaugurated into the Gwladys Street's Hall of Fame.|$|E
