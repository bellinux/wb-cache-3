25|$|Additive manufacturing, {{starting}} with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will {{do much of}} their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.

Usually, pipe drains or ditches are preferable to wells. However, when the soil consists of a poorly permeable top layer several meters thick, overlying a rapidly permeable and deep subsoil, wells may be a better option, because the drain spacing required for pipes or ditches would be considerably smaller than the spacing for wells.|$|E

25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E

25|$|Gillnetters – On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E
25|$|Entering or {{exiting the}} city meant passing {{under the watchful}} eye of the {{soldiers}} on guard duty. At dusk, the gates would be shut, not to be re-opened until sunrise. Fear of an attack was not the only reason for closing the gates at night. In fact, for extended periods, especially in the late 18th century, there was little likelihood of being attacked. Yet even in times of good relations with the neighbouring French, the doors were shut: above all the military authorities feared their troops deserting. This was a constant plague for the Austrian army, as for all Ancien Régime garrisons. Each year, a tenth of the troops would be lost to desertion, often escaping under the cover of darkness. In 1765, barbed wire was placed on the ramparts, to make night-time escapes more difficult. Paradoxically, the gate closure became <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of keeping the garrison inside than of protecting the city itself. However, those still outside the walls would have to hurry home when they heard the Zapestreech—signalling the imminent gate closure—if they wanted to avoid being locked out for the night. The Luxembourgish legend of Saint Nicholas (see below) refers to this.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{limited by}} shares also acquire finance through ‘equity’ (a synonym for the share capital). Shares differ from debt in that {{shareholders}} rank last in insolvency. The main justification for shareholders’ residual claim is that, unlike many creditors (though not large banks) {{they are capable}} of diversifying their portfolio. Taxation of profits on shares can also be treated differently with a different tax rate (under the Income Tax Act 2007) to capital gains tax on debt (which falls under the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). This makes the distinction between shares and debt important. In principle, all forms of debt and equity arise from contractual arrangements with a company, and the rights which attach are a question of construction. For instance, in Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd the House of Lords held that when the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was passed, preferential shareholders were entitled to no extra, special share of assets upon winding up: construction of the terms of the shares entitled them to extra dividends, but without special words to the contrary, shareholders were presumed equal otherwise. For anyone to become a member of a company under the Companies Act 2006 section 33, the contract for shares must simply manifest the intention to do so. However, beyond this, the dividing line between shares and debt is <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of standard practice than law. It is legally possible to {{become a member of the}} company without being a shareholder, simply by being accepted and registered on the members’ register. It is also possible to be a shareholder without being a member immediately. It is standard practice that shareholders have one vote per share, but occasionally shareholders (particularly those with preferential dividend rights) do not have votes, and debt holders and others may have votes without having shares. It is even possible for creditors to contract to be subordinated behind shareholders in insolvency – it is just unlikely, and strongly discouraged by the regulatory framework. Shares are also presumed to be transferable to other people, although like other rights, the right to trade is subject to the company’s constitution.|$|E

In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in is what you get out,' so, at one level, it's <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bradmans {{lived in}} the same modest, {{suburban}} house in Holden Street, Kensington Park in Adelaide for all but {{the first three years of}} their married life. They experienced personal tragedy in raising their children: their first-born son died as an infant in 1936, their second son, John (born in 1939) contracted polio, and their daughter, Shirley, born in 1941, had cerebral palsy from birth. His family name proved a burden for John Bradman; he legally changed his last name to Bradsen in 1972.

After the cricketer's death, a collection of personal letters written by Bradman to his close friend Rohan Rivett between 1953 and 1977 was released and gave researchers new insights into Bradman's family life, including the strain between father and son.|$|E
500|$|The {{major part}} of Cauer's legacy is his {{contribution}} to the network synthesis of passive networks. [...] Indeed, he is considered {{the founder of the}} field and the publication of his principal work in English was enthusiastically greeted, even though this did not happen until seventeen years later (in 1958). [...] Prior to network synthesis, networks, especially filters, were designed using the image impedance method. [...] The accuracy of predictions of response from such designs depended on accurate impedance matching between sections. [...] This could be achieved with sections entirely internal to the filter but {{it was not possible to}} perfectly match to the end terminations. [...] For this reason image filter designers incorporated end sections in their designs of a different form optimised for an improved match rather than filtering response. [...] The choice of form of such sections was <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of designer experience than design calculation. [...] Network synthesis entirely did away with the need for this. [...] It directly predicted the response of the filter and included the terminations in the synthesis.|$|E

500|$|In the U.S., where Gilbert and Sullivan's {{performance}} copyright {{was never}} in force, Pinafore continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies. The New York Times, in a 1914 review, called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat New York Hippodrome a [...] "royal entertainment" [...] that [...] "comes up smiling". The opera {{had been turned into}} a [...] "mammoth spectacle" [...] at with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour. Buttercup made her entrance to the three-masted Pinafore rowing into sight, and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash. The Times praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs [...] "fairly to be shouted". The production took some liberties, including interpolating music from other Sullivan works. The paper concluded, [...] "the mild satire of Pinafore is entertaining because it is universal". The same paper deemed Winthrop Ames' popular Broadway productions of Pinafore in the 1920s and 1930s [...] "spectacular". Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received. The New York Times review of The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players' 2008 season at New York City Center commented, [...] "Gilbert's themes of class inequality, overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant, however absurdly treated. But the lasting appeal of Pinafore and its ilk is <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan's generous supply of addictive melodies." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}} in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, {{he was named}} ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rebounds per game (rpg). [...] He was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were {{in need of a}} center. [...] However, Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended {{that it was not a}} matter of drafting a center, but <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.

New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a [...] "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating [...] "You simply can't stop watching." [...] The Washington Post Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is much <b>more</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different."
