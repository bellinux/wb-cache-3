Now, it so happened that I, on my arrival in the island, was appointed Korong, and promoted to the post of King of the Rain, having a native woman assigned me as Queen of the Clouds, with whom I might keep company. This woman being, after her kind, enamored of me, and anxious to escape her own fate, to be sleain by my side, did betray to me that secret which they call in their tongue the Great Taboo, and which had been betrayed to herself in turn by a native man, her former lover.

It is not {{within the scope of}} this dissertation to discuss all types of securities, rather attention is merely drawn to the securities that are specified in the Circulars of the Central Bank of Sudan. This dissertation is divided into Fives Chapters: Chapter one is concerned with the Proprietary Securities. This chapter comprises two parts; the first part deals with mortgages over immovable property, and the second, with charges i. e. company charges (fixed and floating). Chapter Two addresses the Possessory Securities and discusses the <b>manners</b> <b>whereby</b> the banks can take constructive possession over the goods rather than taking actual possession i. e. the classic pledge. Chapter Three is about Choses in Action. It deals exclusively with the company stocks, shares and bank balances according to the Circulars of Central Bank of Sudan. It examines the types of shares and their use as security. Chapter Four is about the Sale of Property Mortgaged to Banks Act 1993 and the problems of its application in practice. Chapter Five contains conclusions, some recommendations and suggestions...|$|R
40|$|We {{often think}} of graphs geometrically, i. e. we see {{vertices}} as points {{on a plane}} or in space, with edges as lines connecting them. When speci ed algebraically (e. g. by its adjacency matrix), the geometrical imagery is absent. Can we somehow create it from the algebraic description? The geometric representation might be useful in itself, say {{because we want to}} draw the graph on paper. But once a graph is embedded in space, in a nice <b>manner,</b> say <b>whereby</b> neighbouring vertices are placed close, perhaps problems such as partitioning a graph might be solved by partitioning the associated volume. We can start with any algebraic representation of the graph, but a convenient one is the node-edge incidence matrix B of a graph G with n vertices and m edges. B has n rows and m columns, and bie = 1 if vertex i is an endpoint of edge e, and 0 otherwise. Clearly, every column of B has exactly two 1 s and rest 0 s. Note that 1 BBT = A + D where A is the adjacency matrix, in which aij = 1 if (i; j) is an edge and 0 otherwise, and D a diagonal matrix in which the iith entry equals the degree di of vertex i...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} searching a large set of items, such as emails, for a small subset which are relevant to a given query. This can be implemented in a sequential <b>manner</b> – <b>whereby</b> knowledge from items {{that have already been}} screened is used to assist in the selection of subsequent items to screen. Often the items being searched have an underlying network structure. Using the network structure and a modelling assumption that relevant items and participants are likely to cluster together can greatly increase the rate of screening relevant items. However, inference in this type of model is computationally expensive. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we show that Bayes linear methods provide a natural approach to modelling this data. We develop a new optimisation problem for Bernoulli random variables, called constrained Bayes linear, which has additional constraints incorporated into the Bayes linear optimisation problem. For non-linear relationships between the latent variable and observations, Bayes linear will give a poor approximation. We propose a novel sequential Monte Carlo method for sequential inference on the network, which better copes with non-linear relationships. We give a method for simulating the random variables based upon the Bayes linear methodology. Finally, we look at the effect the ordering of the random variables has on the joint probability distribution of binary random variables, when they are simulated using this proposed Bayes linear method...|$|R
60|$|POWER {{being the}} source from whence all action proceeds, the {{substances}} wherein these powers are, when they *[lost line??] exert this power into act, are called CAUSES, and the substances which thereupon are produced, or the simple ideas which are introduced into any subject by the exerting of that power, are called EFFECTS. The EFFICACY whereby the new substance or idea is produced is called, {{in the subject}} exerting that power, ACTION; but in the subject wherein any simple idea is changed or produced, it is called PASSION: which efficacy, however various, and the effects almost infinite, yet we can, I think, conceive it, in intellectual agents, to be nothing else but modes of thinking and willing; in corporeal agents, nothing else but modifications of motion. I say I think we cannot conceive it to be any other but these two. For whatever sort of action besides these produces any effects, I confess myself to have no notion nor idea of; {{and so it is}} quite remote from my thoughts, apprehensions, and knowledge; and as much in the dark to me as five other senses, or as the ideas of colours to a blind man. And therefore many words which seem to express some action, signify nothing of the action or MODUS OPERANDI at all, but barely the effect, with some circumstances of the subject wrought on, or cause operating: v.g. CREATION, ANNIHILATION, contain in them no idea of the action or <b>manner</b> <b>whereby</b> they are produced, but barely of the cause, and the thing done. And when a countryman says the cold freezes water, though the word freezing seems to import some action, yet truly it signifies nothing but the effect, viz. that water that was before fluid is become hard and consistent, without containing any idea of the action whereby it is done.|$|E

6000|$|During the quarrel over Parnell's grave a {{quotation}} from Goethe {{ran through the}} papers, describing our Irish jealousy: [...] "The Irish seem {{to me like a}} pack of hounds, always dragging down some noble stag." [...] But I do not think we object to distinction for its own sake; if we kill the stag, it is that we may carry off his head and antlers. [...] "The Irish people," [...] O'Leary used to say, [...] "do not know good from bad in any art, but they do not hate the good once it is pointed out to them because it is good." [...] An infallible Church, with its Mass in Latin, and its mediaeval philosophy, and our Protestant social prejudice, have kept our ablest men from levelling passions; but Davidson with a jealousy, which may be Scottish, seeing that Carlyle had it, was quick to discover sour grapes. He saw in delicate, laborious, discriminating taste, an effeminate pedantry, and would, when that mood was on him, delight in all that seemed healthy, popular, and bustling. Once when I had praised Herbert Horne for his knowledge and his taste, he burst out, [...] "If a man must be a connoisseur, let him be a connoisseur in women." [...] He, indeed, was accustomed, in the most characteristic phrase of his type, to describe the Rhymers as lacking in [...] "blood and guts," [...] and very nearly brought us to an end by attempting to supply the deficiency by the addition of four Scotsmen. He brought all four upon the same evening, and one read out a poem upon the Life Boat, evidently intended for a recitation; another described how, when gold-digging in Australia, he had fought and knocked down another miner for doubting the rotundity of the earth; while of the remainder I can remember nothing except that they excelled in argument. He insisted upon their immediate election, and the Rhymers, through that complacency of good <b>manners</b> <b>whereby</b> educated Englishmen so often surprise me, obeyed, though secretly resolved never to meet again; and it cost me seven hours' work to get another meeting, and vote the Scotsmen out. A few days later I chanced upon Davidson at some restaurant; he was full of amiability, and when we parted shook my hand, and proclaimed enthusiastically that I had [...] "blood and guts." [...] I think he might have grown to be a successful man had he been enthusiastic instead about Dowson or Johnson, or Horne or Symons, for they had what I still lacked, conscious deliberate craft, and what I must lack always, scholarship. They had taught me that violent energy, which is like a fire of straw, consumes in a few minutes the nervous vitality, and is useless in the arts. Our fire must burn slowly, and we must constantly turn away to think, constantly analyse what we have done, be content even to have little life outside our work, to show, perhaps, to other men, as little as the watch-mender shows, his magnifying glass caught in his screwed-up eye. Only then do we learn to conserve our vitality, to keep our mind enough under control and to make our technique sufficiently flexible for expression of the emotions of life as they arise. A few months after our meeting in the Museum, Davidson had spent his inspiration. [...] "The fires are out," [...] he said, [...] "and I must hammer the cold iron." [...] When I heard {{a few years ago that}} he had drowned himself, I knew that I had always expected some such end. With enough passion to make a great poet, through meeting no man of culture in early life, he lacked intellectual receptivity, and, anarchic and indefinite, lacked pose and gesture, and now no verse of his clings to my memory.|$|R
40|$|The geotropic {{orientation}} of young rats of a closely inbred line P, separated 6 {{years ago from}} a stock which gave rise also to the closely inbred lines A and B previously studied, has been measured. The curve connecting orientation-angle with inclination of substratum is {{in a general way}} similar to those for A, B, and with them differs markedly from that for race K of totally different ancestry. The variability of the response exhibits similar affinities. Although the orientation-angles are rather close to those obtained with A, the threshold slope for P is that for B; analysis of the curve discloses how this fact is related to the character of the presumptive distributions of thresholds for the respective arrays of tension-receptor units. It is pointed out that these considerations prevent loose comparisons of "geotropic sensitivity" in different lines of rats, but make it plain why comparisons in terms of thresholds for response or of magnitude of response at the same threshold are ineffective. The estimated "number of excitation units," however, is found to correspond to the variability of orientation, and to the <b>manner</b> and extent <b>whereby</b> the dispersions of the measured orientation-angles are governed by the magnitude of the gravitational vector...|$|R

This is so evident, that Barclay himself, that great assertor of the power and sacredness of kings, is forced to confess, That it is lawful for the people, in some cases, to resist their king; and that too in a chapter, wherein he pretends to shew, that the divine law shuts up the people from all <b>manner</b> of rebellion. <b>Whereby</b> it is evident, even by his own doctrine, that, since they may in some cases resist, all {{resisting}} of princes is not rebellion.

50|$|The BamH I enzyme {{is capable}} of making {{a large number of}} {{contacts}} with DNA. Water-mediated hydrogen bonding, as well as both main-chain and side-chain interactions aid in binding of the BamH I recognition sequence. In the major groove, the majority of enzyme/DNA contacts take place at the amino terminus of the parallel-4-helix bundle, made up of a4 and a6 from each subunit. Although a6 from each subunit does not enter the DNA major groove, its preceding loops interact with the outer ends of the recognition site. Conversely, a4 from each subunit does enter the major groove {{in the center of the}} recognition sequence. A total of 18 bonds are formed between the enzyme and DNA across the 6 base pair recognition sequence (12 direct and 6 water mediated bonds). Arg155 and Asp154 located in a spiral ring before a6 are connected with G:C base pairs outside while the middle G:C pairs are connected with Asp154, Arg122, and Asn116 (direct binding). Hydrogen bonding between water and Asn116 results in binding at A:T base pairs inside (water-mediated binding). As discussed above, the L and R subunits bind in a cross over <b>manner,</b> <b>whereby</b> the R-subunit of BamH I contacts the left DNA half-site of the recognition sequence. The binding of each BamH I subunit is precisely the same as its symmetrical partner. The recognition site for BamH I has a palindromic sequence which can be cut in half for ease in showing bonds.|$|E
50|$|Practices such as alchemy, {{medicinal}} magic, charms, and sorcery {{have been}} dated back centuries {{before they were}} considered evil. The Catholic Church condemned such practices in about 900 AD (3), {{but it was not}} until Malleus Maleficarum was published in 1487 that individuals who practiced things considered as “witchcraft” were punished severely. Malleus Maleficarum was published by a Catholic clergyman in Germany. It was written in Latin and the title roughly translates to “Hammer of the Witches”. Before the publication of Malleus Maleficarum, an individual was barely punished if accused of practicing any form of magic. Post-publication of this document changed the way that medieval society treated anyone who performed anything considered an act of magic or witchcraft. Malleus Maleficarum was used as a judicial book of guidelines within secular courts of Europe over three hundred years past its date of publication. Its main two purposes were to inform the audience about how to detect individuals who practice magic and how to prosecute said individuals. The document was divided into three parts, each of which dealt with something different within the process of persecution. The first section discusses what makes witchcraft real and how it is a very present threat to their current society. This section also makes the connection between witches and the Devil. In the second part, actual acts of magic are discussed. Chapters within this section are titled with various spells that the witches might perform, such as “How they are transported from Place to Place”, “How Witches Impede and Prevent the Power of Procreation”, “Of the <b>Manner</b> <b>whereby</b> they Change Men into the Shapes of Beasts”, etc. They identify various magical practices with the idea of witchcraft, thus condemning many acts of magic that have been performed for centuries as crimes punishable by death. Interestingly enough, this section also discusses various remedies by which one can protect themselves against the actions of witches, many of these remedies being reminiscent of various magical acts. The third section discusses the actual prosecution of witches, and the procedure by which one must follow. It defines the use of prosecution, defense, witnesses, and punishments. It is essentially a guide on how to convict an individual of witchcraft.|$|E
