40|$|Objectives: The global {{literature}} has revealed potential negative impacts of migration and discrimination on individual’s psychological adjustments. However, the psychological adjustments among internal <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> {{in developing countries}} are rarely assessed. This study simultaneously examines perceived discrimination and schooling arrangements in relation to psychological adjustments among rural-to-urban <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> in China. Methods: A sample of 657 <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> was recruited in Beijing, China. Cross-sectional associations of self-reported perceived discrimination and schooling arrangements (i. e. public school and <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> school (MCS)) with psychological adjustment outcomes (i. e. social anxiety, depression and loneliness) were examined by general linear model. Results: (1) Compared with <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> in public school, <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> in MCS had lower family incomes, and their parents had received less education. (2) <b>Migrant</b> <b>children</b> in MCS {{reported higher levels of}} social anxiety, depression and loneliness than did their counterparts. Children who reported high level of perceived discrimination also reported the highest level of social anxiety, depression and loneliness.

50|$|The Circuit: Stories {{from the}} Life of a <b>Migrant</b> <b>Child</b> is an autobiographical novel by Francisco Jiménez {{based in part}} on his journey from Mexico to the United States of America. The book, narrated by the child's point of view, follows the life of young Panchito and his family as they move from one {{location}} to another to harvest crops in the United States. The book has three sequels, Breaking Through, Reaching Out and the fourth in the series, Taking Hold: From Migrant Childhood to Columbia University. The author translated the first three novels into Spanish under the titles Cajas de cartón(cardboard boxes), Senderos fronterizos and Mas allá de mi respectively, all published by Houghton Mifflin.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{practise}} of governing migrant schools, and to investigate the underlying rationalities behind the governance of education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children,</b> as well as to analyze {{the extent to which the}} governance of access to education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> makes it possible to accommodate their future educational needs. Drawing on two months‘ research in a government-minban migrant school in the Songjiang district of Shanghai, the data demonstrates that the current policy on governing migrant schools has without doubt provided a better education setting for <b>migrant</b> <b>children,</b> as these children are now supported by an annual subsidy, exempted from tuition fees, and given access to a more standardized curriculum. However, when compared to local public schools, the current situation still reveals marginality in terms of the education of <b>migrant</b> <b>children.</b> By using governmentality theory, I seek to explain Shanghai‘s current governance of education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> through the analytical lens of subjectification, rationality and form of technology. The study suggests that the emergence of issues such as securing China‘s future human resources and China‘s changing attitude towards migrants has highlighted the importance of providing education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children.</b> Following these rationales, the current practises regarding the provision of education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> lie somewhere between supporting (through subsidy and regulation of migrant schools, as well as the promotion of vocational schools) and restricting (via the continued implementation of China‘s National College Entrance Examination (NCEE)). Nevertheless, under the current wave of decentralization, each locality comes with its own concerns, which makes the practise of governing education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> more varied than ever. Thus, under the current situation <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> are still left with limited options for accessing education in urban areas...|$|R

50|$|His {{first two}} novels, Abschiebung (1995) and Zwischenstationen (1999) both {{deal with the}} partly autobiographical {{experience}} of exile, telling the stories of families who are migrating from the Soviet Union to other countries. Similar to Vertlib`s trail of immigrations, in Zwischenstationen the family moves from Israel to Italy, followed by moves to Austria, the Netherlands, and the US, before finally settling in Vienna. Told {{from the perspective of}} a child, the novel reflects Vertlib's personal experience with migration: at home in Austria, but not Austrian-born, he based the story on his own feelings as a <b>migrant</b> <b>child.</b> Vertlib`s novel Schimons Schweigen (2012) was the final episode of the unofficial trilogy revolving around migrant identity and coming to terms with his own odyssey. The protagonist, an Austrian author, travels to Israel, intending to solve the mystery of why his father and his father`s friend Schimon ceased to communicate with each other for 30 years. The novel discusses the issue of displacement and the compromised identity experienced by the protagonist when outside of his homeland as a result of travels between Israel and the Soviet Union.|$|E

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that in most European countries migrants have lower educational attainment levels than natives. Access to education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> is almost universally guaranteed in the EU, {{but this does not}} automatically equate to access to adapted education, taking into account specific needs linked to socio-economic disadvantages and linguistic challenges. Furthermore, social and ethnic school segregation constitutes a serious barrier towards access to good education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children.</b> Sending society actors seem to have only a limited impact on the educational integration of <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> in destination countries, but initiatives like diaspora schools constitute one strategy to try and improve the educational outcomes of <b>migrant</b> <b>children.</b> The scientific literature has only given limited space to the potential role played by sending society actors for access to good education for <b>migrant</b> <b>children.</b> The Interact-project should aim to cover this field and assess whether the role played by sending society actors has not unjustly been overlooked.

40|$|Recent {{trends in}} rural to urban {{migration}} in China indicate that more migrants {{are moving to}} the cities with their families, including young children. Without an urban household registration or hukou, <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> {{do not have access}} to local schools in the cities, raising many concerns about the children’s well-being. Using data from the 1997 Migrant Census in Beijing, this study sought to describe the social and demographic characteristics of <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> in Beijing, to examine the patterns of school attendance of <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> and to determine the factors affecting their school attendance. The study found that 88 percent of <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> in Beijing were attending school. <b>Migrant</b> <b>children</b> whose parents had higher education, were non-agricultural hukou holders and those who had longer residence in Beijing had higher rates of school attendance.

30|$|Moreover, {{the degree}} of {{standardization}} of the educational system of migrant children’s countries of origin is expected to affect the educational achievement of <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> who attended part of their education in their origin country. In our case out best indicator of standardization in the countries of origin is the length of compulsory education, and not a national standardized exam, because for that later indicator is for many origin countries not valid. Whereas second generation <b>migrants</b> and <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> who arrive {{before the age of}} 5 did not attend education in their origin country, <b>migrant</b> <b>children</b> with an age higher than 5 have been shaped by their origin countries’ educational systems.
