5000|$|In 1973 Sansui {{introduced}} the QS Vario <b>Matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> with 20 dB separation in all directions. (The Vario <b>Matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> could also play SQ records on Phase Matrix mode with 6 dB separation. Later Sansui used front-rear logic on the SQ mode.) Two outboard decoders, the QSD-1 and QSD-2, {{as well as}} the QRX series of larger receiver-amplifiers, incorporated this matrix and up-conversion. Sansui's QS decoders also had good stereo-to-quad capabilities, wrapping the L-R panorama to LB-LF-RF-RB in a horseshoe topology. (The Vario <b>Matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> could synthesize four channel sound with high separation - at least 12 dB.) ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{this time}} Dolby {{joined forces with}} Kodak in {{developing}} this system. Dolby's solution to the center-channel problem was to use a [...] "directionally enhanced" [...] <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder,</b> based on those developed for domestic [...] "Quadraphonic" [...] systems, to recover a center channel from left and right channels recorded on the film. The <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> originally employed for this used the Sansui QS matrix under license. This system {{was used for the}} 1975 Ken Russell film Lisztomania.|$|E
5000|$|This LP {{was mixed}} for Quadraphonic {{reproduction}} (also compatible with stereo). It {{was to be}} played back using the now long-extinct Dynaco or EV Stereo-4 decoders, or later, using the [...] "360Surround" [...] <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> built by Stephen Desper and previously included with purchases of his limited-edition book Recording the Beach Boys.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1980s integrated-circuit {{manufacturers}} {{were working on}} designing integrated-circuit matrix decoders. A typical early example is the SSM-2125 from PMI. The SSM-2125 is a complete Dolby Stereo <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> (except for the surround delay) on a single chip, it allowed domestic decoders which used the same logic system found in professional decoders to be marketed to the consumer. These decoders were thus given the name Dolby Pro Logic.|$|E
50|$|In {{discrete}} quadraphonic systems all 4 channels remain {{fully independent}} {{of each other}} throughout the entire recording and reproduction chain. There is no intermixing of channels as is done in <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> 4-channel systems such as SQ and QS. CD-4 encoded records were also compatible with conventional with 2-channel stereo playback systems. In stereo mode all four channels of music can be heard over 2 speakers. This was the only discrete quadraphonic phonograph record system to gain major industry acceptance.|$|E

[...] However, the recording (LP or CD) can be played back in Quad by most of today's audio-video receivers.

5000|$|The Sound Retrieval System (SRS) is a {{patented}} psychoacoustic 3D audio processing technology originally {{invented by}} Arnold Klayman {{in the early}} 1980s. (The original SRS patents are , [...] and , which expired between 2006 and 2008. Patents may apply in other countries). The SRS technology applies head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create an immersive 3D soundfield using only two speakers, widening the [...] "sweet spot," [...] creating a more spacious sense of ambience, and producing strong localization cues for discrete instruments within an audio mix. SRS is not a Dolby <b>matrix</b> surround <b>decoder</b> but works with normal stereo recordings.|$|R
50|$|This same plane-wave {{assumption}} {{makes it}} possible to vary the distance of speakers within reasonable limits without upsetting the correct function of the decoder, provided that the difference is compensated with delay, the power is adjusted for uniform loudness at the center, and that per-speaker near-field compensation is used. Distance does not affect the <b>decoder</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} often called RM (Regular Matrix) when used on {{amplifiers}} or receivers by other trademarks than Sansui. Many Japanese trademarks like Pioneer or Kenwood had matrix decoders with two modes: - SQ and RM. JVC had two modes on their <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> called Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. That decoder could play both SQ and QS records, {{but it was}} a simplified decoder. QS records could also be played on Marantz Vari-Matrix system. (European trademarks like Philips or Bang & Olofsen had only decoders for SQ or both SQ and CD-4 - but not QS.) QS records could give some quadraphonic effect, although far from accurate, when played on an SQ decoder.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} and mid-1970s, for example, Ferguson made two channel {{receivers}} with a built-in Hafler circuit. Philips had a similar circuit in their two channel receivers. Many receivers from middle price trademarks had such circuits - but often without volume control for the rear channels.More expensive trademarks seldom had Hafler or similar circuits, because they thought such circuits increased the distortion of the sound. Most of Marantz' four channel receivers had a variable matrix called Vari-Matrix (not {{to be confused with}} Sansui's QS Vario Matrix) that could simulate four channel stereo from two channel sources in different ways and the listener could adapt the sound with a control. The Vari-Matrix could also with good result play all matrix records. Technics by National had a similar <b>matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> with two controls.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Sansui {{introduced}} the Quadphonic Synthesizer QS-1, which could make simulated four channel stereo from two channel sources. Sansui developed the QS Regular Matrix system, {{which made it}} possible to transmit four channel Quadraphonic sound from a standard LP. The channel separation was only 3 dB, but because of the human way of hearing it sounded relatively good. In 1973, Sansui {{introduced the}} more advanced QS Vario <b>Matrix</b> <b>decoder</b> with 20 dB separation. Unfortunately the SQ system developed by Columbia/CBS was the most popular so called matrix system. But later QS decoders could also play SQ records. Some Sansui receivers could also play the most advanced four channel system - CD-4/Quadradisc by Japanese JVC and American RCA. Most big record companies used either SQ or CD-4, but Decca used the Sansui QS system.|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{power loading}} {{algorithms}} for variable beam variable rate (VBVR) Bell Laboratories Layered Space–Time (BLAST) system under QoS constraints are proposed. The truncated right unitary matrix as precoder at transmitter and truncated left unitary <b>matrix</b> as <b>decoder</b> at receiver which are obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD) choose variable eigen-subchannels to carry BLAST codes with variable layers. We compare the average spectral efficiency (ASE) of several power allocation algorithms— continuous rate (CR) system, one-time power loading (OPL) system, variable beam variable rate system under instantaneous power constraint (VBVR-IPC) and variable beam variable rate system under average power constraint (VBVR-APC). Simulation shows that VBVR-APC and VBVR-IPC perform better than conventional OPL algorithm. 1...|$|R
30|$|The first {{variation}} {{inspired by}} [13] can further improve the performance by running the proposed algorithm several times each {{time with the}} same initial LLRs from the channel but a different grouping of the less reliable bits. This {{is based on the}} fact that some bits with their |LLR|s close to those in the unreliable set B are also of the wrong sign and vice versa. Each time the proposed algorithm is run, a different estimate of codeword may be obtained due to the different parity-check <b>matrix.</b> The <b>decoder</b> keeps all the returned codewords in a list and chooses the one that minimizes Euclidean distance from the received vector of the channel. This variation can significantly improve the asymptotic performance of polar codes.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel fault {{detection}} and fault diagnosis technique for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The cell is configured to implement a bijective function to simplify the testing of the whole cell array. The whole chip is partitioned into disjoint one-dimensional arrays of cells. For the lookup table (LUT), a fault may occur at the memory <b>matrix,</b> <b>decoder,</b> input or output lines. The input patterns can be easily generated with a k-bit binary counter, where k denotes the number of input lines of a configurable logic block (CLB). Theoretical proofs show that the resulting fault coverage is 100 %. According to {{the characteristics of the}} bijective cell function, a novel built-in self-test structure is also proposed. Our BIST approaches have the advantages of requiring less hardware resources for test pattern generation and output response analysis. To locate a faulty CLB, two diagnosis sessions are required. However, the maximum number of configurations is k + 4 for diagnosing a faulty CLB. The diagnosis complexity of our approach is also analyzed. Our results show that the time complexity is independent of the array size of the FPGA. In other words, we can make the FPGA array C-diagnosable...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} to testing lookup table (LUT) based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is proposed in this paper. A general {{structure for the}} basic configurable logic array blocks (CLBs) is assumed. We group k CLBs in the column into a cell, where k denotes the number of inputs of an LUT. The whole chip is configured {{as a group of}} one-dimensional iterative logic arrays of cells. We assume that in each linear cell array, there is at most one faulty cell, and that multiple faulty CLBs in the same cell can be detected. For the LUT, a fault may occur at the memory <b>matrix,</b> <b>decoder,</b> input or output lines. The switch stuck-on and stuck-off fault models are adopted for multiplexers. New conditions for C-testability of programmable/reconfigurable arrays are also derived. Our idea is to configure the cells so as to make each cell function bijective. This property is helpful for applying pseudoexhaustive test patterns to each cell and propagating errors to the observable outputs. In order to detect all the faults defined, k + 2 configurations are required, and the resulting number of test patterns is 2 k. A novel built-in self-test structure is also proposed in this paper. The input patterns can be easily generated with a k-bit counter. The number of configurations for our BIST structures is 2 k + 4. Our BIST approaches also have the advantage of requiring fewer hardware resources for test pattern generation and output response analysis. To locate a faulty CLB, three test sessions are required. However, the maximum number of configurations for diagnosing a faulty CLB is k + 4. Keywords: FPGA, fault detection, bijection, built-in self-test (BIST), C-testable 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{transceiver}} optimization for amplify-and-forward multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) cooperative networks with multiple relays. We consider the case where precoding at the source, forwarding at the relays, and decoding at the destination are all carried out by means of widely-linear (WL) structures. On the basis of the minimum-mean-square-error criterion with appropriate power constraints, we propose a closed-from design for the WL-MIMO source precoder, relaying <b>matrices,</b> and destination <b>decoder.</b> Numerical results, in terms of bit-error rate, demonstrate that, when the disturbance exhibits improper or noncircularity features, the proposed design ensures significant performance gain with respect to its linear counterpart...|$|R
40|$|Random {{linear network}} coding {{simplifies}} routing decisions, improves throughput, and increases tolerance against packet loss. A substantial limitation, however, is delay: decoding requires as many independent linear combinations as data blocks. Hierarchical network coding purportedly solves this delay problem. It introduces layers to decode prioritized data blocks early, which may benefit video streaming applications or applications for sensor information collection. While hierarchical network coding reduces decoding delays, it introduces significant space complexity and additional decoding time. We propose a decoding algorithm that manages all prioritization layers {{in a joint}} <b>decoder</b> <b>matrix.</b> Analytical evaluation and performance measurements show that we maintain prioritization benefits without increased space complexity and improve decoding performance. With memory requirements independent {{of the number of}} layers, our algorithm facilitates more fine-grained prioritization layers to further the benefits of hierarchical network coding.

The advantages to the consumer, music and film producers, and broadcasters, are obvious.
