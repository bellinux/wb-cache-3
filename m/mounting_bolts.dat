2500|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a motor mount {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. [...] Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually drilled and tapped into the pillar for the motor <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b> [...] Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. [...] Consequently, the belt race length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128. [...] If it does vary, then the standard Singer V belts can be too long or too short. [...] In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|E

50|$|Below the cymbal, the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> {{passes through}} first a dome washer {{and then a}} bottom felt, which support the cymbal. The bolt then passes through the cymbal. The part of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> that passes through the cymbal is {{separated}} from the cymbal by a sleeve, most commonly of plastic, which protects the metal cymbal from contact with the metal bolt. Omission of this sleeve by beginners is common, and leads to keyhole damage to the cymbal mounting hole, and often also to cracking around the hole.|$|R
50|$|In the NTSB {{investigation}} report, {{the cause}} was attributed to extreme pitch-up to 14g+ caused {{by the loss of}} the port elevator trim tab due to wear in the trim tab mounts, exacerbated by lock-nuts on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> losing their self-locking ability due to use past their normal life.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame was}} made stiffer through the {{enlarging}} {{of the front}} engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts,</b> though this still left the ZX-9R with just a single front engine mount {{on either side of}} the frame. Further, the rubber bushings in the top rear engine mount were changed to alloy. This combined to make the engine's contribution to the stiffness of the frame/engine unit greater.|$|E
50|$|Subframes {{are prone}} to misalignment, which can cause {{vibration}} and alignment issues in the suspension and steering components. Misalignment is caused by space between the chassis-subframe <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> and the mounting hole. There {{are a number of}} companies in the automotive aftermarket that offer solutions for the subframe misalignment and movement issue, including TyrolSport of the USA and Spoon Sports of Japan.|$|E
40|$|During the {{prototype}} vibration {{tests of the}} GAS adapter beam, significant impacting of the beam at its support points was observed. The cause of the impacting was traced to gaps under the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> heads. Because of the nonlinear nature of the response, {{it was difficult to}} evaluate the effects which Shuttle launch dynamics might have on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> loads. A series of tests were conducted on an electrodynamic exciter in which the transient acceleration time histories, which had been measured during the Space Transportation System- 1 (STS- 1; Space Shuttle mission 1) launch, were simulated. The actual flight data had to be filtered and compensated so that it could be reproduced on the shaker without exceeding displacement and velocity limitations. <b>Mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> loads were measured directly by strain gages applied to the bolts. Various gap thicknesses and bolt torques were investigated. Although increased gap thickness resulted in greater accelerations due to impacting, the bolt loads were not significantly affected. This is attributed to the fact that impacting excited mostly higher frequency modes which do not have significant modal mass...|$|R

5000|$|Almost all Quadrajets {{today have}} some amount of warpage of the {{castings}} although less {{pronounced in the}} so-called [...] "mod Quad" [...] versions after 1974 which were a bit heavier and better designed to resist warping. The root cause of this warpage is over-tightening the front two carburetor <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts,</b> often in combination with a base gasket that lacks hard nylon inserts for the bolt holes.|$|E
50|$|Later {{models were}} {{fitted with a}} bashplate between the lower frame downtubes (by frame number TB879). The bashplate was dual purpose: to stop dirt {{entering}} the air filter, and also to protect the carburettor from damage. Even later models (by frame number TB1029) were fitted with a further small light steel plate shielding the carburettor float bowl and fitted under {{the heads of the}} front two engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{installed}} in the BMW E30, a two-piece oil pan with a removable front sump was fitted to the M42. In this two-piece arrangement, the upper oil pan casting incorporates the oil pump's supply passage, and is sealed to the crankcase oil filter housing with a paper gasket. This can cause problems, because thermal cycles and engine vibration tend to loosen the six 10mm upper pan <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> inside the motor.|$|E

5000|$|Belleville washers, {{when used}} on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts,</b> are also useful as an {{indicator}} of swelling or shrinkage of wooden propellers on aircraft (typically experimental aircraft). By torquing their associated bolts to provide a specific gap between sets of washers placed with [...] "high ends" [...] facing each other, a change in relative moisture content in the propeller wood will result in a change of the gaps which is often great enough to be detected visually. As propeller balance depends on the weight of blades being equal, a radical difference in Belleville washer gaps may indicate a difference in moisture content—and thus weight—in the adjacent blades.|$|E
50|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a motor mount {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually drilled and tapped into the pillar for the motor <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts.</b> Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar.

In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|E
5000|$|A nearby German {{field worker}} {{ran over to}} the crash site and was met by the {{mechanic}} from Brickhill garage who had rushed to the crash site in his car to offer assistance. The pilot was already dead. A search for the crash site in 2001 by a local using a metal detector was successful. He found some of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> [...] "cone shaped" [...] that were removed when the remains had been dismantled on site. The tree that the DH 108 had hit was also found, with the scar still visible. The earlier theory that a faulty oxygen system was the cause was ruled out by the coroner in his later report.|$|E
50|$|Modern cymbal nuts come in {{two main}} varieties, the older being a metal wingnut with an {{extended}} metal thread, the more recent being a plastic wingnut in which the thread extension also serves as the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> sleeve. These plastic wingnuts are most commonly added as an aftermarket accessory, but are not compatible with a combined lower washer and sleeve.|$|R
5000|$|Piggybacking is {{a method}} of {{mounting}} a splash cymbal, mostly restricted to small splashes, by simply placing it inverted above another cymbal, with which it shares the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> and its sheath, washers if used and wingnut. A spacing felt is normally used to separate the cymbals, serving as the top felt of the lower cymbal and the bottom felt of the upper cymbal.|$|R
50|$|Side-stand mounting:The side-stand <b>mount</b> <b>bolts</b> {{directly}} into the casting that forms the lower section of the left side crankcase. In {{the event of a}} hard impact on the side-stand a torsional load is passed to the crankcase which invariably fails. This potentially expensive weakness is frequently addressed by the fitting of an aftermarket side-stand relocating kit to remove the mount from the crankcase and place it directly to the frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{reworked}} interior includes {{new materials}} for the door, console and dash panels, a new steering wheel and seats, and {{a wide range of}} trim packages with both leather and cloth seating. The refreshed interior also features a new instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch (180mm) TFT (Thin Film Transistor) display. The available 8.4 inch UConnect touchscreen radio with available navigation has been revised, now including UConnect Apps. Mechanically, the 3.6L Pentastar V6 and the 5.7L/6.4L HEMI engines remained the same. All engines are now backed by the ZF 8HP 8-Speed Automatic transmissions co-produced by ZF (previously only V6 models used the ZF 8-speed). There have been revisions to the chassis components, including Electric Assist Power Steering, which replaces the previous models Electro-Hydraulic Assist Power Steering. New aluminum rear differentials now use 4 <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> for rigidity. AWD is no longer available on 5.7L R/T models.|$|E
50|$|Like the T-44-122 prototype, {{one of the}} two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes {{went through}} {{competitive}} trials against the captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank. The second of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes was put in competitive trials against the T-44-122 prototype. The second prototype uncovered additional faults in the design. By May 1944 two second-generation prototypes were being built. These featured the driver's position moved rearwards so that his hatch was partially on the hull roof. The driver's vision flap was reduced to a plain square flap with rounded lower corners, in line with the glacis plate. These prototypes had prominent collars {{at the base of the}} gun tube, without the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> which were present in the first generation prototypes. The two prototypes also have differences between each other. One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate while the other had a smooth uncluttered glacis plate. One of these prototypes passed trials at the NIBT proving grounds near Kubinka in June and July 1944. This prototype weighed 31.3 tonnes and was armed with an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 gun. The turret front armour thickness was increased to 115 mm. Hulls side armour thickness was increased to 75 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bell housing}} bolt pattern {{for the old}} AMC 196 Straight-6 engine {{is the same as}} for the more modern early 199 and 232 (used from 1964 to 1971), but the 196 had {{different}} dowel pin sizes. AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different bell housing bolt pattern that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the bell housing changed; all 1966-up V8 bell housing bolt patterns are the same. The bell housing for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two <b>mounting</b> <b>bolts</b> with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|E
5000|$|Peterson Bluff (...) is a {{prominent}} bluff (1,480 m) {{on the north}} side of Ebbe Glacier. The feature forms the southeast end of the broad ridge descending from <b>Mount</b> <b>Bolt</b> in the Anare Mountains. Mapped by United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photography, 1960-63. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Donald C. Peterson, photographer's mate with U.S. Navy Squadron VX-6 at McMurdo Station, 1967-68 and 1968-69.|$|R
5000|$|A cymbal stack is a {{combination}} of two or more cymbals mounted in contact, producing a sound unlike any single cymbal. The effect is similar to a loosely closed hi-hat, or can alternatively be seen as an extreme case of a sizzle cymbal with the upper cymbal serving as a single large jangle. The exact effect is dependent on the tension on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt,</b> and with some combinations can be varied from a very short crunch to a much longer buzz.|$|R
5000|$|The engines were {{developed}} as competitors to the [...] Rotax 582 with an identical <b>mounting</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern to the 582, allowing either to be a drop-in replacement. The engines {{are similar to}} the Rotax powerplant in being liquid-cooled, two-cylinder in-line engines, with dual capacitor discharge ignition. The 3502 was developed from the 3503 as a de-rated version and produces , in comparison to the 3503's [...] Both engines have the same bore, stroke and compression ratio as the three-cylinder in-line liquid-cooled Hirth 3701 and the bore, stroke, compression ratio and displacement of the twin-cylinder Hirth 2704 and Hirth 2706.|$|R
