40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} {{distributed}} methodology for detecting and isolating <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> faults in interconnected cyber-physical systems. The distributed sensor fault detection and isolation process is {{conducted in the}} cyber superstratum, in two levels.

The monitoring agent is designed to isolate <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> faults occurring in the sensor set of the physical part, while it is allowed to exchange information with its neighboring monitoring agents. The secondlevel diagnosis is realized by applying a global decision logic designed to isolate <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> faults that may propagate in the cyber superstratum through the exchange of information between monitoring agents. The decision making process, executed in both levels of diagnosis, relies on a <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> fault combinatorial logic and diagnostic reasoning.

Modern military concepts, such as [...] "battlefield awareness", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene which can be used to support strategic decisions.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a methodology for detecting and isolating <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> faults in large-scale interconnected nonlinear systems. The backbone of the proposed decentralized methodology is {{the design of a}} local sensor fault diagnosis agent dedicated to each interconnected subsystem, without the need to communicate with neighboring agents. Each local sensor fault diagnosis agent is responsible for detecting and isolating multiple faults in the local set of sensors. The local sensor fault diagnosis agent consists of a bank of modules that monitor smaller groups of sensors in the corresponding local sensor set. The detection of faults in each of the sensor groups is conducted using robust analytical redundancy relations, formulated by structured residuals and adaptive thresholds. The <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> fault isolation in each local sensor fault diagnosis agent is realized by aggregating the decisions of the modules and applying a diagnostic reasoningbased decision logic. The performance of the proposed diagnostic scheme is analyzed with respect to sensor fault detectability and <b>multiple</b> <b>sensor</b> fault isolability.
