5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese showed signs of {{expanding}} and modernizing their logistical effort. The number of supply and <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> had fallen, mainly due to increased use of motor/river transportation and mechanized construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year that the 559th Group was using 20 bulldozers, 11 road graders, three rock crushers, and two steamrollers for maintenance and new road construction.|$|E
5|$|No. 33 Squadron is {{responsible}} for aerial refuelling and long-range transport. It is located at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, and controlled by No.86 Wing, {{which is part of}} Air Mobility Group. The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components. As well as aircrew, the squadron is staffed by <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> responsible for regular aircraft service. Heavier maintenance is conducted by Northrop Grumman Integrated Defence Services (formerly Qantas Defence Services).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 26 Lancasters were armed with Tallboys and the {{remainder}} with JW mines.

The Liberators departed Bardney just before the bombers, carrying McMullen, <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> and spare parts. The No. 540 Squadron Mosquito left Bardney the next day. Despite not being notified of the new plan until after all of the Lancasters were airborne, the Soviet military quickly agreed to the changed arrangements.|$|E

5|$|In July 2014, two Globemasters, several aircrews and <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> were {{deployed}} to Eindhoven Air Base in the Netherlands {{as part of}} the response to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the Ukraine. In conjunction with Royal Netherlands Air Force C-130s, the two aircraft ferried international police officers and their equipment between the Netherlands and Kharkiv in the Ukraine. They also flew the bodies of victims of the incident to the Netherlands. A third C-17 flew aircrew and equipment from Australia to the Netherlands. This deployment was completed on 20 August 2014.|$|E
5|$|No. 78 Wing RAAF is {{headquartered}} at RAAF Williamtown. It commands No. 76 Squadron, {{based at}} RAAF Williamtown, flying Hawk Mk127 aircraft, No. 79 Squadron, based at RAAF Pearce, flying Hawk Mk127 aircraft, and No. 278 Squadron, which provides technical training specific to flight training. 78 Wing conducts operational training, both ground and air, on the F/A-18B Hornet and Hawk at Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons and No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit. It currently has an increasing role providing simulator training to aircrews and <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> at Air Force bases across Australia.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> often spend {{the better part of}} their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of the}} duty day.|$|E

5|$|This {{deficiency}} {{was addressed}} by procuring further German Bf 109 and French Morane D-3800fighters. In 1942, the Swiss-built F+W C-36 multipurpose aircraft was introduced into service, and in 1943, Switzerland opened its own aircraft factory, Flugzeugwerk Emmen. Caverns {{were built in}} which to shelter aircraft and <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> from air attack, for example in Alpnach, Meiringen and Turtmann. In 1942-43, an air gunnery range at Ebenfluh-Axalp was opened for training. The Surveillance Squadron (Überwachungsgeschwader) was formed in 1941 and made combat-ready in 1943. A night fighter squadron was formed for evaluation purposes in 1944 and disbanded in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Gales and fog {{prevented}} the British from conducting further attacks between 25 and 28 August. On 25 August Indefatigable, Formidable, two cruisers and seven destroyers refuelled from the oilers. Both of the cruisers later {{detached from the}} force and returned to Scapa Flow. Duke of York, Furious, a cruiser and five destroyers also sailed to the Faroe Islands to load supplies. Before leaving the fleet, Furious transferred two Barracudas {{and a pair of}} Hellcats to Indefatigable. As the elderly Furious was judged to be no longer capable of combat operations, she proceeded from the Faroe Islands to Scapa Flow with the cruiser and several destroyers. On 29 August Duke of York and the remaining destroyers rejoined {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet off north Norway. During this period, the flying squadrons' <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> worked to repair aircraft which had been damaged during the 24 August attacks.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet left Scapa Flow as {{a single}} group on 14 July. During the voyage north, the airmen {{received}} detailed briefings on the attack plans and terrain around Kaafjord and were also issued with escape kits to use if they were shot down over Norway. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> also worked to ensure that as many aircraft as possible would be ready. The twelve German submarines in the Norwegian Sea did not {{make contact with the}} British force as it sailed north. The weather for much of the voyage was foggy, but the skies were clear when the fleet reached its flying off position to the north of Kaafjord in the evening of 16 July.|$|E

5000|$|September 22, 2012: A Piper PA-28R-180 Cherokee, {{registration}} number N4567J, inexplicably descends {{to the left}} and strikes trees immediately after takeoff from Runway 17. The commercial rated pilot and certificated flight instructor (CFI) are killed and the airplane is substantially damaged. Initial reports from witnesses indicate that the takeoff roll was noticeably longer than airplanes typically perform, with an unusual engine sound. The NTSB determines the probable cause(s) of this accident as follows: The loss of engine power during takeoff due to fuel contamination. Contributing to the accident was <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel's</b> failure to adequately correct the water contamination effects. Contributing to the severity of the occupants' injuries was the lack of shoulder restraints.|$|R
50|$|The 81st Training Wing {{replaced}} Keesler Training Center in July 1993, {{taking on}} the mission of specialized technical training in electronics, avionics, computers, operations, <b>maintenance,</b> and <b>personnel</b> and information management for Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, Air National Guard, other Department of Defense agencies, and foreign nations.|$|R
5|$|In September 1967, Melbourne {{travelled}} to the United States {{to collect}} new aircraft: 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks. To operate the new aircraft, the carrier received a major refit on {{her return to}} Sydney, which began in December 1967. In May 1967, it was proposed that while Melbourne was out of service, A-4 Skyhawk pilots and <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> could be attached to a United States Marine Corps Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam. Australian aircraft {{were not to be}} provided, as the A-4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence, not the fighter-bomber role performed by the Marines, and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam's heavy anti-aircraft defences. This deployment did not occur; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and replacement parts in priority to the RAN, and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups with the program, while also disrupting Melbournes post-refit reactivation. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of the}} refit on 14 February 1969. She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May, then sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, to participate in SEATO Exercise Sea Spirit.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, the Japanese {{entered the}} war, attacking Pearl Harbor and {{launching}} {{an invasion of}} Malaya. Faced with a threat closer to home, the Australian government pressed {{for the return of}} its troops from the Middle East, and so in early 1942 the 7th Division began withdrawing from their garrison posts in Syria and Lebanon. The 2/3rd left the village of Fih and moved to a camp at Hill 69, in Palestine, on 14 January 1942. They remained there until 31 January when they boarded a train which took them to Kantara where they were ferried across the canal to continue the journey to Port Tewfik where the majority of the battalion, totalling 636 personnel of all ranks, boarded the troopship Orcades. Men who were in the hospital or on course were subsequently reposted to the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, and remained in the Middle East, later seeing action at El Alamein. Others who did not board the Orcades included the battalion's 'B' Echelon, essentially all its vehicles, baggage and heavy weapons, and its <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel.</b> These embarked on eight smaller vessels: the Silver Willow, Penrith Castle, Shillong, Tarifa, Sophecles, Nigerstroom, Industria and Tricolor. These ships were to follow the Orcades up at its eventual destination, which was at the time, still being kept secret even to the troops on board.|$|E
5|$|No.82 Wing {{accepted}} {{its first}} F-111Cs in June 1973. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, ordered {{that the new}} aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within operational limits, to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition. No.1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No.82 Wing's lead strike force, while No.6 Squadron was primarily tasked with crew conversion training. The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and <b>maintenance</b> <b>personnel</b> were held by No.482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos.1 and 6Squadrons' joint flying program. In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s {{was transferred to the}} flying squadrons, which for the first time took direct control of their F-111s. No.482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate-level servicing, while major upgrades and complex maintenance were carried out by No.3 Aircraft Depot. These two organisations merged in 1992 to form No.501 Wing, which handed over heavy maintenance of the F-111 to Boeing Australia in 2001. Between 1977 and 1993, the RAAF lost seven F-111Cs in crashes. Three of the accidents involved aircraft flown by No.1 Squadron: in August 1979, January 1986 and September 1993, the last two killing both crew members. In July 1996, No.1 Squadron took responsibility for aerial reconnaissance using specially modified RF-111Cs previously operated by No.6 Squadron. This gave No.1 Squadron five mission types: land strike, maritime strike, close air support, long-range air defence, and reconnaissance. In May 1999 the unit was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency.|$|E
