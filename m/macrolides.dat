5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other <b>macrolides.</b> They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. <b>Macrolides</b> also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect.

40|$|Two main {{mechanisms}} of <b>macrolide</b> resistance {{have been described}} in erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (ERSP) : a ribosomal methylase, ErmAM, and a <b>macrolide</b> efflux pump, MefE. In this study, we examined the prevalence of these mechanisms in 114 clinical isolates of ERSP from a 30 -center study conducted in the United States between November 1994 and April 1995.

Seventy (61 %) ERSP contained the <b>macrolide</b> efflux gene (mefE), whereas 36 isolates (32 %) contained the biosomal methylase gene (ermAM). Isolates that were ermAM-positive had constitutive <b>macrolide</b> resistance. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (for which 90 % of isolates were susceptible) of clarithromycin for the efflux-positive strains were much lower than those for the ermAM-positive strains (4 microg/mL vs. > 128 microg/mL, respectively).

5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} <b>macrolides</b> or {{clindamycin}} are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{determined}} <b>macrolide</b> resistance genotypes {{in clinical}} isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae from multiple medical centers in Lebanon and assessed the serotype distribution {{in relation to}} these mechanism(s) of resistance {{and the source of}} isolate recovery. Methods Forty four <b>macrolide</b> resistant and 21 <b>macrolide</b> susceptible S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility according to CLSI guidelines (2008) and underwent molecular characterization. Serotyping of these isolates was performed by Multiplex PCR-based serotype deduction using CDC protocols. PCR amplification of <b>macrolide</b> resistant erm (encoding methylase) and mef (encoding <b>macrolide</b> efflux pump protein) genes was carried out. Results Among 44 isolates resistant to erythromycin, 35 were resistant to penicillin and 18 to ceftriaxone. Examination of 44 <b>macrolide</b> resistant isolates by PCR showed that 16 isolates harbored the erm (B) gene, 8 isolates harbored the mef gene, and 14 isolates harbored both the erm (B) and mef genes. There was no amplification by PCR of the erm (B) or mef genes in 6 isolates. Seven different capsular serotypes 2, 9 V/ 9 A, 12 F, 14, 19 A, 19 F, and 23, were detected by multiplex PCR serotype deduction in 35 of 44 <b>macrolide</b> resistant isolates, with 19 F being the most prevalent serotype. With the exception of serotype 2, all serotypes were invasive. Isolates belonging to the invasive serotypes 14 and 19 F harbored both erm (B) and mef genes. Nine of the 44 <b>macrolide</b> resistant isolates were non-serotypable by our protocols. Conclusion <b>Macrolide</b> resistance in S. pneumoniae in Lebanon is mainly through target site modification but is also mediated through efflux pumps, with serotype 19 F having dual resistance and being the most prevalent and invasive. </p...|$|R

5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of <b>macrolides</b> {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{commonly}} used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the <b>macrolides,</b> will greatly increase {{the effect of}} warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can {{reduce the amount of}} the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K1, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect, including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of <b>macrolides</b> in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E

Sinobronchial syndrome is well accepted to involve the coexistence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CS) and chronic lower airway inflammation such as chronic bronchitis and diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB). Although these diseases are resistant to several types of treatment, after discovery {{of the effectiveness of}} erythromycin on DPB, low-dose and long-term administration of <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics such as erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clarithromycin, are used frequently in the treatment of these diseases with remarkable success [1].

40|$|Objectives: Patients with cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) are frequently colonized by macrolide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, {{a result of}} maintenance <b>macrolide</b> therapy. As transmission of S. aureus between household contacts is common, we examined the prevalence of macrolide-resistant S. aureus colonization in CF patients on maintenance azithromycin therapy and their household contacts and compared this with the S. aureus <b>macrolide</b> resistance prevalence in the community. Patients and methods: Sixty-five CF patients on maintenance <b>macrolide</b> therapy and 194 household contacts were screened for S. aureus colonization by culturing sputa, cough swabs and nasal swabs.

Fifteen patients with chronic sinusitis received <b>macrolide</b> treatment (CAM 400 mg/day) for 1 to 3 months. The number of infiltrated neutrophils and IL- 8 concentrations in the nasal discharges of these patients decreased significantly at 1 to 2 months after the treatment.

We examined the effect of <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics on inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6 and IL- 8) and chemical mediator (PGE 2) and also matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) productions by human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods The effect of <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics [erythromycin (EM), azithromycin (AZM) and josamycin (JOM) ] on HGFs proliferation were examined by MTT assay. HGFs were treated with LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PgLPS) and <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics, and IL- 6, IL- 8 and PGE 2 levels were evaluated by ELISA. MMPs were detected by gelatin zymography. Results AZM slightly but significantly decreased HGFs proliferation, while EM and JOM did not affected. AZM increased PgLPS-induced IL- 8 production dose-dependently, while AZM did not alter IL- 6 and PGE 2 productions. EM and JOM did not altered PgLPS-induced IL- 6, IL- 8 and PGE 2 productions. All <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics did not alter MMPs production. These results indicate that <b>macrolide</b> antibiotics have no direct anti-inflammatory effect.
