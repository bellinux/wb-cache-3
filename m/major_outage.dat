Hydro-Québec estimated that 145,000 of their customers lost power but separate storms in the areas around Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d'Or, Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City contributed to some of the outages. If the storm track had been just a few kilometres further south, hitting directly populated areas in the city of Ottawa and downtown Gatineau, these numbers would have been much higher and property damage would have been greater.|$|R
