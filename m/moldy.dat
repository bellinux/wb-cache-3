Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that <b>moldy</b> corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E

5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting <b>moldy</b> silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E

5000|$|The plot goes disastrously awry, and a human {{corporation}} called ISDN retaliates {{against the}} boppers by infecting {{them with a}} genetically modified organism called chipmold. The artificial disease succeeds in killing off the boppers, but when it infects the boppers' outer coating, a kind of smart plastic known as flickercladding, it creates a new race of intelligent symbiotes known as <b>moldies</b> [...] - [...] thus fulfilling Berenice's dream of an organic/synthetic hybrid.|$|R

5|$|Prisoners {{received}} a hot {{drink in the}} morning, but no breakfast, and a thin meatless vegetable soup at noon. In the evening they {{received a}} small ration of <b>moldy</b> bread. Most prisoners saved some of the bread for the following morning. Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories, except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation, who were better fed and clothed. Sanitary arrangements were poor, with inadequate latrines {{and a lack of}} fresh water. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, latrines were not installed until 1943, two years after camp construction began. The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice, and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases. Noma, a bacterial infection occurring among the malnourished, was a common cause of death among children in the Gypsy camp.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. <b>Moldy</b> bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E

David and his bird allies come in to take out Murdstone and Grimby using the giant cheese globe, {{trapping}} them in {{a thick layer of}} cheese. The employees are freed and celebrate as Murdstone and Grimby are taken away. David finds and helps Mealy and Micawber to escape, along with the <b>Moldies.</b> The full-on sunlight that comes through the open grating is enough to break open the Moldies' captive cheese shells. The film ends on Christmas with David hosting the grand opening of the Copperfield Orphanage (with all Murdstone's former workers there) and everyone cheering for David and Agnes' love.|$|R
5000|$|The John Mercer Langston School {{was built}} {{next door to}} ease the overcrowded {{conditions}} at Slater. Both schools were operated independently until the late 1910s when the Slater principal, Anna E. Thompson, became principal of both schools. During this time the schools were referred to jointly as Slater-Langston. Slater was annexed to the Margaret Murray Washington Vocational School one block to the south in 1951. Langston continued as an elementary school and Slater returned for use as an elementary school in 1958. The building, however, became outdated, it deteriorated {{and it was still}} overcrowded. It was featured in a 1965 Washington Post article [...] "Moldy Shaw Fed by Even <b>Moldier</b> Schools."

Aspergillus mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or {{handling}} of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis. Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Researchers suggest that <b>moldy</b> cannabis should thus be discarded to avoid these serious risks.|$|E
25|$|Drying {{process is}} the most {{difficult}} and critical part of making the pasta. If the products dry too fast, they would crack during or after drying process and have a poor appearance and low mechanical strength. If the products dry too slowly, they would spoil and become <b>moldy.</b> So the pasta should lose right amount of moisture in right amount of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} these {{differences}} will be magnified or minimized based on the initial condition of the fruit after harvest (with <b>moldy,</b> damaged, sun-burnt or botryized grapes producing stark differences between free-run and pressed juice), the type of press used, the amount of pressure involved and the overall amount of movement that the grapes are subject to that could impact how much the skins and seeds are scoured and torn.|$|E
5000|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{says the}} film [...] "no pretense of placing {{anything}} {{new in the}} audience's stockings" [...] but is complimentary of star Chenoweth, saying [...] "with the right talent, it's possible to make even the <b>moldiest</b> of material sing just a little". [...] David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle calls it [...] "a pleasant way to spend a holiday evening {{in front of a}} crackling plasma screen". [...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly says [...] "The only reason to watch this trivial holiday movie—with Kristin Chenoweth as an NYC bitch who finds herself after moving to Montana—is to gawk at Cougar Town’s Josh Hopkins, who plays her love interest, often with a bare (and chiseled!) chest".

25|$|Contrary to {{mainland}} practices, corn was not {{ground into}} flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off the cob. Corn bread becomes <b>moldy</b> faster than cassava {{bread in the}} high humidity of the Caribbean. Corn was also used to make an alcoholic beverage known as chicha. The Taíno grew squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and pineapples. Tobacco, calabashes (West Indian pumpkins) and cotton were grown around the houses. Other fruits and vegetables, such as palm nuts, guavas, and Zamia roots, were collected from the wild.|$|E

25|$|The resort used United States Steel's then newly {{developed}} construction process for its original longhouses; steel frames were erected on-site, and pre-constructed modular rooms were lifted into these frames via crane, similar to Disney's Contemporary Resort. This {{method of building}} caused problems in both Disney's Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts, with guest complaints of a <b>moldy</b> smell in their rooms. It was found that mold and debris had collected in the spaces between each room. The spaces were filled in, stopping the problem, and Longhouses built {{as part of the}} resort's later expansions were built using conventional building techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN needed {{will depend on}} what the winemaker's goals are for fermentation, {{particularly}} whether or not wild fermentation is desired or if the wine will be fully fermented to dryness. The state of the grapes and the conditions of fermentation will influence the amount of nitrogen needed. Fruit that is damaged, <b>moldy</b> or botrytis infected will usually be more depleted of nitrogen (as well as other vitamin resources) {{when they come in}} from the vineyard than clean, intact grapes. This depletion can be further exacerbated by over clarification of the must and high sugar content. Wines fermented at higher temperatures tend to progress at a faster rate, requiring more nitrogen than longer, cooler fermentation. Also the amount of oxygen exposure will influence the rate of nitrogen uptake by the yeast with wine fermented in complete anaerobic conditions (such as many white wines in stainless steel tanks) requiring less nitrogen than wines fermented in barrels or open top fermentors.|$|E
25|$|According to Krakauer, a well-nourished {{person might}} consume {{the seeds and}} survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer {{hypothesized}} that McCandless was likely unable {{to fend off the}} toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety Rhizoctonia leguminicola may have caused McCandless's death. Rhizoctonia leguminicola is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have aided McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became <b>moldy.</b> If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable {{to get out of bed}} and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis is a photograph that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.|$|E
25|$|Pesticides {{are used}} to control organisms that are {{considered}} to be harmful. For example, they {{are used to}} kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like West Nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria. They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas. Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by <b>moldy</b> food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush. They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant. Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses. Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.|$|E

500|$|After minimal rehearsal, filming {{took place}} in February and March 2007 on a six-week schedule, of which 30 days were {{designated}} to filming. The crew was planning to import snow for the film's winter events, but it snowed on location, {{and they were able}} to reschedule filming to shoot the winter scenes during snowfall, which second assistant director Josy Capkun says resulted in much wider snow shots than originally planned. Although the film was shot out of sequence, the final scene was scheduled for the final day and, after a long period of rain, the crew was intending to shut down production and resume months later to shoot the scene, set in summer. [...] However, the rain stopped {{and they were able to}} shoot the scene in the sun.

500|$|In 1991, Huey said Metallica {{with new}} {{producer}} Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music {{for a more}} commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences. Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range. The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load—an album that has been described as having [...] "an almost alternative rock" [...] approach—the band changed musical direction and focused on non-metal influences. Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza. David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as [...] "goodbye to the <b>moldy</b> stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996. With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.|$|E
