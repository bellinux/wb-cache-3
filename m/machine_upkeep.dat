30|$|The {{reconfigurable}} {{vibrating screen}} (RVS) machine is an innovative beneficiation machine designed for screening different mineral particles of varying sizes and volumes {{required by the}} customersâ€™ through the geometric transformation of its screen structure. The successful RVS <b>machine</b> <b>upkeep</b> requires its continuous, availability, reliability and maintainability. The RVS machine downtime, which could erupt from its breakdown and repair, must also be reduced to the barest minimum. This means, {{there is a need}} to design and develop a maintenance system model that could be used to effectively maintain the RVS machine when utilized in surface and underground mines. In view of this, this paper aims to develop a maintenance system model that could be used to effectively maintain the RVS machine when used in surface and underground mines. The maintenance system model unfolds the predictive (i.e. diagnosis and prognosis) algorithms, the e-maintenance strategic tools as well as the dynamic maintenance strategic algorithms required to effectively maintain the RVS machine. Four different case studies were presented in this paper to illustrate the applicability of this maintenance system model in maintaining and managing the RVS machine when utilized in the mining industries.|$|E
40|$|Compact routing {{has shown}} promise for {{reducing}} the forwarding state in Internetlike graphs, without badly impacting traffic flows. This dissertation compares two such compact routing algorithms on real Internet snapshots from router data across 12 years. The results indicate that these algorithms behave consistently over time, and exhibit extremely small forwarding tables with very low path inflation. Acknowledgements Colin Perkins and Stephen Strowes for their support, feedback, discussions, helpful pointers, field trips, anecdotes, and, of course, the initial idea for this project. The departmental support staff for their help through out the year with <b>machine</b> <b>upkeep,</b> and allowing access to copious amounts of server space, hard drives, and docks; their assistance was invaluable. The Embedded, Networked and Distributed Systems group for their help and support through out. The Algorithms group for sanity checking any graph theory and algorithms I produced. My fellow MSci and MRes students for their company, help, and generally making this year bearable. Finally, the Level 4 and 3 students for their patience while I stole their CPU cycles, RAM modules, and hard drive space. ii 5. 2. 3 Routing [...] . 29 5. 3 Summary [...] 29 6 Brady-Cowen (BC) compact routing 3...|$|E
