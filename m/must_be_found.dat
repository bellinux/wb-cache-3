5|$|In {{directed}} graphs, {{the maximum}} spanning tree solution cannot be used. Instead, several different algorithms are known; {{the choice of}} which algorithm to use depends on whether a start or destination vertex for the path is fixed, or whether paths for many start or destination vertices <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} {{the age of}} a sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, the ratio of its activity to {{the activity of the}} standard <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000lb of which was prepared by NIST in 1977 from French beet harvests.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower 3 is a {{survival}} horror game played from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. Clock Tower 3 {{is the first}} game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, {{as opposed to the}} point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies ("Subordinates"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches them. In order to pacify them, an item of sentimental value <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> and returned to the spirit's corpse.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and a harpoon gun for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, President Shinra becomes {{suspicious}} of the Turks activities, believing that someone within the organization is leaking sensitive information. He concludes {{that it must be}} Veld, and removes him from command, instead placing the company's security leader Heidegger in charge. In his first operation however, Heidegger nearly destroys Junon, and the President reinstates Veld. In his first mission back in command, Veld plans to defeat AVALANCHE. An assault is launched at a Mako Reactor, during which Rufus Shinra is revealed to be the traitor supporting AVALANCHE. He is captured by the Turks and placed under house arrest. At the same time, Shears defects to the Turks in an effort to save the gravely ill Elfé. Veld discovers that Elfé is his daughter Felicia, whom he thought dead in a botched Shinra operation, and resigns from the Turks. With Elfé continuing to weaken, Fuhito takes over the command of AVALANCHE. It is revealed that a Materia owned by Elfé is Zirconiade, an ancient and powerful summoned monster that Fuhito intends to use to destroy humanity and stop them harming the planet. However, the Materia is broken, and is slowly draining Elfé's life energy. To save her, the four Support Materia <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found.</b> Fuhito holds one, and the Turks and Shears hold another.|$|E

25|$|Pacifism may {{be based}} on moral {{principles}} (a deontological view) or pragmatism (a consequentialist view).

25|$|The Fair Housing Act makes {{explicit}} the unlawfulness {{of discrimination}} against any member of a protected class, including religion, age, disability, gender, and race.

Totally blind batsmen cannot be out stumped, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>found</b> to be LBW twice before going out. Totally blind fielders are allowed to take a catch on the bounce.|$|E

Points are scored by having physical impairments, mental ones or a mixture of the two (if they are likely to significantly affect the claimant's ability to work). In order to be entitled to ESA, a person will need to score at least 15 points in total.|$|E
