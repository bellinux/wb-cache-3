25|$|Non-scholarly literature, however, {{continued}} {{to rely on}} adaptation. France's Pléiade, England's Tudor poets, and the Elizabethan translators adapted themes by Horace, Ovid, Petrarch and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created {{by the rise of}} a <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> development of printing, with works such as the original authors would have written, had they been writing in England in that day.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{opposition to}} Somoza {{came from the}} educated <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> normally conservative wealthy, such as Pedro Joaquín Chamorro. On September 21, 1956, Rigoberto López Pérez sneaked into a party attended by the President and {{shot him in the}} chest. In his memoirs Nicaragua Betrayed, Anastasio Debayle (Somoza's son) claims that Chamorro had knowledge of the assassination plot. While the assassin quickly died in a hail of gunfire, Somoza himself died a few days later, in an American hospital in the Panama Canal Zone.|$|E
25|$|After {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most Southerners {{accepted}} the integration of most institutions (except public schools). With the old barrier to becoming a Republican removed, Southerners joined the new <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Integration thus liberated Southern politics from the old racial issues. In 1963, the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding African-American voters from the Democratic primaries, which {{had been the only}} elections that mattered in most of the South. Meanwhile, the newly enfranchised black voters supported Democratic candidates at the 85–90% level, a shift which further convinced many white segregationists that the Republicans were no longer the black party.|$|E

Despite competing vigorously in the polls, the Hills couple were nevertheless close friends with JLP leader Sir Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley, head of the PNP, who both served as Jamaican Prime Ministers.

25|$|In {{the cooler}} climates of {{northern}} Europe, people could store butter longer before it spoiled. Scandinavia has the oldest tradition in Europe of butter export trade, dating {{at least to}} the 12th century. After the fall of Rome and through much of the Middle Ages, butter was a common food across most of Europe—but had a low reputation, and so was consumed principally by peasants. Butter slowly became more accepted by the upper class, notably when the early 16th century Roman Catholic Church allowed its consumption during Lent. Bread and butter became common fare among the <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic {{uprising}} {{began in}} the mid-to-late 1970s, with attacks on prominent members of the Ba'ath Alawite elite. As the conflict worsened, a debate in the party between hard-liners (represented by Rifaat al-Assad) and Ba'ath liberals (represented by Mahmoud al-Ayyubi) began. The Seventh Regional Congress, in 1980, was held {{in an atmosphere of}} crisis. The party leadership—with the exception of Assad and his proteges—were criticised severely by party delegates, who called for an anti-corruption campaign, a new, clean government, curtailing the powers of the military-security apparatus and political liberalization. With Assad's consent, a new government (headed by the presumably clean Abdul Rauf al-Kasm) was established with new, young technocrats. The new government failed to assuage critics, and the Sunni <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> radical left (believing that Ba'athist rule could be overthrown with an uprising) began collaborating with the Islamists.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, {{the church}} had wooden pews and a single central aisle, with {{balconies}} {{on both sides of}} the church; the central aisle was occupied by <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> balconies by their servants.

Therefore, in the late 1950s, the BdD started to act increasingly as a substitute (Ersatzorganisation) for West German communists.|$|R

25|$|Buildings {{rose and}} roads were {{constructed}} in the new neighbourhoods north of Lisbon, works initiated by the city council {{with the support of}} the bourgeoisie. In 1878 the public promenade was demolished; it was replaced in 1886 by the Avenida da Liberdade (Liberty Avenue), designed by Ressano Garcia to be the central urban axis of the city, connecting the Baixa with the newly developed areas of the city and extending into agricultural land in anticipation of further urban expansion. At the head of the avenue was constructed Marquis of Pombal Square (Praça do Marquês de Pombal), the new geographical centre of Lisbon, from which radiated the newly built avenues of Lisbon. The upper class of Lisbon built palaces on these thoroughfares; the most important was the Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo, running northeast and ending in the new Praça Duque de Saldanha, whence it became a part of another great avenue, today República but initially Ressano Garcia. In the vicinity was the Campo Grande (then an open field and not a Garden) and the new Campo Pequeno bullring, completed in 1892 in a Moorish Revival architectural style. New neighbourhoods were built nearby on plans similar to that of the Baixa, including Campo de Ourique to the west, and Estefânia to the east. Adjacent to the Estefânia neighbourhood was the grand new avenue Avenida Rainha Dona Amélia (now rebuilt as Avenida Almirante Reis), linking it to the Martim Moniz. All these new developments transformed the city. The lower <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> common people settled in the eastern side of the city, while the upper middle classes and the wealthy bourgeoisie moved to the western side, with the Baixa being the location of the larger retail establishments.|$|E
500|$|Their {{development}} and commercial worth {{has been linked}} to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement – grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany. Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a [...] "matter of small scale and meticulous detail". The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the [...] "experience of miraculous visions".|$|E
500|$|Robinson and Jekyll {{were part}} of the Arts and Crafts Movement, a broader {{movement}} in art, architecture, and crafts during the late 19th century which advocated a return to the informal planting style derived as much from the Romantic tradition as from the actual English cottage garden. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition of 1888 began a movement toward an idealised natural country garden style. The garden designs of Robinson and Jekyll were often associated with Arts and Crafts style houses. Both were influenced by William Morris, {{one of the leaders of}} the Arts and Crafts Movement—Robinson quoted Morris's views condemning carpet bedding; Jekyll shared Morris's mystical view of nature and drew on the floral designs in his textiles for her gardening style. When Morris built his Red House in Kent, it influenced new ideas in architecture and gardening—the [...] "old-fashioned" [...] garden suddenly became a fashion accessory among the British artistic <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cottage garden esthetic began to emigrate to America.|$|E
50|$|Web {{painting}} is first {{documented in the}} 16th century from the Puster Valley in the Austrian Tyrolean Alps, carried out by monks who produced paintings on canvases made entirely of spiders' webs or caterpillars' silk.

Only around 100 are known to exist, primarily held in private collections.|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} {{transformation that}} Guerin speaks of in Fascism and Big Business is, of course, Fascism. Fascism in Germany was {{the fusion of}} two forces: a frightened <b>and</b> desperate <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> that saw their allegiance to their Leader and his anti-Bolshevik, imperialist, and racist doctrine as their only hope for survival; and a desperate ruling <b>class</b> of industrialists <b>and</b> landowners who saw their only hope for survival in a political system that could keep the working <b>class</b> in check <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> same time pursue a militaristic and imperialist policy that would pull German capitalism back on its feet. The fusion of these two classes—the urban lower <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ruling <b>class</b> of industrialists <b>and</b> landowners—is crucial to understanding the nature of Fascism as a continuation of capitalism, {{as well as to}} understanding why there was a fascist take-over rather than a socialist revolution. What forces were present in German society which united <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> capitalists through the medium of a fascist’s dictatorship is the central task of this report...|$|R

In the United States, birth registration did not begin in Mississippi until 1912 and was not universal until 1933. Hence, in many longevity cases, no actual birth record exists. This type of case is classified by gerontologists as [...] "partially validated".|$|R
500|$|Through {{their work}} at The Warlock Shop, Buczynski and Slater came {{to meet and}} befriend Judith and Thomas Kneital (also known by their craft names of Theos and Phoenix), who had {{recently}} taken control of the Long Island coven of Gardnerians in New York after the former high priest and high priestess, Raymond Buckland and his wife Rosemary, had decided to divorce. In early 1973, the shop hit financial difficulty, and the Kneitals personally lent several thousand dollars to Slater and Buczynski {{in order to help}} them out, which Buczynski promptly paid back. Their business quickly recovered, and they employed a young man from New Orleans named Robert Carey to work in the shop; he was a close personal friend of Candy Darling, and used to visit The Factory, where he was known as [...] "Chanel 13". The increasing relationship between Slater and Buczynski and the Kneitals led to socialising between their two covens; despite their differing class backgrounds (the Gardnerian Commack coven being largely <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Welsh Traditionalist Brooklyn Heights coven being largely working class and counter-cultural), they got on well. In February 1973, Buczynski requested initiation into the Gardnerican Craft from the Kneitals, but they refused, being cautious of what uses he would put the Gardnerian liturgy to.|$|E
500|$|On September 23, 2009, the {{paramilitary}} EBP joined the political {{branch of the}} Macheteros, the Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorriqueños, in an event named Vigilia por la Dignidad held at Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, in honor of Ojeda Ríos. There both groups agreed that they would promote an agenda of unity with other sectors of society to confront what they perceived as [...] "a fascist repression" [...] being imposed {{by the government and}} manipulated by [...] " [...] that control large amounts of capital". The EPB and PRTP stated that Fortuño represented the [...] "lords of capital" [...] and that his administration was surrendering control of the government and justice system to these interests. The organizations argued that finality was economic gain {{at the expense of the}} public and that they employed open class warfare against it, approving laws without feedback and enforcing other measures. The EBP and PRTP concluded this communiqué by suggesting that public manifestations, armed resistance and independentist unity would be required to counteract the administration. In a different topic, the EPB provided an extended critique of the Puerto Rican statehood movement. In denoting what they believe is the [...] "true face of anexionism", referring to right-wing Republicans such as Fortuño, Rivera Schatz and Jennifer González, the group quoted Ojeda Ríos opinion of the newly elected governor. The EPB argued that those wealthy interests pushed Fortuño by exploiting modern propaganda methods, such as the internet and media, and that the federal government [...] "employed its creativity" [...] to ensure his election by indicting the former governor after the political campaign had begun. The organization interpreted this as a showcase of the [...] "power of transnational corporation to manipulate the economic and political" [...] system, and argued that the austerity measures were part of a plan to satisfy the bond-holders, multinationals, developers and businessmen and [...] "to present statehood as the only solution" [...] to an [...] "intentionally exacerbated crisis". The EBP also criticized unions for their perceived [...] "dispersion", [...] "lack of ideological definition" [...] and [...] "unwilliness to radicalize their struggle", asking them to seek coordinated efforts that entice [...] "the evolution of revolutionary postures within the <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public in general". The organization then urged other independentist groups to cease cooperating with other entities that [...] "seek sovereignty but not independence", in particular with the free association movement, and to pursue unity to face the [...] "militaristic" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] actions of an administration that [...] "leans towards dictatorship".|$|E
