5|$|The exact {{prevalence}} of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is unknown, and {{it is thought that}} many people with symptoms of OHS have not been diagnosed.

5|$|The {{character}} {{was incorporated into}} the Star Wars merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of Return of the Jedi. Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in Star Wars Legends literature. Jabba the Hutt's image has since played an influential role in popular culture, particularly in the United States. The name {{is used as a}} satirical literary device and a political caricature to underscore negative qualities such as <b>morbid</b> obesity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} heavy metal had {{branched}} {{in so many}} different directions that fans, record companies, and fanzines created numerous subgenres. The United States was especially known for one of these subgenres, thrash metal, which was innovated by bands like Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, Exodus, Nuclear Assault, Death Angel, Mono Men, The DT's, OFF!, and Overkill, with Metallica being the most commercially successful. The United States was {{known as one of the}} birthplaces of Death Metal during the mid to late 1980s. The Florida scene was the most well-known, featuring bands like Death, <b>Morbid</b> Angel, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Malevolent Creation, Obituary, and many others. There are now countless death metal and deathgrind bands across the country.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. <b>Morbid</b> Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically <b>morbid</b> theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} <b>morbid</b> dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her {{household}} {{to move from}} Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and <b>morbid</b> {{in the wake of}} the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is the discography of Sepultura, a Brazilian heavy metal band. Sepultura {{was formed in}} Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, in 1984 by brothers Max and Igor Cavalera. After several lineup changes, Paulo Jr. and Jairo Guedz became permanent members for the band's first studio album <b>Morbid</b> Visions, released in 1986 through Cogumelo Records. Guitarist Jairo Guedz left Sepultura following the band's first tour {{and was replaced by}} Andreas Kisser. With the new lineup, Sepultura recorded Schizophrenia in 1987.

Sepultura's best-selling album Roots, was released in 1996 and debuted at number 27 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the <b>morbid</b> theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a <b>morbid</b> fantasy.|$|E

25|$|The <b>morbid</b> fascination of European {{tourists}} with Hindu cremation rituals {{is perceived}} as lack of sensitivity besides being a gross invasion of privacy.

25|$|Observation {{with close}} imaging {{follow-up}} {{may be used}} in select cases if a meningioma is small and asymptomatic. In a retrospective study on 43 patients, 63% of patients were found to have no growth on follow-up, and the 37% found to have growth at an average of 4nbsp&mm / year. In this study, younger patients were found to have tumors that {{were more likely to have}} grown on repeat imaging; thus are poorer candidates for observation. In another study, clinical outcomes were compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation. Only 6% of the conservatively treated patients developed symptoms later, while among the surgically treated patients, 5.6% developed persistent <b>morbid</b> condition, and 9.4% developed surgery-related <b>morbid</b> condition.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, several rock bands—namely the American Coven and the British Black Widow—employed {{the imagery}} of Satanism and {{witchcraft}} in their work. References to Satan also appeared {{in the work of}} those rock bands which were pioneering the heavy metal genre in Britain during the 1970s. Black Sabbath for instance made mention of Satan in their lyrics, although several of the band's members were practicing Christians and other lyrics affirmed the power of the Christian God over Satan. In the 1980s, greater use of Satanic imagery was made by heavy metal bands like Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, and Destruction. Bands active in the subgenre of death metal—among them Deicide, <b>Morbid</b> Angel, and Entombed—also adopted Satanic imagery, combining it with other <b>morbid</b> and dark imagery, such as that of zombies and serial killers.|$|E
25|$|We cite as {{examples}} the clogging of {{channels of communication}} by irrelevant reports, the danger of being led by continued false alarms to ignore real indications of hostile action, and the cultivation of a <b>morbid</b> national psychology in which skilful hostile propaganda could induce hysterical behavior and harmful distrust of duty constituted authority.|$|E
25|$|Bruckner died in Vienna in 1896 {{at the age}} of 72. He {{is buried}} in the crypt of the monastery church at Sankt Florian, {{immediately}} below his favorite organ.

25|$|This is a hymn to {{the beauty}} of the Moon, as personified by the {{celestial}} huntress Diana. The lyrics in this song are very reminiscent of Cradle's earlier works where Pagan imagery is imbued with strong female characteristics. The lyrics' <b>morbid</b> cadence hint at the author's bewitched state of mind.|$|E
25|$|American death metal bands Deicide and <b>Morbid</b> Angel base much {{of their}} lyrics around misotheism in name and in concept. Many bands in the black metal genre, such as Mayhem, Emperor, Gorgoroth and Darkthrone express extreme misotheism in their lyrics and actions, which {{involved}} burning down churches during the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Gastric bypass is {{indicated}} for the surgical treatment of <b>morbid</b> obesity, a diagnosis {{which is made}} when the patient is seriously obese, {{has been unable to}} achieve satisfactory and sustained weight loss by dietary efforts, and suffers from comorbid conditions which are either life-threatening or a serious impairment to the quality of life.|$|E

25|$|To {{close the}} circle, Death {{released}} their fourth album Human in 1991. Death's founder Schuldiner helped push {{the boundaries of}} uncompromising speed and technical virtuosity, mixing technical and intricate rhythm guitar work with complex arrangements and emotive guitar solos. Other examples are Carcass's Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious, Suffocation's Effigy of the Forgotten and Entombed's Clandestine from 1991. At this point, all the above characteristics are present: abrupt tempo and count changes, on occasion extremely fast drumming, <b>morbid</b> lyrics and growling vocal delivery.|$|E
