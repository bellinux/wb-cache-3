25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides her ear for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... she slides {{in and out of}} her characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to <b>mind-expanding</b> imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic {{contributor}} Tom Maginnis {{writes that}} the lyrics [...] "reflect the idealist optimism of the soon-to-be-labeled 'summer of love' {{and the kind of}} chemically enhanced <b>mind-expanding</b> euphoria that pervaded the new 'hippie' youth culture". Author Ian Inglis views Harrison's mention of [...] "the love that's shining all around here" [...] and [...] "Floating down the stream of time" [...] as especially reflective of the philosophy behind the Summer of Love, while theologian Dale Allison identifies the singer's [...] "emerging religious worldview" [...] in the first of those phrases.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the various}} {{underground}} influences in Yellow Submarine, author Stephen Glynn identifies the segment featuring [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] as {{being among the}} film's [...] "most daring sequences". Led by art director Heinz Edelmann, the animation for the song reflects the influence of psychedelic artists such as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, who in turn were inspired {{by the work of}} the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley. Referring to London's UFO Club, for which the Hapshash team designed promotional posters, Glynn considers the scene to be a cinematic version of Unlimited Freak Out – [...] "a 'happening' that sought to create a totalising <b>mind-expanding</b> environment involving music, light and people".|$|E
500|$|Tapping {{into the}} {{psychedelic}} zeitgeist, musicians sonically pushed barriers and explored new horizons. [...] Garage acts, while generally lacking the budgetary means to produce musical extravaganzas {{on the scale}} of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or the instrumental virtuosity of acts such as Jimi Hendrix or Cream, nonetheless managed to infuse esoteric elements into basic primitive rock. [...] The 13th Floor Elevators from Austin, Texas, are usually thought to be first band to use the term [...] "psychedelic"—in their promotional literature in early 1966. [...] They also used it in the title of their debut album released in November, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. [...] In August 1966, the Deep traveled from New York to Philadelphia to record a set of hallucinogenic songs for the album , released in October 1966, one month before the 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, and whose all-night sessions produced <b>mind-expanding</b> stream of consciousness ramblings. [...] Other notable bands that incorporated psychedelia into garage rock were the Electric Prunes, the Music Machine, the Blues Magoos, and the Chocolate Watchband.|$|E
500|$|In December 1952 Cameron {{moved to}} a {{derelict}} ranch in Beaumont. With the aid of Druks and Paul Mathison, she gathered a loose clique of magical practitioners around herself which she called [...] "The Children". Intentionally comprising members from various [...] races, she oversaw a range of sex magic rituals {{with the intent of}} creating a breed of mixed-race [...] "moonchildren" [...] who would be devoted to Horus. She became pregnant {{as a result of these}} rites, and termed her forthcoming child [...] "the Wormwood Star", although the pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Over time, many of Cameron's associates within The Children distanced themselves from her, in particular because of her increasingly apocalyptic pronouncements; she claimed that Mexico was about to conquer the U.S., that a race war was about to break out in the Old World, and that a comet would hit the Earth, and that a flying saucer would rescue her and her followers and take them to Mars. During her magical rituals she used a range of drugs, including marijuana, peyote, and magic mushrooms, and in June 1953 she visited Los Angeles to attend a Gerald Heard lecture on the <b>mind-expanding</b> uses of hallucinogens. Perhaps because of her drug use, Cameron was suffering from auditory hallucinations, frequent bouts of depression, and dramatic mood swings. During this period, she corresponded with the Thelemite Jane Wolfe, although other Thelemites and Crowley associates such as Karl Germer and Gerald Yorke deemed her insane.|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy called Doctor Strange [...] "an engaging, smartly {{cast and}} {{sporadically}} eye-popping addition" [...] to the franchise, adding [...] "this action movie ostensibly {{rooted in the}} <b>mind-expanding</b> tenets of Eastern mysticism is different enough to establish a solid niche alongside the blockbuster combine's established money machines." [...] McCarthy, in addition to praising the acting, felt that there were certain sequences that [...] "go far beyond [...] in visual spectacle" [...] and that the time manipulation sequences, [...] "seen to outstanding advantage in 3D, [...] mind-trip-seeking audiences back in Doctor Strange's origin days would have called 'far-out' but today's fans will simply deem 'amazing'." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety called the film [...] "Marvel’s most satisfying entry since Spider-Man 2," [...] and wrote that despite having [...] "the same look, feel, and fancy corporate sheen" [...] as the other MCU films, it [...] "boasts an underlying originality and freshness missing from the increasingly cookie-cutter comic-book realm of late." [...] Debruge also praised the casting along with the multitude of visual effects the film was able to achieve. Alonso Duralde, reviewing for TheWrap said, [...] "True, Doctor Strange is an origin story, and occasionally hemmed in by the genre's narrative requirements, but it's smart enough to bring in great British actors to make the predictable paces and life lessons feel fresh and fascinating." [...] Regarding the film's visuals, Duralde praised them, exclaiming, [...] "In a year where bloated, empty spectacles have induced a crushing level of CG fatigue, this funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "The giddily enjoyable Doctor Strange... is part of Marvel's strategy for world domination, yet it's also so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Within the familiar narrative contours of the origin story, writer-director Scott Derrickson crams in enough out-of-body experiences, spatial-temporal shenanigans and dazzlingly kaleidoscopic visuals to make you wonder if he and his co-writers ... were dropping acid behind the scenes." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{first of}} these {{possible}} College courses, and the one {{most likely to be}} useful and fruitful for the mass of the male population in a modern community, is an expansion of the Physics of the Schooling stage. It may be very conveniently spoken of as the Natural Philosophy, course. Its backbone will be an interlocking arrangement of Mathematics, Physics, and the principles of Chemistry, and it will take up as illustrative and <b>mind-expanding</b> exercises, Astronomy, Geography, and Geology conceived as a general history of the Earth. Holding the whole together will be the theory of the Conservation of Energy in its countless aspects and a speculative discussion of the constitution of matter. A certain minimum of Historical and Political reading and of general [...] "Library" [...] would be insisted upon in Section ii. This could be made a quite noble and spacious course of instruction extending over from three to five years, from fourteen or fifteen up to eighteen or twenty-one (or even longer in the case of those partially employed); its less successful products would drop out--it might be before completion--to take up the work of more or less skilled artisans and technical workers, and its more successful ones would pass some of them into the technical colleges for special industries with a view to business direction, into special study for the engineering trades, for the profession of soldiering, [Footnote: I may perhaps explain that my conception of military organization is a universal service of citizens --non-professional soldiers--who will be trained--possibly in boyhood and youth, to shoot very well indeed, to ride either horses or bicycles, and to take up positions and move quickly and easily in organized bodies, and, in addition, a special graduated profession of soldiers who will be in their various ranks engineers, gunners, special-force men of various sorts, and, in the higher ranks, masters of all the organization and methods necessary for the rapid and effective utilization of the non-professional manhood of the country, of volunteers, militia, or short-service enlistment levies, drawn from this general supply, and of all the machinery of communication, provisioning, and so forth. They will not be necessarily the [...] "social superiors" [...] of their commands, but they will naturally exercise the same authoritative command in warfare that a doctor does in a sick-room.] or for the naval and mercantile services, or into research and the literature of science. Some also would pass on to study for the profession of medicine through more special work in Chemistry and Physiology, and some with a proclivity for drawing and design would become architects, designers of appliances, and the like. The idea of the ordinary development of this course is not so very remote from what already exists in Great Britain as the Organized Science School, but, as with all these courses, it would be done in varying degrees of thoroughness and extension under varying conditions. This is the first of my three alternative College courses.|$|E
