5000|$|An all-wood {{foundation}} {{usually has}} {{seven or eight}} <b>support</b> <b>slats</b> disposed below paperboard or beaverboard. This foundation, variously called a [...] "no-flex", [...] "low-flex" [...] or zero-deflection unit, {{as well as an}} [...] "ortho box", provides support similar to a platform foundation. All-wood foundations have become increasingly prevalent as U.S. mattress makers shifted to super-thick, one-sided mattresses.|$|R
5000|$|The Q-Net is an armor {{system that}} stands {{off from the}} vehicle's hull and [...] "catches" [...] the RPG before it hits {{the outside of the}} vehicle itself, using metal nodes {{connecting}} the net to disrupt the fusing of the warhead. The Q-Net is similar to other add-on systems like slat armor cages, but with additional benefits of being cheaper and 50-60% lighter than slat, allowing it to be integrated on light vehicles that cannot <b>support</b> <b>slat</b> such as Humvees. Because it is lighter, it reduces power train stress and fuel consumption, while giving equal or greater protection than bar armor. It is fully modular with a hook-and-loop installation method, allowing the system to be configured to different platforms. The net gives 360-degree coverage and can even provide overhead protection.|$|R
