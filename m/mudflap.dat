5|$|In April 1962, McNamara {{asked the}} Nike team to {{consider}} using the Zeus site on Kwajalein as an operational anti-satellite base after the main Zeus testing had completed. The Nike team responded that a {{system could be}} readied for testing by May 1963. The concept was given the name Project <b>Mudflap.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rainstorm Entertainment was {{confirmed}} in November 2003 {{to produce and}} finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004. The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, <b>Mudflap</b> Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel, and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi. Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of Spokane, Washington.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{developed}} {{direct ascent}} anti-satellite weapons. A United States Army Nike Zeus missile {{armed with a}} nuclear warhead destroyed an orbiting satellite in May 1963. One missile from this system known as Project <b>MUDFLAP</b> and later as Project 505 was available for launch from 1964 until 1967. A nuclear-armed Thor anti-satellite system deployed by the United States Air Force under Program 437 eventually replaced the Project 505 Nike Zeus in 1967. The Program 437 Thor missile system remained in limited deployment until 1975. One drawback of nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapons was that they could also damage United States reconnaissance satellites. As a result, the United States anti-satellite weapons development efforts were re-directed to develop systems that did not {{require the use of}} nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|Supercomputing {{technology}} {{applied to}} the problem of semi-trailer truck drag has helped to validate such aerodynamic improvements. Traditional solid truck <b>mudflaps</b> can increase drag, but a study by the UT-Chattanooga SimCenter indicated slatted <b>mudflaps</b> can reduce drag more than 8 percent, making the truck's drag coefficient comparable to one without any <b>mudflaps</b> fitted.|$|R
2500|$|The mid 1979 {{changes for}} the 1980 model year US version were mostly cosmetic. The {{interior}} received a redesigned center console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x5" [...] aluminum wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers standard and the aluminum wheels were optional). In addition, body molded <b>mudflaps</b> became available. On the copper metallic and white cars, the <b>mudflaps</b> were painted the body color while the <b>mudflaps</b> were left black on all other colors. On {{the rear of the}} <b>mudflaps,</b> the word [...] "Celica" [...] was painted in white lettering.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mudflaps</b> can {{be large}} {{rectangular}} sheets suspended behind the tires, {{or may be}} small molded lips below {{the rear of the}} vehicle's wheel wells. <b>Mudflaps</b> can be aerodynamically engineered, utilizing shaping, louvers or vents to improve airflow and lower drag.|$|R
25|$|In {{the present}} day, {{two years after}} Megatron's defeat, the Autobots have formed the Non-Biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST), a {{classified}} international military task force dedicated to eliminate the surviving Decepticons. In Shanghai, the Autobots intercept two Decepticons, Demolisher and Sideways. They send in new recruits: Sideswipe, Skids, <b>Mudflap,</b> Arcee, Chromia, and Elita One to hunt them down. Sideswipe successfully kills Sideways, while Optimus Prime kills Demolisher, but not before he warns them of the Fallen's return. At NEST's headquarters in Diego Garcia, National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway scolds the task force sarcastically for their tactics, reminding them that Megatron's corpse is still {{at the bottom of}} the Laurentian Abyss and the last known AllSpark shard is locked up in the base. Soundwave hacks into a military satellite, overhears the information, and sends Ravage to retrieve the shard.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, the novelization, junior novel, {{and graphic}} novel of Transformers: Dark of the Moon were released. Both {{the novel and}} the graphic novel {{featured}} Skids and <b>Mudflap</b> as supporting characters, but the characters were missing from the junior novel. The graphic novel made reference to several Autobots from the IDW Publishing tie-in comics {{who died in the}} stories between Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon. Another novel, written by Peter David, was published on May 24, 2011, and was released only paperback. Though it is slightly different from the film, the novel still pertains to the topic and synopsis of the film it is based on in the outcome of the final battle. The novel features about 400 pages and is published by Del Rey Books. Its synopsis is: ...|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Glove Slap" [...] is {{a parody}} of the song [...] "Love Shack". The B-52's sang both the {{original}} and the amended version used in the episode. The music playing during the sequence where the Simpsons begin farming is the theme tune from the television series Green Acres. The addicted animals attempting {{to break into the}} house to obtain the last Tomacco is a reference the film Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the zombies' attack. A farmer is shown using an elephant to measure his corn plants' height; this is a reference to the song [...] "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'" [...] in the musical Oklahoma!, which features the line [...] "the corn is as high an elephant's eye". The Southern colonel's accent is similar to the Warner Bros. character Foghorn Leghorn and he uses Foghorn's phrase [...] "Sir, I say sir!", while the <b>mudflap</b> on his RV features a picture of him in a similar pose to Warner Bros. character Yosemite Sam.

2500|$|Revenge of the Fallen premiered on June 8, 2009 in Tokyo and was {{released}} on June 24, 2009 in the United States. Metacritic said the film received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews"; criticism was directed at its bland story, melodramatic acting, romantic scenes, crude humor, overall length, repetitive and poorly shot action sequences, abrupt ending, Optimus Prime's drastically decreased screen time compared to the previous film, and the characters of Skids and <b>Mudflap</b> for being offensive black stereotypes. However, critics praised the visual effects, music, and the voice performances of Hugo Weaving, Charlie Adler and Tony Todd. The film won three Golden Raspberry Awards at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony and became the highest-grossing film to win the Worst Picture award. The film grossed a total of $402.1 million in the US and Canada and $434.2 million in other territories, {{for a total of}} $836.3 million worldwide. It was the second highest-grossing film of 2009 in the US and Canada, 23rd domestically, the 44th highest-grossing film of all time and fourth highest of the year worldwide. With over 11 million home media sales in 2009, it was also the top-selling film {{of the year in the}} United States. It was followed by [...] in 2011, [...] in 2014, and [...] in 2017.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters <b>Mudflap</b> and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E

When he and <b>Mudflap</b> return to the NEST base on Diego Garcia, they scan two Chevrolet concept cars for their new modes. Skids takes the green one after knocking <b>Mudflap</b> off it; <b>Mudflap</b> ends up taking {{the form of the}} red-orange one. They then approach and accompany Bumblebee who rescues Sam Witwicky from Megatron and Starscream. <b>Mudflap</b> and Skids then accompany Wheelie, Sam Witwicky and friends and in their search for the ancient Seeker Jetfire and is teleported with them to Egypt. Finding themselves at a dead end, Skids's brawl with <b>Mudflap</b> unintentionally causes them to find the Tomb of the Primes before Bumblebee tosses them out.
