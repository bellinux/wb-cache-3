40|$|A tritium {{exposure}} apparatus {{has been}} designed and built {{for the purposes of}} generating a high-pressure tritium atmosphere at 523 K. The loading system consists of a uranium tritide storage bed, an intermediate tritium transfer chamber filled with 5 A molecular sieve, and the sample exposure chamber. The loading system resides in a sealed glovebox with a nitrogen atmosphere that is continually purged through a Glovebox Clean-up System. The tritium used in each loading experiment is approximately 6000 Ci (22 TBq). The process entails transferring the tritium inventory from the uranium storage bed to the cryogenically cooled (77 K) <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>chamber.</b> The molecular sieve at liquid nitrogen temperature is capable of adsorbing tritium to densities of 290 Ci/gram at one atmosphere. At 523 K a maximum tritium pressure of 21 MPa is achieved. The loading apparatus is used to develop high-density radioactive isotope fuel for self-powered microelectronic and micromechanical devices. This paper presents the design specifics of the tritium exposure apparatus, the steps taken in generating the high-temperature, high-pressure tritium atmosphere and the performance characteristics of the apparatus.

40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>sieves,</b> porous, {{crystalline}} frameworks with pore {{sizes of}} molecular dimensions, are of great industrial importance as detergents, catalysts and absorbants. Despite their technological importance, the syntheses {{of these materials}} are still not well understood and typically rely on extensive series of trials to produce new framework structures. Thermodynamic investigations are undertaken {{to better understand the}} energetic differences amongst <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> frameworks and the mechanisms and interactions important in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> self-assembly. The enthalpies relative to quartz at 298. 15 K are determined by high-temperature solution calorimetry for a collection of calcined pure-silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> with diverse structural features. Si 0 _ 2 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> are shown to be only modestly (6. 8 - 14. 4 kJ/mol) metastable with respect to quartz. A strong linear correlation between enthalpy and molar volume is observed, implying that the overall packing quality determines the relative enthalpies of Si 0 _ 2 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> Silanol (Si-O-H) defect sites lead to an additional destabilization of no more than 2. 4 kJ/mol. The entropies of four pure-silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> spanning the entire range of molar volumes available to Si 0 _ 2 frameworks are determined by the integration of heat capacity measurements from 5 to 400 K. The entropies of these structures are almost identical (3. 2 - 4. 2 J∙K^(- 1) ∙mol^(- 1) above quartz), hence the empty pore volume and cages do not contribute appreciably to the vibrational density of states. The enthalpy and entropy data are combined to calculate the Gibbs free energies of transition from quartz to eight other silica polymorphs, including four <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> as well as silica glass. At typical synthesis conditions, the available thermal energy is RT = 3. 5 kJ/mol. The <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> Gibbs free energies are only slightly larger than RT at 5. 5 - 12. 6 kJ/mol above quartz and lie in the same energetic region as the amorphous precursors used for <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> preparation. There are therefore no significant thermodynamic barriers to transformations among silica polymorphs. Thus the role of SDA in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> syntheses is not the stabilization of otherwise very unstable phases. Interaction enthalpies between inorganic frameworks and organic SDAs are measured by HF solution calorimetry for six molecular sieve/SDA pairs. The enthalpies are only moderately exothermic (- 1. 1 to - 5. 9 kJ/mol SiO_ 2), as expected if the predominant interactions are van der Waals contacts between the hydrophobic silica frameworks and the hydrocarbon portions of the SDAs. Interaction entropies can be estimated for three framework/SDA pairs, and, when used in combination with the interaction enthalpies, allow the calculation of the Gibbs free energies of interaction between these three inorganic/organic pairs. The latter values range from - 2. 0 to - 5. 4 kJ/mol SiO_ 2, smaller in magnitude than twice the available thermal energy at <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis temperatures. This energy range is comparable to the range observed for the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> frameworks alone, showing that energetics of both the frameworks and of the molecular sieve/SDA interactions must be considered in order to adequately describe <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis. The energetics of the synthesis of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> (considering all components present in the synthesis mixture) are examined here and also reveal small differences between various molecular sieve/SDA combinations. The energetic contribution of the effective dilution experienced by the SDA upon occlusion is similar in magnitude to the other energetic effects.

40|$|Throughout {{the last}} two decades, {{there has been a}} {{tremendous}} interest and growth in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> science. In particular, substantial {{attention has been paid to}} the development of new <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> for catalytic applications, as <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> have the unique ability to promote reactions in a shape-selective manner. To increase the variety of reactions that can be catalyzed by <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves,</b> recent efforts have focused on generating new types of active sites in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> by incorporating transition metals into the silicate framework or by supporting metal-based species within the micropores. Despite this, there are still many chemistries that can not be carried out over <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> catalysts where significant benefit could be gained if the reaction were to be accomplished in a shape-selective manner. To address this problem, I have prepared a new class of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> that contain intracrystalline organic functionalities [denoted organic-functionalized <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> (OFMS's) ]. Previous attempts to synthesize silicate-based <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> with organic functionalities within the micropores have focused on grafting organic groups onto preformed zeolites. However, this is not a viable route to the production of OFMS's that can function as shape-selective catalysts, as the organic groups preferentially functionalize the external crystal surface. Here, the problems with this approach are circumvented by preparing OFMS's by direct synthesis. Attempts to synthesize OFMS's directly both in the presence and absence of organic structure-directing agents (SDA's) are described. Pure-silica beta zeolites containing a variety of intracrystalline organic groups are synthesized using tetraethyl ammonium fluoride (TEAF) as the SDA. Porosity is generated by removing the occluded TEAF by solvent-extraction techniques. Following extraction, the exposed organic functionalities are further altered by chemical techniques, e. g., amines to imines, phenethyl groups to phenethylsulfonic acid groups. The ability to perform shape-selective acid catalysis (phenethylsulfonic acid) and shape-selective formation of imines from amines indicates that the organic moieties reside largely in the micropores of the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve.</b> Several preparation variables have an impact on the nature of the resulting OFMS's, the most of important of which are the synthetic method, silicon source, and extraction method. The effects of these synthetic factors on the crystal size and morphology, porosity and hydrophobicity of the products are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} new organic structure-directing agents (SDA's) are {{synthesized}} and used for the synthesis of high-silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> The hydrophobicity and rigidity of these new and other previously known SDA's are evaluated {{in terms of their}} phase transfer behavior from water to chloroform and the number of tertiary and quaternary connectivities, respectively. It is found that the phase transfer behavior of the organic cation SDA's is best measured when they are in their iodide form, in that the greatest ability for discrimination between differences in hydrophobicity is possible in this form of the salt. The phase transfer behavior of numerous SDA's shows the same trend as that of simple tetraalkylammonium iodides with respect to the correlation between C/N+ values and percent transferred. The phase transfer results are correlated to the ability for structure-direction in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis. It is difficult to obtain a <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> when using extremely hydrophobic SDA's. For hydrophobic, monocationic SDA's, introduction of a second charge into the molecule decreases the hydrophobicity and allows for structure-direction in <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis. Thus, SDA's with intermediate hydrophobicity are found to be most useful for high-silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesis.

The NH 3 -TPD profile and SS NMR spectroscopy for this <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> confirmed the presence of weak and strong acid sites assigned to P-OH-Al and Si-OH-Al hydroxyl groups. All the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> were used in MTO reaction. The selectivity to ethylene and propylene on the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> prepared at 190 ⁰C for 5 days is better than the selectivity to ethylene and propylene on the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> synthesized at 170 ⁰C, 200 ⁰C and 210 ⁰C for 5 days. <b>Molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> prepared at 200 ⁰C for 4 days was better in ethylene and propylene selectivity than the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> prepared at 200 ⁰C for 2 - 3 days, 5 - 6 days. Methane and DME were the main products on most of the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> Methane, ethylene and propylene and some impurities were the products on <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> prepared with SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 2. 4 molar ratio in MTO reaction. The conversions of DME towards light olefins were extremely low. Na- SAPO reduced methane, and improved ethylene and propylene selectivity. Nonmodified and Co-SAPO <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> improved the selectivity towards light olefins. Piperidine {{can be used as a}} template to synthesis SAPO- 34 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> within a short period of five days. SAPO- 5 was synthesized instead of SAPO, and DME was the main product instead of light olefins on the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> during MTO reactions...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} concerns {{synthesis of}} structured <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> The preparation procedure {{is based on}} the use of ion exchange resins as macrotemplates. Macroporous cation or anion exchange resin types were used depending on the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> type to be synthesized. Anion exchange resin beads were employed as macrotemplates in the synthesis of zeolite type <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> since negatively charged precursor species are present in the initial zeolite synthesis solutions. Cation exchange resins were used for the preparation of aluminophosphate <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves,</b> where precursor species in the synthesis solutions are positively charged. The method involves a number of steps, which can be summarized as: (i) introduction of precursor species into the resin by ion exchange; (ii) secondary treatment to transform the precursor into a desired phase; and (iii) removal of the ion exchanger by calcination. The first two steps can be performed simultaneously by hydrothermally treating the resin with synthesis solution, where inorganic material is initially ion exchanged into the resin and transformed into a zeolite upon hydrothermal treatment. The steps (i) and (ii) may also be separated by firstly treating the resins with precursor solutions and then converting the exchanged species into a <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> by secondary treatment with additional components and/or structure directing agents. Upon calcination the ion exchange resin and zeolite structure directing agents are removed leaving porous <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> structures with a shape determined by the shape of the resin macrotemplate. The calcined macrostructures can be employed in secondary synthesis for the preparation of composite macrostructures containing two types of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> Modified <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> macrostructures were also prepared by the method. These macrostructures correspond to <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> macrostructures containing various transition metal oxides. The modification is performed as a post-synthesis procedure. It {{is based on the}} fact that as synthesized resin-molecular sieve composites retain a certain degree of ion exchange capacity, which facilitates the introduction of charged metal ions. The procedure was demonstrated for both: (i) metal cations, which were exchanged into the cation exchange resin-molecular sieve composite; and (ii) negatively charged metal species, which were exchanged into anion exchange resin-molecular sieve composites. Upon calcination of a complex metal precursor-resin-molecular <b>sieve</b> composite modified <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> macrostructures were obtained. The properties of non-modified and modified <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> macrostructures were extensively characterized by various methods (X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman and UV-vis DRS spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, nitrogen adsorption and chemisorption measurements) to study the crystallization mechanism, sample crystallinity and morphology, nature of the metal species, etc. The non-modified <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> macrostructures are of interest for application as catalysts and catalyst supports, adsorbents and packing materials, whereas modified macrostructures are of interest mainly in the area of catalysis.
