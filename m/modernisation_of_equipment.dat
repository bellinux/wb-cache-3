40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide an {{empirical}} analysis of the performance of Macedonian grape-growing family farms assessed in terms of technical, allocative, and economic efficiency and to relate aspects targeted in the Rural Development Program (RDP) to the efficiency scores. The study was based on a two-step efficiency analysis, applying Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), in the first step, and Tobit regression analysis in the second step. Data were collected between 2006 and 2008 through face-to-face interviews with 300 grape growers in the Tikvesh vineyard district in Macedonia, each represented by the three-year average of inputs, outputs and prices. The results indicated a large potential for efficiency improvement. The average efficiency was 0. 71 for technical efficiency, 0. 79 for allocative efficiency and 0. 56 for economic efficiency. More efficient farms used smaller areas, irrigated a smaller proportion of total area, used less hired labour, used and paid less for inputs, but produced a larger quantity, with higher value per hectare.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis was}} conducted on the efficiency of commercial grape-producing family farms in the Republic of Macedonia in order to examine how farm performance is influenced by selected aspects of the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) (2007 - 2013). The emphasis was on Macedonian grape production on family farms and on instruments for more efficient use of resources, production modernisation, vine revitalisation, and the knowledge and managerial capacity of Macedonian grape growers. A two-stage analysis was carried out on farm-level data for the period 2006 - 2008. The estimated efficiency scores indicated that substantial efficiency improvements are possible on Macedonian grape-producing farms, with potential for a cost decrease of 29 % (20 % and 36 % with parametric and bootstrapping applied) if farmers manage inputs more efficiently. Farm revenue can be improved by 47 % (61 % when bootstrapping applied) if farmers manage to increase the value of outputs. More efficient farms used a smaller area, irrigated a smaller proportion of total area, used less hired labour, used and paid less for inputs, but produced a larger quantity, with higher value per hectare. The technically more efficient farmers were: younger farmers, farmers with profit maximisation objectives; farmers with lower expectations of a better future for farming; farmers making choices with other family members; farmers monitoring production on the farm and maintaining bookkeeping records; those attending seminars, and those interested in competence-based knowledge such as plant protection, credit/investments. Interventions in production assortment and quality have potential to influence farm performance. Rural development policies can help improve farm efficiency.

40|$|Dairy farmers {{suffered}} substantially increased {{energy bills}} during the 1970 's, {{at a time}} of herd expansion and <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> to allow bulk milk refrigeration and storage on the farm. Little was known of the levels of electricity use in the dairy farming sector, but extrapolations had suggested a figure of 300 to over 400 kWh/cow/annum. Farmers were requesting quantitative estimates for the potential of conservation equipment, particularly plate heat exchangers and heat recovery units. An energy audit of dairy farms in South Devon is described. Over a period of two years, data were collected relating to energy use by each of the major components of a milking parlour and dairy, for a range of parlour sizes, levels of production and the ambient conditions. Analysis revealed the factors most influencing variations in energy use. An equation was developed to describe the energy use by a bulk milk tank, given the level of production and the ambient temperature. The bulk tank accounted for some 40 % of the total energy used. The bulk tank has been studied in detail. The stages of heat transfer from the milk to the chilled water and the resulting effects upon the ice bank have been modelled. Laboratory investigations were carried out to determine some parameters empirically. The model's limits, sensitivity and validation are reported. Typical levels and ranges of energy use are suggested. A mean of approximately 250 kWh/cow/annum resulted from the audit, but 200 kWh/cow/annum was achieved by the most economical of farms without resort to conservation equipment, and this level is proposed as a target for the conscientious farmer. The factors affecting energy use in the farm dairy are identified as political, environmental, technical and managerial and these are discussed. The farmer's influence has to be directed mainly at the last of these categories. Investment in energy conservation equipment should not be considered until consumption is down to the proposed target level.

40|$|In October 2014, the Indonesian National Army (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI) {{held the}} biggest {{military}} parade in the nation's history, complete with F 16 s whistling overhead, battleships {{and hundreds of}} military vehicles. This display of force was a farewell to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who left behind a legacy of military modernisation and an emphasis on professionalism (Faridz 2014). From the podium Yudhoyono declared: We have witnessed together advancements that make us proud: our defence posture is increasingly strong, our heavy weaponry is increasingly comprehensive and modern, the capacity and professionalism of the TNI is increasingly heightened, and we have finished and completed the reform of the TNI. We are thankful {{for the last ten}} years, and we have developed strength and modernisation well (Rizki 2014). A few months earlier, on 1 July 2014, the anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian National Police (Polisi Republik Indonesia, Polri), the president spoke of his hopes to transform Indonesia's police into a â€˜world-classâ€™ force. <b>Modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and technology was crucial to developing that professionalism. Apart from terrorism, he said, â€˜your job is to bust criminals. Protect the community. That's itâ€™ (Firdaus 2014). Professionalism through modernisation was the cornerstone of Yudhoyono's ten-year governance of the security sector. Military professionalism was a longstanding theme in the president's intellectual history. But what did he mean by it? In 1990, on the precipice of the New Order's long decline, Yudhoyono presented a paper on military professionalism to the Army Staff and Command College (Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Darat, Seskoad) (Yudhoyono 1990). In it he rejected the liberal preoccupation with civilian supremacy over the military as a Western import. He argued that officers of the Indonesian Armed Forces (Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia, ABRI) should be professional, not liberal-democratic, and that ABRI's professionalism did not limit the force to one neat category, â€˜soldierâ€™, â€˜nation-builderâ€™, â€˜leaderâ€™ or â€˜state functionaryâ€™. ABRI was all these things and as long as it adhered to professionalism, morality, security expertise, solidarity, leadership, unity and closeness to the people, then it would remain the only institution able to deliver security and stability amidst development. Honna (2003 : 77 â€“ 9) described Yudhoyono's idea of professionalism as a catch-all concept directed against the threat of social change...|$|E
40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT: The {{paper has}} always been and {{it remains to be}} the primary {{information}} carrier though only 0. 1 % of the total information is recorded on this media. The paper production industry has a great impact on the environment which is mostly due to the use of raw materials (wood of conifers and deciduous trees), fillers (CaCOÂ  3), additional materials (dyes, glue, binders, retentionaids), and chemicals (acids and bases). However, the greatest impact on the environmentis caused by the extensive water consumption. To produce 1 ton of paper up to 60 m 3 of freshwater are necessary. The water is not the only resource needed in the production cycle. Besides, the consumption of electrical energy (approximately 10, 000 MJ/tÂ pap), waste paper (paper represents 35 % of waste), and air pollution (paper production and transport) should be taken into consideration. In spite of the above mentioned environmental threats the paper still remains an important element of the everyday life and the use of modern information technology (personal computers, telefax, Internet) has increased its demand and consumption. It is important that the paper is produced from natural materials which are later released into environment without significant environmental consequences. The technology of paper recycling and re-use is widely known and a must of any responsible and professional social environment. Digitisation has increased the consumption of electrical energy as a consequence of production, use and reprocessing of different devices. Unlike a written record, a digital record has no permanent value and the electromagnetic field has a negative effect on the digital records. Digital records have to be constantly updated and adjusted to the computer software and hardware. A book and its content represent a treasure and an invaluable part of the cultural heritage. To use a book it is necessary to learn the alphabet whereas to readÂ digital records we need to be computer and information literate. Negative effects of digitisation have affected the production of paper as the demand for graphic paper (newsprint, writing, printing paper) has decreased. The demand for raw materials, products and semi-manufactured products has decreased, too. Consequently, the level of investments in <b>modernisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and in new production lines has been equally reduced. The proportion of employees directly or indirectly involved in the paper making and paper processing industry has been diminished. In the European Union paper and paper processing industry employ 1. 9 million people in 200, 000 enterprises representing 6. 5 % of turnover in the production sector or 80 billion EUR or 16 billion EUR of the value added per year. The EU is expected to prevent the decline of paper and paper related industry (graphic, construction, logistic) which would endanger the production â€“ consumption cycle. After all, dismissals can ruin the social equilibrium. However, the paper production is faced with a difficult situation caused by digitisation. The competitiveness of the global market has an impact on the labour force costs, raw materials and energy products. Besides, production costs within the European Union are not competitive because of the EU Regulations and Directives which affect the price of raw materials, semi products and energy products. All these facts led to the decrease of workforce and the loss of market leading position and competitiveness. </p...|$|E
