40|$|Abstract—Home {{healthcare}} can {{be divided}} into monitoring and assistance scenarios. In both scenarios, <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>devices</b> are applied for dedicated sensor or actuator functionalities. The requirements and assumptions for the different nodes split the devices in three different classes with particular characteristics concerning energy consumption, power supply, memory, computing power, and bandwidth. Nevertheless, the number of nodes and complexity of setups require new concepts like Serviceoriented Architectures to solve arising problems. In this paper, the Devices Profile for Web Services is suggested as comprehensive middleware for all three device classes. Hence, Web services technologies, which are already applied in the internet and in automation industry, can avoid interoperability problems of sensors and actors in the domain of home healthcare also...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} deployed supercomputer Tryton, {{located in}} the Academic Computer Center of Gdansk University of Technology, provides great means for massive parallel processing. Moreover, {{the status of the}} Center as one of the main network nodes in the PIONIER network enables the fast and reliable transfer of data produced by <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>devices</b> scattered {{in the area of the}} whole country. The typical examples of such data are streams containing radio-telescope and satellite observations. Their analysis, especially with real-time constraints, can be challenging and requires the usage of dedicated software components. We propose a solution for such parallel analysis using the supercomputer, supervised by the KASKADA platform, which with the conjunction with immerse 3 D visualization techniques can be used to solve problems such as pulsar detection and chronometric or oil-spill simulation on the sea surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{previous}} experimental {{results on the}} catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes we developed a growth model. For this model we performed calculations and simulations which yielded predictions for the growth, as there are e. g. growth time and growth velocity. The calculated results are compared with experimental data obtained for the growth. Carbon nanotubes [1] have been studied {{for more than ten}} years and are now con-sidered for applications in <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>devices</b> such as tubular lamps [2], flat panel displays [3] and nanometric electronic devices [4, 5]. Such devices implies specific de-mands on the properties of the tubes, as the length, diameter and electronic proper-ties have a strong influence on the final performance of the device. Consequently nan-otube growth has to be controlled and understood. However, the growth mechanism is at present poorly understood, be it for arc discharge, laser ablation, or catalytic growth [6]. Based and inspired by previous results [7, 8] a new model for the growth of carbon nanotubes is proposed. Here, the possibility is demonstrated to calculate the growth of carbon nanotubes for this model by simple thermodynamics equations leading e. g. to the prediction of the growth velocity. Additionally, the heat generation and distributio...|$|E
50|$|MELs can {{be lowered}} by using fewer {{electronic}} devices, choosing more efficient electronics (for example, Energy Star appliances), modifying occupant behavior and managing standby power. Still, MELs {{are a significant}} obstacle in creating zero-energy buildings. Heating, cooling and water heating energy loads can be reduced by improvements to the building envelope, HVAC and water heating equipment, and air distribution system. MELs are more elusive, however, because of their diversity. Many <b>miscellaneous</b> electric <b>devices</b> {{that can be found}} in a large fraction of houses are smaller—for example toasters, televisions and internet routers, while larger power draws, such as well pumps or waterbed heaters, are present in only a small fraction of houses. Such variety makes it hard to find a systematic method of reducing MELs. If MELs cannot be reduced, the only way to counter them is with larger (and thus more costly) solar arrays or other electricity generation methods.|$|R

The SWIM floppy {{controller}} is also common to both machines and connected through the Grand Central chip. The ANS lacks the MESH SCSI chip (53CF94/6 derived Apple SCSI chip) which is present on the PM9600 and supports the internal Fast SCSI bus.|$|R
40|$|<b>Miscellaneous</b> and {{electronic}} <b>devices</b> consume {{about one-third of}} the primary energy used in U. S. buildings, and their energy use is increasing faster than other end-uses. Despite the success of policies, such as Energy Star, that promote more efficient miscellaneous {{and electronic}} products, much remains to be done to address the energy use of these devices if we are to achieve our energy and carbon reduction goals. Developing efficiency strategies for these products depends on better data about their actual usage, but very few studies have collected field data on the long-term energy used by a large sample of devices due to the difficulty and expense of collecting device-level energy data. This paper describes the development of an improved method for collecting device-level energy and power data using small, relatively inexpensive wireless power meters. These meters form a mesh network based on Internet standard protocols and can form networks of hundreds of metering points in a single building. Because the meters are relatively inexpensive and do not require manual data downloading, they can be left in the field for months or years to collect long time-series energy use data. In addition to the metering technology, we also describe a field protocol used to collect comprehensive, robust data on the <b>miscellaneous</b> and electronic <b>devices</b> in a building. The paper presents sample results from several case study buildings, in which all the plug-in devices for several homes were metered, and a representative sample of several hundred plug-in devices in a commercial office building were metered for several months...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{attributed to}} electronic devices {{in the typical}} U. S. home {{has more than doubled}} since 1980 and is expected to continue to grow at a rate nearly double the forecasted growth rate for residential electricity end use. 1 The breadth of these devices also grows continuously, driven by technological innovation designed to meet surging consumer demand and changing lifestyles. While the traditional sources behind this increasing energy consumption trend are office equipment and consumer electronics, other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>devices,</b> such as power tools, portable appliances, and personal care products contribute as well. The growth in electricity consumption within the typical home from miscellaneous end uses is in addition to the rising costs of fuel, such as gasoline for automobiles and oil for home heating. These costs are intensifying, straining consumer budgets while adding to the climate change burden. To address these concerns, consumers, more than ever, need relevant information about the growing array of miscellaneous products and their energy consumption in order to make smart buying decisions. As a result, new opportunities exist for ENERGY STAR to highlight existing electronics products that are efficient across multiple modes of operation, including &quot;active &quot; or &quot;on &quot; mode, and to address nontraditional miscellaneous products. As each opportunity to address multiple modes of operation and product types presents itself, it brings with it the need to overcome a variety of technical challenges while designing relevant policy options that will benefit consumers...|$|E
40|$|Large, high {{resolution}} displays do not only provide new possibilities for information visualization and exploration in several application fields but also challenge the user {{in new and}} uncommon ways. Due to display dimensions of several meters and enormous information density, the user is only able to perceive {{a subset of the}} visualized data at once. The mapping of conventional interaction techniques like WIMP and the use of classical input devices appears to be not sufficient in respect to usability and ergonomics. For instance, pointers are either too small to perceive from all user positions or they don’t react precisely enough on high data density. The remarkable distances which come with direct manipulative interfaces on large displays enforce efficient and exact control mechanisms. Therefore, one topic of the seminar will be the analysis of <b>miscellaneous</b> input <b>devices</b> (tracking systems, PDA, Revolution-Controller…) for {{high resolution}} displays in respect to their advantages and disadvantages in combination with several interaction techniques, especially Zoomable User Interfaces. Furthermore, the focus of the seminar lies on new or adjusted interaction concepts for high resolution displays which take the limited human perception into account.
