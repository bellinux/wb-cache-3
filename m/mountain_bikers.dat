5|$|The first {{road between}} Glossop and Ashopton was the Doctor's Gate, a Roman Road {{that follows the}} Shelf Brook between Shelf Moor and Coldharbour Moor, a route popular today with walkers and <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers.</b> In 1932, an Iron Age axe thought {{to be more than}} 2,000 years old was found near the site of this road.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{landscape}} features include Bronze Age round barrows, extensive ancient field systems and Iron Age hill forts. Evidence from Roman times includes silver coins discovered in West Bagborough. The hills {{are now a}} peaceful area popular with walkers, <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers,</b> horse riders and tourists. They explore paths such as the Coleridge Way (the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Nether Stowey from 1797 to 1799) or visit places {{of interest in the}} surrounding villages.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E

25|$|Other local {{destinations}} for walkers and <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> include Lantern Pike (also accessible from Little Hayfield), {{a prominent}} {{hill to the}} north west of the village traversed by the Pennine Bridleway.|$|E
25|$|This {{trail is}} used mainly by <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers,</b> {{but can be}} equally enjoyed by hikers. Due to the {{steepness}} of many sections, horseback riding, and sled-dogging is prohibited. Challenges for hikers include a long strenuous climb when hiking the trail as a loop, rocky sections, and crossing small creeks. Trail rules require <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> to yield to hikers; nevertheless, hikers should be watchful of mountain bike traffic. Mountain bike races sometimes include Farlow Gap as {{a section of the}} race, and hikers should either avoid the trail on these days, or be especially watchful. The trail crosses several creeks where water bottles can be filled.|$|E
25|$|Helmets use varies greatly between {{populations and}} between groups. Downhill <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> and amateur {{sportive}} cyclists normally wear helmets, and helmet use is enforced in professional cycle sport {{and in a}} few legal jurisdictions. Utility cyclists and children are much less likely to wear helmets unless compelled.|$|E

25|$|Epping Forest attracts {{large numbers}} of <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers.</b> Mountain biking is {{generally}} permitted except around the Iron Age camps, Loughton Brook and other ecologically or geomorphologically sensitive areas. Despite clear signposting, a minority of <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> and horse riders continue to cause damage in these areas, and the Conservators of Epping Forest have expressed their concern. A number of clubs organise rides, particularly on Sunday mornings. The forest is also used as a training area for many national level mountain-bike racers as it is highly regarded for its fast and tight flowing single track trails. This type of terrain is known within the mountain bike fraternity as cross country (or XC). Epping Forest was considered as a venue for the mountain-biking event of the 2012 Summer Olympics, though the final choice was near Hadleigh Castle.|$|E
25|$|Regional Cycle Route 32/33 {{runs through}} the town, on its way from Shrewsbury to Craven Arms. The route avoids cycling along the busy A49 main road, with the {{exception}} of a stretch north of Craven Arms. The area is popular with <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers,</b> due to the number of bridleways and country lanes in the hilly countryside.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a variety}} of birds, {{reptiles}} and mammals in the area. Deer, rabbits and bobcats may be spotted by watchful hikers and <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers.</b> Farlow Gap and the Daniel Ridge Trail pass through forests with diverse tree species, including yellow poplar, red oak, black gum, and red maple. Rhododendron also grows abundantly (sometimes called laurel), and remains green all year, its leaves curling in the winter.|$|E

25|$|Mountain biking is {{becoming}} more popular with dedicated trail centers in Wicklow, Dublin, Galway and Tipperary. For competitive <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers,</b> there is a National Cross-Country series, a National Downhill series and a National Enduro series.

25|$|Within a 20- to 30-minute {{drive from}} {{downtown}} Vancouver are the North Shore Mountains, with three ski areas: Cypress Mountain, Grouse Mountain, and Mount Seymour. <b>Mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> have created world-renowned trails across the North Shore. The Capilano River, Lynn Creek and Seymour River, {{also on the}} North Shore, provide opportunities to whitewater enthusiasts during periods of rain and spring melt, though the canyons of those rivers are more utilized for hiking and swimming than whitewater.|$|E
25|$|While the {{mountain}} is {{closely associated with}} the highly popular eponymous ski area built around the Colonel's Chair ridge at {{the mountain}}'s northwest corner, that takes up {{only a small portion of}} the mountain. The actual summit, some distance from the ski area, is graced with a fire lookout tower, the highest in the state and second-highest in the Northeast. The former road to it is open to hikers, horses (and possibly <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers</b> in the future). It is the most popular route to the mountain's summit.|$|E

25|$|The rural tier {{has been}} the focus of orchestrated efforts by {{residents}} and county government to preserve its rural character and environmental integrity. Under the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Patuxent River Park is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in Queen Anne both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of tobacco planter mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status; a fall drive yields exceptional beauty along the Patuxent valley's Leeland Road, Croom Road, Clagett's Landing Rd., Mill Branch Rd., Queen Anne Rd., and Brandywine Rd. Walking access along roads in this area is very limited, because most property along the roads remains in private ownership. However, walking is much more accessible in the widespread M-NCPPC lands and trails and state holdings in the Patuxent valley, such as Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Rosaryville State Park, both popular among hikers and <b>mountain</b> <b>bikers.</b>|$|E

500|$|The next {{race was}} {{just around the}} corner, {{and it was a}} big one. The 1990 Xerox Challenge was {{organised}} by Robin Judkins as one of the sporting events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. It was by far the hardest; the 22-day multi-sport event covered the length of the country—from Cape Reinga to Bluff—and included road cycling, kayaking, running, and mountain biking. There were 67 competitors, including 6 women, who embarked on the [...] challenge. While Lynch was the favourite for the women, she soon developed severe tendonitis and the race doctor threatened to pull her from the race if she refused to take an anti-inflammatory. She had no option but to take the medication if she wanted to remain in the race, and promptly ended up in Wellington Hospital from the reaction to the medication. Fortunately for her, the fellow competitors were stuck in nearby Makara Beach, waiting for the weather in Cook Strait to settle enough to enable the kayak section. After two days, organisers abandoned the plan for the kayak section and Lynch was well enough to rejoin the race. The event featured every night on prime time TV {{and by the end of}} it, the two winners had become household names in New Zealand: Lynch, and Steve Gurney.
