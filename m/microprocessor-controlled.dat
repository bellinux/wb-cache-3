25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s <b>microprocessor-controlled</b> tourniquets were invented by James McEwen, a {{biomedical}} engineer in Vancouver, Canada. The first US patent for an electronic tourniquet system {{was awarded to}} Dr. McEwen in 1984 and to date he has been awarded many more US and foreign patents for tourniquet improvements. Modern tourniquet systems based on Dr. McEwen’s invention have self-checks and self-calibration {{to ensure that the}} systems are safe for use. They are also self-contained as they do not require external compressed gas sources to function. They provide accurate control over the cuff pressure through electronic regulators, and have various safety features such as audio-visual alarms for pneumatic leakage and inflation time. The use of automatic tourniquet systems has significantly improved tourniquet safety. Modern automatic tourniquets are self-calibrating and self-contained. These new tourniquet devices also provide a variety of safety features that are not possible in older mechanical tourniquets.|$|E

The coaches were initially built in South Korea by ROTEM, then in Bangalore by BEML through a technology transfer arrangement. These trains consist of four [...] stainless steel lightweight coaches with vestibules permitting movement throughout their length and can carry up to 1500 passengers, with 50 seated and 330 standing passengers per coach. The coaches are fully air conditioned, equipped with automatic doors, <b>microprocessor-controlled</b> brakes and secondary air suspension, and are capable of maintaining an average speed of [...] over a distance of [...] The system is extensible up to eight coaches, and platforms have been designed accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of the six}} axles {{are driven}} via a {{reduction}} gear by one nose suspended axle hung traction motor (Brush designed and built TM2161A four pole motors). Each motor has a separate <b>microprocessor-controlled</b> power supply (SEPEX in Brush's designation - from [...] "Separately Excited"), a system that was first tried on the Class 58. One feature of this system is that if one set of wheels/axle/motor starts to wheelslip their speed can be reduced without affecting the other motors.|$|E

This is the second <b>microprocessor-controlled</b> camera in the Zenit range (the first one was the second variant of the Zenit-automat camera), and the second (after the Zenit-5) {{motor-driven}} SLR camera built by KMZ. Shutter speeds range from 1/2000 to 1 sec (and up to 16 sec in Auto mode). X-sync is 1/125 sec, and the camera includes both manual shutter and aperture-priority modes as well as DX-coding from 50 to 3200 ISO. In 2004, the KM received some improvements and was renamed to the Zenit-KM Plus ...|$|E

The {{success of}} the Prophet 5, a {{polyphonic}} and <b>microprocessor-controlled</b> keyboard synthesizer, aided the shift of synthesizers towards their familiar modern shape, away from large modular units and towards smaller keyboard instruments. This form factor helped accelerate the integration of synthesizers into popular music, a shift that had been lent powerful momentum [...] by the Minimoog, and also later the ARP Odyssey. Earlier polyphonic electronic instruments of the 1970s, rooted in string synthesizers before advancing [...] to multi-synthesizers incorporating monosynths and more, gradually fell out of favour {{in the wake of}} these newer, [...] note-assigned polyphonic keyboard synthesizers.|$|E
