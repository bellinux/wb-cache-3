5000|$|Ethiodized oil is {{composed}} of iodine combined with ethyl esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate.

50|$|Diagnosis is {{made through}} a {{combination}} of patient history, neurological examination, and medical imaging.

50|$|A large {{study of}} spinal {{stenosis}} from Finland found the prognostic factors for {{ability to work}} after surgery were ability to work before surgery, age under 50 years, and no prior back surgery. The very long-term outcome (mean follow-up time of 12.4 years) was excellent-to-good in 68% of patients (59% women and 73% men). Furthermore, in the longitudinal follow-up, the result improved between 1985 and 1991. No special complications were manifested during this very long-term follow-up time. The patients with total or subtotal block in preoperative <b>myelography</b> achieved the best result. Furthermore, patients with block stenosis improved their result significantly in the longitudinal follow-up. The postoperative stenosis seen in computed tomography (CT) scans was observed in 65% of 90 patients, and it was severe in 23 patients (25%). However, this successful or unsuccessful surgical decompression did not correlate with patients' subjective disability, walking capacity or severity of pain. Previous back surgery had a strong worsening effect on surgical results. This effect was very clear in patients with total block in the preoperative <b>myelography.</b> The surgical result of a patient with previous back surgery {{was similar to that}} of a patient without previous back surgery when the time interval between the last two operations was more than 18 months.|$|E
50|$|The {{root cause}} of the {{condition}} is not entirely clear, and {{it appears to have}} multiple causes, including iatrogenic cause from misplaced epidural steroid injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally (inside the dura mater, the sac enveloping the arachnoid mater), or from contrast media used in <b>myelography</b> prior to the introduction of Metrizamide. Other noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of anesthetics (e.g. chloroprocaine), and steroids (e.g. prednisolone, triamcinolone acetonide). A variety of other causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes. Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Prior spinal surgery has been documented as a cause of arachnoiditis ossificans, {{as well as for the}} adhesive form. It can also be caused by long term pressure from either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis.|$|E
50|$|Cerebrospinal {{fluid leaks}} are {{diagnosed}} by performing different tests. A diagnostic dural puncture {{is commonly used}} because its results show {{the presence of a}} leak easily. Other types of tests that could be used are cranial CT, cranial MRI, spinal MRI, and CT <b>myelography.</b> A cranial MRI can be diagnostic by showing one of the five main findings, which are subdural fluid collections, enhancement of venous structures, pituitary hyperemia, and sagging of the brain. Another cause of orthostatic headaches is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a form of dysautonomia, which is diagnosed with autonomic testing instead of the imaging tests that are used to determine a CSF leak. It can be difficult to distinguish if a patient is solely affected by POTS because patients with CSF leaks have similar symptoms and may even develop secondary POTS.|$|E
5000|$|Fibrous {{scarring}} {{can also}} be a complication within the subarachnoid space. It is notoriously difficult to detect and evaluate. Prior to the development of magnetic resonance imaging, the only way to ascertain the presence of arachnoiditis was by opening the dura. In the days of CT scanning and Pantopaque and later, Metrizamide <b>myelography,</b> the presence of arachnoiditis could be speculated based on radiographic findings. Often, <b>myelography</b> prior to the introduction of Metrizamide was the cause of arachnoiditis. It {{can also be}} caused by the long term pressure brought about with either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis. [...] The presence of both epidural scarring and arachnoiditis in the same patient are probably quite common. Arachnoiditis is a broad term denoting inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. A variety of causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.Infectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of intrathecal (inside the dural canal) agents such as myelographic contrast media, anesthetics (e.g. chloroprocaine), and steroids (e.g. Depo-Medrol, Kenalog). Lately iatrogenic arachnoiditis has been attributed to misplaced Epidural Steroid Injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally. The preservatives and suspension agents found in all steroid injectates, which aren't indicated for epidural administration by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration due to reports of severe adverse events including arachnoiditis, paralysis and death, have now been directly linked to the onset of the disease following the initial stage of chemical meningitis. [...] Neoplasia includes the hematogenous spread of systemic tumors, such as breast and lung carcinoma, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Neoplasia also includes direct seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and choroid plexus carcinoma. Strictly speaking, {{the most common cause of}} arachnoiditis in failed back syndrome is not infectious or from cancer. It is due to non-specific scarring secondary to the surgery or the underlying pathology.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{who develop}} {{transverse}} myelitis are typically {{transferred to a}} neurologist or neurosurgeon who can urgently investigate the patient in hospital. Before arranging this transfer, the physician should be certain that breathing is not affected, particularly in high spinal cord lesions. If there is any evidence of this, methods of respiratory assistance must be on hand {{before and during the}} transfer procedure. The patient should also be catheterized to test for and, if necessary, drain an over-distended bladder. A lumbar puncture can be performed after the MRI or at the time of CT <b>myelography.</b> Steroids are often given in high doses when symptoms begin with the hope that the degree of inflammation and swelling of the spinal cord will be lessened, but whether this is truly effective is still debated. Lyme disease serology is indicated in patients with transverse myelitis keeping in mind that dissociation in Lyme antibody titers between the blood and the CSF is possible.|$|E
50|$|A CT scan is not {{the most}} {{effective}} imaging technique when observing lumbar abnormalities, however it can supplement an MRI by detecting certain degenerative processes. When determining whether or not a laminotomy will be beneficial for the patient, a healthcare provider must assess the severity of the possible abnormalities. Out of all the potential reasons to have a laminotomy performed, lumbar spinal stenosis is the chief reason. CT scans are used specifically to pinpoint a buckled lumbar ligamentum flavum as well as facet hypertrophy, which are some of the main pathophysiological changes indicative of lumbar spinal stenosis. Even though a CT scan can reveal these pertinent signs of lumbar spinal stenosis, it can sometimes give a cloudy image due to the shadowing of the tissue contrast. When this occurs, an intrathecal <b>myelography</b> contrast is conducted with the CT scan to fix the abnormal contrast. A CT scan can also reveal an increase in the cross sectional area of the L3 vertebrae, which ultimately decreases the cross sectional area of the spinal canal. As an increase {{in the size of the}} L3 vertebrae occurs, pressure builds up on the cauda equina, commonly causing pain in the lower back and lower extremities. Cauda equina compression can also be due to stenosis of L4-5 region as well. Even though the CT scan allows for intensive image studying, the fixed nature of the image collection process alone is not enough to reach a definitive diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. The outcome of the CT scan can help compile physiological evidence that the patient has lumbar spinal stenosis, and that the patient may potentially benefit from a laminotomy to improve his or her quality of life.|$|E
5000|$|Removal of a disc at {{one level}} can lead to disc {{herniation}} at a different level at a later time. Even the most complete surgical excision of the disc still leaves 30-40% of the disc, which cannot be safely removed. This retained disc can re-herniate sometime after surgery. Virtually every major structure in the abdomen and the posterior retroperitoneal space has been injured, at some point, by removing discs using posterior laminectomy/discectomy surgical procedures. The most prominent of these is a laceration of the left internal iliac vein, which lies {{in close proximity to}} the anterior portion of the disc. In some studies, recurrent pain in the same radicular pattern or a different pattern can be as high as 50% after disc surgery. [...] Many observers have noted that {{the most common cause of}} a failed back syndrome is caused from recurrent disc herniation at the same level originally operated. A rapid removal in a second surgery can be curative. The clinical picture of a recurrent disc herniation usually involves a significant pain-free interval. However, physical findings may be lacking, and a good history is necessary. [...] The time period for the emergence of new symptoms can be short or long. Diagnostic signs such as the straight leg raise test may be negative even if real pathology is present. The presence of a positive myelogram may represent a new disc herniation, but can also be indicative of a post operative scarring situation simply mimicking a new disc. Newer MRI imaging techniques have clarified this dilemma somewhat. [...] Conversely, a recurrent disc can be difficult to detect in the presence of post op scarring. <b>Myelography</b> is inadequate to completely evaluate the patient for recurrent disc disease, and CT or MRI scanning is necessary. Measurement of tissue density can be helpful.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CT <b>myelography</b> has {{historically}} been the test of choice for localization of CSF fistula in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. This study evaluates the additional benefits of intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography</b> in the detection of CSF leak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension who underwent CT <b>myelography</b> followed by intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography.</b> All patients received intrathecal iodine and off-label gadolinium-based contrast followed by immediate CT <b>myelography</b> and subsequent intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography</b> with multiplanar T 1 fat-suppressed sequences. CT <b>myelography</b> and intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography</b> images were reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist to determine the presence of CSF leak. Patient records were reviewed for demographic data and adverse events following the procedure. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met both imaging and clinical criteria for spontaneous intracranial hypotension and underwent CT <b>myelography</b> followed by intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography.</b> In 3 / 24 patients (13 %), a CSF leak was demonstrated on both CT <b>myelography</b> and intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography,</b> and in 9 / 24 patients (38 %), a CSF leak was seen on intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography</b> (P =. 011). Four of 6 leaks identified independently by intrathecal gadolinium MR <b>myelography</b> related to meningeal diverticula. CT <b>myelography</b> did not identify any leaks independently.
