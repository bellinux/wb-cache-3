5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside holes {{at the bottom}} of {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the <b>microhabitat</b> created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye is a generalist, {{feeding on}} fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms {{part of the}} diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a {{pollinator}} of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range {{and that of the}} bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred <b>microhabitat</b> for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.|$|E

Poults of brood hen that selected open-shrub <b>microhabitats</b> were younger than those that selected forest <b>microhabitats.</b> Open-shrub and open grass/forb <b>microhabitats</b> had high herbaceous cover. Herbaceous vegetation provides habitat for invertebrates required in diets of poults and was selected by brood hens for feeding.

40|$|Escape studies often {{focus on}} one variable, but tactics and refuge use vary with <b>microhabitats,</b> exposure, {{distance}} to refuge, and temperature. We studied these effects and effects of <b>microhabitats</b> and risk factors (distance from refuge, temperature) on flight initiation distance (FID, distance between predator and prey when escape begins) and distance fled (DF) in the lizard Sceloporus virgatus. FID increased as distance to refuge increased and temperature decreased. DF increased as FID increased, supporting the hypothesis that individual differences in boldness are consistent among encounter phases. Refuges were rock crevices, trees, logs, and grass clumps. Interhabitat differences in FID and DF matched those in distance to refuge. FID was longer for lizards on rocks and ground than trees due to proximity to and use of refuge. Lizards on trees rarely changed <b>microhabitats,</b> moving {{to the far side}} and unpredictably up or down. Lizards on slopes fled long distances up slopes. Most lizards on rocks entered crevices or switched <b>microhabitats.</b> Lizards on ground usually changed <b>microhabitats.</b> Optimal escape theory accurately predicted effects of risk on FID, but initial <b>microhabitats</b> and final <b>microhabitats</b> and refuges affected tactics, FID and DF. DF was affected by risk, being longer when lizards remained visible...|$|R

25|$|Animals {{move for}} a variety of reasons, such as to find food, a mate, a {{suitable}} <b>microhabitat,</b> or to escape predators. For many animals, the ability to move is essential for survival and, as a result, natural selection has shaped the locomotion methods and mechanisms used by moving organisms. For example, migratory animals that travel vast distances (such as the Arctic tern) typically have a locomotion mechanism that costs very little energy per unit distance, whereas non-migratory animals that must frequently move quickly to escape predators are likely to have energetically costly, but very fast, locomotion.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{dramatic}} loss of tropical forests and accelerating climate change, secondary forest regeneration is increasingly recognised {{as being an}} important method for reversing losses in biodiversity and carbon stocks. The recolonisation of biodiversity within secondary forests depends in part upon the recovery of forest structure, including the range of <b>microhabitats</b> used by diverse local communities. Here, we investigate the return of critical <b>microhabitats</b> along a successional gradient of secondary forest in the Tropical Andes of Colombia. We measured the abundance of live (bromeliads, tree ferns and moss) and dead (deadwood and leaf litter) <b>microhabitats</b> across three landscapes, each encompassing primary, and young (4 – 18 yr old) and old secondary forests (19 – 35 yr old). Considering the increasing rate of climate warming in the region, we also explored whether these <b>microhabitats</b> provide thermally buffered microclimates. We found that secondary forests have different composition and lower complexity of <b>microhabitats</b> than primary forests, but <b>microhabitats</b> appear to be recovering towards primary forest levels. Furthermore, in all forest types, <b>microhabitats</b> had lower maximum temperatures and higher minimum temperatures, thereby serving as thermal buffers that reduced exposure to extreme temperatures. These benefits exist despite ambient temperatures in secondary forests surpassing those of primary forests by 1 – 2 °C on average. The protection of secondary forest and promotion of further forest regrowth in the Tropical Andes should represent an urgent investment for conservation, {{and the value of}} these forests for offering critical <b>microhabitats</b> and buffered microclimates under climate change should not be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|The study object {{consisted}} of 28 <b>microhabitats</b> of five Utricularia species localized in the Province of Lower Silesia, Poland. The {{aim of the}} study was to analyse the chemical properties of water and to present the differentiation of <b>microhabitats</b> in respect of their chemism, i. e., whether there are differences between the <b>microhabitats,</b> and which of the Utricularia species show the highest tolerance to the chemical properties of water. Analysed were the contents of NO - 2, NO - 3, NH + 4, PO - 2 4, K +, Ca + 2, Mg + 2, Na +, Fe + 3, SO - 2 4, total hardness of water, organic substance, pH and trophicity of water. The differentiation of <b>microhabitats</b> of Utricularia intermedia and U. minor appeared to be small, but much higher in case of U. vulgaris, U. australis and U. ochroleuca. The similarity of <b>microhabitats</b> has been determined by cluster analysis. The tree plot showed the least similarity of U. minor and U. intermedia, which occupy an extreme position in relation to <b>microhabitats</b> of the remaining species.

25|$|Nylon {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to abrasion and degradation, hence the netting {{has the potential}} to last for many years if it is not recovered. This ghost fishing is of environmental concern. Attaching the gillnet floats with biodegradable material can reduce the problem. However it is difficult to generalize about the longevity of ghost-fishing gillnets due to the varying environments in which they are used. Some researchers have found gill-nets still catching fish and crustaceans over a year after loss, while others have found lost nets destroyed by wave action within one month or overgrown with seaweeds, increasing their visibility and reducing their catching potential {{to such an extent that}} they became a <b>microhabitat</b> used by small fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} generally open grassland, perhaps with shrubs interspersed, and adjacent lookout points. These are normally trees – at forest edges {{in much of}} the habitat, but single trees or small stands at the taiga-tundra border. In steppe, it will utilize any isolated perch, be it fence posts, power lines or rocks. In general, some 5–15 perching sites per hectare habitat seem to be required. It avoids low grassland with no lookouts and nesting opportunities (trees or large shrubs), as well as dense forest with no hunting ground. Apart from grassland, the birds will utilize a variety of hunting habitats, including bogs, clearings or non-industrially farmed fields. Breeding birds appear to have different <b>microhabitat</b> desires, but little detail is known yet.|$|E
25|$|The color {{variations}} in the mimicked substrate and animal skin are similar. Depending on the species, the skin of cuttlefish responds to substrate changes in distinctive ways. By changing naturalistic backgrounds, the camouflage responses of different species can be measured. Sepia officinalis changes color to match the substrate by disruptive patterning (contrast {{to break up the}} outline), where as S. pharanonis matches the substrate by blending in. Although camouflage is achieved in different ways, and in an absence of color vision, both species change their skin colors to match the substrate. Cuttlefish adapt their own camouflage pattern in ways that are specific for a particular habitat. An animal could settle in the sand and appear one way, with another animal a few feet away in a slightly different <b>microhabitat,</b> settled in algae for example, will be camouflaged quite differently.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effects of natural {{free-floating}} plants on zooplankton distribution in a shallow subtropical lake. First, the hypothesis that free-floating plants have an effect on physico-chemicals, leading to a decrease on nutrient availability and influencing the phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton community was tested. Second, the hypothesis that free-floating plants act as a refuge for zooplankton was tested. Three <b>microhabitats</b> were selected: free-floating plants, littoral area and open water. Results demonstrated that the effects of different <b>microhabitats</b> on phytoplankton biomass and physico-chemicals were not significant, indicating a weak influence of the plants. Zooplankton densities were higher in free-floating plants and littoral area, although the effect of <b>microhabitats</b> was weak for most of the predominant genera. The absence of free-floating plant effects on phytoplankton and physico-chemicals showed that it was not a factor influencing the microcrustacean distribution in the <b>microhabitats.</b> Low differences in densities of zooplankton among <b>microhabitats</b> and low abundance of large-bodied cladocerans led to reject the hypothesis that free-floating plants act as a refuge for zooplankton...|$|R

25|$|Newcomb's snail {{probably}} shares {{life history}} similarities {{with other members}} of its family. Lymnaeid snails generally feed on algae and vegetation growing on submerged rocks. Snails attach eggs to submerged rocks or vegetation and larval stages do not disperse widely; the entire life cycle is tied to the stream system in which the adults live. Little is known about the biological or environmental factors affecting Newcomb's snail population size, however, important factors may include: annual, multi-year, or decadal changes in stream flows; severe weather, high flow, or channel-scouring events; and periods of prolonged drought. Snail dispersal both upstream and downstream within a stream system probably plays an important function in colonizing or recolonizing suitable habitat, particularly <b>microhabitat</b> protected from channel scour. Dispersal of Newcomb's snail between stream systems is likely infrequent because of their obligate freshwater habitat requirements; historic dispersal probably relied on long-term erosional events that captured adjacent stream systems. This life history differs greatly from the freshwater Hawaiian neritid snails (Neritina granosa, Neritina vespertina) that have marine larvae that migrate into and up streams following a period of oceanic dispersal. Most likely, the planktonic larvae of the neritid snails disperse across the oceanic expanses that separate the main Hawaiian Islands and can colonize streams on any or all of these islands. Newcomb's snail lacks this dispersal capacity.|$|E

40|$|In Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, newly hatched Nucella emarginata, {{a direct}} {{developing}} prosobranch gastropod, are almost exclusively located within 3 structurally complex microhabitats: the filamentous algae Cladophora columbiana, clusters of mussels Mytilus, and dense assemblages of the barnacle Semibalanus cariosus. When exposed to desiccation or predators for 4 to 5 h, mortality of hatchlings located in these <b>microhabitats</b> (1. 7 to 36 % mortality) was considerably lower than for individuals on open surfaces (99 to 100 %). Also, food (prey species) in C. columbiana, mussel clusters, and S. cariosus <b>microhabitats</b> was more abundant but of similar energetic value to that on open rock surfaces. The <b>microhabitats</b> used by early juvenile N. emarginata thus provide the double {{advantage of a}} considerably reduced risk of mortality and abundant prey. The means by which hatchlings disperse after emerging from their egg capsules were established by laboratory observations and by deployment of collectors in the field. Hatchlings do not actively initiate dispersal by drifting in the water column. Crawling is the usual means of travelling from the capsule to protective <b>microhabitats,</b> with hatchling crawling speed averaging only 3. 7 mm/min on smooth rock surfaces in the laboratory. The abundance and distribution of <b>microhabitats</b> that protect early juveniles could therefore be important determinants of the local abundance and distribution of N. emarginata populations.
