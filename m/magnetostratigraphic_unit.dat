40|$|Abstract: The Late Pliocene – Early Pleistocene {{terraces}} of the Klondike area {{provide a}} conformal record of sedimen-tation which marks {{the transition from}} preglacial to glacial conditions, {{and is one of}} the most complete records of gla-ciation and interglaciation in the northern Cordillera. Preglacial sedimentation is recorded in the Lower White Channel gravel that contains a reverse-normal polarity sequence. A re-aggradation of the nonglaciated valleys of the goldfields in response to Late Pliocene cooling is recorded by the Upper White Channel gravel, which is characterized by a dom-inant normal polarity with a lower reversal likely associated with the first ice-wedge casts. Klondike gravel interfingers with Upper White Channel and is normally magnetized, indicating an equivalent <b>magnetostratigraphic</b> <b>unit.</b> This glaciofluvial gravel provides evidence of extra-basinal clasts, marking a major reorganization of drainage associated with the first advance of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in western Yukon Territory correlated with the Gauss chron (> 2. 58 Ma). An intermediate terrace in Klondike valley is overlain by 8 m of fluvial and glaciofluvial gravel named the Midnight Dome gravel. This gravel is mantled by 15 m of loess and hillslope deposits, named the Midnight Dome loess, which preserve at least three interglacial pollen assemblages, and a reverse-normal-reverse-normal polarity se-quence assigned to the late Matuyama chron, including Jaramillo subchron (1. 07 – 0. 99 Ma), and early Brunhes chron ( 2. 58 Ma) making these among the oldest glacial sediments in North America...|$|E
5000|$|When {{measurable}} {{magnetic properties}} of rocks vary stratigraphically {{they may be}} the basis for related but different kinds of stratigraphic units known collectively as <b>magnetostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> (magnetozones). The magnetic property most useful in stratigraphic work is the change {{in the direction of the}} remanent magnetization of the rocks, caused by reversals in the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field. The direction of the remnant magnetic polarity recorded in the stratigraphic sequence can be used as the basis for the subdivision of the sequence into units characterized by their magnetic polarity. Such units are called [...] "magnetostratigraphic polarity units" [...] or chrons.|$|R
5000|$|A {{polarity}} chron, or chron, is {{the time}} interval between polarity reversals of Earth's magnetic field. It is a term used in stratigraphy (a branch of geology) to name the time interval represented by a <b>magnetostratigraphic</b> polarity <b>unit.</b> It represents a certain time period in geologic history where the Earth's magnetic field was in a [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "reversed" [...] position. Chrons are numbered in order starting from today and increasing in number into the past. As well as a number, each chron {{is divided into two}} parts, labelled [...] "n" [...] and [...] "r", thereby showing the position of the field's polarity. A chron {{is the time}} equivalent to a chronozone or a polarity zone.|$|R
