50|$|Some of {{the species}} {{that can be easily}} seen are scarlet ibis and {{bleeding}} heart doves, named after the red spot of feathers on their chests. But if you look more closely in the tree, you may see a boat-billed heron looking for fish or a tanager feeding on fruit. <b>Masked</b> <b>lovebirds</b> can be heard calling, red-billed leiothrix will dart at eye level looking for insects, and pygmy geese swim in the stream.|$|R
50|$|The Africa {{section is}} broken up into Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, the Congolese Rainforest, and Uganda. Several snack bars are located {{throughout}} Africa, {{as well as}} the Rafiki Restaurant and Equator gift shop in the Nanyuki Market (Kenya). Nanyuki Market also has a small aviary for <b>masked</b> <b>lovebirds</b> and a white-cheeked turaco. A zebra tram station and boat house are located in the Nanyuki Market. Tanzania features a pier for the boat ride {{on the other side of}} Africa.|$|R
50|$|White eye-rings <b>lovebirds,</b> {{of which}} <b>masked</b> <b>lovebirds</b> are part, are {{reportedly}} less aggressive {{in comparison to}} the slightly larger peach-faced lovebird. They are frequently housed in aviaries with other species of their genus, a practice which although can be convenient, and wonderfully aesthetic, may lead to hybridization. This can especially be concerning where other species may not be as locally common e.g. black-cheeked lovebird, and Lilian's lovebird. It would be advisable to house lovebirds either; by themselves, or if a mixed collection is desired, ensure they are kept in a large flight with a few feeding stations, & assertive species e.g. red-rumped parrot, kākāriki, rose-ringed parakeet or cockatiels. They can usually be kept safely with quails, and pheasants in aviaries.|$|R
50|$|Feral {{populations of}} Fischer's lovebirds and masked lovebirds live in cities of East Africa. Also present there are {{interspecific}} hybrids {{between these two}} species. The hybrid has reddish-brown on head and has orange on upper chest, but otherwise resemble the <b>masked</b> <b>lovebird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{yellow-collared lovebird}} (Agapornis personatus), also called <b>masked</b> <b>lovebird</b> or eye ring lovebird, is a {{monotypic}} species of bird of the lovebird genus in the parrot family Psittaculidae. They are native to northeast Tanzania {{and have been}} introduced to Burundi and Kenya.|$|E
5000|$|Lovebirds are [...] {{in length}} and [...] in weight. They are among the {{smallest}} parrots, characterized by a stocky build, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, sharp beak. Wildtype lovebirds are mostly green {{with a variety of}} colors on their upper body, depending on the species. The Fischer's lovebird, black-cheeked lovebird, and the <b>masked</b> <b>lovebird</b> have a prominent white ring around their eyes. Many color mutant varieties have been produced by selective breeding of the species that are popular in aviculture.|$|E
25|$|Pridelands and African Savannah – Giraffes, zebras and {{ostriches}} are all {{found in}} one large enclosure which is first viewed from above on a boardwalk, while springbok and white rhino share the opposite enclosure. An expansive walk-through aviary located {{next to the}} giraffe enclosure is home to <b>masked</b> <b>lovebirds,</b> meerkats and leopard tortoises. This area also offers ground level views looking out over a watering hole to the giraffes and zebras, and is themed to resemble a rocky escarpment tumbling down onto the savannah. Continuing along the path, is the lion enclosure which is home to four female lions. The Pridelands area of the zoo also features Greater flamingos, Hamadryas baboons, two cheetah brothers and servals. An African themed cafe named 'The Watering Hole', is located in this precinct next to the lions and flamingos.|$|R
50|$|Breeding cages {{should be}} 400mm x 400mm x 500mm, or these birds can be housed in colonies, or have {{in some cases}} been kept at liberty. There was a mixed flock of <b>masked,</b> peach-faced <b>lovebird,</b> and a few hybrids near Napier, New Zealand {{for a number of}} years in the mid 2000s. There is also a small feral {{population}} in France, which contains the Blue mutant, and mixes with larger proportion of Fischer's lovebirds - also from aviary origin.|$|R
50|$|Tanzania {{features}} an African lion exhibit with 9 lions visible from a climate controlled observation building {{as well as}} a covered deck. Small exhibits that appear carved or surrounded by rock simulate a natural kopje; these include serval, bushbaby, meerkat, black-footed cat, rock hyrax, <b>masked</b> and Fischer's <b>lovebird,</b> bat-eared fox, and black-throated monitor. A log-themed bridge crosses to the black rhino exhibit and a top-notch 3 acre enclosure housing chimpanzees. The chimpanzee observation building allows guests to view a very large area for a troop of 12 chimps to play and explore, and allows visitors to become educated on chimpanzees with a connected classroom. This side of the African plains features Masai giraffes, Grant's zebras, gray crowned cranes, and ostriches. Nearby are some ground birds, kori bustard and secretary bird, leopard tortoises, a small house with slender-snouted crocodiles, and a hippo pool.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the species}} of lovebird, the female will carry nesting {{material}} into the nest in various ways. The peach-faced lovebird tucks nesting {{material in the}} feathers of its rump, while the <b>masked</b> <b>lovebird</b> carries nesting material back in its beak. Once the lovebirds start constructing their nest, mating will follow. During this time, the lovebirds will mate repeatedly. Eggs follow 3-5 days later. The female will spend hours inside her nesting box before eggs are laid. Once the first egg is laid, a new egg will follow every other day until the clutch is complete, typically at four to six eggs. Even without a nest or a male, lovebirds sometimes produce eggs.|$|E
40|$|The {{survey was}} carried out to know {{some aspects of the}} bird trade in Bali on May 2002, {{especially}} to observe the diversity and abundance of species of Psittacidae Family along with their problems. The survey was done by direct observations and interview to the traders in the Sanglah and Satria Bird Markets, Denpasar-Bali. The total of 80 spescies of birds were traded in Bali and most of them i. e. : 75 species or 1577 individuals were found in the Satria bird market, but only 37 species or 393 individuals traded in the Sanglah bird market. Psittacidae family was found more abundantly, i. e. : 428 individiuals in 13 species of parrots. Those spesies of parrots were: Violet-necked Lory (Eos squamata), Blue-streaked Lory (E. reticulata), Red Lory (E. bornea), Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus), Chattering Lory (Lorius garrulus), Cockatail Australia (Nymphicus hollandicus), Moustached Parrakeet (Psittacula alexandri), Peach-faced Lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis), Fischerâ€™s Lovebird (A. fischeri), <b>Masked</b> <b>Lovebird</b> (A. personata), Bali Hanging Parrot (Loriculus pusillus) and Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). The Rainbow Lorikeet was found more abundant than another species of parrots, but Bali or Javan Hanging Parrot was very rare. The most catching area of Psittacidae was about 45...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Microsporidia are single-celled, obligate intercellular parasites with a wide host range covering most invertebrate phyla and all five classes of vertebrates. Numerous reports have implicated Encephalitozoon hellem, a microsporidia organism first described in humans, as the causative agent of severe disease in immunocompromised patients. Enc. hellem has been recently identified in psittacine bird hosts using histolytic and molecular methods. This study was designed to initiate the investigation of microsporidial infection in a variety of asymptomatic psittacine birds, especially lovebirds. Cloacal smears and droppings were examined for the presence of spores using calcofluor white M 2 R stain as the primary screening technique. Indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using polyclonal antiserum to Encephalitozoon hellem was used to confirm positive and seceded age and species matched negative slides based on the calcofluor staining results. A total of 198 clinically normal lovebirds were surveyed including peach-faced (Agapornis roseicollis) <b>lovebirds</b> (113), <b>masked</b> (A. personata) <b>lovebirds</b> (32), and Fischer's (A. fischeri) lovebirds (53). Since Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease Virus (PBFDV) is possibly an immunosuppressive virus, 111 lovebirds were tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for virus at an independent commercial laboratory. Previously unreported exciting new data about subclinical microsporidial infections in avian hosts have been generated from this study including: (1) adaptation of methods from the medical literature for veterinary diagnostic use; (2) comparison of diagnostic methods for deletion of parasite spores; (3) calculation of the point prevalence of microsporidial spore shedding in three species of asymptomatic lovebirds and in lovebird flocks; (4) correlation of microsporidial shedding by lovebird species; (5) correlation of microsporidial shedding by lovebird age; and, (6) correlation of microsporidial spore shedding with PBFDV inferiors. These data indicate that microsporidial infections are currently under-diagnosed in healthy psittacine birds. Further investigation will determine if birds serve as a reservoir for zoonotic transmission of Enc. hellem...|$|R
