5|$|Another {{widespread}} and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes {{a layer of}} egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a relatively recent innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton was consumed {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E

5|$|Surface gratings, {{consisting}} on ordered surface features due {{exposure of}} ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat. The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E
5|$|With common {{ingredients}} including the olive, wheat, and grape; a shared climate; {{and a long}} period for cultural exchange, it might be expected that a single, pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed. Certain items, such as olive oil, bread, wine, roast lamb or mutton (for example, Maghreb méchoui, Greek kleftiko and souvlaki, Turkish shish kebab), bottarga, and stews of <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> vegetables and tomato (such as Spanish andrajos, French estouffade à la Provençale, Italian ciambotta, Turkish buğu kebabı), are indeed found all around the Mediterranean. Despite this, however, the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines, from the Maghreb, Levant and Ottoman to the Italian, French, and Spanish. Each of those, in turn, has national and provincial variations.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of <b>meat,</b> <b>with</b> no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E

25|$|Pygmies, the {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of the}} Congo, are generally hunter-gatherers.

25|$|Various {{kinds of}} pulses or legumes, make up an {{important}} part of Pakistani cuisine. While lentils (called daal) and chickpeas (called channa) are popular ingredients in homestyle cooking, they are traditionally considered to be inexpensive food sources. Because of this reason, they are typically not served to guests who are invited for dinner or during special occasions. Combining <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> lentils and pulses, whether in simple preparations or in elaborate dishes such as haleem, is also a distinctively Pakistani touch not commonly seen in neighbouring India, where a substantial number of its population are vegetarians.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, Taiwan {{became the}} first Asian country to officially ban the {{consumption}} of dog and cat meat as well as jail time for those who kill and torture animals. The Animal Protection Act amendments approved by the Legislative Yuan aims to punish the sale, purchase or consumption of dog or cat <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> fines ranging from NT$50,000 to NT$2 million. The amendments also stiffen punishment for those who intentionally harm animals to a maximum two years' imprisonment and fines of NT$200,000 to NT$2 million.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{differences}} in opinion within the raw feeding community. Issues include {{the question of}} whether dogs are omnivores or carnivores. Also, whether cats and dogs need plant material in their diet, and if so, the proportion of such material. The safety of whole bones is also a frequent topic of discussion. Recipes that are advocated range from those that include vegetables and grains, to a minimalist approach using only meat, bones, organ meat, and necessary supplements such as the <b>Meat</b> <b>with</b> Bone diet advocated by Michelle T.

25|$|Because {{of a mass}} {{emigration}} of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti {{became a}} popular take-out dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken curry, potatoes, a boiled egg and various vegetables, most notably the kousenband or yardlong bean. Another variation includes shrimp and aubergine. The <b>meat</b> <b>with</b> gravy, potatoes, egg and yardlong beans are served {{side by side on}} a plate, with the aloo puri folded in fours on top.

25|$|Kashrut: As {{indicated}} in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a young goat {{may not be}} boiled in its mother's milk.
