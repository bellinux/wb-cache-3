40|$|The Second Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS II) was {{conducted}} in eastern Texas during 2005 and 2006. This 2 -year study included an intensive field campaign, TexAQS 2006 /Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric Composition and Climate Study (GoMACCS), conducted in August–October 2006. The results reported in this special journal section are based on observations collected on four aircraft, one research vessel, networks of ground-based air quality and meteorological (surface and radar wind profiler) sites in eastern Texas, a balloon-borne ozonesonde-radiosonde network (part of Intercontinental Transport Experiment Ozonesonde Network Study (IONS- 06)), and satellites. This overview paper provides operational and logistical information for those platforms and sites, summarizes the principal findings and conclusions that have thus far been drawn from the results, and directs readers to appropriate papers for the full analysis. Two of these findings deserve particular emphasis. First, despite decreases in actual emissions of highly reactive volatile organic compounds (HRVOC) and some improvements in inventory estimates since the TexAQS 2000 study, the current Houston area emission inventories still underestimate HRVOC emissions by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Second, the background ozone in eastern Texas, which represents the <b>minimum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> that is likely achievable through only local controls, can approach or exceed the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppbv for an 8 -h average. These findings have broad implications for air quality control strategies in eastern Texas...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics on a vast {{range of}} spatial and {{temporal}} scales, from individual convective plumes to planetary-scale circulations, {{play a role in}} driving the temperature variability in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Here, we aim to better quantify the deep convective temperature signal within the TTL using multiple datasets. First, we investigate the link between ozone and temperature in the TTL using the Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes (SHADOZ) dataset. Low ozone concentrations in the TTL are indicative of deep convective transport from the boundary layer. We confirm the usefulness of ozone as an indicator of deep convection by identifying a typical temperature signal associated with reduced ozone events: an anomalously warm mid to upper troposphere and an anomalously cold upper TTL. We quantify these temperature signals using two diagnostics: (1) the "ozone minimum" diagnostic, which has been used in previous studies and identifies the upper tropospheric <b>minimum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> as a proxy for the level of main convective outflow; and (2) the "ozone mixing height", which we introduce in order to identify the maximum altitude in a vertical ozone profile up to which reduced ozone concentrations, typical of transport from the boundary layer are observed. Results indicate that the ozone mixing height diagnostic better separates profiles with convective influence than the ozone minimum diagnostic. Next, we collocate deep convective clouds identified by CloudSat 2 B-CLDCLASS with temperature profiles based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) Global Position System (GPS) radio occultations. We find a robust large-scale deep convective TTL temperature signal, that is persistent in time. However, it is only the convective events that penetrate into the upper half of the TTL that {{have a significant impact on}} TTL temperature. A distinct seasonal difference in the spatial scale and the persistence of the temperature signal is identified. Deep-convective cloud top heights are on average found to be well described by the level of neutral buoyancy...|$|E

30|$|The {{importance}} {{of improving the}} SSI forcing estimates {{can be seen from}} climate model experiments, which have estimated the atmospheric impact of the larger SORCE SSI variability in comparison to previously existing SSI estimates. Haigh et al. ([2010]) showed that the difference between near solar maximum and solar <b>minimum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the middle stratosphere was more than doubled when using the SORCE spectrum, while in the upper stratosphere, the impact was opposite to those from the prevailing SSI model inputs. A further study by Ineson et al. ([2011]) suggested that if the SORCE SSI observations were the true representation of the UV variability, regional winter climate in the Northern Hemisphere could be significantly affected by the solar cycle, with little impact on global average temperatures. The currently available SSI forcing data sets are summarised by Ermolli et al. ([2013]). They also report on the differences in the atmospheric impact from the most commonly used SSI data set in current climate model simulations, between the NRLSSI (Lean [2000]) and the SORCE SSI data. The results show that the solar cycle difference in atmospheric heating is much larger (by a factor of 2) and the resulting stratospheric temperature differences more pronounced when the SORCE SSI data is used. Merkel et al. ([2011]) used the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) to compare the solar ozone response to the SORCE SSI observations and the NRLSSI (Lean [2000]) reconstructions and extended their focus to the mesospheric responses, whereas previous studies mainly focused on the stratosphere. The comparison of the model results to 8 years of satellite ozone observations showed that the observed solar cycle variation in ozone at higher altitudes was better captured by the simulations using the SORCE SSI variability than the simulations using the NRLSSI reconstruction. However, the results have to be handled with care as they not even include one full solar cycle. Finally, Ermolli et al. ([2013]) highlight that while the solar-induced changes were of minor importance for global average temperatures, they lead to large regional responses.|$|R

40|$|Thirteen {{years of}} ozone {{soundings}} at the Antarctic Belgrano II station (78 ° S, 34. 6 ° W) have been analysed {{to establish a}} climatology of stratospheric ozone and temperature over the area. The station is inside the polar vortex {{during the period of}} development of chemical ozone depletion. Weekly periodic profiles provide a suitable database for seasonal characterization of the evolution of stratospheric ozone, especially valuable during wintertime, when satellites and ground-based instruments based on solar radiation are not available. The work is focused on ozone loss rate variability (August–October) and its recovery (November–December) at different layers identified according to the severity of ozone loss. The time window selected for the calculations covers the phase of a quasi-linear ozone reduction, around day 220 (mid-August) to day 273 (end of September). Decrease of the total ozone column over Belgrano during spring is highly dependent on the meteorological conditions. Largest depletions (up to 59 %) are reached in coldest years, while warm winters exhibit significantly lower ozone loss (20 %). It has been found that about 11 % of the total O 3 loss, in the layer where maximum depletion occurs, takes place before sunlight has arrived, as a result of transport to Belgrano of air from a somewhat lower latitude, {{near the edge of the}} polar vortex, providing evidence of mixing inside the vortex. Spatial homogeneity of the vortex has been examined by comparing Belgrano results with those previously obtained for South Pole station (SPS) for the same altitude range and for 9 yr of overlapping data. Results show more than 25 % higher ozone loss rate at SPS than at Belgrano. The behaviour can be explained taking into account (i) the transport to both stations of air from a somewhat lower latitude, near the edge of the polar vortex, where sunlight reappears sooner, resulting in earlier depletion of ozone, and (ii) the accumulated hours of sunlight, which become much greater at the South Pole after the spring equinox. According to the variability of the ozone hole recovery, a clear connection between the timing of the breakup of the vortex and the monthly ozone content was found. <b>Minimum</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> of 57 DU in the 12 – 24 km layer remained in November, when the vortex is more persistent, while in years when the final stratospheric warming took place "very early", mean integrated ozone rose by up to 160 – 180 DU...|$|E

Episodes when the surface <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> is essentially zero last up to several days during this time of year. In the Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP-I and AGASP-II) in 1983 and 1986, it was found that <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> often showed a very steep gradient in altitude with very low values near the surface.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that hydrocarbon species and other air pollutants which accumulate at low and high <b>concentrations</b> of <b>ozone</b> are more directly associated with childhood wheezy episodes than ozone.  METHODS—Prospective observational study over 1  year set in the Lewisham district of south east London. The daily attendance rate of children with acute wheeze at the {{accident and emergency department}} of Lewisham Hospital was related to local measurements of ozone, hydrocarbon species, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and small particulate matter with diameter < 10 µm (PM 10).  RESULTS—An inverse relation was found between the air pollutants and ozone. After seasonal and meteorological adjustment a non-linear U shaped trend was found between incidence of wheeze and ozone. The trend was significant in children < 2 years of age but not in older children. In the younger age group, after adjustment for season, temperature, wind speed, and respiratory infection, the incidence relative to that at the mean daily <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> of 32. 7  µg/m 3, was estimated to increase by 65 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 22 % to 122 %) at an <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> of 5  µg/m 3 (1. 5  SDs below the mean) and by 63 % (95 %CI − 6 % to 184 %) at 80  µg/m 3 (2. 5  SDs above the mean). For several hydrocarbons there were significant positive linear relations found, again in children < 2 years of age but not older children. For benzene, the incidence increased by 8 % (95 % CI 2  to 13 %) per SD (SD 2. 8  µg/m 3) increase in benzene concentration. A same day association between incidence and ozone was found to be the most significant but for other pollutants a lag of 2  days gave the most significant associations. No significant association was found for the non-hydrocarbon pollutants including SO 2, NO 2, and PM 10.  CONCLUSIONS—A U shaped relation was found between ozone and the incidence of wheezy episodes in young children. Certain hydrocarbon pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere when <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> are low, and are associated with childhood wheezy episodes.

40|$|The final warming date of {{the polar}} vortex is a key {{component}} of Southern Hemisphere stratospheric and tropospheric variability in spring and summer. We examine the effect of external forcings on Southern Hemisphere final warming date, and the sensitivity of any projected changes to model representation of the stratosphere. Final warming date is calculated using a temperature-based diagnostic for ensembles of high- and low-top CMIP 5 models, under the CMIP 5 historical, RCP 4. 5, and RCP 8. 5 forcing scenarios. The final warming date in the models is generally too late in comparison with those from reanalyses: around two weeks too late in the low-top ensemble, and around one week too late in the high-top ensemble. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is used to analyse past and future change in final warming date. Both the low- and high-top ensemble show characteristic behaviour expected in response to changes in greenhouse gas and stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> In both ensembles, under both scenarios, an increase in final warming date is seen between 1850 and 2100, with the latest dates occurring in the early twenty-first century, associated with the <b>minimum</b> in stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in this period. However, this response is more pronounced in the high-top ensemble.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} a {{reaction}} of dissolved ozone in an alkaline water solution with hydrogen peroxide was evaluated. Assays were conducted in a bubble column with a gaseous <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> (mixed with oxygen) at 21 and 27 g m- 3. Concentration curve of dissolved ozone in the liquid revealed an <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> peak in the liquid phase, subsequent decreasing concentration and constant maintenance in the stationary phase. Highest concentration was not detected for the lowest <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> in the gaseous phase. Peak {{was due to the}} self-decomposition of ozone in the liquid phase and the production of hydrogen peroxide. The latter reacted with molecular dissolved ozone and decreased <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> after maximum concentration...|$|R

High resolution ozone profiles {{were provided by}} EUMETSAT. In order to verify near surface <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> obtained from satellite data, a comparison was performed with observations at ground stations. It was shown that the two measurements were consistent, that is the time series of satellite data describe well seasonal changes and are also appropriate for regional air pollution assessment. However, there are limitations on using satellite data for predicting instant <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> and urban pollution. Spatial distributions of mean annual and seasonal <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were derived for the Baikal region. These evidence distinct seasonality in surface <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> with maxima and minima falling on spring and autumn months, respectively, throughout the entire region. According to the satellite data, <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in remote mountainous areas are higher in comparison with those from industrial regions of Angara and Selenga river valleys...|$|R
40|$|Garcia and Soloman (1987) {{have noted}} that the October monthly mean <b>minimum</b> total <b>ozone</b> amounts south of 30 S were {{modulated}} by a quasibiennial oscillation (QBO) signal. The precise mechanism behind this effect, however, is unclear. Is the modulation {{brought about by the}} circulation-produced QBO signal in the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> itself, or does the temperature QBO modulate the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), leading to changes in the chemically induced Antarctic spring ozone decline rate. Or is some other phenomenon involved. To investigate the means through which the QBO effect occurs, a series of correlation studies has been made between polar ozone and QBO signal in ozone and temperature...|$|R

From 1979 to 1992 the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> apparently increased by 1. 48 ± 0. 40 percent per year or 0. 21 ± 0. 06 Dobson unit per year over South America and the surrounding oceans.

40|$|Surface <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Mexico City {{frequently}} {{exceed the}} Mexican standard and have proven difficult to forecast due {{to changes in}} meteorological conditions at its tropical location. The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is largely responsible for intraseasonal variability in the tropics. Circulation patterns in the lower and upper troposphere and precipitation {{are associated with the}} oscillation as it progresses eastward around the planet. It is typically described by phases (labeled 1 through 8), which correspond to the broad longitudinal location of the active component of the oscillation with enhanced precipitation. In this study we evaluate the intraseasonal variability of winter and summer surface <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Mexico City, which was investigated over the period 1986 – 2014 to determine if there is a modulation by the MJO that would aid in the forecast of high-pollution episodes. Over 1   000   000 hourly observations of surface ozone from five stations around the metropolitan area were standardized and then binned by active phase of the MJO, with phase determined using the real-time multivariate MJO index. Highest winter <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were found in Mexico City on days when the MJO was active and in phase  2 (over the Indian Ocean), and highest summer <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were found on days when the MJO was active and in phase  6 (over the western Pacific Ocean). Lowest winter <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were found during active MJO phase  8 (over the eastern Pacific Ocean), and lowest summer <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were found during active MJO phase  1 (over the Atlantic Ocean). Anomalies of reanalysis-based cloud cover and UV-B radiation supported the observed variability in surface ozone in both summer and winter: MJO phases with highest <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> had largest positive UV-B radiation anomalies and lowest cloud-cover fraction, while phases with lowest <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> had largest negative UV-B radiation anomalies and highest cloud-cover fraction. Furthermore, geopotential height anomalies at 250  hPa favoring reduced cloudiness, and thus elevated surface ozone, were found in both seasons during MJO phases with above-normal <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Similar height anomalies at 250  hPa favoring enhanced cloudiness, and thus reduced surface ozone, were found in both seasons during MJO phases with below-normal <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations.</b> These anomalies confirm a physical pathway for MJO modulation of surface ozone via modulation of the upper troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Molecular oxygen dayglow {{emissions}} {{arise in}} part from processes related to the Hartley band photolysis of ozone. It is therefore possible to derive daytime <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> from measurements of the volume emission rate of either dayglow. The accuracy to which the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> can be inferred depends on the accuracy to which numerous kinetic and spectroscopic rate constants are known, including rates which describe the excitation of molecular oxygen by processes that {{are not related to}} the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration.</b> We find that several key rate constants must be known to better than 7 percent accuracy in order to achieve an inferred <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> accurate to 15 percent from measurements of either dayglow.

40|$|A {{rigorous}} {{method is}} presented {{for determining the}} <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> in the onshore flow of marine air at the North American west coast. By combining the data available from all marine boundary layer sites with simultaneous wind data, decadal temporal trends of MBL <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in all seasons are established with high precision. The average springtime temporal trend {{over the past two}} decades is 0. 46 ppbv/yr with a 95 % confidence limit of 0. 13 ppbv/yr, and statistically significant trends are found for all seasons except autumn, which does have a significantly smaller trend than other seasons. The average trend in mean annual <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> is 0. 34 &plusmn; 0. 09 ppbv/yr. These decadal trends at the North American west coast present a striking comparison and contrast with the trends reported for the European west coast at Mace Head, Ireland. The trends in the winter, spring and summer seasons compare well at the two locations, while the Mace Head trend is significantly greater in autumn. Even though the trends are similar, the absolute <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> differ markedly, with the marine air arriving at Europe in all seasons containing 7 &plusmn; 2 ppbv higher <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> than marine air arriving at North America. Further, the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> at the North American west coast show no indication for stabilizing as has been reported for Mace Head. In a larger historical context the background boundary layer <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> over the 130 years covered by available data have increased substantially (by a factor of two to three), and this increase continues at present, at least in the marine boundary layer (MBL) of the Pacific coast region of North America. The reproduction of the increasing trends in MBL <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{over the past two decades}} as well as the difference in the <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> between the two coastal regions will present a significant challenge for global chemical transport models. Further, the ability of the models to at least semi-quantitatively reproduce the longer-term, historical trends may an even greater challenge...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{have been}} {{monitored}} at the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiment Site (GLEES) in the Snowy Range of the Medicine Bow Mountains 55 km west of Laramie, Wyoming, USA. The site {{is located at}} 3, 186 m elevation in a large subalpine meadow of a mature subalpine forest near timberline. Continuous ozone and meteorological monitoring {{are a part of}} the GLEES research to determine the effects of atmospheric deposition on alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Ozone monitoring has shown specific summer and winter diel ozone distribution patterns, typical of remote, rural, high elevation sites. The data show relatively high background <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> with little diel variation in winter. Stratospheric intrusions contribute to the ground-level <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the spring. Summer ozone patterns show diurnal photochemical peaks and significant night time concentrations suggesting lack of scavenging. The relationship of modeled leaf stomatal conductances, boundary layer conductances, canopy conductances and photosynthesis rates to ambient <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> and measured <b>ozone</b> flux was examined by using regression analysis. <b>Ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> were also compared with wind, radiation, temperature, and humidity conditions at the site by using regression analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the characteristics of <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> based on the value of Hurst coefficient. The Hurst coefficient, denoted as H, is used to explain the long-term degree of persistency in <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> in Malaysia. This paper investigates the scaling properties and persistency of <b>ozone</b> <b>concentrations</b> at six selected air quality monitoring stations in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Daily mean for the hourly data of <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> from 1998 - 2006 is considered in this study. In describing the statistical properties, several related statistics are identified and the autocorrelation functions of the observed data were plotted. The anomaly method is used to deseasonalise the seasonal variation and the natural non-stationary of the data. Next, the persistency of <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> is determined by using the scaling analysis, namely Dispersional Ratio Method. This method considers two dispersion measures, that is the range and variance. The result shows that there are two different scaling regions, separated by a critical time scale, ncwhich is approximately 90 days. For shorter time scale (n nc) where the H values are between 0. 5 < H < 1 at all monitoring stations. These findings provide information on scaling behaviour and persistence in <b>ozone</b> <b>concentration</b> in the ambient air of Klang Valley, Malaysia...|$|R
