5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E

25|$|Apophysomyces variabilis {{is one of}} four {{species in}} the genus Apophysomyces, which also {{includes}} A. elegans, A. ossiformis, and A. trapeziformis. In the past, Apophysomyces elegans was believed to be the species responsible for most cases of cutaneous mucormycosis attributed to Apophysomyces, but recently, some of the other species {{have been shown to be}} important in human infection. Since the new species have only recently been recognized, <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned about their relative clinical importance, comparative virulence, epidemiology, and anti-fungal drug susceptibilities.|$|E

25|$|Ireland was {{inhabited}} sometime {{shortly after}} {{the ending of the}} last Ice Age, approximately 10,000 – 8000 BC Conservative estimates place the arrival of the first humans in County Wexford as occurring between 5000 BC – 3000 BC, referred to as the Mesolithic period in Ireland, though they may have arrived slightly earlier. Its proximity to Britain and Europe means that County Wexford {{was probably one of the}} earliest areas of Ireland to be inhabited by humans. Evidence of this period is scarce and <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered through Archaeology and Research.|$|E

500|$|The {{paper has}} been {{questioned}} by palaeontologists such as Andrea Cau and Thomas Holtz, who point out that feathers in theropod dinosaurs can grow in the same {{parts of the body}} as scales (as seen in Juravenator), and thus the presence of scales does not actually eliminate the presence of feathers from that part of the body. Furthermore, feathers are delicate structures which can be very easily lost due to taphonomic factors. Paleontologist Mark Witton was warmer to the study, suggesting [...] "we have to concede a scalier appearance than many of us thought likely", while also highlighting that <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> determined about tyrannosaurid life appearance. Though acknowledging the role that taphonomy plays in interpreting dinosaur skin, Witton points out that the scale impressions are high quality, consistent in form across all patches, and show no obvious evidence of fibre impressions or spaces for filament attachment, despite the preservation of submillimeter scales. More variation and evidence of deformation might be expected if taphonomy had distorted the specimens in a significant way.|$|E
500|$|This {{meeting was}} mostly {{symbolic}} {{and did not}} have any concrete proposals or results. Nevertheless, some policies or earlier decisions were reaffirmed or emphasized. First of all, the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) Heads of State and Government met with President Hamid Karzai of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan and discussed the progress in that country, and recognized the valuable role played by both Allies and Partners who make up the ISAF, but also emphasized that <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done for Afghanistan to become a peaceful and stable country, fully integrated into the international community. Secondly, the commitment of the Euro-Atlantic community to peace, security and stability in the Balkans was reaffirmed. Further, the presence of the Heads of State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro at their meeting as observers was welcomed, and these leaders were urged them to meet the outstanding conditions set for Partnership for Peace membership by Allies. Thirdly, the resolve to fight terrorism was reaffirmed and [...] some initiatives aimed at increasing the EAPC’s contribution in this fight were taken, thereby endorsing the further implementation of the Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{processes}} are {{also involved in}} the aurora, and <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an [...] "overflow" [...] along magnetic field lines of the copious [...] "ring current" [...] ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1942 {{introduction}} to the multi-volume Checklist of Recorded Folk Song in the Library of Congress, Harold Spivacke, Chief of the Library of Congress's Division of Music, wrote:Many hard-working and expert folklorists cooperated in the accumulation of this material, but in the main {{the development of the}} Archive of American Folk Song represents the work of two men, John and Alan Lomax. Starting in 1933, the Lomaxes, father and son, traveled tens of thousands of miles, endured many hardships, exercised great patience and tact to win the confidence and friendship of hundreds of singers in order to bring to the Library of Congress records of the voices of countless interesting people they met on the way. Very <b>much</b> <b>remains</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to make our Archive truly representative of all the people, but the country owes a debt of gratitude to these two men for the excellent foundation laid for future work in this field.... The Lomaxes received much help in their expeditions from many interested folklorists, some of whom have made important contributions to the Archive as a result of independent expeditions of their own.
