5000|$|The Cedar Creek to North Tamborine section {{traverses}} very steep hillsides {{and deep}} gullies and retains its original alignment {{with a large}} [...] "S" [...] bend winding up the hill. As it has a steep gradient, the road has been made by cutting into the hillside and depositing the spoil down hill to make a wider road bed and ease construction problems. Where the cliff has been cut back, some rock walls have been built to stop the bank eroding onto the road and blocking it. Below the road dry stone rock walls, i.e. walls that have no <b>mortar</b> <b>joining</b> the stones, cover the steep embankments to prevent the road surface sliding downhill. To prevent the heavy rainfall washing the road away, culverts under the road direct the water away from the road surface.

To ensure the sustainability of a building one of the essential condition is to use local materials with reduced embodied energy, low cost and good appearance. In case of new buildings masonry works can be durable and sustainable {{in the same time}} if all the materials (units and mortars) used to realise them have the similar characteristics (mineralogical composition, texture, structure, physical and mechanical properties). The study was performed considering tuffs as masonry units, mortar based on these tuffs (both in substitution of cement and sand), and classical <b>mortar</b> as <b>joining</b> together in order to realise a homogeneous structure...|$|R

30|$|The ‘vertical zigzag groupings’ {{seem to be}} {{the result}} of our global {{perception}} of the pattern, while the near-horizontal diverging/converging’ mortar lines are a local percept arising from a local focus on the <b>mortar</b> lines <b>joining</b> different tiles in adjacent rows. Therefore, there is a simultaneous perception of both groupings due to rapid changes in the focus point of the eye. Even at a focal view, due to eccentricity relation of RGCs sizes and distance to the fovea, we still have this multiscale retinal encoding of the pattern. Although we might get an impression of either the ‘local or global percept’ of the pattern in an instance of time, it is more likely that the global percept would carry more weight in the final perception of the illusion pattern, but interestingly, even at coarse scales, where tiles are not connected through the mortar lines, the wedge shape of tiles provides the same stable direction for the divergence/convergence percept of the mortar lines in the DoG edge map.|$|R
50|$|The PCAPP EDS started {{processing}} on March 18 {{with the}} elimination of Department of Transportation (DOT) bottles which contain chemical agent drained from selected munitions {{over the years to}} assess the condition of the stockpile. On April 8, the first munitions were successfully processed. In June, operators at the PCAPP EDS took things up a notch with the introduction of 4.2-inch mortars into the destruction process. The first three <b>mortars</b> were <b>joined</b> by three 105 mm projectiles. All were safely detonated in the vessel on June 18. On July 16, the first 155 mm projectiles from Pueblo’s stockpile were safely destroyed in the PCAPP EDS. The PCAPP EDS completed its first campaign in February 2016, destroying 549 munitions that leaked or were sampled in the past and 11 bottles containing mustard agent. It will remain on stand-by to destroy any munitions rejected for automated processing in the main plant due to their condition.|$|R
5000|$|Frazer {{arrived in}} 1868 and started work on {{industrial}} structures, {{none of which}} remain. He built almost exclusively with basalt at that time, a black or grey rock available in the local hills. Basalt is a hard volcanic rock, it weathers very well, but is somewhat difficult to cut. Frazer and his masons split and chiseled the stone, making a roughly squared face. These blocks were set in courses on the building facades that faced the streets. The blocks were then finished around the edges with black-dyed <b>mortar</b> and <b>joined</b> by a white mortar joint, giving a squared look to the slightly irregular edges. The dressed stone, known as Ashlar masonry, was used only for the outer shell of the stone walls, {{the rest of the}} wall was made of infilled rubble stone, forming a wall with a total thickness of about 18 inches. After a quarry for volcanic tuff, also known as pick rock, opened in 1881, Frazer switched to that softer, easier to work material.|$|R
40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} archaeometric study {{concerning the}} Amtoudi Agadir, declared World Cultural Heritage (northern {{border of the}} Sahara Desert, southern Morocco), was performed consisting in lithostratigraphic reconstruction of the bedrock, diagnosis of constitutive materials (stones, mortars, and wooden elements), and analyses of constructive techniques and architectonic elements (load-bearing and supported structural elements). The medieval agadir (fortified granary) was built directly on a rocky piton with rocks of the substratum with traditional materials and ancestral techniques. The stones have been identified and classified into four petrofacies. Degradation such as biological attacks, chromatic alteration, erosion, exfoliation, and fissuration on the stones have been characterized. Recommendations for conservation and maintenance of the rocks have been proposed in compatibility with the environment. Load-bearing (masonry walls) and supported structural elements (ceiling structures) have also been studied in order to define their stability. Worst cases of 1 - and 2 -height walls, together with worst cases of the wooden or stone ceiling structures have been analyzed. Materials, techniques, and dimensions have been characterized for possible failures to shearing, bending, and flexural buckling as guide for maintenance of the agadir. The main problems of the walls derive from excessively thin construction {{with a lack of}} interlocking of the rocks and a diminished proportion or quality of <b>mortar</b> <b>joining</b> the rocks due to washing. It has been recommended to avoid thicknesses lower than 0. 4 m for 2 -height walls and lower than 0. 3 m for 1 -height walls. A nominal load has been estimated in the worst case (with wooden elements) for the ceiling structures of about 7. 0 KN/m 2. The calculations have indicated that a 25 % increase over the nominal load would imply a risk of failure, the use of stone elements being preferable over wooden ones. With these propositions for the Amtoudi Agadir, new management and prospects for cultural tourism are feasible. This research was supported by Urbino University found (Resp. F.

40|$|Different scale approaches, micromechanical, {{multiscale}} and macromechanical or phenomenological, {{are presented}} {{to study the}} structural response of masonry elements. First, a micromechanical model is introduced and the masonry {{is considered to be}} a heterogeneous material, made of <b>mortar</b> and bricks <b>joined</b> by interfaces, where the mortarbrick decohesion mechanisms occur. To this end, a special interface model combining damage and friction is proposed. Then, two multiscale procedures are presented, that consider regular arrangements of bricks and mortar, modeled by nonlinear constitutive laws which account for damage and friction effects. A homogenization technique is developed to derive two different equivalent continuum models at the macro-level, a micropolar Cosserat continuum and a nonlocal Cauchy model. Finally, a macromechanical model, based on the adoption of a classical No-Tension Material (NTM) model, and on the presence of irreversible crushing strains, is proposed. A zero tensile strength is assumed, thus fracture strains arise when the stress is zero. Moreover, an elastoplastic model is considered for the material response in compression. Numerical applications are performed on a masonry arch and two masonry panels, by adopting the three approaches presented. Comparisons with experimental outcomes, published elsewhere, are performed...|$|R
40|$|Refractory Mortar is {{a mixture}} of fine {{particles}} which are used {{in the form of a}} paste to bind refractory bricks after the addition of water to the mixture. The composition and chemistry of the mortar need to be similar to that of the brick to be <b>joined</b> by the <b>mortar.</b> The service life of a refractory lining not only depends on the properties bricks but also on joints made by mortar. More precisely to say mortar joints in a refractory walls is the weakest part of the wall. Mortars used to bind the bricks are generally low cost materials as compared to bricks. But its importance is much more than brick. Because it forms the lining between the refractory bricks;if failure occurs,it causes the damage of the whole refractory lining. In the present study,attempts have been made to develop 45 % Al 2 O 3 <b>mortar</b> to <b>join</b> 45 - 50 % alumina bricks with suitable binder. Chinese bauxite,fire clay grog, and sillimanite sand have been used as aggregates to prepare the mortar. Three binders chosen are bentonite, plastic clay and sodium silicate liquid. Attempt has been made to study the effect of binders on the physical and mechanical properties of the mortar thus developed. Analysis has been done by considering all the physical and mechanical properties of the mortar found by using different binders in different percentage. It has been found by using bentonite as a binder that, all the mechanical properties of the mortar increases with increase in bentonite content also with increase in temperature. It is also concluded that by using plastic clay as a binding agent, mechanical also physical behaviour of mortar increases with increase in plastic clay content. By using sodium silicate liquid as a binder all the mechanical properties of the mortar specially bond strength of mortar increases drastically with increase in temperature also with sodium silicate liquid content as compared to other binders studied.
