5|$|In {{his article}} of 2002, Alan A. Stone, {{who as a}} member of team had {{examined}} Pyotr Grigorenko and found him mentally healthy in 1979, disregarded the findings of the World Psychiatric Association and the later avowal of Soviet psychiatrists themselves and put forward the academically revisionist theory that there was no political abuse of psychiatry as a tool against pacific dissidence in the former USSR. He asserted {{that it was time for}} psychiatry in the Western countries to reconsider the supposedly documented accounts of political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR in the hope of discovering that Soviet psychiatrists were more deserving of sympathy than condemnation. In Stone's words, he believes that Snezhnevsky was wrongly condemned by critics. According to Stone, one of the first points the Soviet psychiatrists who have been condemned for unethical political abuse of psychiatry <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the revolution is the greatest good for the greatest number, the greatest piece of social justice, and the greatest beneficence imaginable in the twentieth century. In the Western view, the ethical compass of the Soviet psychiatrists begins to wander when they act in the service of this greatest beneficence.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian High Court granted full de jure {{recognition}} to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists {{who had been a}} month earlier convicted [...] of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council [...] "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that [...] "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".|$|E
500|$|Beadle and his judges granted full de jure {{recognition}} to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black nationalists who one month earlier {{had been convicted of}} terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council [...] "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that as he could not countenance a legal vacuum, the only alternative was the 1965 constitution.

UDI, the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered de jure by the Rhodesian legal system.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew George submits {{that the}} Genesis flood {{narrative}} matches that in Gilgamesh so closely that [...] "few doubt" [...] that it derives from a Mesopotamian account. What is particularly noticeable {{is the way}} the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale [...] "point by point and in the same order", even when the story permits other alternatives. In a 2001 Torah commentary released on behalf of the Conservative Movement of Judaism, rabbinic scholar Robert Wexler stated: [...] "The most likely assumption we can <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common tradition about the flood that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the retelling." [...] Ziusudra, Utnapishtim and Noah are the respective heroes of the Sumerian, Akkadian and biblical flood legends of the ancient Near East.|$|E

6000|$|If we must {{recommend}} one of Miss Austen's novels, perhaps Pride and Prejudice is {{the most}} typical; but {{there is very little}} to justify this choice when the alternative is Northanger Abbey, or Emma, or Sense and Sensibility, or Persuasion, or Mansfield Park. All are good; the most definite stricture that one can safely <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mansfield Park is not so good as the others. Four of the novels are confined to country parishes; but in Northanger Abbey and Persuasion the horizon is broadened to include a watering place, whither genteel folk went [...] "to take the air." ...|$|E

The only safe surmise to <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he would not think as Mr. Razumov thought at this crisis of his fate. He would not have an hereditary and personal knowledge or the means by which historical autocracy represses ideas, guards its power, and defends its existence. By an act of mental extravagance he might imagine himself arbitrarily thrown into prison, but it would never occur to him unless he were delirious (and perhaps not even then) that he could be beaten with whips as a practical measure either of investigation or of punishment.|$|E
