5000|$|Leakage {{inductance}} {{can be an}} undesirable property, as {{it causes}} the voltage to change with loading. [...] In many cases it is useful. Leakage inductance has the useful effect of limiting the current flows in a transformer (and load) without itself dissipating power (excepting the usual non-ideal transformer losses). Transformers are generally designed to have a specific value of leakage inductance such that the leakage reactance created by this inductance is a specific value at the desired frequency of operation.Commercial transformers are usually designed with a short-circuit leakage reactance impedance of between 3% and 10%. If the load is resistive and the leakage reactance is small (<10%) the output voltage will not drop by more than 0.5% at full load, ignoring other resistances and losses. High leakage reactance transformers are used for some negative resistance applications, such as neon signs, where a voltage amplification (transformer action) is required as well as current limiting. In this case the leakage reactance is usually 100% of full load impedance, so even if the transformer is shorted out {{it will not be}} damaged. Without the leakage inductance, the negative resistance characteristic of these gas discharge lamps would cause them to conduct excessive current and be destroyed. Transformers with variable leakage inductance are used to control the current in arc <b>welding</b> <b>sets.</b> In these cases, the leakage inductance limits the current flow to the desired magnitude.|$|R

40|$|Twin-wire welding based {{additive}} manufacturing (TWAM) {{is a novel}} {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) process for creating metallic objects using {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW). The twin-wire welding, apart from offering higher deposition rates, also makes it possible to create gradient objects by the use of dissimilar filler wires. However, there is necessity to manage the thermal stresses while depositing multiple layers on the substrate plate; {{this is one of the}} major challenges to be addressed. With the help of finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental methods, this paper studies the effect of area-filling paths on the residual stresses developed during weld-deposition. Three area-filling patterns viz. raster, spiral-in, and spiral-out were chosen. FEA for these three patterns was done using ANSYS Mechanical APDL. The twin-wire arc weld-deposition was modeled as a set of two moving heat sources separated at a fixed distance. The deposited material was activated by element birth method once the arc passes over a location, simulating the weld material deposition. The temperature gradient induced residual stresses produced during and post material deposition was predicted using passively coupled thermo-mechanical simulations. For validation, the weld-deposition experiments were done using twin-wire GMAW <b>welding</b> <b>set</b> up, and residual stresses were measured using an X-ray diffraction (XRD) system. Temperature distribution plays a critical role in the evolution of the residual stresses during weld-deposition. Hence, two metrics viz., thermal mismatch profile, and secant-temperature rate were introduced to quantify preheat and conduction. It was observed that raster patterns had the lowest thermal mismatch and secant rates resulting in the lowest residual stresses of the three area-fill patterns. Residual stresses from experiments has reasonable correlation with those obtained from elastic-FE simulations in order as well as trend and provide valuable insights into the evolution of the stresses for various area-fill patterns in TWAM...|$|R
