50|$|It was {{not only}} in design and {{commemorative}} purpose that this issue proved a watershed in U. S. stamp history. The Columbians, like all previous U. S. stamps, had been produced by private security printers on limited-term contracts periodically presented for bidding. They proved, however, {{to be the last}} U. S. stamps printed by a private company for many years. For during early 1894, the American Bank Note Company failed to secure a renewal of its stamp contract because the U. S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing submitted a lower bid; and the Bureau then enjoyed a monopoly on U. S. stamp production for decades thereafter. Not until 1944 would a private company again produce U. S. stamps (the Overrun Countries series, which required special <b>multicolor</b> <b>printing)</b> and the Bureau subsequently resumed its exclusive role in production, only gradually relinquishing it over the next sixty years (U. S. stamp operations at the Bureau ceased entirely during 2005). Scholars believe that the Bureau's first task during 1894 was to finish some Columbian sheets printed by American Banknote; what makes this theory plausible is that, while many Columbian stamps are perfectly perforated, others are distinctly substandard in this regard, with partially punched chads and/or holes that are missing, ragged or misplaced-- flaws that would also mar the stamps of the first Bureau definitive issue, released later during 1894.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Moire {{effect is}} a special optical {{phenomenon}} caused by the interference of light. In the printing industry, it is also called Moire phenomenon which is caused by superposition of the <b>multicolor</b> <b>printing</b> dots for halftone images. Now it is widely used in the anti-counterfeiting areas. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic principle of Moire effect. Then we describe several main applications of the Moire effect {{in the field of}} halftone image security. We review the main types of Moire-based anti-counterfeiting methods, compare them, and explain how they can be used for such security applications. It will provide the necessary technical information for the persons that in anti-counterfeiting area...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, a {{real time}} quality {{monitoring}} and control in <b>multicolor</b> <b>printing</b> is proposed using online mechatronic system based on computer vision. Theoretical and practical study for automatic detection of register marks through an adaptive threshold value selection algorithm. The proposed system provides an automatic control of the press machine {{to be able to}} quantify and compensate the miss-registration happens in printing setup or during operation. The proposed mechatronic system uses a CMOS image sensor to capture the printed register mark image data in real time. Further image processing and analyzing is carried out under MATLAB environment. The color segmentation algorithm involves an adaptive threshold value selection technique to enhance the overall system performance. The geometrical color to color deviation is compensated through DC motor controlled by the decision making algorithm. The system was applied to a pen plotter as a simulation of press machine and succeeded to achieve the required task...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will define {{a family of}} {{sinusoidal}} screening elements and explore the possibilities of their application in graphic arts, securities printing and design solutions in photography and typography editing. For this purpose mathematical expressions of sinusoidal families were converted into a Postscript language. The introduction of a random variable results in a countless number of various mutations which cannot be repeated without knowing the programming code itself. The use {{of the family of}} screens in protection of securities is thus of great importance. Other possible application of modulated sinusoidal screens is related to the large format color printing. This paper will test the application of sinusoidal screens in vector graphics, pixel graphics and typography. The development of parameters in the sinusoidal screen element algorithms gives new forms defined within screening cells with strict requirements of coverage implementation. Individual solutions include stochastic algorithms, as well as the autonomy of screening forms in regard to <b>multicolor</b> <b>printing</b> channels. <br /...|$|E

This was taken up in France. The modern screenprinting process originated from patents taken out by Samuel Simon in 1907 in England. This idea was then adopted in San Francisco, California, by John Pilsworth in 1914 who used screenprinting to form <b>multicolor</b> <b>prints</b> in a subtractive mode, differing from screenprinting as it is done today.|$|R

50|$|The only folio set {{produced}} in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, {{and the next}} thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893-1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with deckled edges. Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are <b>multicolored)</b> are <b>printed</b> on Chine-collé. The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, {{as well as the}} necessity for <b>multicolored</b> <b>prints</b> (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.|$|R

50|$|Lithography was {{discovered}} in 1797, at first used in printing paper images. An image is drawn with a greasy crayon on a smooth stone or zinc surface, which is then wetted. The water remains on the stone but is repelled by the grease. Ink is spread on and is repelled by the water but remains on the grease. Paper is than pressed onto the slab. It picks up the ink from the grease, thus reproducing the drawing. The process can be repeated to make many copies.A <b>multicolored</b> <b>print</b> could be made using different blocks for different colors.

50|$|Yukata {{are worn}} {{by men and}} women. Like other forms of {{traditional}} Japanese clothing, yukata are made with straight seams and wide sleeves. Men's yukata are distinguished by the shorter sleeve extension of approximately 10 cm from the armpit seam, compared to the longer 20 cm sleeve extension in women's yukata. A standard yukata ensemble consists of a cotton undergarment (juban), yukata, obi, bare feet, sandals (geta), a foldable or fixed hand fan, and a carry bag (kinchaku). Kinchaku are used by {{both men and women}} to carry cellphones and other small personal items. For men, an optional hat may also be worn to protect the head from the sun. Yukata literally means bath(ing) clothes, although their use is not limited to after-bath wear. Yukata are a common sight in Japan during the hot summer months.Traditionally yukata were mostly made of indigo-dyed cotton but today a wide variety of colors and designs are available. As with kimono, the general rule with yukata is that younger people wear bright, vivid colors and bold patterns, while older people wear dark, matured colors and dull patterns. A child may wear a <b>multicolored</b> <b>print</b> and a young woman may wear a floral print, while an older woman would confine herself to a traditional dark blue with geometric patterns. Men in general may wear solid dark colors. Since the late 1990s, yukata have experienced increasing popularity.|$|R
