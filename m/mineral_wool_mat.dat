40|$|The {{properties}} of the <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> <b>mat</b> {{are determined by the}} mode of heat treatment and {{properties of}} the products. The main parameter to assess the properties of highly porous fibrous material is its resistance to the air flow, which can be estimated by the value of the hydraulic resistance. This parameter includes both the characteristics of the mineral fiber (diameter, length, density) characteristics of the system as a whole (total porosity, average density, the content of fibrous inclusions) and gas environment parameters (temperature and speed of its motion through the porous layer). Characteristics of the gaseous medium are technological factors, which influence the material during the heat treatment, and hence optimization of the process parameters. The flow of gas through the perforated wall of the hole determined by characteristics, pressurized inside a rolling pin, and the structural characteristics of the mineral geometrical cylinder and his hydraulic resistance. So, a universal criterion, which measures the mass transfer efficiency and hence the effectiveness of the heat treatment, is a hydraulic resistance cylinder. The study of the processes occurring in the mineral wool carpet, showed that its hydraulic resistance is directly proportional to the surface of fibers per unit bed volume and inversely proportional to the third degree of porosity of the layer. Researches have shown that increasing the degree of perforation increases the uneven distribution. However, if total power increases 1. 87 times, because the perforation through the inlet portion perforation of rolling pin was disclosure, substantially uniform distribution was achieved. The investigations led to the following conclusions: the specific surface layer has a linear dependence on its average density; hydraulic resistance of the layer will be greater, when the amount of beads and fibers diameter is smaller. The obtained exact dependence allows calculating the hydraulic resistance to the flow of gas in the cylinder mineral wool. This allows taking into account the parameters of a rolling pin and the intensity of its expiration coolant, optimize its heat treatment parameters, as well as to assess patterns to filter of vapor during operation in the heating cylinder...|$|E
40|$|Das Ziel der Arbeit war die Entwicklung einer Begrünungsmethode für Gleisbette mit schneller Vegetationsentwicklung. Zur Begrünung wurden Sedumpflanzen verwendet, die durch den Einsatz von Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus und Nährsubstrat (allein und kombiniert) in verschiedenen Vegetationssystemen auf dem nährstoffarmen Standort Gleisbett etabliert werden sollten. Die Aktivität der inokulierten Mikroorganismen wurde indirekt über den Einfluss auf die Vegetationsleistung ermittelt. Der Einsatz von B. subtilis und Lactobacillus bewirkte eine signifikante Wachstumsförderung der oberirdischen Pflanzenteile. Die Anwendung von Nährsubstrat als Bodenhilfsmittel war ebenfalls für das Pflanzenwachstum besonders wirksam, sowohl allein appliziert als auch in Kombination mit den Bakterien. Darüber hinaus führte die Applikation der Bakterien und des Nährsubstrates zu einem reduzierten Trockenstress auf Geotextilmatten. Die Wahl des Substrates war entscheidend für die Wirksamkeit der Bakterieninokulation. Jedoch hatten höhere Versuchstemperaturen und pH-Werte ebenfalls eine {{positive}} Wirkung auf das Pflanzenwachstum. Diese Einflüsse waren in Kombination mit Ziegelbruchsubstrat wesentlich stärker als mit den anderen getesteten Substrattypen. Das Ziegelbruchsubstrat kombiniert mit einer Bakterien- und Nährsubstratbehandlung bewährte sich als günstiges, umweltschonendes Begrünungsverfahren von Gleisbettanlagen. The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop and improve existing methods for the remediation of rail tracks using soil borne bacteria. Through the use of Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus ssp. alone and in combination with a nutrient solution three different growth substrates were tested. The substrates were brick chips, textile <b>mats,</b> and <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> <b>mats.</b> Brick chips were tested along railway tracks in Munich but all three substrates were tested along an artificial rail track on the experimental station at the Humboldt University-Berlin. Plants selected for remediation belong to the genus Sedum, which is relatively tolerant to dry conditions. The use of Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus in combination with a nutrient solution improved plant growth significantly. Plants inoculated with bacteria showed increased growth during the first three months but after four months there was no longer any significant difference between treatments. The addition of nutrient solution alone improved plant growth. Plant growth was significantly different on all three substrates, whereas brick chips were the best substrate. The results of this study indicate that the quality of the substrate is the most important factor for remediation and greening of rail tracks. Both bacteria tested had only a limited effect. High temperature and pH resulted in larger Sedum plants in the open field. Brick chips are a cheap substrate which can be used for rail track greening. The rapid growth of plants can be influenced by the application of an additional nutrient solution as well as inoculation with Lactobacillus and/or B. subtilis...|$|R

40|$|Traditional practises {{employed}} in designing and installing peripheral drainage systems around subgrade construction {{have not been}} entirely successful, particularly where the basement space is to be finished. A new method is introduced where drainage along the basement wall {{takes place in a}} 10 mm <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> layer having a density of 50 kg/m[3]. In the experiment two such layers were placed against the foundation wall. This new method is a modification of the standard method of replacing free draining backfill. It would have the two fold purpose of providing a free draining layer so that water could readily reach the footing drains and also supply a heat insulating layer {{on the outside of the}} foundation. Laboratory tests simulating field conditions indicate that glass <b>wool</b> <b>mats</b> make a suitable draining and capillary disrupting layer against a basement wall, provided that, as always, satisfactory draining around the foot of the foundation was provided. Laid in two layers and without continuous joints, the glass <b>wool</b> <b>mats</b> used in the Norwegian Building Research Institute test setups showed better properties than the more conventional techniques they were compared with.

40|$|Aims: The {{present study}} was aimed to {{measurement}} of sound absorption coefficient of <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> and determination of their absorption ability. Materials and Methods: <b>Mineral</b> <b>wool</b> was used to find noise absorption coefficient. Random and normal sound absorption coefficient values were predicted. Then, the measures of transmission loss calculated as an overall value, for applied absorbent material and bare sheet metal. Results: The measured values of noise with one octave band frequency demonstrated an attenuation of 5. 5 - 7 dB for these frequencies. The absorption coefficients of materials showed that <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> had more normal sound coefficients than its random sound absorption coefficient values.

40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{recycled}} <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> filler on the various properties of wood plastic composites was studied and the critical factors affecting {{the formation of the}} properties were determined. An estimation of the volume of <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> fiber waste generated in the European Union between the years 2010 - 2020 was presented. Furthermore, the effect of fiber pre-treatment on the properties of the wood plastic composites were studied, and the environmental performance of a wood plastic composite containing recycled mineral fibers was assessed. The results showed that the volumes of construction and demolition waste and new <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> produced in the European Union are growing annually, and therefore also the volumes of recycled <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> waste generated are increasing. The study showed that the addition of recycled <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> into composites can enhance some of the mechanical properties and increase the moisture resistance properties of the composites notably. Recycled <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> as a filler in wood plastic composites can also improve the fire resistance properties of composites, but it does not protect the polymer matrix from pyrolysis. Fiber pre-treatment with silane solution improved some of the mechanical properties, but generally the use of maleated polypropylene as the coupling agent led to better mechanical and moisture resistance properties. The environmental performance of recycled <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> as the filler in wood plastic composites was superior compared to glass fibers.

State-of-the-art measurement techniques {{for the evaluation of}} primary layer homogeneity are very slow and can only be applied after the product is manufactured. We present here a method that enables on-line monitoring and control and is based on experimental modeling using neural networks. The experimental method is based on image acquisition and image processing of the <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> primary layer structure. As a estimator of the <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> primary layer structure and quality, the weight {{of the primary}} wool layer is used, measured by an on- line weighting device in four locations of the conveyor belt.

All data channels were simultaneously sampled. Radial basis neural networks are used for prediction. The structure of the <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> primary layer is predicted on the basis of experimentally provided weights data. The learning set consists of weights- images pairs.

However, <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> waste is often considered unrecyclable because of its fibrous nature and low density. In this paper, rock wool (RW) and glass wool (GW) were studied as alkali-activated material precursors without any additional co-binders. Both <b>mineral</b> <b>wools</b> were pulverized by a vibratory disc mill in order to remove the fibrous nature of the material.

From {{the point of view}} of slowing (retardation) transformation of environmental resources, the introduction of <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> to crops under glass, in a very much reduced use of peatlands, which for reasons of natural resources are extremely important.

"Life cycle assessment" - called the method of LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) which is commonly called the "cradle to grave" - that is, from extraction of raw materials, through processing, exploitation, to the storage of waste.

Every catalogue list of any material producer of <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> contains thermal conductivity, sometimes also specific heat capacity, but they give only single characteristic values for dry state of material mostly. Exposure to outside climate or any other environment containing moisture can negatively affect the thermal insulation {{properties of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>wool.</b> Nevertheless, the <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> materials due to their climatic loading and their environmental exposure contain moisture that can negatively affect their thermal insulation properties. Because the presence of water in <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> material is undesirable for the majority of applications, many products are provided with hydrophobic substances. Hydrophilic additives are seldom used in <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> products. However, this kind of materials has a good potential for application for instance in interior thermal insulation systems, masonry desalination, green roofs, etc. For these materials, certain moisture content must be estimated and thus their thermal properties will be different than for the dry state. On this account, moisture dependent thermal properties of hydrophilic <b>mineral</b> <b>wool</b> (HMW) are studied {{in a wide range of}} moisture content using a pulse technique. The experimentally determined thermal conductivity data is analysed using several homogenization formulas based on the effective media theory. In terms of homogenization, a porous material is considered as a mixture of two or three phases. In case of dry state, material consists from solid and gaseous phase. When moistened, liquid phase is also present. <b>Mineral</b> <b>wool</b> consists of the solid phase represented by basalt fibers, the liquid phase by water and the gaseous phase by air. At first, the homogenization techniques are applied for the calculation of solid matrix thermal conductivity. Subsequently, the thermal conductivity dependence on moisture content is evaluated by means of several mixing formulas. To verify the obtained results, Wiener’s and Hashin-Shtrikman’s bounds are used. The results show that the application of homogenization techniques can provide useful estimates of measured data and can be successfully used for much less time consuming thermal conductivity evaluation even for the highly inhomogeneous fibrous material such as <b>mineral</b> <b>wool.</b> The data on thermal properties can find use in building practice, especially in the design of thermal insulation building envelopes.
