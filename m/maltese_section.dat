Out of 72 submissions, 20 were chosen for the two semi finals. Eventually 10 made it for the final of Saturday 5 November 1960. All shows were held at the Radio City Opera House in Hamrun and were transmitted on the islandâ€™s cable radio system, now extinct, and then better known as Rediffusion. Eight of the ten songs were sung in Italian, one in English and one in Maltese. Each song had to be presented with two different musical arrangements. It was also a requisite to have two different singers for each song.|$|E

In 1929, following a successful motorboat regatta, the Malta Motor Boat Club was formed. This led in 1930 to the two clubs amalgamating under the title of the senior body, with the declared policy of providing a common meeting ground for the <b>Maltese</b> and English <b>sections</b> of the community, and to this end, the building of premises suitable to the Clubs' activities.|$|R

What is very interesting is the diversity of social and professional categories of military engineers, already committed by the Pope or by the big dynastic families of the time, called to work for the Hospitaller Order. Military architecture is also reflected in bastions, curtain walls and ravelins and by 1550 military engineering in Italy, as Count Valperga, seems to have become established as a specialist practice, the first branch of architecture to achieve recognition as an independent profession...|$|R

This text tries to investigate the relationship between historical events and their transformations that led to the configuration of Valletta, permeated by theoretical concepts and studies introduced in Malta by Francesco Laparelli, military engineer from Cortona, as aspects of military defense, the design of a city and architectural principles. Theory and practice converge in the new city of the Order, in a milieu quite different from the historical context of the Sixteenth Century...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the Phoenician and Punic tombs {{discovered in the}} Maltese Islands from various aspects. The first chapter considers the historical and archaeological background of the Phoenicians in Malta between 700 B. C. and A. D. 100. The second part (Chapters 2 and 3) deals with {{the correlation between the}} distribution of tombs and geomorphology, water resources, soils and land-use; this section also discusses which areas of the Maltese Islands were likely to be inhabited during this period. The third section of this study (Chapter 4) concentrates on the type of society which emerges from the burial evidence during the Phoenician Period. The fourth part (Chapters 5 and 6) is concerned with the dating and utilization of tombs, while it also estimates the living and buried population of the <b>Maltese</b> Islands; this <b>section</b> also attempts to calculate a potential population for the Maltese archipelago from different land-use figures. The final part of this dissertation examines with different maps the location of Punic urban and rural settlements in the Maltese Islands in relation to later historical settlement patterns during the Roman and Byzantine eras, the Middle Ages and the Modern Period...|$|R

However, these are rather limited and very often the position of the child victim, witness or suspect is similar to that of an adult involved in criminal proceedings. This means that children and adults have the same extent of rights to be heard and to participate in the criminal process but special mechanisms that take into account the vulnerability and best interests of children are scarce. For instance, there seem to be no special measures aimed at ensuring that child victims and suspects are provided with the necessary information during proceedings. This would seem to be a rather important element in ensuring child friendly justice. The position of the child victim and child witness is generally the same given that the criminal action is a public action prosecuted by the police or the Attorney General. In fact, the position of the victim is traditionally that of witness. Nevertheless, there are certain measures that allow for more active participation of victims when compared to other witnesses. These measures typically apply to both adults and children. With reference to child suspects, the most important child friendly measures are the existence of the Juvenile Court and the availability of care orders issued by the Minister for social welfare. The Juvenile Court provides a somewhat more child-friendly setting than the normal courts of criminal justice. Care orders, on the other hand, can constitute an alternative to imprisonment for children convicted of a criminal offence. However, these measures are only available for children under 16 years of age. Children between 16 and 18 years of age will be tried in the same court as adults. Moreover, children under 16 years charged jointly with a person over 16 years of age will also be tried in the same court as an adult and will not benefit from the special measures available in the Juvenile Court. It must be noted that the age threshold for criminal responsibility in Malta is very low (nine years of age). Children between 9 and 14 years of age are exempt from criminal responsibility for any act or omission done without mischievous discretion (that is, knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act and its consequences). However, if children in this age group act with a mischievous discretion they are liable to punishment. For children between 14 and 18 years of age, the applicable punishment is diminished by one or two degrees. The punishments that can be imposed on adults can also be imposed on children but certain reductions may be applied in favour of children depending on their age. Once the child reaches 18 years of age, there is full criminal responsibilityN/...|$|R
