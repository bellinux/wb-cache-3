40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-rank and jointly-sparse approach for imaging stationary targets using <b>multipolarization</b> through-wall <b>radar</b> (TWR). The proposed approach exploits two important characteristics of multichannel TWR signals: low-rank {{structure of the}} wall reflections and jointly-sparse structure of the polarization images. The task of removing wall reflections and reconstructing multichannel images of the same scene behind-the-wall is formulated as a regularized least squares optimization problem, where the low-rank regularization is imposed on the wall returns and the joint-sparsity constraint is enforced on the multichannel images. An iterative algorithm is introduced to solve the optimization problem, yielding multichannel images of the indoor targets. Experimental results on real radar data show that the proposed model enhances multichannel imaging in terms of target-to-clutter ratio and indoor target localization...|$|R

For separation of the lava flows, shorter wavelengths, smaller incidence angles and horizontal polarization are best. A SIR-C radar configuration could provide nearly complete discrimination of these lava flows. Conversely, the longer wavelengths, larger incidence angles and vertical polarization was preferred for sedimentary rocks, perhaps due to the slight vegetation cover. Satisfactory classification of sedimentary rocks requires more radar data than for the lavas. These results are potentially useful both for radar system configuration and for geological applications.

In [2], a multi-channel through-wall radar imaging based on image fusion for combining the single-channel images to obtain a high signal-to-clutter ratio image was proposed for through-wall human being detection. In [3], a signal processing strategy was proposed to track multiple extended targets in a scene {{by means of a}} wide-band monostatic through-wall radar. And this method used the preprocessing of raw data, model-based radar image formation for objection detection and tracking. In [4], the authors presented a technique for classifying stationary targets based on the high-range resolution profile extracted from 3 -D TWRIs and the targets classified which using a naïve Bayesian classifier supported by principal component analysis. In [5], a novel near-field through-wall imaging algorithm with ability in the presence of wall ambiguities was proposed, and the capability of the new algorithm to detect the targets was verified by finite-difference time-domain method. In [6], an extension iterative target detector and another detector based on Bayes’ test were proposed with joint detection and fusion of a set of <b>multipolarization</b> <b>radar</b> images.

40|$|Discrimination {{of targets}} can be {{improved}} significantly by analyzing the polarization of scattered electromagnetic waves. In radar imaging, the target image can be enhanced by combining measurements from different polarizations. In this chapter, we propose a joint image formation and fusion approach for <b>multipolarization</b> through-the-wall <b>radar</b> imaging, using compressive sensing (CS). The measurements from different polarization channels are processed jointly using the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model to produce several images of the scene, each corresponding to a polarization channel. Furthermore, the measurement vectors are {{fused together to form}} a composite measurement vector, which yields a composite image of the scene. The advantage of fusing the measurement vectors before image formation is that the measurement noise is reduced and the target information is enhanced, which leads to a more informative composite image. The MMV model enforces the same sparsity support for all formed images by reinforcing target information across channels and attenuating noise. Experimental results are presented using simulated and real data. Analysis and comparison of experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed through-the-wall radar imaging approach, especially in the presence of high-measurement noise...|$|R

The study area is around Lake Titicaca, in the high plateau of Altiplano in the Andes, between Bolivia and Peru. The terrain is fragmented to small size cultivated land parcels with rudimentary farming technology and high variability in growth due to the crop rotation patterns practiced in the region. The SIR-C data cquired in April of 1994, field observation and ground data are used to classify the images into land cover types. The analysis includes, a test of separability of classes using data extracted from training areas, the use of a linear discriminant function to classify the training sites, application of principal component on SIR- C channels, and explanation of results based on the sensitivity of radar data at each channel to vegetation biomass and structure and underlying soil condition. The classification is performed by a maximum likelihood classifier and the accuracy is measured over training and independent test sites and expressed in terms of confusion matrix. The combination of both frequencies and polarization channels resulted in less than 10 % error both on training and test sites. It is shown that current single channel spaceborne radar systems such as JERS- 1 and Radarsat produce more than 40 % error (20 % when combined).

40|$|Spaceborne imaging sensors in the visible, {{infrared}} {{and passive}} microwave {{have been used}} to observe and study the Earth's surface since {{the early stages of the}} space program. More recently, active microwave imaging sensors (radars) have been developed to extend our capability to study the Earth surface processes. Imaging radars, flown on Seasat (1978) and the Shuttle (1981, 1984), acquired synoptic images of a variety of geologic, biologic, and oceanographic features and provided new insight in some of the land and ocean processes. Subsurface synoptic imaging was achieved for the first time in some of the arid regions of the world. Soil moisture distribution after a rainstorm was clearly delineated, opening the possibility of its monitoring on a global basis. Polar ice distribution and dynamics over large areas in the Beaufort Sea were monitored over a three-month period, thus allowing the possibility of operational observation of ice dynamics in support of polar navigation. The successful development and flight of these spaceborne imaging radars was the result of major technological developments in the 1970 s. They used some of the largest spaceborne lightweight planar array antennas (2 X 10 m) with printed radiating elements. The transmitters were fully solid state and generated a 1 kw peak power signal at L-band (1. 2 Ghz). The processing of the received data to generate the high-resolution (25 to 40 m) imagery was done using both optical and digital processors. More advanced imaging radar systems are under development.

40|$|On October 5, 1984, {{the second}} Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-B) was {{launched}} into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger. SIR-B {{is part of}} an evolutionary radar program designed to progressively develop a multifrequency, <b>multipolarization</b> synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> with a variable earth-imaging geometry. The SIR-B instrument is an upgraded version of SIR-A, with the additional capability of tilting the antenna mechanically to acquire imagery at variable incidence angles ranging from 15 to 60 deg. The variable look angle capability provided a means of acquiring multiple incidence angle imagery over specific targets on successive days of the mission. These data are being used to classify surface features by their backscatter signatures as a function of incidence angle and for topographic mapping. In addition to the antenna tilt capability, a digital data-handling system was added to increase the dynamic range, the resolution was improved by a factor of two over SIR-A, and a calibration subsystem was added to improve the radiometric accuracy of the data.

40|$|The NASA/JPL {{aircraft}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) was used to conduct major data acquisition expeditions in 1983 through 1985. Substantial improvements to the aircraft SAR were incorporated in 1981 through 1984 resulting in an imaging radar that could simultaneously record all four combinations of linear horizontal and vertical polarization (HH, HV, VH, VV) using computer control of the radar logic, gain setting, and other functions. Data were recorded on high-density digital tapes and processed on a general-purpose computer to produce 10 -km square images with 10 -m resolution. These digital images yield both the amplitude and phase of the four polarizations. All of the digital images produced so far are archived at the JPL Radar Data Center and are accessible via the Reference Notebook System of that facility.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{retrieval}} of agricultural crop height from space by using <b>multipolarization</b> Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar</b> (SAR) images. Coherent and incoherent crop height estimation methods are discussed {{for the first time}} with a unique TanDEM-X dataset acquired over rice cultivation areas. Indeed, with its polarimetric and interferometric capabilities, the TanDEM-X mission enables the tracking of crop height through interferometric SAR (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) and the inversion of radiative transfer-based backscattering model. The paper evaluates the three aforementioned techniques simultaneously with a data set acquired in September 2014 and 2015 over rice fields in Turkey during their reproductive stage. The assessment of the absolute height accuracy and the limitations of the approaches are provided. In-situ measurements conducted in the same cultivation periods are used for validation purposes. The PolInSAR and morphological backscattering model results showed better performance with low RMSEs (12 and 13 cm) compared to the differential InSAR result having RMSE of 18 cm. The spatial baseline, i. e. the distance between satellites, is a key parameter for coherent methods such as InSAR and PolInSAR. Its effect on the absolute height accuracy is discussed using TanDEM-X pairs separated by a baseline of 101. 7 m and 932 m. Although the InSAR based approach is demonstrated to provide sufficient crop height accuracy, the availability of a precise vegetation-free digital elevation model and a structurally dense crop are basic requirements for achieving high accuracy. The PolInSAR approach provides reliable crop height estimation if the spatial baseline is large enough for the inversion. The impact of increasing spatial baseline on the absolute accuracy of the crop height estimation is evident for both methods. However, PolInSAR is more cost-efficient, e. g. there is no need for phase unwrapping and any external vegetation free surface elevation data. Instead, the usage of radiative transfer based backscattering models provides not only crop height but also other biophysical properties of the crops with consistent accuracy. The efficient retrieval of crop height with backscattering model is achieved by metamodelling, which makes the computational cost of backscattering inversion comparable to the ones of the coherent methods. However, effectiveness depends on not only the backscattering model, but also the integration of agronomic crop growth rules. Motivated by these results, a combination of backscattering and PolInSAR inversion models would provide a successful method of future precision farming studies.
