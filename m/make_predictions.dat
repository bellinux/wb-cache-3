5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and <b>make</b> <b>predictions</b> about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it is a theory which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E
5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, economic agents were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled economic agents (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents <b>make</b> <b>predictions</b> based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

40|$|To predict multivariate systems, {{we have to}} <b>make</b> <b>prediction</b> model {{following}} the causality among elements composing a system. Although we can observe many time-series data as behavior of elements, we are not sure which observed ele-ments relate to the element that we aim to predict. That is, we have to detect these essential elements and constitute a predic-tion model only by these elements. Here, such a detection be-comes possible by identifying the causality of a multivariate system. In this study, we identify the causality from the view-point of prediction accuracy. First, we <b>make</b> <b>prediction</b> mod-els by using each combinatorial pair of elements, and then we estimate each prediction accuracy. Secondly, we find the best pair which <b>makes</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy the best, and we identify the causality among elements {{on the basis of}} the best pair. However, because this numerical cost grows exponen-tially to the number of elements, this identification is consid-ered as a combinatorial optimization problem. Therefore, we apply the genetic algorithm. In order to examine the accuracy of estimated causality, we perform some simulations with a numerical model of complex systems. Moreover, we apply our method to predict a real financial system by detecting the causality and optimizing prediction model dynamically. 1...|$|R
