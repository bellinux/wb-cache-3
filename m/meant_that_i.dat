5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, I {{was officially}} demanded {{to join the}} National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The {{technical}} work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing at all. Why {{do you ask}} such silly questions? <b>I</b> only <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> {{had married}} I {{should not have been}} here, and we should never have met again." ...|$|R
6000|$|I had a {{momentary}} suspicion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had said something}} stupid. Her smile amongst many other things seemed to have <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> too. And <b>I</b> answered it with a certain resignation: ...|$|R
500|$|Rachel Nichols {{was born}} January 8, 1980 in Augusta, Maine, to Jim, a schoolteacher, and Alison Nichols. She {{attended}} Cony High School, where she {{competed in the}} high jump. Nichols {{said in an interview}} that she was not the hot chick in high school and her mother would euphemistically refer to her as [...] "a late bloomer", [...] "which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had uncontrollable arms and legs, I had very long appendages. I took several years of very highly structured dance classes for me to be able to control myself." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{told him}} to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause {{constantly}} thrown in my face. I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> did not want it. [...] "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." ...|$|E
500|$|Campaign {{magazine}} listed [...] "Cog", {{along with}} Balls for the Sony BRAVIA line of high-definition televisions, {{as one of}} the most-imitated commercials in recent times. Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from [...] "Cog" [...] are a 2003 piece for breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs, Nearness for the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, a 30-second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, an advertisement for BBC Radio Merseyside football coverage, and the 2007 Tipping Point, advertising Guinness stout. When asked about the similarities between [...] "Cog" [...] and [...] "Tipping Point", Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind Tipping Point, replied: [...] "I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, {{you have to look at}} things like that and make a decision. The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought it wasn’t that near [...] "Cog"." ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{flush of}} crimson suffused the girl's cheeks. [...] "I never <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>I</b> can {{scarcely}} forgive you for fancying I did. Of course I could trust you with--you {{have made me}} use the word--the dollars, but you must realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not do anything in public opposition to my uncle's opinion." ...|$|R
60|$|If he <b>meant</b> all <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> {{will take}} an oath {{that he was}} spindle-shanked, and cross-eyed, and had a lousy itching shoulder, and that his heart was crosser than his eyes, and that he wrote it out of malice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanks,' he said. 'No, {{but what}} <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wished I {{was in for}} this poetry prize. I bet I could turn out a {{rattling}} good screed. Why, last year I almost got the prize. I sent in fearfully hot stuff.' ...|$|R
500|$|The title story, [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", is set {{in early}} 19th century Gloucestershire and {{concerns}} the friendship of three young women, Cassandra Parbringer, Miss Tobias, and Mrs. Fields. Though {{the events of the}} story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43. Clarke has said, [...] "For a long time it was my hope that these three ladies should eventually find a place in...the novel...I decided there was no place for them...I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity...it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed to write the women and the servants, as far as possible, as they would have been written in a 19th-century novel." [...] Reviewers highlighted this tale, one calling it [...] "the most striking story" [...] of the collection and [...] "a staunchly feminist take on power relations". In her review of the volume in Strange Horizons, Victoria Hoyle writes that [...] "there is something incredibly precise, clean, and cold about Clarke's portrayal of 'women's magic' in this story (and throughout the collection)—it is urgent and desperate, but it is also natural {{and in the course of}} things." ...|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{inspired}} by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue {{during the early years}} of her success with the observation: [...] "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." [...] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, [...] "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." [...] Rolling Stone commented that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as [...] "an icon to rival Madonna", saying, [...] "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter." [...] Minogue has said of Madonna, [...] "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done", and [...] "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that." [...] Minogue has been declared by media as a sex symbol.|$|E
2500|$|All her {{information}} {{came from}} friends whose conversation leaned sharply {{away from their}} relatively high incomes, which, apparently, they found to be embarrassing {{in a world that}} harbored poor people. Their chosen method of being helpful was to attend meetings at one another's homes and discuss the problems of the hungry hordes after dinner. I am not trying to be amusing; it's what they really did. A Party member was usually invited to lead the discussions. I was apolitical. To some, that <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was either stupid or [...] "inner-directed"—which meant according to them that I didn't care about my fellow man. What I really didn't care about was the four or five of her friends who later became known as the Hollywood Ten.|$|E
60|$|DON JUAN. The old {{man called}} it murder, because he was, he said, {{defending}} his daughter's honor. By this he <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> because <b>I</b> foolishly {{fell in love}} with her and told her so, she screamed; and he tried to assassinate me after calling me insulting names.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did I say;--jolly as a sandboy? There {{is nothing}} wrong in <b>that.</b> What <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> was, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> this world {{is a very good}} sort of world, and that a man can get along in it very well, if he minds his p's and q's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>meant</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{said one}} other night, and I {{am ready to}} prove it," [...] he said. [...] "Whether I shall ever return or not, I say it solemnly, only Gods knows; but if I live to reach our camp, I think Hilton Dane will." ...|$|R
2500|$|Banjee. That was the {{identity}} I was given {{back in the}} summer of 1991, when I, half out/half in approached the colored museum of the Christopher Street piers. I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, all I knew was that there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns {{spent his}} early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his {{paternal}} grandparents after his parents' marriage failed. He then {{spent a year}} living with his mother in Columbia, South Carolina, and thereafter he spent several years living with his aunt Gladys in Lake Murray, South Carolina, twenty-two miles from Columbia. He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he once said, [...] "In the place where I was a child, there were no artists {{and there was no}} art, so I really didn't know what that meant. I think I thought it <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be in a situation different than the one that I was in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theile {{arrived in}} Rome as an outsider, despite being the {{defending}} champion as he had not regained his form of four years prior, with Robert Bennett and Frank McKinney of the United States posting faster times. This {{appeared to be the}} case in the heats, with Theile posting the third fastest time behind the American duo. In the semifinals, Bennett was unable to repeat his earlier performance and Theile won, while McKinney won the other semifinal, also in a time slower than Theile. Theile was confident approaching the final, recounting [...] "I had great faith in myself and my abilities. I had a short, sharp peak, which <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to save everything for that burst and then exert everything I had for precisely that moment." [...] Theile attacked at the outset in the final, as was his style, and held a slender lead at the 50-metre mark over McKinney and Bennett. Theile made a good turn, lengthening his lead to half a body length, before holding off a late surge to claim consecutive gold medals, defeating McKinney by just 0.2 s, setting a new Olympic record in the event. For the first time, the 4×100-metre medley relay was contested at the Olympics, and combining with Terry Gathercole, Neville Hayes and Geoff Shipton, the Australians finished well behind the Americans to win the silver medal.|$|E

5000|$|Hytner {{was on a}} {{percentage}} for both London and New York productions, allowing him (then aged 34) to never need worry about money again. [...] "It was a huge- a massive stroke of fortune," [...] he said in 2010. [...] "It <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> thereafter <b>I</b> only needed to do what I wanted to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What he <b>meant</b> by <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am sure I don't know, Baas, seeing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have never}} thought much of women, {{at least not}} for many years since my last old vrouw went and drank herself to death after lying in her sleep on the baby which I loved much better than I did her, Baas.|$|R
60|$|JUNO. I don't {{think you}} quite understand. I <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{in love with}} you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{distress}} me. Ah,--you meant me--you <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} dead, {{because you think}} I am old! But that is a mistake--I am not very old!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You will be {{very tired}} of that hat before three years, Rilla,' said mother, with a {{provoking}} grin, which, being interpreted, <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't stick it out.|$|E
50|$|The Norman {{conquest of}} England {{proceeded}} only {{slowly in the}} North of the country, perhaps due to the relative poverty of the land (for example, not suitable for growing the Normans' preferred wheat, as opposed to oats), and to various uprisings in England {{as well as in}} Normandy <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> William <b>I</b> had to be elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>meant,</b> of course, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would not}} make it a ground for quarrelling with you. If I wished to tell you I could do so without any inquiry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} think I could have meant {{anything}} against him!" [...] said Mrs. March, with the tender fervor that every {{woman who lived}} in the time of the war must feel for those who suffered in it. [...] "All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hoped you would not get mixed up with him too much. You're so apt to be carried away by your impulses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The baby {{belongs to}} me," [...] cried Mrs. Wheeler passionately. [...] "Jane {{wrote to me}} about her. Jane <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have her. I've come for her." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{knew they}} really <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was too old}} to be of service in such an {{adventure}} as this. Also they desired to keep me out of risk.|$|E
6000|$|... "When you {{resolved}} on that, you <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should never}} know my origin?" [...] said Deronda, impulsively. [...] "You {{have at least}} changed in your feeling on that point." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{clasped his}} hands with a gesture that for him was strangely full of expression. [...] "When I came here to-night I was--I hoped--I <b>meant</b> {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could {{to do away with}} the past, and start fair again. And you meet me with 'nerves,' and silence, and sighs. There's nothing tangible. It's like--it's like a spider's web." ...|$|R
