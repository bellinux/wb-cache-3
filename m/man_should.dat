In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E

The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to <b>man,</b> <b>should</b> be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the <b>man</b> <b>should</b> go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E

With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of all the candidates, of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted into both programmes.|$|E

25|$|In a {{book written}} by Yehuda Berg, {{a former teacher}} at the center, he {{recommended}} that men not masturbate as semen generated without loving, shared intention does not serve its purpose.

50|$|The role {{of feminist}} {{discourse}} {{in the field of}} sexuality has been to redefine a woman’s sex role. It criticized the double standards of sex between women and men, which included traditionally held norms such as that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be aggressive and active, women passive and inactive; that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> have stronger sexual desires and women weaker; that <b>men</b> <b>should</b> be sexually experienced before marriage but women retain their virginity; that women should not ask too much for sex and should consider men’s satisfaction as their own. The critical feminist discourse is also rewriting the gender views in Chinese society. Some feminist scholars have started to emphasize women’s sexual rights and the diversity of sexuality among Chinese women. Thus China’s sexual revolution is also women’s sexual revolution, as evidenced by these trends.|$|R
