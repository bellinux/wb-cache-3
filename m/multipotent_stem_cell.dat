50|$|In plants, genetic {{changes in}} somatic lines {{can and do}} result in genetic changes in the germ lines, because the germ cells are {{produced}} by somatic cell lineages (vegetative meristems), which may be old enough (many years) to have accumulated multiple mutations since seed germination, some of them subject to natural selection. Likewise, basal animals such as sponges (Porifera) and corals (Anthozoa) contain <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lineages, {{that give rise to}} both somatic and reproductive cells. Weismann barrier appears to be of a more recent evolutionary origin.|$|E
50|$|Genetic lineage tracing {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} by various research groups {{to show that the}} cell clusters originating from the developing foregut express a transcription factor called PDX1 (Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1). This transcription factor has been shown to give rise to the <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lineages contributing to the endocrine, exocrine and ductal cells of the pancreas. These cells {{have been shown to be}} spatially located at the tip of the branching pancreatic tree. Later these cells are shown to originate from the dorsal bud of the developing pancreas.|$|E

Placental <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated by explant method, colon cancer was modeled by administering 20 mg/kg dimethylhydrazine weekly for 20 weeks, tumors of the colon were cut into 500 Âµm slices. There were no changes in proliferative activity of tumor tissue, or in the level of apoptosis. Absence of influence of placental <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> on colon tumor growth is a unique feature of these cells, and extends the application of placental <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in therapy...|$|R

50|$|Plants and basal metazoans such as sponges (Porifera) and corals (Anthozoa) do not {{sequester}} {{a distinct}} germline, generating gametes from <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> lineages that also {{give rise to}} ordinary somatic tissues. It is therefore likely that germline sequestration first evolved in complex animals with sophisticated body plans, i.e. bilaterians. There are several theories {{on the origin of}} the strict germline-soma distinction. Setting aside an isolated germ cell population early in embryogenesis might promote cooperation between the somatic cells of a complex multicellular organism. Another recent theory suggests that early germline sequestration evolved to limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in mitochondrial genes in complex organisms with high energy requirements and fast mitochondrial mutation rates.|$|E
50|$|Though {{stem cells}} {{isolated}} from the muscle (satellite cells) {{have the ability to}} differentiate into myotubes when injected directly into the muscle of animals, they lack the ability to spread systemically throughout. To effectively deliver a therapeutic dose to an isolated muscle it would require direct injections to that muscle every 2mm. This problem was circumvented by using another <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell,</b> termed pericytes, that are located within the blood vessels of skeletal muscle. These cells have the ability to be delivered systemically and uptaken by crossing the vascular barrier. Once past the vasculature, pericytes have the ability to fuse and form myotubes. This means that they can be injected arterially, crossing through arterial walls into muscle, where they can differentiate into potentially functional muscle. These findings show potential for stem cell therapy of DMD. The pericyte-derived cells would be extracted, grown in culture, and then these cells would be injected into the blood stream where the possibility exists that they might find their way into injured regions of skeletal muscle.|$|E

They possess trophic, immunoregulatory, antimicrobial and hematopoiesis-supportive properties. Moreover, injected MSC {{are able to}} migrate to sites of hypoxia and inflammation. Recently, more evidence has become available showing that MSC may originate from pericytes. Different microenvironments as well as non-standardized methods for their isolation and expansion lead to heterogeneous cell populations.

40|$|AbstractThe upper {{region of}} the outer root sheath of vibrissal follicles of adult mice {{contains}} <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that respond to morphogenetic signals to generate multiple hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and epidermis, i. e., all the lineages of the hairy skin. At the time when hair production ceases and when the lower {{region of the}} follicle undergoes major structural changes, the lower region contains {{a significant number of}} clonogenic keratinocytes, and can then respond to morphogenetic signals. This demonstrates that <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> migrate to the root of the follicle to produce whisker growth. Moreover, our results indicate that the clonogenic keratinocytes are closely related, if not identical, to the <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and that the regulation of whisker growth necessitates a precise control of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> trafficking...|$|R

The findings on light microscopy were in agreement with those described in CDA type II, whereas on electron microscopy, the ultrastructure findings were compatible with both types I and II. The acidified serum lysis test (Ham test) performed with eight normal sera was negative. The patient's red blood cells showed an increased agglutinability with anti-i antibodies.

Bone Marrow (BM) histology was used only to exclude previous or other subtypes of Ph-CMD or Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In addition, {{the lack of any}} cytogenetic or molecular-biological marker has made the discrimination between ET and cases of Reactive Thrombocytosys (RT) without a well known cause quite problematic.

40|$|Immunological {{imbalance}} is {{the foundation}} for the development of liver damage or fibrosis. Therefore, the treatment of liver diseases not only relies on regenerative medicine for cellular replacement, but also depends on immunoregulation. The immunological basis of liver injury and repair, the immunological basis of <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for allograft, and the research advances in the immunoregulatory effect of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the treatment of liver diseases demonstrated that <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> especially mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> have low immunogenicity and cause immunosuppression, with the immunological basis of allograft; in addition, they can improve the local immune microenvironment of the liver by immunoregulation to reduce the liver injury caused by immune response.

40|$|Abstract. The mouse {{intestinal}} epithelium is able {{to establish}} and maintain complex lineage-specific, spatial, and temporal patterns of gene expression despite its rapid and continuous renewal. A <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> located near the base of each intestinal crypt gives rise to progeny which undergo amplification and allocation to either enterocytic, Paneth cell, goblet cell, or enteroendocrine cell lineages. Differentiation of these four lineages occurs during their geographically ordered migration along the crypt-villus axis. Gut stem cells appear to have a "positional address " which is manifested by differences in the differentiation programs of their lineal descendants along the duodenalcolonic (cephalocaudal) axis. We have used the intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabpi) as a mode...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The mouse {{intestinal}} epithelium {{represents a}} unique mammalian system for examining {{the relationship between}} cell division, commitment, and differentiation. Proliferation and differentiation are rapid, perpetual, and spatially well-organized processes that occur along the crypt-to-villus axis and involve clearly defined cell lineages derived from a common <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> located near the base of each crypt. Nucleotides- 1178 to + 28 of the rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene were used to establish three pedigrees of transgenic mice that expressed SV- 40 large T antigen (TAg) in epithelial cells situated in the uppermost portion of small intestinal crypts and in already committed, differentiating enterocytes as they exited these crypts and migrated up th...|$|E

We also describe DNA damage and repair strategies during reprogramming and discuss potential genotoxic agents that can reduce the inherent risk for teratoma formation and mutation accumulation.

40|$|Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} disease, the {{hallmark}} {{of which is the}} Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). Without intervention the disease progresses from a benign chronic phase to a rapidly fatal blast crisis. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on a model we have previously described using the expression of a conditional mutant of Bcr-Abl PTK in a <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> line, FDCP-Mix. Long term exposure of FDCP-Mix cells to Bcr-Abl mimics disease progression in CML. Four major differences were observed as a consequence of long term exposure to the Bcr-Abl PTK compared with cells exposed short term.

40|$|SummaryMalignant astrocytoma, {{the most}} {{prevalent}} primary brain tumor, is resistant to all known therapies and frequently harbors mutations that inactivate p 53 and activate Ras signaling. We have generated mouse strains that lack p 53 and harbor a conditional allele of the NF 1 tumor suppressor that negatively regulates Ras signaling. The mice develop malignant astrocytomas with complete penetrance. The majority of tumors display characteristics of glioblastoma multiforme with concomitant alteration of signaling pathways previously described in the human counterparts of this neoplasm.

However, little is known about mammalian cells responsible for these regenerative processes. Here we review cellular origin of this plasticity in the light of newly described adult neural crest-derived stem cell populations. We also discuss further potential <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations with the ability to regenerate disrupted innervation and to functionally recover the mechanoreceptors.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which an apparently uniform population of cells can generate a heterogeneous population of differentiated derivatives is a fundamental aspect of pluripotent and <b>multipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour. One possibility is that {{the environment and the}} differentiation cues to which the cells are exposed are not uniform. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive possibility is that the observed heterogeneity arises from the stem cells themselves through the existence of different interconvertible substates that pre-exist before the cells commit to differentiate. We have tested this hypothesis in the case of apparently homogeneous pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells, which do not follow a uniform pattern of differentiation when exposed to retinoic acid. Instead, they produce differentiated progeny that include both neuronal and non-neural phenotypes. Our results suggest that pluripotent NTERA 2 stem cells oscillat...|$|E
