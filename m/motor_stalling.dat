50|$|During {{the third}} day solo in lunar orbit, Worden began to have some {{problems}} with the Mass Spectrometer. This was located {{on the end of}} a boom that is deployed and retracted periodically throughout the mission. Frequently instruments in the CM were indicating that it had failed to retract. To get it to retract properly he had to cycle the retract/deploy switch several times. During the EVA on the return to Earth, he inspected the housing and found that guide pins were barely coming through the guide slot. Further it was found that the problems with retraction always occurred after the housing had been in the shadow of the spacecraft, but would retract fully after being in sunlight. This was caused by the <b>motor</b> <b>stalling</b> out, implying that the parts of the boom were being deformed by thermal expansion. To stop this occurring, several modifications were made to the instruments used on Apollo 16 and Apollo 17.|$|E

50|$|This {{strategy}} {{worked for}} Opportunity until Sol 654 (November 25, 2005), when the Joint-1 azimuth <b>motor</b> <b>stalled</b> {{because of increased}} electrical resistance. Rover operators responded by delivering higher-than-normal current to the motor. This approach also worked, though Joint 1 continued to stall periodically. Typically, the rover's handlers simply tried again the next sol and the joint worked. They determined that the Joint-1 <b>motor</b> <b>stalls</b> were most likely due to damage caused by the extreme temperature cycles the joint experienced during deep sleep. As a precaution, they started keeping the robotic arm {{out in front of}} the rover overnight, rather than stowing it underneath the rover deck, where it would be virtually unusable in the event of a Joint-1 motor failure.

40|$|Abstract—After {{an initial}} fault lowers bus voltage, {{induction}} motors {{connected to the}} bus can successively stall in a cascading process {{that can lead to}} a voltage collapse or delayed voltage recovery. There are typically many induction motors connected to the bus, and models that aggregate the motors do not capture the cascading stall. We study the cascading stall in a simple power system with many induction motors using a quasistatic assumption and randomization of some motor parameters, and hence efficiently estimate the distribution of the number of <b>motors</b> <b>stalled.</b> This approach is also extended to a simple 4 -bus system and a simple motor dynamics and similar results are obtained. These distributions can often be fit with a high-level and generic probabilistic model of cascading failure, showing a commonality between cascading <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> and other cascading processes.

40|$|Complex {{drilling}} operations, high {{production expenses}} {{and a low}} oil price influence the modern petroleum industry. Reducing the non-productive-time (NPT) during an operation can reduce the production expenses. Drilling, well control and mud equipment is responsible for 21 - 30 % of the NPT (Contractor, 2010). The industry needs solutions that reduces drilling related NPT. Our solution {{was to develop a}} program that predicts failures while drilling. The program reduces NPT by alerting the operator of failures that will occur in the future. Historical data on NPT during drilling is important when developing a failure-predicting program. Collected historical data was from 427 offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The goal was to match program output with the historical data. The program was developed to calculate a probability distribution of future failures. The distribution is calculated based on symptoms detected in real-time-drilling-data (RTDD). As for medical diseases, the probability of a drilling related failure changes with the detected symptoms. A symptom can cause a positive or negative event. All symptoms were linked to their events through relationships. The relationships were collected in an ontology that serves as a database for the program. The program was developed by placing all relationships in a hierarchal structure. Symptoms were placed on the top and failures were placed {{on the bottom of the}} hierarchy. Detection of a symptom activates multiple paths leading to failures. The activated paths were added together and presented as a failure distribution. To match the historical failure distribution, the ontology and the complete program were adjusted. Data from three actual drilling operations were used to test the program. The failures were one case of lost circulation and two cases of <b>motor</b> <b>stalls.</b> Symptoms were detected and collected from End of Well (EoW) reports and RTDD. The program was capable of predicting the two cases of <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> failures, but the lost circulation failure was only top three. Based on the successful prediction of <b>motor</b> <b>stalls,</b> the program was verified as logical. The most probable failure was <b>motor</b> <b>stall</b> with a probability of 18 %. The probabilities were not extreme enough, as the most probable failure should have a probability of at least 50 %. Future work includes adjusting the ontology to make the failure distribution extreme. To optimize the program further, a method that deactivates time and depth dependent symptoms must be developed. More EoW reports and RTDD are required to continue testing the program. By applying these changes, we believe that the program will be able to predict failures and hence reduce drilling related NPT...|$|R
40|$|Air {{conditioner}} (A/C) <b>motor</b> <b>stalling</b> {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} main reasons for the occurrence of delayed voltage recovery events leading to voltage collapse. In recent years, the phenomenon of Fault-Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) has increasingly been observed. Planning tools have been found inadequate to capture FIDVR-type events, primarily due to inaccurate modeling of A/C motor loads. A dynamic A/C motor model based on the phasor modeling approach is considered in this work. The model accurately represents the behavior of A/C motors during and after a fault. Sensitivity analysis is performed to arrive at a set of more significant model parameters. This information may be used effectively in tuning the model parameters for various types of A/C motors. The next step in the development of a load model capable of accurately capturing the dynamical behavior of loads in the system is the aggregate modeling of several A/C motors. Instead of using a simplistic method of aggregating these machines into a single equivalent machine based on their ratings, an analytical approach based on bifurcation theory is presented in this work. The method characterizes the stalling behavior of several A/C motors in the system based on the system voltage level and thus provides a way for a more refined approach to aggregate A/C motor modeling...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{phenomenon}} of Fault-Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) has increasingly been observed. Air conditioner (A/C) <b>motor</b> <b>stalling</b> is considered {{as one of the}} main reasons for the occurrence of delayed voltage recovery events [3]. This thesis studies the possibility that the stalling of a small percentage of induction motors could precipitate FIDVR events. A 12. 5 kV distribution network model with A/C motor load is used to construct certain bifurcation diagrams. Continuation methods based on the predictorcorrector technique are used to arrive at system steady-state solutions tracing the curves of motor behavior while the system bus voltage is varied. The stable and unstable operating points of induction machines are obtained and analyzed. Results show that a small percentage of induction motors stalling could exacerbate the stalling of additional motors. There could be either no stable solutions for the system with a partial number of A/C motors stalled or stable solutions with a certain number of A/C motors stalled, depending on the percentage of integrated motor loads. We conclude that a small percentage of stalled induction motors in practice could precipitate the stalling of additional motors, or even all motors in a distribution network. Thus, a mitigation strategy of replacing a number of ?prone to stall? motors to ?robust? ones may not effective. This information is crucial in developing mitigation plans to avoid a FIDVR event...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{transport}} is {{an essential}} function in eucaryotic cells, facilitated by motor proteins - proteins converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long distances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor domain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with {{a recent study of}} phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating lowered single <b>motor</b> <b>stalling</b> forces. In this article we report the effects of mutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when load on the cargo is {{in the vicinity of the}} mutant's stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the development of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the transition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact computation of average velocity and run-length. It can also be used to introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation and to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors. Our method is easily implementable and we provide a software package for general use. Comment: 28 page article + 7 page supplementary materia...|$|E

40|$|The {{electric}} grid {{is one of}} the major achievements of human kind. In the last hundred years it has grown from small clusters of generation and loads, into large networks containing millions of elements and spanning entire continents. Recently, the increasing deployment of distributed generators (DGs) has triggered a grid transformation from a rigid to a flexible and de-centralized structure. Microgrids are an essential element in this transformation because by grouping DGs and loads into controllable units, they can provide a coordinated response to maximize their impact on the grid. Microgrids are inherently different from the larger grid. This thesis shows how by challenging the paradigm of constant frequency and voltage operation, a new strategy can be implemented to achieve an improved response after large disturbances without compromising safety. Large disturbances are commonly encountered in the grid and disrupt the power balance that is required for a reliable operation. If the imbalance is large enough and the proper actions are not taken, then a blackout will occur, affecting millions of people and creating a severe economic impact. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed operation strategy, two large disturbances are studied: a fault in the distribution network that creates a reactive power imbalance due to induction <b>motor</b> <b>stalling,</b> and a sudden change in generation or consumption that leads to a real power imbalance. In the first part, a framework is created to study fault events and then used to describe a fault recovery strategy that expands the stability region of the system. In the second part, the proposed operation strategy is presented as a new control technique that allows energy to be extracted from the induction motors in the system to achieve an inertial response and provide frequency regulation. All the results are validated using a microgrid experimental set-up that was built as part of this thesis. by Jorge Elizondo Martinez. Thesis: Ph.
