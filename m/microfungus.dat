25|$|Waste {{material}} is removed continuously and deposited in refuse piles as above (or even by some Atta ants into streams). The {{division of labour}} in Acromyrmex echinatior leafcutter ants includes individuals who work almost exclusively in waste management: waste material (excreta, food refuse, etc.) frequently harbours Escovopsis (a <b>microfungus</b> that is parasitic on the fungus that A. echinatior tends) {{as well as other}} parasites, so spatial separation of waste material from the fungal garden and wider nest environment is of paramount importance. This is achieved by depositing waste material on downhill and downwind piles or in special deep underground refuse chambers. Distinct waste management workers also exist in Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. The risk of waste-worker ants contaminating the fungal garden/nest is lowered by other ants attacking them if they try to enter the nest, whilst attacks are more frequent in species with internal refuse chambers (this also reinforces the division of labour). On the other hand, some species retain excreta and/or anal exudates within the nest to utilize it for antiparasite purposes: C. formosanus employs its faces as building material for the nest carton, the use of faceal material promotes the growth of Actinobacteria with natural antimicrobial activity (e.g. Streptomyces), combating fungal parasites like M. anisopliae. Colony members of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) defend themselves against the virulent Crithidia bombi parasite by consuming beneficial gut bacteria from the faces of conspecific after eclosing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microfungi</b> [...] are fungi, {{eukaryotic}} organisms such as molds, mildews and rusts, which exhibit tube tip-growth {{and have}} cell walls composed of chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine. The <b>microfungi</b> are an artificial, paraphyletic group, distinguished from macrofungi {{only by the}} absence of a large, multicellular fruiting body. <b>Microfungi</b> are ubiquitous in all terrestrial and freshwater and marine environments. <b>Microfungi</b> grow in plants, soil, water, insects, cattle rumens, hair, and skin. Most of the fungal body consists of microscopic threads, called hyphae, extending through the substrate in which it grows. The mycelia of <b>microfungi</b> produce thousands of tiny spores that are carried by the air, spreading the fungus.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} trophic niches of sympatric and allopatric {{populations of}} the isopods Asellus aquaticus and Proasellus coxalis were compared in laboratory. Sixteen <b>microfungi</b> were singly offered as the sole food resource for 50 days to young animals born in the laboratory. Furthermore, six of all tested fungi were again offered to young of the F 1 and F 2 generations of P. coxalis from populations living sympatrically. Animals and <b>microfungi</b> were collected in three woodland streams that were similar in geographic location and hydrogeologic, physical and chemical features. The <b>microfungi</b> were {{selected on the basis}} of their constant presence throughout six months of sampling in each of three habitats. The results indicate first, that A. aquaticus and P. coxalis from populations living sympatrically have a potential trophic niche much more differentiated than do the populations living allopatrically. In particular, progeny of the two species when sympatric showed similar survival on only 25 % of the tested fungal resources. Second, the two species when sympatric are specialized for <b>microfungi</b> not very common in nature; more common <b>microfungi</b> are used without distinction by individuals of both species. Third, the exclusiveness of each resource for the sympatric populations increases inversely with the abundance in nature of the resource itself. Fourth, in P. coxalis, the number of survivors eating a particular fungus increases in the F 1 and F 2 vs. parental generations. The results emphasize a possible effect of co-occurrence on character displacement and support the hypothesis of coevolutionary trophic partitioning between the two species. It appears that the importance of <b>microfungi</b> in the co-occurrence relationships of A. aquaticus and P. coxalis is much more than appears from the low estimates of the biomass of the <b>microfungi...</b>|$|R

50|$|Fallen logs {{of white}} spruce and {{trembling}} aspen {{at various stages}} of decomposition were sampled from undisturbed and 1, 14, and 28-year-old post-fire and post-harvest sites in northern Alberta, and studied for differences in the associated <b>microfungus</b> communities (Lumley et al. 2001). Wood samples were plated directly onto each of 6 different media and from these fungal species were identified and enumerated over a 24-month period. Approximately 10 000 isolates were obtained, representing 292 species of filamentous microfungi, including 41 ascomycetes, 29 zygomycetes, and 222 mitosporic fungi. The most commonly isolated species were Trichoderma viride, Rhinocladiella atrovirens, Penicillium pinophilum and Mortierella ramanniana. Cluster analysis and ordination of <b>microfungus</b> communities in logs showed that the tree species of the log had the greatest influence on the species composition of communities. Fungus community composition was also correlated with the stage of decomposition. Species richness was highest in logs from undisturbed sites, and lowest in logs from the most recently disturbed sites. Species diversity (Shannon-Weaver) was only slightly higher at undisturbed sites than at disturbed sites. The most significant environmental factor was log moisture, which increased proportionately with stage of decomposition and was significantly correlated with climatic factors.|$|E
