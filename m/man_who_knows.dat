5|$|A {{friend from}} the {{discussion}} group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying {{a friend of a}} friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E

25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to lie about it. He argues that the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> the subjects about which he tells lies, whether arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy, is twice as powerful as the man who does not know his subjects. Socrates never indicates what a man might stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E
25|$|Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as Bend of the River (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), The Far Country (1954) and The Man from Laramie (1955), were {{perennial}} favorites {{among young}} audiences entranced by the American West. Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws—a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> violence first hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations {{laid the foundation}} for many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewart's screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.|$|E

Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardships. In the prologue, he explains how {{he managed to get}} another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens, is able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy <b>Man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{joined the}} National Press Club and the Burning Tree and Congressional Country Clubs; one {{reporter}} watching Romney hurriedly play golf {{at the last}} said, [...] "There is a young <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> where he is going." [...] Lenore's cultural refinement and hosting skills, along with her father's social and political connections, helped George in business, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures. [...] He was chosen by Pyke Johnson, a Denver newspaperman and automotive industry trade representative he met at the Press Club, to join the newly formed Trade Association Advisory Committee to the National Recovery Administration. [...] The committee's work continued even after the agency was declared unconstitutional in 1935. [...] During 1937 and 1938, Romney was also president of the Washington Trade Association Executives.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{newspaper}} {{gave the}} film a generally favourable assessment: its critic wrote, [...] "Mr. Val Guest, the director, certainly knows his business {{when it comes}} to providing the more horrid brand of thrills... The first part of this particular film is well up to standard. Mr. Brian Donlevy, as the American scientist responsible for the experiment, is a little brusque in his treatment of British institutions but he is clearly a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> what he is doing. Mr. Jack Warner, representing Scotland Yard, is indeed a comfort to have at hand when Things are on the rampage." [...] Positive reviews also came from Peter Burnup in the News of the World, who found that [...] "with the added benefit of bluff, boisterous Brian Donlevy… all earnest addicts of science fiction will undoubtedly love every minute of it" [...] while the reviewer in The Manchester Guardian praised [...] "a narrative style that quite neatly combines the horrific and the factual" [...] and Today's Cinema called it [...] "one of the best essays in science fiction to date" [...] Film historian Bruce G. Hallenbeck notes a degree of national pride in some of the positive reviews. For instance, Paul Dehn in the News Chronicle said, [...] "This is the best and nastiest horror film I have seen since the War. How jolly that it is also British!". Similarly, William Whitebait in the New Statesman, who found the film to be [...] "better than either War of the Worlds or Them!", also called for [...] "a couple of cheers for the reassurance that British films can still, once in a while, come quick".|$|E

500|$|Spin {{positioned}} it {{at number}} 46 {{on their list}} of the best 50 albums of 2013. They said, [...] "Push is in fighting form, incorporating a mature {{point of view on}} his drug-dealer past while rapping with the confidence of a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>knows</b> the game is his to lose." [...] NME positioned it at number 48 on their list of the 50 best albums of year. They said, My Name Is My Name was the moment Clipse member Pusha T finally hit the home run he promised for so long. The beats snapped hard, the guests including Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz glittered and the overall vibe was dirty but triumphant." [...] Paste ranked it number 34 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 saying, [...] "each bar has the ferociousness of a lion smelling the scent of fresh blood. Among his contemporaries, Pusha T is the sharp-witted wordsmith who makes you feel like you’re listening to a master at work, devilishly cooking up something as pure and addictive as he possibly can." [...] It was named the third best hip hop album of 2013 by PopMatters. They commented saying, [...] "My Name Is My Name is easily one of the most impressive displays of lyricism of the year and contains some of 2013's best verses, as Pusha shows off his versatility..... The production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn't overshadow Pusha's performance. The beats are big and full of bass, giving life to the album and forming a unique theme, with a reunion with Pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia..... My Name Is My Name has substance, style, and passion, and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now. [...] " [...] Consequence of Sound positioned it at number 44 on their list of the 50 best albums of the year.|$|E
