"One Minute" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song with electropop influences, and begins with Clarkson singing, [...] "You're going crazy, running on empty / You can't <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> mind / You try to hide it, {{but you had to}} say it / Restless all this time." [...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan. A reviewer for Billboard commented on the song's structure, writing that [...] "One Minute" [...] consists of [...] "rapid-fire give-and-take verses".|$|E

500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months.

Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe".

2500|$|DRM opponents {{argue that}} the {{presence}} of DRM violates existing private property rights and restricts a range of heretofore normal and legal user activities. A DRM component would control a device a user owns (such as a digital audio player) by restricting how it may act with regard to certain content, overriding some of the user's wishes (for example, preventing the user from burning a copyrighted song to CD as part of a compilation or a review). Doctorow has described this possibility as [...] "the right to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> own copyright laws".|$|E

Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside.

2500|$|In 1924, Louis Armstrong {{joined the}} Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as {{featured}} soloist. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong {{was a master}} of his hometown style, {{but by the time}} he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded [...] "stiff, stodgy," [...] with [...] "jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality." [...] The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of [...] "Mandy, <b>Make</b> <b>Up</b> <b>Your</b> Mind" [...] by George W.

2500|$|... "Jaka's Story", {{a tragic}} {{character}} study dealing with gender roles {{and the political}} suppression of art, is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in Reads) contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, but which Sim describes as [...] "anti-feminism". During {{this part of the}} story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional [...] "reads" [...] author, interspersed with the main Cerebus storyline. [...] In Davis' material, he refers to the [...] "creative male light" [...] and the [...] "emotional female void", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of Church and State (namely, the [...] "female light" [...] being raped by the [...] "male void" [...] and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with The Comics Journal, [...] "Cerebus #1-200 [...] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. You <b>make</b> <b>up</b> <b>your</b> mind which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain." [...] By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by an even harsher essay in the back of issue #265 called [...] "Tangent", in which Sim identified a [...] "feminist/homosexualist axis" [...] that opposed traditional and rational societal values. [...] This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.|$|E
