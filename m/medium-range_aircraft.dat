50|$|The Yakovlev Design Bureau {{developed}} {{large numbers}} of fighter aircraft used by the Soviet Air Force during World War II. Particularly well known are the Yak-1, Yak-3 and Yak-9 {{as well as the}} Yak-6 transport. In 1945 Yakovlev designed one of the first Soviet aircraft with a jet engine, the Yak-15. He also designed the first Soviet all-weather interceptor, the Yak-25P, and the first Soviet supersonic bomber, the Yak-28.

50|$|On 12 October 1951, the Comité du matériel civil (civil {{aircraft}} committee) {{published a}} specification for a <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft,</b> which was later {{sent to the}} aviation industry by the Direction technique et industrielle. This called for an aircraft capable of carrying 55 to 65 passengers and 1000 kg of cargo on routes up to 2000 km with a cruising speed of about 600 km/h. The type and number of engines were not specified. Since 1946, various design studies for aircraft in this category had already been underway at several of the leading French aircraft manufacturing organisations, and had resulted in some ambitious concepts being mooted. However, none of these firms possessed the financial power to independently embark on the substantial development work involved, let alone to establish a manufacturing line {{for the construction of}} such aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Following more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was {{proposed}} in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 {{was designed to}} be a high-capacity <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft.</b> It would have a fuselage stretch of 40 ft over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to Boeing's later 777-300 and Airbus A340-600. Like the DC-8, the series 62 {{was proposed}} for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of 26 ft, along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later Boeing 777-200 or the Airbus A330-300/A340-300/500. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as all the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and American Airlines Flight 191, the trijet's reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{aircraft}} pre-design methodologies tend {{to involve}} an increasing amount of disciplines in a concurrent way. Previous research has advanced {{the capabilities of}} interlinking design tools and creating automated, multidisciplinary analysis and design workflows. A central challenge herein {{is found in the}} practical management of disciplinary knowledge. The main question that arises is: how to effectively set up the collaboration among engineers with different specialisations in order to operate the networked tools competently? In this context this paper presents an engineering framework enabling multidisciplinary analysis and optimisation and its application to the advanced pre-design of a short- to <b>medium-ranged</b> <b>aircraft</b> configuration. A system-of-systems approach is established by combining aircraft pre-design with system layout considerations, enforcing knowledge exchange between experts with different backgrounds. Still existing technical, as well as non-technical collaboration barriers are identified and described. It is concluded that although showing large potential for attaining improved design results, larger focus on organising effective collaboration among engineers is required to advance the multidisciplinary design approach to an even higher level...|$|R

50|$|In October 1962, in a {{small office}} in Paris, a final move {{was made in the}} {{protracted}} negotiations. The project was in danger of getting stuck, and there were important matters that still needed to be resolved. The impasse needed to be overcome, and the solution required the consolidation of a special relationship as well as technical expertise. Bill Strang and Lucien Servanty closeted themselves away for a whole day, with a single draughtsman and drawing board, and with an understanding that they would not emerge until they had reached agreement (and an agreed drawing) of the general arrangement for the long-range and <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft.</b> They succeeded, although {{it would be hard to}} imagine two men more unlike in temperament, background and personality - Lucien Servanty, a forceful and fiery character, who did not suffer fools gladly, and Bill Strang, an equable, quiet-spoken man, who led rather than drove his team. They were, one might have thought, a fairly unlikely pair to work together as collaborators on the most difficult technological project ever tackled in Europe. Yet this partnership, like many others in the Concorde organisation, and grew and flourished on the firm basis of mutual respect for the other's intellect and integrity.|$|E

40|$|The {{different}} kinds of fatigue tests are necessary to continue the life of ageing aircraft. The features of landing gear tests of <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> are discussed in this article. Firstly, the fatigue testing with cyclic loading by loads, which act during Standard-type flight, was done. Then different residual strength tests with stepped static loading were carried out: axle beam torsion, braking during landing and running with landing weight. Acoustic emission (AE) and ultrasonic methods were used to check fatigue crack initiation and development. Then they were compared {{with the results of}} fracture analysis. High effectiveness of AE methods for the analysis of initiation and early development of fatigue failures in the process of cyclic loading and residual strength tests is shown...|$|E

5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine <b>medium-range</b> {{transport}} <b>aircraft,</b> and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|R
25|$|The F-15 {{can trace}} its origins to the Vietnam War, when the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy fought over {{tactical}} aircraft {{being used in}} the war. At the time, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was pressing for both services to use as many common aircraft as possible, even if there were performance sacrifices involved. As part of this policy, the USAF and Navy were involved in the TFX (F-111) program, aiming to deliver a <b>medium-range</b> interdiction <b>aircraft</b> in Air Force use that would also serve as a long-range interceptor aircraft for the Navy.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{lightweight}} construction in vehicle manufacturing {{is an interesting}} possibility for reducing fuel consumption. At present {{lightweight construction}}s {{are being used to}} lower the weight not only of new aircraft but also of new terrestrial vehicles. However, these construction methods using new materials place new demands on the level of vehicle acoustics to ensure that passenger comfort is maintained and/or improved. The acoustic and hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations arising from excitation of the fuselage during cruise flight, of the side window in cars and of the body of high-speed trains {{is one of the major}} sources of noise. The German Aerospace Center conducted three flight tests on a single aisle <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> to measure the noise excitation, transmission and radiation into the cabin. These measurements are used to quantify the excitation and to validate numerical simulations. A pressure sensor array was used to measure the turbulent boundary layer. With this array it was possible to separate the hydrodynamic from the acoustic pressure fluctuations. The results are used to describe the aeroacoustic sources in a more precise manner than that given by the two current, state of the art models (Corcos, Efimtsov). These same methods were used to measure the hydrodynamic and acoustic pressure fluctuations at the side window of a generic car model...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{accidents}} {{of commercial}} airplanes {{have raised the}} question once more whether pilots can rely on automation in order to fly advanced aircraft safely. Although the issue of human-machine interaction in aviation has been investigated frequently, profound knowledge about pilots’ perceptions and attitudes is fragmentary and partly out-dated. The paper at hand {{presents the results of}} a pilot survey, which has been guided by a collaborative perspective of human-automation decision-making. It puts emphasis on the hybrid interaction of human actors and non-human technical agents and the role distribution in the digital cockpit. The key question is whether pilots have confidence in human-automation collaboration, even in the case of automated systems, which act more and more autonomously. The results are partly surprising: confidence in hybrid collaboration is rather high, depending mostly on perceived symmetry of humans and automation as well as on perceived change of competencies and role distribution. The perception of complexity is only average, and – most unexpected – this factor does not negatively affect pilots’ confidence in hybrid collaboration. The differences between Airbus and Boeing pilots are much lower than assumed, but pilots of regional jets, mostly flying short- or <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft,</b> differ from both groups remarkably, presumably due to their specific task profile, including a high number of opportunities to collaborate with automation...|$|E
40|$|Operator {{interaction}} with modern control systems {{is a topic}} of great concern in high-risk industries such as nuclear power and commercial aviation. The issues associated with such systems focus {{on the ability of}} the operators (e. g., pilots) to achieve mission goals safely while containing failures. Operators must be able to interact safely and reliably with highly automatic and complex systems across the full spectrum of possible operating conditions, including normal, abnormal, and emergency situations. In environments such as commercial aviation, operator {{interaction with}} the machine is specified through a set of standard operating procedures (SOP). A procedure represents a collective agreement on the 'best' way to perform a given task. The intent {{of this paper is to}} suggest a formal methodology, for designing and evaluating procedures, that is both reliable and systematic. Our approach involves two major elements: a model of the machine and a list of the operator's task specifications (goals). We use formal modeling paradigms for describing the system and super-imposing on it the operator's tasks. Such paradigms, based on recent frameworks such as Statecharts and Hierarchical Hybrid Machines appear to be adequate methods for analyzing operator interaction with modern control systems. To illustrate this methodology, we model and analyze the sequence of actions for an emergency procedure. The procedure, Irregular Engine Start, for a <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircraft,</b> specifies the sequence of immediate actions that must be performed by the crew to avoid an uncontrolled rise in engine temperature during start-up. A model of engine behavior during a hot start is constructed. It also describes the various actions that can be taken by the crew and the resulting outcomes. The model is then opened up as a tree of all possible action sequences. This action tree allows us to trace the correct sequences necessary to achieve the desired end-goal (secure and shut down of the engine). In conclusion, we argue that the current process of designing and evaluating procedures can be improved. We discuss the implications of this approach for designing and evaluating this and other types of procedures. We conclude with insights about the benefits and limitation of this methodology, and offer suggestions for future research...|$|E

40|$|Main {{results of}} glaciological and {{geophysical}} engineering surveys, conducted during three summer field seasons of 2013 – 2016 (59 – 61 st Russian Antarctic Expeditions  – RAE) near the Russian Station Mirny (East Antarctica), {{are discussed in}} the paper. Objective of these works was to site and then to organize a new airfield for landing of <b>medium-range</b> <b>aircrafts</b> with ski landing gears. Investigations included aerial photography, GPR surveys (georadar profiling), ice core drilling, and installation of landmarks to measure velocity of the glacier motion. The GSSI ground-penetrating radars with the main frequencies of 270  MHz and 900  MHz were used. In addition, special explorations were conducted for detecting the englacial crevasses by means of remote-sensing methods. The GPR data allowed a revealing the boundary between snow-andfirn thickness and atmospheric ice. In the course of processing of 252 travel-time curves of the diffracted waves a kinematic model of the sub-surface part of the glacier has been constructed. It was found that the dielectric permittivity of the snowfirn thickness averages  2. 43; similar value for the atmospheric ice amounts to  3. 0. The GPR data made it possible to determine intraglacial (englacial) crevasses and to choose the most favorable field for the landing.
