2500|$|The {{expansion}} of the park into Jackson Hole brought a requirement for new facilities at the new park gateway at Moose. The Mission 66 program was conceived in 1955 {{to deal with the}} dramatic increase in visitation, particularly automobile-borne tourism, being experienced Park Service-wide. The Moose Visitor Center, a new administration building, and employee residences were built at Moose, just downstream from Menor's Ferry, where a bridge crossed the Snake River. At about the same time the Colter Bay Village complex was developed on Jackson Lake {{in the northern part of}} the park, providing camping, lodging and <b>marina</b> <b>services.</b> The largest development of this era was the new Jackson Lake Lodge, a reinterpretation of the traditional Park Service lodge concept in a modern style by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood. [...] Underwood, who had designed the rustic Bryce Canyon and Grand Canyon lodges as well as Yosemite's Ahwahnee Hotel, made a sharp break from the naturalistic rustic style, using concrete and steel and straight, sharp lines while he incorporated traditionally rustic colors and textures, framing a view of Mount Moran from the main lobby.

40|$|Includes bibliography. Although tourism {{has been}} a major {{economic}} sector in the Car ibbean s ince the mid- 1960 s, the sector now faces significant challenges as competit ion intensif ies in the global tourism market. These challenges include environmental impacts, and the need for continued high levels of public investment in order to sustain the tourism product. The precariousness of the sector was made starkly evident with the onset of the global recession in 2009, when the sector recorded significant decline. Notwithstanding some limited recovery since that time, the recent experience highlighted the need for Caribbean countries to undertake more vigorous efforts towards diversifying their economies in general, and enhancing their tourism sectors in particular. One area identif ied for specific development is yachting and <b>marina</b> <b>services,</b> a sub-sector which is widely regarded as having significant economic potential. Towards this end, the present study seeks to examine the nature of recreational demand for yachting and <b>marina</b> <b>services</b> in the Caribbean. In order to achieve this, a simple demand model is estimated, and elast icities calculated for three demand var iables. Using data from eight countries, the model identified income in the source market, airline t icket cost, and the frequency of hurricanes as the three most critical variables which influenced consumers’ decision to seek yachting and <b>marina</b> <b>services</b> in the Caribbean. I. Tourism and <b>marina</b> <b>services</b> in the Caribbean. [...] II. The demand for <b>marina</b> <b>services</b> in the Caribbean – theoretical framework. [...] III. Specifying the demand model. [...] IV. Model estimation and results. [...] V. Policy implications and recommendations. [...] VI. Conclusion and limitations of the research...|$|E

A 1991 study by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation proposed the extension of Highway 555 (Granary Lake Road) from Blind River to meet Spine Road in Elliot Lake, creating a new route which would reduce the length of a commute between the two communities by approximately 20 kilometres. Although the ministry has announced no firm plans to construct the proposed road, Elliot Lake City Council passed a motion in August 2015 calling for the project's revival {{on the grounds that it}} would provide significant economic benefit to both communities.|$|R
