5|$|<b>Motions</b> of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral <b>motions</b> include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. <b>Motions</b> in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. <b>Motions</b> in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E

High dimensional <b>motion</b> capture date are represented using a low dimensional representation by topology preserving network, which maps similar <b>motion</b> instances {{to the neighborhood}} points on the low dimensional <b>motion</b> manifold. Nonlinear manifold learning between a low dimensional manifold representation and high dimensional <b>motion</b> data provides a generative model to synthesize new <b>motion</b> sequence by controlling trajectory on the low dimensional <b>motion</b> manifold. We segment <b>motion</b> primitives by analyzing low dimensional representation of body poses through <b>motion</b> from <b>motion</b> captured data. Clustering techniques like k-means algorithms are used to find <b>motion</b> primitives after dimensionality reduction. <b>Motion</b> dynamics in training sequences can be described by transition characteristics of <b>motion</b> primitives. The transition matrix represents the temporal dynamics of the <b>motion</b> with Markovian assumption. We can generate new <b>motion</b> sequences by perturbing the temporal dynamics. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Motion</b> {{planning}} {{is an essential}} task for humanoid robots. However, it is still very challenging to obtain good <b>motion</b> performance in humanoid <b>motion</b> planning, because of its high DOFs (degree of freedoms), variable mechanical structure and nonlinearity. In humanoid <b>motion</b> planning, the <b>motion</b> performance can be given only after one whole cycle <b>motion</b> is completed. This is a demanding condition for <b>motion</b> planning on either real robots or simulation platform. In this paper, a DFNN (dynamic neural fuzzy network) is adopted to model humanoid robots for <b>motion</b> planning. The inputs of DFNN are parameters which determine <b>motion</b> of humanoid robots. The output is evaluation of humanoid <b>motion</b> performance. The DFNN after training can give evaluation of <b>motion</b> performance immediately once the parameters are determined. The DFNN models not only the dynamics of robots, also the <b>motion</b> planning method. Therefore, the DFNN stores two kind of knowledge: the mapping be-tween parameters and humanoid <b>motion,</b> the mapping between humanoid <b>motion</b> and <b>motion</b> performance. I...|$|R
