The Act, in the main, is {{retrospective}} to 1 January 2011 and it creates virtual parity, in taxation matters, between civil partners {{on the one hand and}} <b>married</b> <b>people</b> on the other hand. The Social Welfare Code had already been amended in December 2010 {{to take account of}} civil partnership.|$|E
5|$|<b>Married</b> <b>people,</b> however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati. It {{is said that}} her worship creates a feeling of wanting {{solitude}} and distaste of worldly things, which is considered as highest characteristics of a spiritual quest. Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the Westridge area on the 1928 electoral roll numbered over 130. At the , Yarralumla had a {{population of}} 2,890 people. Of these 46.9% were male. The suburb had only 1.0% indigenous Australians, substantially {{below the national average}} of 2.8%. The percentage of <b>married</b> <b>people</b> in the suburb was nine points higher than the national average, and the proportion of residents who had never married was 9 points lower. Despite the higher level of marriage, this did not translate into a higher level of children; 49.6% of families consisted of a couple without children in the household, compared to the national average of 37.8%. Yarralumla residents had a median age of 49, compared to a Canberra average of 35. The suburb had an older population for a city of young people; the median national age is 38 and 41.7% of Yarralumla residents were 55 or over, compared to the national figure of 27.6%.|$|E

40|$|Most <b>people</b> do not <b>marry</b> <b>people</b> {{who are too}} close, {{household}} {{members for}} example. However, nor do they <b>marry</b> <b>people</b> who are too far, such as total strangers for themselves or their family. In other words, they typically <b>marry</b> <b>people</b> with whom they {{have some sort of}} previous connection. In certain post-industrial settings, and perhaps elsewhere as well, prior linkages relating to employment, schooling, religious affiliation and so on undoubtedly intervene in the orientation of marriage choices. However, in most places, most of the time, such considerations remain subordinate to the role played by other types of relationship, namely those deriving from kinship and marriage themselves. In short, as a general rule, most <b>people</b> <b>marry</b> <b>people</b> with whom some sort of direct or indirect kinship or in-law relationship already exists. This common-place observation has far-reaching implications. As many of the previously related spouses of each generation give birth to children who themselves marry persons with whom they are directly or indirectly related, a higher-order social entity comes into being: a dense network of interlocking consanguinal and affinal ties. Such a network can be likened to a particularly complicated tangle of strings (o...|$|R

25|$|A {{criticism}} of marriage {{is that it}} gives the state an undue power and control over the private lives of the citizens. The statutes governing marriage are drafted by the state, and not by the couples who marry under those laws.

25|$|Self-verification strivings {{may also}} {{influence}} the social contexts that people enter into and remain in.

College roommates behave in a similar manner. People {{are more inclined to}} divorce partners who perceived them too favorably.

This shows that the percentage of people who are married is declining while the percentage of people who have never been married is on the rise.|$|E

25|$|Davis' second term, {{which lasted}} only ten months, was {{dominated}} by the recall election. Davis signed into law several controversial measures during the closing weeks of the recall campaign, including one granting drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants. Davis also signed legislation requiring employers to pay for medical insurance for workers and legislation granting domestic partners {{many of the same}} rights as <b>married</b> <b>people.</b> He vetoed legislation that would have given undocumented immigrants free tuition for community college. Many of Davis' opponents were furious over the signings of these measures so late in his administration. Some political observers saw these efforts as an attempt to reinforce support from Hispanics, labor union members and liberal Democrats. Ultimately, Davis did not have as much support from Hispanics and union members in the recall election as he did in his 2002 re-election.|$|E
