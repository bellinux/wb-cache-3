40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a methodological {{procedure}} for supporting decision makers in transport planning. The methodology is adopted for evaluating safety conditions in a road infrastructure. Public administrations need to reduce road accidents and injuries, so as to reduce the social costs of transport. However dwindling financial resources for road <b>maintenance</b> <b>call</b> for targeted interventions to achieve the best results, optimizing resources for the most critical sections. In this analysis, the multicriteria method Electre III is used, a ranking procedure applied in the specific case to a suburban road system. The analysis provides some indications for choosing and ranking the most critical sections of the network. The safety conditions of an infrastructure of roads can be determined as a function of accidents, injuries, fatalities and exposure to risk and depend on road and traffic characteristics. In this analysis safety conditions for each road section are measured on the basis of several criteria including number of accidents, state of road maintenance, curvature, grade, access-point density. Values of the criteria are obtained from on-site measurements. This analysis is based on a comparison of criteria and alternatives. It identifies priorities for safety interventions. The road sections have been hierarchically ranked, according to the priority of interventions for improving safety conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} governmental {{policies and}} measures that regulate the use of animal manure in the European Union (EU- 15). Systematic intervention by governments with European agriculture in general started {{at the end of}} the 19 th century. Major changes in governmental policies on agriculture followed after the establishment of the EU and its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 1957. Environmental side effects of the large-scale intensification of agricultural production were addressed following the reform of the CAP and the implementation of various environmental regulations and directives from the beginning of the 1990 s. The Nitrate Directive approved in 1991 has exerted, as yet, the strongest influence on intensive livestock production systems. This directive regulates the use of N in agriculture, especially through its mandatory measures to designate areas vulnerable to nitrate leaching and to establish action programs and codes of good agricultural practice for these areas. These measures have to ensure that for each farm the amount of N applied via livestock manure shall not exceed 170 kg•ha– 1 •yr– 1. These measures have large consequences, especially for countries with intensive animal agriculture, including The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Ireland. The mean livestock density in these countries is between 1. 5 and 4 livestock units/ha, and the average amounts of N in animal manure range from 100 to 300 kg/ha of agricultural land. More than 10 yr after approval of the Nitrate Directive, there appears to be a delay in the implementation and enforcement in many member states, which reflects in part the major complications that arise from this directive for intensive livestock farming. It also reflects the fact that environmental policies in agriculture have economic consequences. The slow progress in the enforcement of environmental legislations in agriculture combined with the increasing public awareness of food safety, animal welfare, and landscape <b>maintenance</b> <b>call</b> for a more fundamental change in EU agriculture...|$|E

From the perspective of operation and maintenance (O&M) world, the vital knowledge requirements from PHM are indicators of degraded health condition (alarm, warnings, call for inspection, etc.), estimates of time to onset of such indicators, estimate of time to maintenance, and ahead-of-time diagnostics for identification of the root causes (or sources) that will likely cause these <b>maintenance</b> <b>calls.</b> Such knowledge provides lead time to the operators and system maintainers to prepare for inspection and schedule maintenance opportunistically, so as to minimize downtime and optimize maintenance cost...|$|R

In order to perform parallel view maintenance, we solve two issues: detecting maintenance-concurrent data updates in a parallel mode, and correcting the problem that the DW commit order may not correspond to the DW update processing order due to parallel maintenance handling.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{application}} and covering number {{bound for the}} framework of "Machine Learning with Operational Costs (MLOC)," which is an exploratory form of decision theory. The MLOC framework incorporates knowledge about how a predictive model {{will be used for}} a subsequent task, thus combining machine learning with the decision that is made afterwards. In this work, we use the MLOC framework to study a problem that has implications for power grid reliability and <b>maintenance,</b> <b>called</b> the Machine Learning and Traveling Repairman Problem ML&TRP. The goal of the ML&TRP is to determine a route for a "repair crew," which repairs nodes on a graph. The repair crew aims to minimize the cost of failures at the nodes, but as in many real situations, the failure probabilities are not known and must be estimated. The MLOC framework allows us to understand how this uncertainty influences the repair route. We also present new covering number generalization bounds for the MLOC framework.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} optimal {{maintenance}} planning of preventive maintenance and renewal activities for components {{in a single}} railway track when the available time for maintenance is limited. The rail-track system consists of several types of components, such as rail, ballast, and switches with different preventive maintenance and renewal intervals. To perform maintenance or renewal on the track, a train free period for <b>maintenance,</b> <b>called</b> a possession, is required. Since a major possession directly affects the regular train schedule, maintenance and renewal activities are clustered as much as possible. In a highly dense and utilized railway network, the possession time on the track is critical since the demand for train operations is very high and a long possession has a severe impact on the regular train schedule. We present an optimization model and investigate the maintenance schedules with and without the possession capacity constraint. In addition, we also integrate the social-economic cost related {{to the effects of}} the maintenance time to the variable possession cost into the optimization model. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the model...|$|R
40|$|The one-session {{treatment}} (OST) {{approach for}} SPs is deemed well-established, {{and has been}} found to be highly effective for older children and adults; however, has not yet been trialled with very young children. The present study examines the preliminary effectiveness of play-modified OST for young children with a SP of dogs, using a multiple baseline controlled case series design. Treatment involved play modified one-session of intensive cognitive-behavioural therapy (OST plus Play) which was followed by brief telephone delivered <b>maintenance</b> <b>calls</b> over the 3 weeks immediately following treatment. Four young children (4 years of age) participated and symptoms were assessed at pre-treatment, across a 1 – 3 week baseline phase, immediately following the OST plus Play, and at 1 and 3 months follow-up. Visual inspection provided evidence for stability of symptoms across the baseline phase, followed by reductions in symptoms over the course of treatment and follow-up. Non-parametric analyses offered further support, with significant improvements in following the intensive OST plus Play intervention. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyFull Tex...|$|R
