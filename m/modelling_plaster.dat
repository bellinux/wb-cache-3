40|$|BACKGROUND The EUROCRAN index {{has been}} used in inter-center studies to assess dental arch {{relationship}} (DAR) and palatal morphology (PM) in children with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP). For this type of inter-center research, a scoring method that could be performed over the internet would be the most effective. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the reliability of application of the EUROCRAN index on 3 D digital models or photographs of <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> instead of using <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> METHODS The EUROCRAN reference models were presented in three formats: <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> 2 D photographs of <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> and 3 D digital <b>models.</b> <b>Plaster</b> <b>models</b> of children with UCLP (n[*]=[*] 45) were rated. Of each case, all three formats were rated by six calibrated observers in random order. The strength of agreement of the ratings was assessed with kappa statistics. Concordance among observers was evaluated with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS The ICC showed a good inter-observer agreement for the DAR and poor inter-observer agreement for the PM. Intra-observer agreement for the DAR was moderate to very good, yet for the PM poor to moderate. Comparison between the three formats per observer for the DAR was good or very good and for the PM moderate to poor. CONCLUSIONS The overall results show that the EUROCRAN index is an acceptable and reliable scoring method for the DAR on <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> 2 D photographs of <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> and 3 D digital models. However, due to the small range of deviations in palatal morphology between the cases in our study, the PM component of the index was difficult to assess. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In clinical audits and inter-center studies, <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> can be substituted by 2 D photographs of plaster casts or 3 D digital models when grading treatment outcome with the EUROCRAN index...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} if digital study models are a satisfactory alternative to <b>plaster</b> study <b>models.</b> Method: 1. Pilot study to compare linear measurements from <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with {{two types of}} digital model. 2. Study to compare PAR scores from <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with digital models created from scans of dental impressions. 3. Pilot study to compare PAR scores of <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with 30 printed models created from scans of dental impressions. Results: A mean difference of <O. 5 mm (range 0. 02 - 0. 51 mm) for single linear measurements and < 3. 0 mm (0. 47 - 3. 03 mm) for multiple linear measurements was indicated. A mean difference of 0. 03 PAR points (SD= 3) was demonstrated between PAR scores for <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and digital models. A mean difference of 1 PAR point (SD= 3) was demonstrated between PAR scores for <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and 30 printed models. Conclusions: Both types of digital study model may be comparable with <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> when used for linear measurements. Digital models created from scans of dental impressions are indicated to be comparable with <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> for PAR scoring. 30 printed models may be comparable to <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> for PAR scoring.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} linear measurements in virtual models by comparing measurements performed on virtual models obtained from alginate impression scans, <b>plaster</b> <b>model</b> and measurements performed on conventional <b>plaster</b> <b>model.</b> Methods: The sample comprised 26 randomly selected patients to have impressions of their upper and lower jaws taken using alginate and their bite registration using a wax bite. The virtual models were obtained by scanning the alginate impression and the <b>plaster</b> <b>model</b> in a laser surface scanner (R 700; 3 Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark), and the measurements were performed using the Ortho Analyser (3 Shape) proprietary software. The linear measurements {{of the size of}} the teeth mesial to distal, arch perimeter, intercanine distance and intermolar distance in the upper and lower arches were performed on <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> digital impressions and digital models, by three observers and repeated after 15 days on 8 models for intra-observer evaluations. Data were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Intra-class correlation to check the agreement of intra and inter-observers and ANOVA test were used to analyze the differences between measurements of digital models from impression and digital <b>models</b> from <b>plaster.</b> Results: The results showed a statistically significant difference (pd" 0. 05) for the posterior teeth, anterior teeth, upper arch perimeter and lower inter-canine distance, comparing the digital <b>models</b> with <b>plaster</b> <b>models,</b> but these differences are considered clinically non-significant. Conclusions: Digital models were proven be reliable and clinically acceptable for measuring tooth width, perimeter arches, intercanine and intermolar distances...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: The {{accuracy}} and reliability of <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and digital models acquired with two different surface laser scanners were tested by means of three methods: measurement with calipers, digital measurement with proper software and superimposition of the digital <b>models.</b> Methods: Thirty <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with permanent dentition that met the inclusion criteria were selected and scanned with two laser scanners (R 700 and Xcad). Three examiners measured distances on <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with a digital caliper and on digital models using Ortho Analyzer software. The digital models were also compared by means of superimposition of the models using the Geomagic Qualify software. The intra and inter-examiner reliability of the measurements were evaluated using the ICC. Paired t {{test was used to}} test the accuracy of the measurements on digital and <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Results: The measurements on <b>plaster</b> and digital <b>models</b> acquired by two different scanners showed high values for the ICC. Although statistically significant differences between the measurements on <b>plaster</b> and digital <b>models</b> have been found, these discrepancies were not considered clinically relevant. The superimposition method with Geomagic Qualify software showed that the two digital models were not significantly different.

This paper quantifies, for the first time, the variations in the rectified casts between two experienced prosthetists and the variation between the rectified casts of each individual prosthetist. Prosthetists A and B observed the hand casting of a typical trans-tibial amputee. Each prosthetist was supplied with 5 previously measured duplicated <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> The two prosthetists rectified the supplied <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> based on their own interpretation of basic rectification guidelines. Both prosthetists operated in isolation. The re-measured rectified <b>plaster</b> <b>model</b> data was compared with the unrectified data. The extent of rectification at each of 1800 locations per <b>plaster</b> <b>model</b> was calculated. In zones of major rectification, the mean difference between prosthetists was quantified as 2 mm and the standard deviation (SD) about that mean was ± 1 mm for each prosthetist. The co-ordinates of the apex of the fibular head for the 10 modified casts indicated that the maximum variation was in the axial direction with a SD of 4. 3 mm for prosthetist A and a SD of 2. 8 mm for prosthetist B. The lengths of the 5 <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> rectified by prosthetist A indicated a SD of 0. 2 mm whereas the lengths of the 5 <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> rectified by prosthetist B indicated a SD of 2. 9 mm...|$|R

40|$|Dental {{measurements}} {{have been}} commonly taken from <b>plaster</b> dental <b>models</b> obtained from alginate impressions can. Through {{the use of}} an intraoral scanner, digital impressions now acquire the information directly from the mouth. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the validity of the intraoral scans compared to <b>plaster</b> <b>models.</b> Two types of dental models (intraoral scan and <b>plaster</b> <b>model)</b> of 20 subjects were included in this study. The subjects had impressions taken of their teeth and made as <b>plaster</b> <b>model.</b> In addition, their mouths were scanned with the intraoral scanner and the scans were converted into digital models. Eight transverse and 16 anteroposterior measurements, 24 tooth heights and widths were recorded on the <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> with a digital caliper and on the intraoral scan with 3 D reverse engineering software. For 3 D surface analysis, the two models were superimposed by using best-fit algorithm. The average differences between the two models at all points on the surfaces were computed. Paired t-test and Bland-Altman plot were used to determine the validity of measurements from the intraoral scan compared to those from the <b>plaster</b> <b>model.</b> There were no significant differences between the <b>plaster</b> <b>models</b> and intraoral scans, except for one measurement of lower intermolar width. The Bland-Altman plots of all measurements showed that differences between the two models were within the limits of agreement. The average surface difference between the two models was within 0. 10 mm. The results of the present study indicate that the intraoral scans are clinically acceptable for diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry and can be used in place of <b>plaster</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
