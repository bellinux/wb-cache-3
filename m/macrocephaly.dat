25|$|Hemimegalencephaly is an {{extremely}} rare form of <b>macrocephaly</b> and is characterized by uneven development of brain hemispheres (one-half of brain is larger than other). The syndrome can be presented by itself or in association with phakomatosis or hemigigantism.

2500|$|Amongst 279 {{patients}} who had been reported to have GA1, 185 were symptomatic (two thirds); being symptomatic {{was seen as an}} indication of [...] "low treatment efficacy". High risk screening, neonatal screening and a diagnosis of <b>macrocephaly</b> were the ways to identify bearers of the GCDH defective gene who weren't frankly symptomatic. <b>Macrocephaly</b> remains the main sign of GA1 for those who aren't related to GA1 in any way or benefit from no screening program.

2500|$|Peek {{was born}} in Salt Lake City, Utah with <b>macrocephaly,</b> damage to the cerebellum, and {{agenesis}} of the corpus callosum, {{a condition in which}} the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain is missing; in Peek's case, secondary connectors such as the anterior commissure were also missing. There is speculation that his neurons made unusual connections due to the absence of a corpus callosum, which resulted in an increased memory capacity. According to Peek's father, Fran (Francis) Peek, Kim was able to memorize things from the age of 16–20 months. He read books, memorized them, and then placed them upside down on the shelf to show that he had finished reading them, a practice he maintained all his life. He could speed through a book in about an hour and remember almost everything he had read, memorizing vast amounts of information in subjects ranging from history and literature, geography and numbers to sports, music and dates. Peek read by scanning the left page with his left eye, then the right page with his right eye. [...] According to an article in The Times newspaper, he could accurately recall the contents of at least 12,000 books.|$|E

Pathologic <b>macrocephaly</b> is called [...] "syndromic" [...] when it is associated with any other noteworthy condition, and [...] "nonsyndromic" [...] otherwise. Pathologic <b>macrocephaly</b> can be caused by congenital anatomic abnormalities, genetic conditions, or by environmental events.|$|E
