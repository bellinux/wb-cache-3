Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new party Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio.

5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} school teachers begin their teacher education at the University of Malta by gaining a Bachelor of Education (Honours), which typically takes four years of study to achieve.

University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a postgraduate certificate in education. Two years of professional teaching practice is also generally required. The <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Education</b> may also grant a temporary warrant to teach, valid for one year, to any person the Minister believes has the ability to teach in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Government's {{adherence}} to secularism {{has been criticized}} in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. For instance, in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to national schools. Section 61 of the Education Act empowers the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Education</b> to regulate schools, including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform. The parents of the schoolgirls took {{the view that the}} Ministry of Education's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls' freedom of religion under Article 15(1). While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry, the controversy showed the Singapore Government's steadfastness in insisting on secularism and the difficulties in reconciling secularism and freedom of religion in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the demand}} for {{education}} rose, especially for high school education. There was also a rising need to cater to {{students enrolled in the}} elementary schools affiliated to the Hokkien Hway Kuan. Thus, Nan Chiau Teachers' Training College was converted into a girls' high school, featuring a primary school section. Mr Yang Zhen Li was the first Principal of the institution, which had an initial student enrollment of 900. A female hostel was also built in the 1950s. By the 1960s, Nan Chiau Girls' High had gained {{reputation as one of the}} state's top high schools. In 1965, 2 million dollars was spent by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan to rebuild Nan Chiau Girl's High School to meet the needs of an increased student enrollment. During the re-construction, the high school section conducted lessons at a temporary campus at Guillemard Road, whilst the primary school section continued lessons at the unaffected classroom blocks of the Kim Yam Road campus. The new campus was officially opened by then <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Education</b> Mr. Ong Pang Boon, on 8 March 1969.|$|E
5|$|Bruxner detested the UAP Deputy Leader and Minister for Public Works and Local Government, Eric Spooner, whom Bruxner saw {{as trying}} to {{undermine}} confidence in Steven's leadership and reducing Country Party influence in the government. When Stevens went {{on a visit to}} London in March 1936 for six months until October, Bruxner became Acting Premier, with Spooner as Acting Deputy. The animosity between the two became most pronounced at this time, often over the most petty issues. In May 1937, Bruxner visited the United Kingdom {{as a member of the}} NSW parliamentary delegation to the coronation of King George VI. At the March 1938 election, the Stevens-Bruxner government retained power against Lang and the still-divided Labor Party. Bruxner was re-elected with 61% of the vote. Bruxner worked with his long-time friend, now <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Education</b> David Drummond, to establish a regional tertiary education institution.
