She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was panned by critics, and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film. In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, {{it did not have}} a theatrical release until 2007. Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes. DVD talk concluded that [...] "fans would be <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> pretending the movie never happened in the first place".|$|E
500|$|According to {{the musical}} scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his {{well-known}} bon mot about Saint-Saëns, [...] "He knows everything, but lacks inexperience" [...] ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience"). The winner, Victor Sieg, {{had a career}} no more notable {{than that of the}} 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may [...] "have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency". The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, [...] "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> when it does." [...] The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was [...] "a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul". The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as [...] "Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius", and [...] "Bad music well written".|$|E

2500|$|The novel {{received}} some positive early reviews. In USA Today, novelist Thomas Gifford compared Just This Once to another novel {{in the same}} genre, American Star by Jackie Collins. Gifford concluded: [...] "If you do like this stuff, you'd be much, <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> with the one written by the computer." [...] The Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly declared that Susann [...] "would be proud. Lots of money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|This debate {{took place}} on 3 November 2006 and was {{televised}} by RTL4. Participants were Jan Peter Balkenende and Wouter Bos. Balkenende focused on his achievements the last four years, stating [...] "We are <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than four years ago. We were behind in Europe and now we’re ahead but our work is not yet done." [...] Bos felt that under Balkenende the {{gap between rich and}} poor had grown, stating [...] "What have you asked of the wealthiest? Everybody has been asked to dig into their pockets to contribute to the economy." [...] In an opinion poll conducted by TNS-Nipo following the televised debate, 50 percent of respondents thought Wouter Bos won the debate, against 46 percent for Jan Peter Balkenende.|$|E
2500|$|Personally, Courtney never drank an {{alcoholic}} beverage or used {{any form of}} tobacco. He also had strong views against alcohol and tobacco use by his rowers because he believed it would affect their ability to work. Courtney summed up his view: [...] "I have found in my experience that young men are <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off,</b> and do better work, without alcoholic stimulants than with them, and they are, therefore, absolutely prohibited in our training. As to tobacco, I believe young men do better work when not using tobacco than when using it, and it is prohibited in our training here at Cornell University.” This went against old traditional rowing practice of drinking beer instead water during training. It was believed that alcohol would strengthen the body while water would weaken the body.|$|E

2500|$|On May 1, 1947, 23-year-old Evelyn McHale {{leapt to}} her death from the 86th floor {{observation}} deck and landed on a limousine parked at the curb. Photography student Robert Wiles took a photo of McHale's oddly intact corpse {{a few minutes after}} her death. The police found a suicide note among possessions that she left on the observation deck: [...] "He is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> without me.... I wouldn’t make a good wife for anybody". The photo ran in the edition of May 12, 1947 of Life magazine and {{is often referred to as}} [...] "The Most Beautiful Suicide". It was later used by visual artist Andy Warhol in one of his prints entitled Suicide (Fallen Body). A [...] mesh fence was put up around the 86th floor terrace in December 1947 after five people tried to jump during a three-week span in October and November of that year. By then, sixteen people had died from suicide jumps.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, Susie's father, {{who becomes}} obsessed with his daughter's murder case. Wahlberg stated that {{his role in}} the film {{encouraged}} him to be a more cautious parent with his three children and to talk to them more about [...] "not talking to strangers." [...] Before Wahlberg's casting, Ryan Gosling was set to play the role but dropped out of the film in October 2007, one month before filming. Gosling had gained weight and grown a beard for the role, but said, [...] "The age of the character versus my real age [...] was always a concern of mine. Peter [...] and I tried to make it work and ultimately it just didn't. I think the film is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> with Mark Wahlberg in that role." [...] Gosling later admitted that the real reason for his firing was that he had arrived for filming 60lbs. overweight and sporting a beard, without having discussed the physical change with Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|When Bow was 16, {{her mother}} Sarah fell from a second-story window and {{suffered}} a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with [...] "psychosis due to epilepsy". From her earliest years, Bow had {{learned how to}} care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be [...] "mean" [...] to her, but [...] "didn't mean to... she couldn't help it". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; [...] "As a kid I took care of my mother, she didn't take care of me". Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she [...] "would be <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> dead". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother up. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode, and later she was committed to a sanatorium by Robert Bow.|$|E

The robustly good trellis codes provide a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> trade <b>off</b> between free distance and distance profile. The unequal error protection capabilities of convolutional codes was studied. The problem of finding good large constraint length, low rate convolutional codes for deep space applications is investigated.
