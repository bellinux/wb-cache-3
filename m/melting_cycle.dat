This required preparation of tape with a calibrated width from impregnated fibre sheets. The unidirectional tapes showed polymer-rich zones on the surface. During manufacture the polypropylene (PP) is melted locally with a laser. A consolidation step in a hot press is then required to reduce void content. The flax fibres, composed of polysaccharides, have limited thermal resistance so optimization of the thermal cycle is necessary, but subsequent characterization of mechanical behaviour showed no evidence of property loss in spite of an additional <b>melting</b> <b>cycle.</b> AFP appears to be a promising manufacturing method for biocomposites...|$|E

40|$|Materials and {{processes}} for {{the testing of}} aluminum-base fiber and particle composites, and of metal foams under extended-time low-g conditions were investigated. A wetting and dispersion technique was developed, based {{on the theory that}} under the absence of a gas phase all solids are wetted by liquids. The process is characterized by a high vacuum environment and a high temperature cycle. Successful wetting and dispersion experiments were carried out with sapphire fibers, whiskers and particles, and with fibers of silicon carbide, pyrolytic graphite and tungsten. The developed process and facilities permit the preparation of a precomposite which serves as sample material for flight experiments. Low-g processing consists then merely in the uniform redistribution of the reinforcements during a <b>melting</b> <b>cycle.</b> For the preparation of metal foams, gas generation by means of a thermally decomposing compound was found most adaptable to flight experiments.

The measurements con-firmed the high sensitivity of microwave emission at 19 and 37 GHz to the melting-refreezing cycles of snow. Moreover, micrometeoro-logical data made it possible to simulate snow density, tempera-ture, and liquid water content through a hydrological snowpack model and provided additional insight into these processes. Simu-lations obtained with a two-layer electromagnetic model based on the strong fluctuation theory and driven by the output of the hy-drological snowpack model were consistent with experimental data and allowed interpretation of both variation in microwave emission during the melting and refreezing phases and in discerning the con-tributions of the upper and lower layers of snow {{as well as of the}} underlying ground surface.

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} obtained some of {{the parameters}} necessary for understanding the segregation of silicate liquid from amphibolite undergoing dehydration melting at 1 GPa and 750 – 1000 °C. The solidus for this calcic amphibolite (68 % Mg-Hb, 32 % Pl (An_(90))) is < 750 °C. Amphibolites begin to melt at relatively high temperatures in the garnet-absent field, but the solidus appears to backbend at ∼ 1 GPa, coincident with the garnet-in boundary. Hornblende breakdown due to garnet formation releases H_ 2 O and causes melting. Thus, in the garnet-present field (≥ 1 GPa), the amphibolite dehydration melting solidus may be coincident with the H_ 2 O-saturated solidus. Liquid interconnectivity may be achieved at < 900 °C and < 5 vol % liquid, based on both physical and chemical data from solid rock runs. Mass balance calculations from powdered rock runs suggest that small amounts (∼ 5 – 15 vol %) of hydrous (≥ 4 wt % H_ 2 O), low-viscosity (10 ^ 3 – 10 ^ 4 Pa s), heavy rare earth element-depleted, felsic liquid may be segregated during amphibolite dehydration melting at ≥ 875 °C.

Although comprising {{only a small portion of}} the <b>melting</b> <b>cycle,</b> these H_ 2 O-rich conditions may enhance the segregation of liquid by reduction of liquid viscosities and by mechanical effects on the restite (e. g., increased deformation and liquid fracturing).

In the northern sea-ice zone during the warming, <b>melting</b> <b>cycle</b> from October to March, waters warm {{by an average of}} 3. 5 degrees C and become fresher by 0. 1 to 0. 25. In the southern sea-ice zone, the surface temperatures vary from 1 to 1 degrees C over summer, and the maximal SSS range occurs in December, with a minimum SSS of 33. 65 near the Southern Boundary of the ACC, reaching 34. 4 in the shelf waters close to the coast. The main fronts, normally defined at subsurface, are shown to have more distinct seasonal characteristics in SSS than in SST. The interannual {{variations in}} SSS are more closely linked to variations in upstream sea-ice cover than surface forcing. SSS and sea-ice variations show distinct phases, with large biannual variations in the early 1990 s, weaker variations in the 2000 s and larger variations again from 2009 onwards. The calving of the Mertz Glacier Tongue in February 2010 leads to increased sea-ice cover and widespread freshening of the surface layers from 2011 onwards. Summer freshening in the northern sea-ice zone is similar to 0. 05 - 0. 07 per decade, increasing to 0. 08 per decade in the southern sea-ice zone, largely influenced by the Mertz Glacier calving event {{at the end of our}} time series.

40|$|The {{goals of}} this project are to utilize {{shipborne}} remote sensing to understand the scattering and attenuation process of ocean waves interacting with ice. A dedicated nautical X-band radar on a vessel {{would be used to}} follow the propagation of waves into the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and observe the attenuation and scattering of wave modes from the floating ice as well as estimate surface wind and surface current speeds and directions. This measuring approach will provide a comprehensive local picture of wave scattering and boundary layer flows over floating ice in the MIZ. OBJECTIVES To determine the penetration distance of waves in the MIZ and correlate the MIZ width to the surface wave climatology that generated it. 1. To determine the density of ice floes in the MIZ similar to “void fraction ” and correlate this parameter to the surface wave climatology. 2. To describe the local momentum transfer during freezing and <b>melting</b> <b>cycles</b> and the transport patterns affected by wind and currents. 3. To follow ocean wave groups into the MIZ to estimate the damping of wave energy based on the ice density and scattering from ice floes. 4. To correlate the open ocean wind and wave climate to the wind and wave climate within the MIZ using satellite SAR imagery and marine radar data. APPROACH Boundary layer flows and air-sea fluxes in ice infested waters like the MIZ are very complex compared to the open ocean where surface waves provide the only roughness at the interface.

40|$|Several hundred {{chemical}} analyses of early Proterozoic lavas of the Witwatersrand triad (incorporating the Dominion Group, Witwatersrand Supergroup and Ventersdorp Supergroup) in the Klerksdorp area, have revealed {{the presence of}} various distinct magma types. These essentially correspond to formally defined lithostratigraphic units, but several inconsistencies have necessitated the use of informal nomenclature. The lavas have been regionally metamorphosed to low-grade, greenschist facies assemblages. Original igneous textures are preserved, despite a metamorphic overprint. Metamorphism {{has resulted in a}} certain degree of random chemical remobilization. Ba, Sr, Rb, K₂ 0, Na₂ 0 and CaO have been highly mobile, and their usefulness in petrogenetic modelling is extremely limited. In contrast, Zr, Nb, Y, LREE's, Cr, Ni, Ti 0 ₂ P₂ 0 ₅ and Al₂ 0 ₃ have remained immobile. Ti/Zr and Ti/P ratios together constitute efficient discriminating variables for characterizing the different magma types. Lava compositions range from primitive Mg-rich tholeiites to rhyolites, the bulk being tholeiitic andesites. Al₂ 0 ₃ contents do not exceed 15 %, a feature which reflects the tholeiitic, as opposed to calcalkaline, character of these lavas. Two magma-types are present within the Dominion Group, which is a typical example of bimodal volcanism. The Dominion basic lavas are overlain by the Dominion acid porphyries, with a limited amount of interfingering. The basic lava suite is highly fractionated, with compositions ranging from Mg-, Cr- and Ni-rich tholeiites (close to primary mantle melts) to evolved tholeiitic andesites. The most primitive liquids evolved by 45 % fractional crystallization of hornblende, followed by a further 70 % crystallization of an orthopyroxene-plagioclase assemblage containing up to 3 % sulphides. The Dominion porphyries are rhyolitic, display very limited compositional variation, and probably represent a crustal melt related to the same magmatic event which produced the basic lavas. The only lavas from the Witwatersrand Supergroup present in the Klerksdorp area are those of the Crown Formation (Jeppestown amygdaloid). These are tholeiitic dacites which display extremely limited compositional variation, and are unrelated to any of the other magmas of the Witwatersrand triad. The Ventersdorp Supergroup comprises 4 magma-types: The Kliprivierberg Group lavas at the base are subdivisible into 3 sub-types on the basis of Zr contents. (Zr> 11 Oppm) are the most evolved. They are tholeiitic andesites which display fairly limited compositional variation. It is likely that more evolved compositions are present in other areas where the porphyritic lavas which characterize this unit are better developed. The overlying Orkney lavas are characterized by 110 ppm>Zr> 90 ppm. They are tholeiitic andesites of similar composition to the Alberton lavas, but have lower incompatible element levels, higher siderophile element levels, and are of extremely uniform composition. The uppermost Loraine/Edenville lavas range from magnesian tholeiites to tholeiitic andesites. They are distinguished by Zr< 90 ppm, and contain the most primitive magmas af the Witwatersrand triad, with up to 17, 5 % MgO, 2600 ppm Cr, 600 ppm Ni and M-values up to 77. The most primitive liquids evolved by 38 % fractional crystallization of orthopyroxene ∓ chromite, followed by 35 % fractional crystallization of an extract containing clinopyroxene and plagioclase. The absence of olivine precipitation {{is a result of the}} inherently high Si 0 ₂ content of the magma. The Loraine/Edenville, Orkney and Alberton lavas do not lie on a common liquid line of descent, but are probably consanguinous. The Platberg Group overlies the Kliprivierberg Group, and has a coarse-clastic sedimentary unit, the Kameeldoorns Formation, at the base. Three petrographically distinct porphyritic lava sequences overlie the Kameeldoorns Formation, namely the informal "Goedgenoeg formation", the Makwassie quartz-feldspar porphyries and the Rietgat Formation. Despite petrographic differences, the Goedgenoeg and Rietgat lavas are chemically indistinguishable and thus form a single magma-type. The Makwassie porphyries are dacitic in composition with a high proportion of feldspar and quartz phenocrysts. Rational variation trends are attributed to a nett loss of Si 0 ₂ during secondary alteration. The porphyries are probably of crustal origin. The Goedgenoeg/Rietgat lavas display unusual chemistry and a broad, irrational compositional spectrum. They contain very high incompatible element levels, high nonnative quartz, as well as high MgO, M-values, Cr and Ni relative to the other tholeiitic andesites of the Witwatersrand triad. It is tentatively suggested that they are hybrid magmas containing both crust and mantle components, the former possibly represented by the Makwassie porphyries. Field evidence suggests that Platberg volcanism commenced directly after Klipriviersberg volcanism ceased, and was accompanied by a period of enhanced tectonic activity. The Platberg lavas thus probably reflect a crustal <b>melting</b> <b>cycle</b> associated with the Klipriviersberg magmatic event. The Allanridge lavas are the youngest rocks of the Witwatersrand triad. They are separated from the Platberg Group by a unit of flat-lying sediments, the Bothaville Formation, which was deposited after an extended period of peneplanation. The Allanridge lavas form a separate magma-type. They are tholeiitic andesites of similar composition to the Alberton lavas, but have higher incompatible element levels and are not consanguinous. The compositional similarities amongst the basic magma-types of the Witwatersrand triad suggests that all were generated in an hydrous mantle. Interelement ratio differences between the various magma-types nevertheless support the concept that the mantle was chemically heterogeneous during the early Proterozoic...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} in the {{aluminum}} industry to utilize radiant heat during {{all or part of}} a <b>melt</b> <b>cycle</b> to transform solid aluminum shapes such as ingots, sows and T-bars to the molten state. The rate of heat transferred into or out of an object by thermal radiation will be governed by, among other things, the surface emissivity of the object, which is equal to the absorption coefficient. Aluminum has a very low absorption coefficient, resulting in inefficient radiant heat transfer during melting. However, it is possible to easily and significantly improve the absorption coefficient of aluminum shapes, thereby increasing melt rates, reducing energy consumption, and reducing oxidation.

During a field {{campaign in the}} summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20. 4 km 2, glaciarized area: 2 %), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle {{in one of two}} monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days.

40|$|Daugaard Jensen Gletscher, Greenland, {{is a large}} tidewater glacier {{terminating}} in {{the northwest}} corner of the Scoresby Sund fjords. We present a time series of surface flow speeds spanning 1985 - 2010 based on feature tracking of satellite images. The time series confirms that flow speeds remained stable and reveals a persistent summer acceleration of up to 10 % over the lower 10 km of the glacier. The front of the 6 km floating tongue fluctuates by little more than the average size of calved icebergs, 1 km. While we are unable to detect any imbalance between ice discharge and surface mass balance within our error estimates, observations suggest that the region is losing mass and experiencing decreases in surface elevation. We conclude that as flow speeds and surface mass balance have remained steady since 1985, the shift from balance to imbalance, leading to elevation decrease, must have occurred prior to this date. As for other stable Greenland tidewater glaciers, the seasonal <b>melt</b> <b>cycle</b> is the dominant influence on flow velocity variation but, if the apparent current thinning rates continue, there is potential for the grounding line to retreat, for calving rates to increase and for the glacier to accelerate...|$|R

40|$|Marine-terminating outlet glaciers of the Greenland {{ice sheet}} make {{significant}} contributions to global sea level rise, yet the conditions that facilitate their fast flow remain poorly constrained owing to a paucity of data. We drilled and instrumented seven boreholes on Store Glacier, Greenland, to monitor subglacial water pressure, temperature, electrical conductivity and turbidity along with englacial ice temperature and deformation. These observations were supplemented by surface velocity and meteorological measurements to gain insight into the conditions and mechanisms of fast glacier flow. Located 30 km from the calving front, each borehole drained rapidly on attaining 600 m depth indicating a direct connection with an active subglacial hydrological system. Persistently high subglacial water pressures indicate low effective pressure (180 - 280 kPa), with small amplitude variations correlated with notable peaks in surface velocity driven by the diurnal <b>melt</b> <b>cycle</b> and longer periods of melt and rainfall. The englacial deformation profile determined from borehole tilt measurements indicates that 63 - 71 % of total ice motion occurred at the bed, with the remaining 29 - 37 % predominantly attributed to enhanced deformation in the lowermost 50 - 100 m of the ice column. We interpret this lowermost 100 m to be formed of warmer, pre-Holocene ice overlying a thin (0 - 8 m) layer of temperate basal ice. Our observations are consistent with a spatially-extensive and persistently-inefficient subglacial drainage system that we hypothesize comprises drainage both at the ice-sediment interface and through subglacial sediments.

40|$|Knowledge of the albedo of polar regions {{is crucial}} for {{understanding}} a range of climatic processes that {{have an impact on}} a global scale. Light-absorbing impurities in atmospheric aerosols deposited on snow and sea ice by aeolian transport absorb solar radiation, reducing albedo. Here, the effects of five mineral aerosol deposits reducing the albedo of polar snow and sea ice are considered. Calculations employing a coupled atmospheric and snow/sea ice radiative-transfer model (TUV-snow) show that the effects of mineral aerosol deposits are strongly dependent on the snow or sea ice type rather than the differences between the aerosol optical characteristics. The change in albedo between five different mineral aerosol deposits with refractive indices varying by a factor of 2 reaches a maximum of 0. 0788, whereas the difference between cold polar snow and melting sea ice is 0. 8893 for the same mineral loading. Surprisingly, the thickness of a surface layer of snow or sea ice loaded with the same mass ratio of mineral dust has little effect on albedo. On the contrary, the surface albedo of two snowpacks of equal depth, containing the same mineral aerosol mass ratio, is similar, whether the loading is uniformly distributed or concentrated in multiple layers, regardless of their position or spacing. The impact of mineral aerosol deposits is much larger on melting sea ice than on other types of snow and sea ice.

An integrated multi-pollutant multi-sectoral approach for addressing atmospheric issues will result in optimum environmental and socioeconomic benefits.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of glacier mass loss to future sea level rise is still poorly constrained (Lemke and others, 2007). One {{of the remaining}} unknowns is how water inputs influence glacier velocity. Short-term variations in glacier velocity occur when a water input exceeds {{the capacity of the}} subglacial drainage system, and the subglacial water pressure increases. Several studies (Van de Wal and others, 2008; Sundal and others, 2011) have suggested that high ice-flow velocities during these events are later offset by lower ice-flow velocities due to a more efficient subglacial drainage system. This study combines in-situ velocity measurements with a full Stokes glacier flowline model to understand the spatial and temporal variations in glacier flow on the lower Franz Josef Glacier, New Zealand. The Franz Josef Glacier experiences significant water inputs throughout the year (Anderson and others, 2006), and as a result, the subglacial drainage system is likely well-developed. In March 2011, measured ice-flow velocities increased by up to 75 % above background values in response to rain events and by up to 32 % in response to diurnal <b>melt</b> <b>cycles.</b> These speed-up events occurred at all survey locations across the lower glacier. Through flowline modelling, it is shown that the enhanced glacier flow can be explained by a spatially-uniform subglacial water pressure that increased during periods of heavy rain and glacier melt. From these results, it is suggested that temporary spikes in water inputs can cause glacier speed-up events, even when the subglacial hydrology system is well-developed (cf. Schoof, 2010). Future studies should focus on determining the {{contribution of}} glacier speed-up events to overall glacier motion...|$|R
40|$|Multi-year SAR data is used {{to study}} the {{seasonal}} dynamic of the snow melt patterns on the ice cap of King George Island, Antarctica. The snow cover of the entire ice cap becomes wet during sum-mer months, however, in the highest elevations frequent refreeze and <b>melt</b> <b>cycles</b> are observed. Bare ice areas form in the lowest elevations of the ice cap. These findings are in good agreements with energy balance studies and results of a ground penetrating radar survey. Backscatter values in in-termediate elevations show a marked rise {{at the end of}} the ablation season. This fact is attributed to an increasing surface roughness on a wet metamorphosed snow cover {{at the end of the}} ablation sea-son. The influence of thresholds on the determination of the extent of the bare ice radar zone in summer and winter imagery as well as in ascending and descending orbit is investigated. As a con-sequence, the border of the bare ice radar zone have been mapped using thresholds of – 14 dB in summer and – 6 dB in winter imagery. It could be shown, that thresholds of – 12 dB and – 8 dB, re-spectively, do not change significantly the extent of this radar glacier zone. Firn line altitudes were mapped for several consecutive years. A low inter-annual variation of this line with elevations of about 200 m a. s. l. was observed. The maximum altitude of the firn line was recorded in the mass balance year 1996 / 97 with about 250 m a. s. l. Comparing these values to equilibrium line positions of previous measurements indicate an upward shift in the equilibrium line altitude since the 1970 ’s...|$|R
40|$|The {{avalanche}} {{environment in}} Scotland differs from typical alpine environments. A warmer, maritime climate with regular high winds {{leads to a}} prevalence of dense, old but mobile snow. <b>Melt</b> freeze <b>cycles</b> and wind transport dominate snow pack evolution, with wet snow and slab avalanches being the dominant avalanche types. SnowMicroPen (SMP) measurements were performed alongside conventional snowpits {{in order to identify}} representative samples of SMP data for six typical Scottish snow types. Artificial snow was aged in a cold lab and tested with the SMP. Comparisons are drawn between the artificial snow and natural Scottish snow. It is found that artificial snow can be considered a good model material for systematic studies of interactions between specific snow types and measurement instruments...|$|R
