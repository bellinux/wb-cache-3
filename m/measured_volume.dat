The {{intensity of the}} optical radiation part passing through the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> and distributed in <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> laterally to the trans-illuminating direction, is measured in trans-illuminating direction by the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume.</b> The oil content is calculated from measured intensity values on basis of previous calibration oil content. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for determining of oil content of cleaning fluid. USE - Method for determining of the oil content of a cleaning fluid. ADVANTAGE - The intensity of the optical radiation part, which passes through the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> and distributed in <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> laterally to the trans-illuminating direction, is measured in trans-illuminating direction by the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume,</b> and hence ensures continuous and accurate regulation for the oil concentration of the cleaning fluid at low cost...|$|R

50|$|Given {{the mean}} Doppler {{velocity}} (mean {{frequency of the}} power spectrum) of the <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> {{along the line of}} sight - the radial velocity. For vertical measurements, the Doppler velocities is the sum of terminal velocity of particles, caused by gravity force, and air motions within the <b>measured</b> <b>volume.</b> Terminal velocity contains the information about microphysical properties of cloud particles. In order to obtain the terminal velocity from the cloud-radar observations, the influence of air motions that shift the spectrum have to be removed from the Doppler spectra, improving in this way the microphysics representativity. An approach to correct this shift is given by Kollias et al., improving the accuracy of the relation between the corrected Doppler velocity and the particle fall velocities.|$|E
50|$|Closed pores, i.e. {{those that}} do not {{communicate}} with the surface of the solid, are included in the <b>measured</b> <b>volume.</b> Helium may however demonstrate some measurable permeability through low density solids (polymers and cellulosic materials predominantly) thus interfering with the measurement of solid volume. In such cases larger molecule gases such as nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride are beneficial.|$|E

5000|$|A pipette (sometimes spelled pipet) is a {{laboratory}} tool {{commonly used in}} chemistry, biology and medicine to transport a <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> of liquid, often as a media dispenser. Pipettes come in several designs for various purposes with differing levels of accuracy and precision, from single piece glass pipettes to more complex adjustable or electronic pipettes. Many pipette types work by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and selectively releasing this vacuum to draw up and dispense liquid. Measurement accuracy varies greatly depending on the style.|$|E
50|$|Note: {{to measure}} FRC {{the patient is}} {{connected}} to the spirometer directly after a normal breath (when the lung volume equals FRC), if the patient is initially connected to the spirometer at a different lung volume (like TLC or RV) the <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> will be the initial volume started from and not FRC. In patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases the measurements of the helium dilution technique are not reliable because of incomplete equilibration of the helium in all areas of the lungs. In such cases it is more accurate to use a body plethysmograph.|$|E

50|$|Total {{dissolved}} solids or TDS (sometimes called filtrable residue) is measured as {{the mass of}} residue remaining when a <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> of filtered water is evaporated. Salinity measures water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials. Probability of scale formation increases with increasing total {{dissolved solids}}. Solids commonly associated with scale formation are calcium and magnesium carbonate and sulfate. Corrosion rates initially increase with salinity in response to increasing electrical conductivity, but then decrease after reaching a peak as higher levels of salinity decrease dissolved oxygen levels.|$|E
50|$|Since the air {{motion in}} the {{atmosphere}} affects the Doppler width, this parameter provides information about turbulence within the <b>measured</b> <b>volume.</b> Up- and downdrafts slow down the terminal fall velocities and can decrease or increase the Doppler width. If the measurements are not done pointing to the zenith, the horizontal wind component influences the width as well. The knowledge of the actual wind components in the atmosphere {{can be used to}} correct the Doppler spectrum, so that the retrieved microphysical parameters can be improved and the uncertainties decreased.|$|E
50|$|The Doppler width, or Doppler {{spectrum}} width, is {{the standard}} deviation of the spectrum. Accordingly, small values stand for narrow spectra, while higher spectrum width corresponds to a bigger spreading of the hydrometeors over the velocity domain (frequency domain). Reasons for a higher width could be bi- or multiple-modal spectra. This means that the <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> contains more than one hydrometeor population, which leads to two or more modes in the Doppler spectrum because of the different terminal velocities. A rapid change in Doppler width {{in combination with the}} mean Doppler velocity {{can also be used to}} separate two hydrometeor population.|$|E

50|$|Measures are {{classified}} as either dry measures or fluid measures. Some of the fluid and dry measures have similar names, but the actual <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> is quite different. A recipe will generally specify which measurement is required. U.S. recipes are commonly in terms of fluid measures, even for dry ingredients. Most of these units derive from earlier English units, as applied to the U.S. gallon. Typically they follow a pattern of binary submultiples, where each larger measure consists of two units of the next-smallest measure. An exception is with the commonly used teaspoon as one-third of a tablespoon.|$|E
50|$|Solid {{material}} in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled. Total dissolved solids or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is measured as {{the mass of}} residue remaining when a <b>measured</b> <b>volume</b> of filtered water is evaporated. The mass of dried solids remaining on the filter is called total suspended solids (TSS) or nonfiltrable residue. Settleable solids are measured as the visible volume accumulated {{at the bottom of}} an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour. Turbidity {{is a measure of the}} light scattering ability of suspended matter in the water. Salinity measures water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials.|$|E
