This may be a fixed belt conveyor system or a <b>mobile</b> <b>conveyor</b> with crawlers {{similar to those found}} on the BWE. Mobile conveyors permanently attached to the excavator take the burden of directing the material off of the operator. [...] The overburden can also be transferred directly to cross-pit Spreader, which reaches across the pit and scatters overburden at the dumping ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Multicaterpillar track chassis {{are used}} in the biggest machines. This kind of chassis is {{commonly}} used in open cast mines for <b>mobile</b> transfer <b>conveyor</b> or for bucket wheel excavators. In each machine the chassis consist of 6 to 12 caterpillar tracks, which some are steered. Existing models used for analytical calculations are based on simplified relations taken from quasistatic equations of stability and geometrical connections. The complex research was conducted on <b>mobile</b> transfer <b>conveyor,</b> which is used in open cast mine. The aim of measurements was to identify the value of force that acts on elements of chassis during the steering and driving the machine. The measurements were taken during the drive in different directions, with different positions of center of gravity. The strain gauges were used to measure the deformation on each caterpillar track, trusses and drawbar...|$|R

40|$|The final degree {{project for}} a Bachelor of Science in Mining and Mineral Engineering {{has been carried}} out at Boliden Mineral AB between April and June 2013. The report {{describes}} the history and geology of the mines of Boliden, origin and the development of one of the largest metal-mining companies in Europe - Boliden Mineral AB. In the Boliden area there are many important ore fields which contain gold, zinc, copper, silver and lead. The objective of this project was to investigate and provide the guidelines for the improvement of the regrinding in the ball mill in the Concentrator flotation circuit having influence on metal recovery. The report follows the ore flow from the mine, through the Concentrator and finally to the end product, concentrates. The evaluation leads to conclusions which parameters may affect the concentration process negative. It was discovered that there are problems with the ore stockpiles at the mine and the segregation of the fractions in the silos. It is proposed to install a cone {{on the top of the}} silos to reduce segregation of ore fractions. To reduce this problem Boliden should install a <b>mobile</b> <b>conveyor</b> on the way to the silos and to the ore stockpiles in the mine. This method has been successfully installed at the Aitik ore stockpiles near the new Concentrator. The main task of the thesis was to analyze metal distribution in the flotation circuit, especially technical analysis of regrinding effects on the results of flotation. The analysis of the sampled pulp from the flotation process was done in the Mineral Processing Laboratory and in the Process Laboratory in Boliden. The analytical equipment such as X-rays and ICP were used for metal analysis and QEMSCAN was used for mineralogical determinations analyses. Theoretical calculations and results of conducted laboratory experiments suggests that regrinding in the ball mill has a positive effect on the flotation process, but some improvement is required, especially the regrinding of the gangue particles. This process helps to liberate all metal particles and improves results of metal recovery. For improvement of regrinding process, it is proposed to replace the regrinding ball mill with a newer, more efficient mill of SMD type (Stirred Media Detritor).

40|$|As mines become {{progressively}} deeper, {{mining operations}} face increased costs and challenges in more complex scenarios. For this reason, the mining industry is considering alternative mining systems to the tradtional truck and shovel haulage. Aspeacts such as energy costsl equipment and labour scarcity; and carbon footprint encourage the utilisation of In-Pit Crusher Conveyor (IPCC) systems. This paper therefore aims {{to review the}} recent history of IPCC applications in the mining industry and present the most recent systems installations. There are a few successfully documented cases of fully <b>mobile</b> crusher - <b>conveyor</b> applications. To be economically feasible, semi-mobiel IPCC systems require productive reates on excess of 8000 tonnes per day in today 2 ̆ 7 s mining industry. In addition, conveyors start to gain an econmic advantage for transport distances of 5 km or more...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to move {{a step toward the}} {{automation}} of industrial plants through full exploitation of autonomous robots. A planning algorithm is proposed to move different objects in desired configurations with heterogeneous robots such as manipulators, <b>mobile</b> robots and <b>conveyor</b> belts. The proposed approach allows different objects to be handled by different robots simultaneously in an efficient way and avoiding collisions with the environment and self-collisions between robots. In particular, the integrated system will be capable of planning paths for a set of objects from various starting points in the environment (e. g. shelves) to their respective final destinations. The proposed approach unifies the active (e. g., grasping by a hand) and passive (e. g., holding by a table) steps involved in moving the objects in the environment by treating them as end-effectors with constraints and capabilities. Time varying graphs will be introduced to model the problem for simultaneous handling of objects by different end-effectors. Optimal exploration of such graphs will be used to determine paths for each object with time constraints. Results will be validated through simulations...|$|R
