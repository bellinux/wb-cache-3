5000|$|Indeed, <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> {{issues can}} be {{addressed}} both by general competition policies and by specific media sector rules. According to some scholars, given the vital importance of contemporary media, sector-specific competition rules in the media industries should be enhanced. Within the EU, the Council regulation 4064/89/EEC on the control of concentrations between undertakings as part of European competition legislation covered also <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> cases. The need for sector-specific regulation has been widely supported by both media scholars and the European Parliament. In the 1980s, when preparing legislation on cross-border television many experts and MEPs argued for including provisions for <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> in the EU directive but these efforts failed. In 1992, the Commission of the European Communities published a policy document named [...] "Pluralism and <b>Media</b> <b>Concentration</b> in the internal Market - {{an assessment of the}} need for Community action" [...] which outlined three options on the issue of <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> regulation at the Community level, i.e. no specific action to be taken; action regulating transparency; and action to harmonize laws. Out of these options, the first one was chosen but the debate on this decision lasted for years. Council regulation as a tool for regulating <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> was excluded and the two proposals on a <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> directive advanced in the mid 1990s were not backed by the Commission. As a consequence, efforts at legislating <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> at Community level were phased out {{by the end of the}} 1990s.|$|R
50|$|When {{it comes}} to {{regulating}} <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> at the common European level, there is a conflict between Member states and the European Commission (EC). Even if Member states do not publicly challenge the need for common regulation on <b>media</b> <b>concentration,</b> they push to incorporate their own regulatory approach at the EU level and are reluctant to give the European Union their regulatory power {{on the issue of}} <b>media</b> <b>concentration.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a nutshell, {{there are}} two main {{obstacles}} for the effective reduction of <b>media</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Bulgaria: non-transparent media ownership and the lack of media-specific legislation regulating <b>media</b> <b>concentration.</b> These obstacles cannot be removed without political will for this.|$|R
50|$|The Communications Law also regulates <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> and {{ownership}} issues. The CRA {{has adopted a}} Rule on <b>Media</b> <b>Concentration</b> and Cross-ownership, as referred by the Communications Law, to prevent cross-ownership concentration. The Competition Law provides further rules on market concentration.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} no {{specific}} <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> legislation at the European level, a number of existing legal instruments such as the Amsterdam Protocol, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and actions programs contribute directly and indirectly to curbing <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> at EU level.|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, the European Parliament {{tried to}} revitalize the efforts on {{regulating}} <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> at the European level and adopted a resolution on <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> which called on the European Commission to launch a broad and comprehensive consultation on media pluralism and <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> and to prepare a Green Paper on the issue {{by the end of}} 2003. The European Commission failed to meet this deadline. In the following years, during the process of amending the Televisions Without Frontiers directive, which was adopted by the EP and the Council in 2007, the issue of <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> was discussed, but it did not represented the core of the debate. In 2003, the European Commission issued a policy document named [...] "The future of European Regulatory Audiovisual Policy" [...] which stressed that, in order to ensure media pluralism, measures should aim at limiting the level of <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> by establishing [...] "maximum holdings in media companies and preventing cumulative control or participation in several media companies at the same time".|$|R

5000|$|Part of {{the media}} {{ownership}} debate includes that of <b>media</b> <b>concentration.</b> <b>Media</b> <b>concentration</b> is when {{a large amount of}} media outlets are owned by a small number of companies. According to the MAP website, <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> not only limits diversity, but also [...] "threatens an outlet’s accountability to local communities, since big companies are often unfamiliar with a community’s specific needs." [...] In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration started deregulating the broadcasting industries, which led to the trend of media consolidation. Media Access Project Director Andrew Scwartzman commented: [...] "Deregulation has brought a new breed of broadcaster to whom public service matters less." ...|$|R

The results suggest counter-intuitively that advertisers may actually prefer media markets with less competition for audiences. Product differentiation through advertising is more effective when media markets are less competitive, leading to higher prices for advertised products. As a result, <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> may lead to higher profits for advertising firms if the additional revenue exceeds the higher advertising costs associated with <b>media</b> <b>concentration.</b> ...|$|R

However, in practice existing antimonopoly measures and rules on <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> are weak and insufficient.

Such clusters are organised around a single editorial line, which can either support or oppose the ruling regime, and are used by political powers to propagate their political agendas and to smear their opponents. In such a polarised context, both sides have developed a network of cross-owned media outlets.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} relationship between journalistic freedom and <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> in Kenya {{through the lens of}} the propaganda model (Baker, 2007). The research is based on two features of the 2013 General Election in Kenya: (1) a survey of the publics’ confidence in the conduct of journalists during the 2013 General election in Kenya and (2) a survey of journalists` perceptions of influence of media ownership on journalistic independence in Kenya. This research concludes that an increase in <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> in Kenya has led to the shrinking of the democratic space. 71 percent of the surveyed Journalists believe media diversity in Kenya is at risk whilst 69 percent believe that viewpoint discrimination is occasioned by unhealthy Media Ownership trends in Kenya. The research also indicates that the perceived climate of distrust dogging the mainstream media in Kenya has seen the public turn to citizen journalism as an alternative source of information. This survey raises further questions about future implications for journalistic independence given the dominance of <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> in Kenya...|$|R

The Kent Commission recommended (in section 2.a) {{the creation of new}} legislation that would [...] "require the break-up of regional monopolies, such as that of the Irving family in New Brunswick, by prohibiting the ownership of two or more newspapers having 75% or more of the circulation, in one language, in a defined geographical area".|$|R

Using the unique World Bank dataset covering more than 5, 000 firms across 59 countries, we find strong evidence that that state ownership of media is associated with higher levels of bank corruption. We also find that <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> increases corruption both directly and indirectly through its interaction with media state ownership. In addition, we find that media state ownership and <b>media</b> <b>concentration</b> both accentuate the positive link between official supervisory power and lending corruption and attenuate the negative link between the regulations that empower private monitoring and corruption in lending. Furthermore, the links between media structure and corruption are more pronounced when the borrowing firm is privately owned...|$|R
