40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether inflammatory markers prospectively predict depressive symptom severity 12 <b>months</b> <b>later</b> in heart failure (HF) patients. Methods. In 30 HF patients we assessed depressive symptom severity by the Beck depression inventory (BDI) at baseline {{as well as}} 12 <b>months</b> <b>later.</b> We measured circulating levels of the soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) - 1, the cytokine interleukin (IL) - 6 and the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline assessment. Results. sICAM- 1 (r=. 38, p=. 045) but not CRP or IL- 6 correlated with BDI scores 12 <b>months</b> <b>later.</b> Hierarchical linear regression analysis revealed that independent of baseline BDI assessment, cardiovascular risk factors, indicators of HF disease severity, and medication intake, sICAM- 1 significantly predicted BDI scores 12 <b>months</b> <b>later.</b> sICAM- 1 independently explained between 7 % (beta=. 26, p=. 040) and 10 % (beta=. 35, p=. 045) {{of the total variance}} in BDI scores 12 <b>months</b> <b>later.</b> Conclusion. The findings from this exploratory analysis suggest that the adhesion molecule sICAM- 1 is an independent predictor of depressive symptoms 12 <b>months</b> <b>later</b> in HF patients. Our prospective findings support the suggested role for inflammation in increasing future depressive symptom severity and extend this linkage {{for the first time to}} HF...|$|R
