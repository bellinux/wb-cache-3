50|$|This signal {{reproduced}} {{an accurate}} still {{image of the}} target, so the <b>monoscope</b> was used to produce still images such as test patterns and station logo cards. For example, the classic Indian Head test card used by NBC, shown on the right was often produced using a <b>monoscope.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Monoscopes</b> {{were used}} as {{character}} generators for text mode video rendering in computer displays {{for a short time}} in the 1960s. The CBS Laboratories Vidiac, and the A. B. Dick 990 System, were among the earliest character generators for broadcast television. CBS Laboratories later developed the more advanced Vidifont system in preparation for the 1968 US presidential elections, where a rapid method of all-electronic character generation was required so that news outlets could identify unexpected interviewees on the spot. A similar generator using analogue electronics, Anchor, was developed by the BBC in 1970 and used in the general election later that year.|$|R

50|$|An actual Indian-head test card, {{the pattern}} as printed on art-grade white cardboard, was only of {{secondary}} importance to television system adjustment, {{but many of}} them were saved as souvenirs, works of found art, and inadvertent mandalas. By contrast, nearly all of the hard-to-open, steel-shielded, vacuum glass <b>monoscope</b> tubes were junked with their hidden Indian-head test pattern target plates still inside. The <b>monoscope</b> target plates were also small, a few inches in size, while the showy camera test cards were sized on the order of 1.5 by 2 ft, making them natural keepers for picture-framed wall display.|$|E

50|$|The term Charactron is {{sometimes}} mistakenly applied to {{another type of}} CRT properly called a <b>monoscope</b> which generates an electrical signal by scanning an electron beam of uniform cross section across a printed pattern on an internal target electrode.|$|E
5000|$|Monoscopes were {{available}} {{with a wide}} variety of standard patterns and messages, and could be ordered with a custom image such as a station logo. <b>Monoscope</b> [...] "cameras" [...] were widely used to produce test cards, station logos, special signals for test purposes and standard announcements like [...] "Please stand by" [...] and [...] "normal service will be resumed....". They had many advantages over using a live camera pointed at a card; an expensive camera was not tied up, they were always ready, and were never misframed or out of focus. Indeed, monoscopes were often used to calibrate the live cameras, by comparing the <b>monoscope</b> image and the live camera image of the same test pattern.|$|E
5000|$|Monoscopes {{were similar}} in {{construction}} to an ordinary cathode ray tube (CRT), only instead of displaying an image on its screen it scanned a built-in image. The <b>monoscope</b> contained a formed metal target {{in place of the}} phosphor coating at its [...] "screen" [...] end and as the electron beam scanned the target, rather than displaying an image, a varying electrical signal was produced generating a video signal from the etched pattern. <b>Monoscope</b> tubes had the advantage over test cards that a full TV camera was not needed, and the image was always properly framed and in focus. They fell out of use in the 1960s as they were not able to produce color images.|$|E
50|$|An RCA TK-1 {{test pattern}} {{generator}} (<b>monoscope)</b> is a 19-inch rack-mounted chassis, which contains a <b>monoscope</b> tube housed inside an anti-magnetic steel shield and associated electronic circuits for driving it. The <b>monoscope</b> tube is constructed similarly {{to a small}} cathode ray tube (CRT), but instead of displaying an image, it scans a built-in image, producing a video signal. The tube has a perfectly proportioned copy of the test pattern master art inside, permanently deposited as a carbon image on an aluminum target plate or slide. This perfect copy allowed all of the television studio and production control room video monitors, and home television sets, to be identically adjusted for minimum distortions such as ovals instead of circles. When the monitor or TV set was correctly adjusted to show test pattern circles, the received picture's aspect ratio was exactly four units wide by three units high. The 4 by 3 standard was chosen by the National Television System Committee (NTSC) for analog television, so that film movies would be compatible with TV broadcasting. 4:3 is the same aspect ratio used by 16mm and classic 35mm motion picture film frames.|$|E
50|$|The Indian-head {{test pattern}} was not {{generated}} by pointing a camera at a card, as many older test patterns were. Rather, it was generated directly as a monochrome video signal {{by means of}} a <b>monoscope</b> tube, a specialized video camera tube with the pattern built into the tube.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{physical}} test cards, {{which had to}} be televised using a camera, television stations often used a special purpose camera tube which had the test pattern painted on the inside screen of the tube. Each tube was only capable of generating the one test image, hence it was called a <b>monoscope.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>monoscope</b> was {{a special}} form of video camera tube which {{displayed}} a single still video image. The image was built into the tube, hence the name. The tube resembled a small cathode ray tube (CRT). Monoscopes were used beginning in the 1950s to generate TV test patterns and station logos. This type of test card generation system was technologically obsolete by the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The Indian-head {{test pattern}} {{is a black}} and white {{television}} test pattern which was introduced in 1939 by RCA of Harrison, New Jersey {{as a part of the}} RCA TK-1 <b>monoscope.</b> Its name comes from the original art of a Native American featured on the card. It was widely used by television stations worldwide during the black and white TV broadcasting era before 1970.|$|E
50|$|The <b>monoscope</b> {{was similar}} in {{construction}} to a CRT, with an electron gun at one end, but {{in place of}} a phosphor-coated screen which displayed an image, it had a metal target with an image formed on it. As the electron beam scanned the target, varying amounts of electrons were reflected from the different areas of the image. The reflected electrons were picked up by an internal electrode ring, producing a varying electrical signal which was amplified to become the video output of the tube.|$|E
50|$|Pointing an {{electronic}} camera {{at the same}} stationary monochrome caption {{for a long period}} of time could result in the image becoming burnt onto the camera tube's target â€” and even onto the phosphor of a monitor displaying it in extreme cases.Monoscopes were used as character generators for text mode video rendering in computer displays for a short time in the 1960s. The <b>monoscope</b> declined in popularity during the 1960s due to its inability to generate a colour test card, and the development of solid state TV test pattern signal generators.|$|E
50|$|Only {{after the}} {{monitors}} were adjusted was an actual Indian-head test pattern used. A cardboard mounted lithograph {{of the test}} pattern was typically attached to a rolling vertical easel in each TV studio, to be videographed by each studio camera during test time. Then the cameras were adjusted to appear identical on picture monitors, by alternately switching between and comparing the <b>monoscope</b> image and the test card image. Such adjustments were made {{on a regular basis}} because television system electronics then used hot vacuum tubes, the operating characteristics of which drifted throughout each broadcast day.|$|E
5000|$|Like all tube {{numbering}} systems, {{there are}} many inconsistencies between theory and practice. For example, there is no assigned letter code for cathode-ray tubes. Some unusual types received rather mundane sounding designations, based solely on electrode count, {{because there was no}} better place to put them. For example, the 2F21 is not an actual hexode, but a pattern generating <b>monoscope</b> tube. Some very exotic types received generic designators, even when there was a more appropriate designator available. For example, the 2H21 [...] "phasitron" [...] phase modulator tube used in early FM broadcast transmitters was assigned an [...] "H" [...] (octode) designator, when {{it would have been a}} perfect candidate for the otherwise unused [...] "T" [...] category for deflection controlled tubes.|$|E
50|$|KFAZ went on-the-air August 11, 1953 with a Federal Telecommunication Labs (FTL) FTL-20B 1 kW (visual) transmitter, and a Workshop Associates WA-25-43 14 dB gain antenna. The station's two studios shared two DuMont TA-142 Image Orthicon {{monochrome}} camera chains. One of {{the studio}} camera chains {{could also be used}} to broadcast film projected by either of two General Precision Labs 16mm motion picture projectors, with an FTL Poly-Efex dual flying spot monochrome slide scanner and effects mixer for televising still images (such as advertisement slides or station identification cards), and for producing limited special video effects. The noted equipment compliment allowed for two-camera studio operations, and switching to film without having to use a <b>monoscope</b> test pattern or still slide while moving a studio camera into position for film operations.|$|E
40|$|Network faults, such as router failures, cable outages, and {{configuration}} errors, could seriously affect network performance. In this paper, we use network faults very loosely, {{including those}} that will yield unfavorable end-to-end network performance, such as packet reordering and suboptimal routes. Diagnosing network faults on end-to-end paths is a very challenging problem, because it generally involves other domains. Even {{if it can be}} done, the process is very time consuming, because multiple sources of data, which are scattered in different places, are needed for such diagnosis. In this paper, we consider the problem of making the fault diagnosis as automatic as possible. Based on coordinated active measurement from a set of end systems, we propose a procedure of detecting network faults and identifying their locations. Although this procedure cannot be fully automated for the time being, we show that some of the components could be automated, and we are automating them in a preliminary system called <b>MonoScope.</b> We demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure through several real-world cases that we have encountered in our four years of network monitoring experience.

40|$|Leaf development, leaf area distribution, {{growth and}} {{productivity}} (dry matter of leaves, roots, crowns; and sugar yield) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. cv. <b>Monoscope)</b> plants were studied during the 1983 and 1984 growing seasons on an experimental field plantation. Photosynthetic capacity (P(c); {{photosynthetic photon flux}} density saturated net photosynthetic rate) was measured at regular time intervals in 1984 and 1985. Using these data, {{the performance of a}} model (SUBEMO) simulating growth, yield and sugar accumulation was evaluated. At the end of the growing season, viz. October, about 50 leaves were developed by the sugar beet plant, yielding maximal leaf area index values of around 4 to 5. P(c) changed considerably during the growing season showing significantly lower values before appearance of leaf number 20 (around mid-July), increasing later in the season and slightly decreasing {{near the end of the}} growing season (mid-October). P(c) of mature leaves was significantly and positively correlated with total leaf dry matter of the sugar beet plants at the end of the growing season. Comparisons between simulated and measured dry matter production of leaves and beets (roots + crowns) confirmed the need to integrate seasonal trends in P(c) in the simulation model. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of Active Wave-front Sampling (AWS) for real time quantified 3 D endoscopy. AWS is a technique by which phase information from an aperture area of a lens is obtained by sampling sub-regions of the aperture area in time. The resulting phase information is then processed to obtain an accurate 3 D measure of an imaged target object. While AWS has multitudinous applications and can take on many forms, this thesis examines {{the possibility of using}} an off-the-shelf <b>monoscope</b> and a single camera in conjunction with a rotating off-axis aperture to generate quantified real time three dimensional surface models of a surgical scenario. This AWS based stereo-endoscope (referred to as the AWS-scope) is shown to possess optical attributes that are superior to those of the current industry standard. Quantified 3 D data generated using this AWS-scope is used to create enhanced synthetic stereo image pairs that exhibit superior depth perception characteristics comparable to the current industry standard. by Hemanth Prakash.
