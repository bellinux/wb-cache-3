5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of <b>metal</b> <b>goods</b> in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E

25|$|The Viking Age {{began in}} 793 with {{the attack on}} Lindisfarne; for the next quarter-millennium the Vikings ruled the North Sea. In their {{superior}} longships, they raided, traded, and established colonies and outposts along the coasts of the sea. From the Middle Ages through the 15th century, the northern European coastal ports exported domestic goods, dyes, linen, salt, <b>metal</b> <b>goods</b> and wine. The Scandinavian and Baltic areas shipped grain, fish, naval necessities, and timber. In turn the North Sea countries imported high-grade cloths, spices, and fruits from the Mediterranean region. Commerce during this era was mainly conducted by maritime trade due to underdeveloped roadways.|$|E
25|$|The Phoenicians were Mediterranean seamen in {{constant}} search for valuable metals such as copper, gold, tin, and lead. They began to populate the North African coast with settlementstrading and {{mixing with the}} native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from Tyre established the city of Carthage. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered {{the growth of the}} Berber kingdoms, Numidia and Mauretania. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with Sub-Saharan Africa. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the Garamantes of Fez, who raided caravans. Salt and <b>metal</b> <b>goods</b> were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.|$|E

40|$|A many-body force {{approach}} is adopted {{to calculate the}} thermoelastic properties of Ag and Ni. The method of homogeneous deformation permits the anharmonic potential parameters {{to be related to}} the experimentally known third-order elastic constants. Both second- and third-order Cauchy relations are violated by this many-body potential. We have used a strain-dependent perturbative Helmholtz free energy to evaluate the linear thermal expansion coefficient and the thermodynamic Grueneisen parameter of both <b>metals.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement between theory and experiment is found. Our results suggest that, to fit thermodynamical properties, many-body interactions have to be included in the anharmonic part of the potential...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} of the first {{recorded}} contact with the Europeans, the Kingdom of Kongo was a highly developed state at the center of an extensive trading network. Apart from natural resources and ivory, the country manufactured and traded copperware, ferrous <b>metal</b> <b>goods,</b> raffia cloth, and pottery. The Kongo people spoke in the Kikongo language. The eastern regions, especially that part known as the Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza (or in Kikongo Mumbwadi or [...] "the Seven"), were particularly famous for the production of cloth.|$|E
2500|$|HASAG (also {{known as}} Hugo Schneider AG, or by its {{original}} name in [...] ) was a German <b>metal</b> <b>goods</b> manufacturer founded in 1863. Based in Leipzig, it grew {{from a small}} business making lamps and other small metal products by hand into a large factory and publicly traded company that sold its wares in several countries. During the Second World War, Hasag became a Nazi arms-manufacturing conglomerate with dozens of factories across German-occupied Europe using slave labour on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of Jews from Poland, and other prisoners, died producing munition for Hasag.|$|E

2500|$|Other terms {{often used}} for printed {{engravings}} are copper engraving, copper-plate engraving or line engraving. Steel engraving is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, letterheads and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes {{and other forms of}} security printing. Especially in the past, [...] "engraving" [...] was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or mezzotint. [...] "Hand engraving" [...] is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine <b>metal</b> <b>goods.</b> Traditional engravings in printmaking are also [...] "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1899, {{with the}} {{involvement}} of Darmstädter Bank für Handel und Industrie (known as Darmstädter Bank) and other banks, the firm was established as an aktiengesellschaft, manufacturing <b>metal</b> <b>goods</b> under the name [...] "Hugo Schneider AG (Hasag)". Schneider's sons retained 63 percent of the company, but bankers now sat on the board controlling the company. A venture involving other banks resulted in {{the opening of a}} factory in Warsaw, Poland. In 1902, in addition to lamps, the company began making portable stoves for heating and cooking, bicycle headlights and brass sheeting and wire. The company grew to 1200 employees and the value of the stock increased several times. By 1913, the company was a major producer of all types of petroleum and gas lamps. The outbreak of World War I briefly interrupted the success of the business, as HASAG lost important foreign markets, but this was soon supplanted by the production of small arms. HASAG's 1914 annual report included the news that in September, the company had, after making some adjustments to its operation, succeeded in obtaining large orders for military supplies, which allowed the company to return to [...] "normal sales revenues". In fact, the company's net profit tripled over its previous non-military sales. The company made rounds and other military items in heavy use on the front.|$|E

25|$|As time progressed metal objects {{became more}} common, and ever more complex. The need to further acquire and work metals grew in importance. Skills related to extracting metal ores {{from the earth}} began to evolve, and metalsmiths became more knowledgeable. Metalsmiths became {{important}} members of society. Fates and economies of entire civilizations were greatly affected by the availability of metals and metalsmiths. The metalworker depends on the extraction of precious metals to make jewelry, build more efficient electronics, and for industrial and technological applications from construction to shipping containers to rail, and air transport. Without <b>metals,</b> <b>goods</b> and services would cease to move around the globe on the scale we know today.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{the newly}} {{discovered}} KxFe 2 -ySe 2 systems are doped Mott or band insulators {{is key to}} how superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. With extant theoretical studies supporting conflicting scenarios, a more realistic approach is urgently called for. Here, we use LDA+DMFT to study this issue in KxFe 2 -ySe 2. We find that the undoped KFe 1. 6 Se 2 system is {{a new kind of}} Mott-Kondo insulator (MKI). Electron doping this MKI drives a Mott transition to an orbital-selective non-Fermi liquid <b>metal.</b> <b>Good</b> agreement with spectral and transport responses supports our view, implying that superconductivity arises from a doped Mott insulator, as in the high-Tc cuprates.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the optimum}} use of {{cellular}} <b>metals,</b> <b>good</b> {{knowledge of the}} properties is a necessary precondition. One of the significant thermophysical properties is the effective thermal conductivity representing the various heat transfer processes. Furthermore, cellular metals have complex structures, which make the experimental investigation of this effective thermal conductivity rather complicated. For the present investigations, hollow sphere structures from different steel alloys and open cell structures made of FeCrAl have been measured with two instruments, the transient plane source technique and the panel test technique up to about 250 °C and 800 °C in air, respectively. The results of both methods show good agreement. The effective thermal conductivity measurements {{are influenced by the}} effects of temperature, porosity and pore diameter...|$|R
