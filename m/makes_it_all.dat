25|$|The {{modulation}} of {{the radio}} emissions by planetary rotation is traditionally {{used to determine the}} rotation period of the interiors of fluid giant planets. In the case of Saturn, however, this appears to be impossible, as the period varies at the timescale of tens years. In 1980–1981 the periodicity in the radio emissions as measured by Voyager 1 and 2 was , which was then adopted as the rotational period of Saturn. Scientists were surprised when Galileo and then Cassini returned a different value—. Further observation indicated that the modulation period changes by as much as 1% on the characteristic timescale of 20–30days with an additional long term trend. There is a correlation between the period and solar wind speed, however, the causes of this change remain a mystery. One reason may be that the saturnian perfectly axially symmetric magnetic field fails to impose a strict corotation on the magnetospheric plasma making it slip relative to the planet. The lack of a precise correlation between the variation period of SKR and planetary rotation <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> but impossible to determine the true rotational period of Saturn.|$|E

[...] The Sun commented that [...] "has done the impossible – made the blue rinse sexy". Anna Pickard from The Guardian heavily compared Aguilera to Britney Spears in the video, saying: [...] "We're at a final count of four Christinas to five Britneys. [...] We can't be seen to have achieved a perfect Xtina/Britney balance. [...] We'd probably need a guest appearance from Madonna for that". She also felt that [...] "the 30-second Target advert {{is better than the}} whole video. But still: any release that makes it compulsory to type 'Christina Aguilera Keeps Getting Better' is surely a clever ploy".|$|E

At Metacritic, a website that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 19 reviews. Reviewer Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone praised the [...] "potent guitar riffs" [...] and the introspective themes, {{which he called}} [...] "stronger and broader than autobiography". NMEs April Long felt that [...] "even the quieter moments bristle" [...] and considered the album an affirmation of the band's quality. Michael Paoletta of Billboard considered the album [...] "among the band's best work" [...] and that the themes gave the record [...] "an emotional intimacy that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> more satisfying". Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker rated the album A-, calling it full of [...] "unexpected exhilaration" [...] and liking the [...] "exploration of various relationships" [...] on the lyrics. The Austin Chronicle reviewer praised the heavy sound of the album, saying it drifted from the light-hearted tone of songs such as [...] "Big Me" [...] while [...] "retaining their melodic instincts".|$|E

He concluded, that it's [...] "a flipside" [...] to Mars' lead single.. HitFix's critic Melinda Newman gave the track a B- rating, praising the melody and Mars' vocal delivery, writing [...] "he <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> sound so sweet, and as if he really is tortured by these young girls", but ultimately calling the lyrics [...] "a little skeevy". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, while reviewing the album, believed that it [...] "swells something serious. The ambition is undeniable". He compared it {{to the music of}} U2 and Daughtry.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Nobody is a {{tale about}} choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a {{position}} where he must make an impossible decision – to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future) once solved <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the more difficult – [...] "I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one." [...] The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality, is epitomized by the constant change in storyline, between young boy, adolescent, and mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalists view of the nature and existence of life in the universe. Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time. How actions have universal consequences, how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way – every single choice, no matter its simplicity or complexity can make, alter or change a lifetime.|$|E

[...] That same year, Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar named it as number one top [...] "cult-classic franchise" [...] that should be rebooted in a way Prince of Persia was, commenting that [...] "despite a small cast of characters, minimalist gameplay, and some truly grueling difficulty, Another World... resonated with gamers in ways they weren't expecting.

500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E
