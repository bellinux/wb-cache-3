25|$|Robert Patrick as Bud Mayberry – Leader of a polygamist <b>fringe</b> <b>group.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} {{background of}} the plot depicts an alliance between Scottish nationalist <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> and loyalist paramilitaries who believe they're being 'sold out' in the peace deal with the IRA. While there is significant support for loyalist paramilitarism in Scotland, radical Scottish nationalist <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> {{are far more likely}} to support the Irish Republican cause and to see the Republic of Ireland as a partial role model for an independent Scotland.|$|R
50|$|Her {{changing}} and increasingly radical beliefs increasingly ostracised her from mainstream Christianity {{and even from}} <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> such as the Millerites and Mormons.|$|R
50|$|The newly founded Reform Party also contested the election, but was {{considered}} {{little more than}} a <b>fringe</b> <b>group,</b> and did not win any seats.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{terrorism}} in Islam, Winn {{claims that the}} cause is [...] "not Osama Bin-Laden, not Al-Qaeda, not some radical <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of extremists, but Islam itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of Québécois radicals, Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents (English: The Wheelchair Assassins; A.F.R.), plans {{a violent}} geopolitical coup, and is opposed by {{high-level}} US operatives.|$|R
5000|$|Despite various {{initiatives}} aimed at [...] "rebuilding the black movement", the organisation was, by the mid-1990s, {{more of a}} marginal <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> {{than it had been}} in 1970.|$|R
50|$|Nate Phelps, {{an atheist}} and estranged son of Fred Phelps, {{the founder of}} the <b>fringe</b> <b>group,</b> Westboro Baptist Church, {{supported}} the Reason Rally and was among the event's speakers.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{new forms}} of {{antisemitism}} is the denial of the Holocaust by revisionist historians and neo-Nazis. Holocaust denial serves as a powerful conspiracy theory uniting otherwise disparate <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|Supreme Court nominee John Roberts filed court briefs {{supporting}} violent <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> and {{a convicted}} clinic bomber... America can't afford a justice whose ideology {{leads him to}} excuse violence against other Americans.|$|R
50|$|On March 2, 2008, AffiliationQuebec held a rally, {{inviting}} Howard Galganov to speak. At the rally, an AffiliationQuebec supporter {{wrestled with}} a member of a small, sovereigntist <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> protesting the Galganov speech.|$|R
30|$|This {{effort on}} the part of Gap {{represents}} a proactive approach to fostering professional development among uneducated women, who have historically represented a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> in the apparel industry (cf., Hart & Sharma, 2004).|$|R
50|$|Humanity's Last Stand is {{a fictional}} radical anti-mutant <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> {{appearing}} in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters are depicted as {{enemies of the}} X-Men. The group's first appearance was in Uncanny X-Men Annual 1995.|$|R
50|$|In November, the Powhatan ambushed {{and killed}} Captain John Ratcliffe, {{who had gone}} to Orapax to buy corn. Francis West sailed to the Patawomecks, a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> among Powhatan's subjects, for corn, but {{beheaded}} two of them, then absconded directly to England.|$|R
50|$|The EPP {{began as}} an {{offshoot}} of another radical <b>fringe</b> <b>group,</b> the Free Homeland Party (Partido Patria Libre - PPL). After the PPL was taken apart by police in 2005, several members decided {{to form a new}} group with which to continue the armed struggle.|$|R
50|$|Many {{conservative}} Christian {{groups were}} critical of Explo '72 for its ecumenical involvement with both Protestant and Roman Catholic ministries, {{and for its}} use of rock music. The event attracted Jesus movement <b>fringe</b> <b>groups,</b> including the Children of God and the Christian World Liberation Front.|$|R
50|$|The group formed part of {{a number}} of Conservative Party linked <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> which came to {{prominence}} in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Monday Club, Tory Action and WISE (Welsh, Irish, Scottish, English), but is now positioned outside of the Conservative Party.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hertz results {{gave the}} Maxwellians, who until then {{were only a}} small <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of {{electrical}} theorists, the experimental basis they had previously lacked and helped them overcome the objections of the 'practical' telegraphers and place them {{at the center of}} British electrical science." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fringe</b> <b>Group</b> - {{members of}} this clique follow {{in the shadow of}} members of the popular clique—they mimic the popular cliques' actions, {{structure}} and guidelines, but are not actually part of it. They are [...] "second in line" [...] to the popular kids.|$|R
50|$|A former {{features}} {{editor and}} current {{contributing editor for}} British GQ, he has written for several magazines and newspapers including The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Los Angeles Times, Marie Claire, Maxim and Details. He writes generally about social issues, <b>fringe</b> <b>groups,</b> the entertainment industry and boxing.|$|R
50|$|Sepharial's {{comments}} {{ignored the}} fact that Waltemath's proposed moon had already been discredited by the scientific community {{at the turn of}} the century. There are many readily apparent holes in the arguments supporting Lilith's existence, and the existence of this astronomical object is believed only by <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} set of policies, the {{government}} targeted specific policies and actions at <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b> An example of this is the Accelerated Rural Development Programme of 1964, the Isan component of which included the strengthening of allegiance to Bangkok {{and the rest of the}} country as one of its objectives.|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{response}} by the leadership has given pause, but has generally reinforced the {{feeling in the}} Haredi world that the 'Sanhedrin' is a complete non-issue, and it is generally ignored by the Haredi press. It is considered a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> and is considered unrelated to the Haredi community.|$|R
25|$|They {{therefore}} {{claim that}} it is morally indefensible for Daneel to ruthlessly sacrifice robots and extraterrestrial sentient life {{for the benefit of}} humanity. None of these reinterpretations successfully displace Daneel's Zeroth Law — though Foundation's Triumph hints that these robotic factions remain active as <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> up to the time of the novel Foundation.|$|R
5000|$|He has {{publicly}} {{commented on the}} usefulness of online communities in helping minister to the gay Christian community: [...] "The Internet has made {{a huge difference in}} creating a movement .... What at first might have seemed a little <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> is then able to gain momentum as people meet others and discover they’re not alone." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> and {{individuals}} {{such as those}} within some fundamentalist religious organizations, survivalists, cults, anti-social movements, self-sufficiency enthusiasts, communes and others attracted to conspiracy theories, embraced Y2K {{as a tool to}} engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. End-of-the-world scenarios and apocalyptic themes were common in their communication.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, many fringe theatres began to receive small subsidies. After the 1973-74 stock market crash, many fringe {{companies}} {{were forced to}} close. New playwrights were established at the Bush Theatre and King's Head Theatre, both of whom survived the crash. 7:84 and Red Ladder Theatre Company {{were some of the}} surviving touring <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is then {{revealed}} that all Ashley's classmates, including Proxy, Binder, and the babysitter {{murdered in the}} opening, {{are all part of}} a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> of Anonymous. They created the Smiley myth as a large-scale prank, although they are satisfied with Ashley's death. Binder states that Smiley will likely live on long after them and inspire copycat killings.|$|R
50|$|While not {{actually}} creating division {{among the different}} Jewish groups, the new Sanhedrin has generated {{a great deal of}} debate about its purpose and potential. While most Jews see the new Sanhedrin as an attempt by a <b>fringe</b> <b>group</b> to re-establish the Temple, many have seen it as a potential vehicle to champion a specific cause.|$|R
25|$|The {{relatively}} {{limited space}} given to Nazi German propaganda and ideology, or their domestic sympathizer <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> in Finland, can probably {{be seen as}} one of the many important joint contributions of Ryti, Tanner, and Mannerheim. Ryti's government must also be credited for the fact that Finland remained a genuine democracy unlike any other continental European country that participated in World War II.|$|R
50|$|Anti-Catalanism in {{its most}} virulent form is mostly {{associated}} with far-right Spanish political parties. <b>Fringe</b> <b>groups</b> such as España 2000 (none of which obtained more than 0.5% of the votes in the last general elections) object strongly to the autonomy enjoyed by Catalonia, claiming that the granting of autonomy to Catalonia and other regions {{will lead to the}} breakup of Spain.|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} {{limited space}} given to Nazi German propaganda and ideology, or their domestic sympathizer <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> in Finland, can probably {{be seen as}} one of the many important joint contributions of Ryti, Tanner, and Mannerheim. Ryti's government must also be credited for the fact that Finland remained a genuine democracy unlike any other continental European country that participated in World War II.|$|R
5000|$|In post-war Germany {{the fate}} of civilians and prisoners of war has been a {{contentious}} topic. The current view of the German government is that these losses were due to an aggressive war started by the German nation. [...] However, there are <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> who attempt to trivialize the crimes of the Hitler period by comparing German losses to the Holocaust.|$|R
2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|R
50|$|According to Erdoğan's 4 June {{speech from}} Morocco, the demonstrators are mostly looters, {{political}} losers and extremist <b>fringe</b> <b>groups.</b> He {{went on to}} say they went hand-in-hand with 'terrorists' and 'extremists'. He indicated that these protests were organised by the Republican Peoples Party (even though the CHP had initially supported construction on the Gezi-park). Turkey analysts however suggested the demonstrations arose from bottom-up processes, lacking leadership.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{supporters}} of Irish neutrality oppose the deepening of the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union. Supporters of EU integration have accused opponents of stirring rumours about conscription into a European army. Such claims were made regarding the Treaty of Lisbon by some <b>fringe</b> <b>groups</b> during the 2008 referendum campaign and believed by [...] "48% of 'no' voters and remarkably 26% of 'yes' voters".|$|R
