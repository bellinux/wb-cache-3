5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air <b>missiles</b> <b>and</b> so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic <b>missiles</b> <b>and</b> nuclear missiles.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, <b>missiles</b> <b>and</b> agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and anti-missile turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E
5|$|Iowa {{was then}} towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, where {{over the next}} several months the {{battleship}} was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk <b>missiles,</b> <b>and</b> a quartet of Phalanx Close-in weapon system Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship <b>missiles</b> <b>and</b> enemy aircraft. Iowa was the first battleship to receive the RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones, which replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16inch (410mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire-control systems for her guns and <b>missiles,</b> <b>and</b> improved electronic warfare capabilities. Armed as such, Iowa was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984, ahead of schedule, within her budget at a cost of $500million, and under the command of Captain Gerald E. Gneckow. In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to Iowa engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv) inspection was skipped.|$|E

5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise <b>missiles</b> <b>and</b> {{unmanned}} combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both.

5|$|The Končar-class is a {{class of}} six missile boats built for the Yugoslav Navy during the late 1970s at Tito's Shipyard Kraljevica, SR Croatia. The boats {{featured}} a mixture of Western and Eastern equipment, including Soviet anti-ship <b>missiles</b> <b>and</b> Swedish guns.|$|E
5|$|The XF4H-1 was {{designed}} to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided <b>missiles,</b> <b>and</b> to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45° and was equipped with blown flaps for better low-speed handling.|$|E
