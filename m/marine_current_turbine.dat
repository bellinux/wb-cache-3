The tidal flows in which they operate are highly turbulent, but {{the characteristics of the}} inflow turbulence have not being considered in present design methods. This work considers the effects of inflow turbulence on the wake behind an actuator disc representation of a <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine.</b> Different turbulence intensities and integral length scales were generated in a large eddy simulation using a gridInlet, which produces turbulence from a grid pattern on the inlet boundary. The results highlight the significance of turbulence on the wake profile, with a different flow regime occurring for the zero turbulence case. Increasing the turbulence intensity reduced the velocity deficit and shifted the maximum deficit closer to the turbine. Increasing the integral length scale increased the velocity deficit close to the turbine due to an increased production of turbulent energy. However, the wake recovery was increased due to the higher rate of turbulent mixing causing the wake to expand. The implication of this work is that <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> arrays could be further optimized, increasing the energy yield of the array when the site-specific turbulence characteristics are considered...|$|E
40|$|If a turbine {{loses its}} {{electrical}} load, it will rotate freely and increase speed, eventually achieving that rotational speed which produces zero net torque. This {{is known as}} a runaway situation. Unlike many other types of turbine, a <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> will typically overshoot the final runaway speed before slowing down and settling at the runaway speed. Since the hydrodynamic forces acting on the turbine are dependent on rotational speed and acceleration, turbine behaviour during runaway becomes important for load analyses during turbine design. In this article, we consider analytical and numerical models of <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> runaway behaviour in one dimension. The analytical model is found not to capture the overshoot phenomenon, while still providing useful estimates of acceleration at the onset of runaway. The numerical model incorporates turbine wake build-up and predicts a rotational speed overshoot. The predictions of the models are compared against measurements of runaway of a <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine.</b> The models are also used to recreate previously-published results for a tidal turbine and applied to a wind turbine. It is found that both models provide reasonable estimates of maximum accelerations. The numerical model is found to capture the speed overshoot well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{regard to}} marine {{renewable}} energies, significant electrical {{power can be}} extracted from marine tidal current. However, the power harnessed by a <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> varies due to the periodicity of the tidal phenomenon and could be highly fluctuant caused by swell effect. To improve the power quality and make the marine current generation system more reliable, energy storage systems will play a crucial role. In this paper, the power fluctuation phenomenon is described {{and the state of}} art of energy storage technologies is presented. Characteristics of various energy storage technologies are analyzed and compared for marine application. The comparison shows that high-energy batteries like sodium-sulphur battery and flow battery are favorable for smoothing the long-period power fluctuation due to the tide phenomenon while supercapacitors and flywheels are suitable for eliminating short-period power disturbances due to swell or turbulence phenomena. It means that hybrid storage technologies are needed for achieving optimal performance in marine current energy systems. Index Terms—Energy storage, <b>Marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine...</b>|$|E

This study initially used theoretical double-multiple-streamtube models, followed by physical testing on a scaled-down model turbine and primarily numerical simulations. Numerical investigations of a proposed full-scale turbine(power coefficient, blade loads and flow behaviour) were undertaken using the developed computational models. The turbine design was studied using a time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) commercial solver. A transient-rotor-stator model with a moving mesh technique was used to capture the change in flow field {{at a particular time}} step. A shear stress-transport k-omega turbulence model was used to model turbulent features of the flow. The numerical results show good agreement with experimental measurements and the theoretical double-multiple-streamtube model.

40|$|Abstract—Variations {{of marine}} current speed {{may lead to}} strong {{fluctuations}} in the power extracted by a <b>marine</b> <b>current</b> <b>turbine</b> (MCT). During short-time period, swell effect is the main cause for the current speed variations. Conventional tip speed ratio Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm will require the MCT to accelerate or to decelerate frequently under swell effect, which can cause severe fluctuations in the generator power. This paper focuses on power smoothing control of grid-connected MCT system. In the first step, a modified MPPT algorithm with filter strategy is proposed in generator-side control to mitigate the fluctuation of generator power. In the second step, Super-capacitor (SC) Energy Storage System (ESS) is added to compensate the residual power fluctuations. Simulations of a 1. 5 MW direct-driven grid-connected MCT system are carried out. The swell effect {{is calculated based on}} typical system location and sea state. Detailed control strategies and SC sizing are described. The results demonstrate that the association of the generator-side filter strategy with the SC ESS system achieves a smoothed power injected to the grid in case of swell disturbances.
