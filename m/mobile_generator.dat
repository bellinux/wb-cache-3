25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases. The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a <b>mobile</b> <b>generator.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyse radial {{networks}} in rural areas for the deployment of <b>mobile</b> <b>generators</b> that maintain electricity supply {{in the event of}} a forced outage. Maintaining the electricity supply in such a situation would minimise forced outage compensation costs a network operator has to pay after 12 hours of forced outage. The deployment of <b>mobile</b> <b>generators</b> will offer an important option in guaranteeing that both forced and planned outages in underground cable networks do not take longer than 24 hours. Through analyses of two case studies of radial networks, I have developed reference charts so that <b>mobile</b> <b>generators</b> can be quickly deployed and power supply returned within 12 hours. The <b>mobile</b> <b>generators</b> are to be connected to substations to feed other substations in the radial network through medium voltage cables. Only voltage drop and loadability have been considered in this study. The methodology I used for creating the reference charts can be applied to other radial networks and extended to include other limitations in the application of <b>mobile</b> <b>generators.</b> Validerat; 20140613 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

Major facilities included constructing a bridge in Noresund, a new road from Noresund to Fjellhvil, a telecommunications building on the hill that included 12 communications lines and facilities for the race director, 30 telephone lines along the course, and construction of the Norefjellstua hotel.

40|$|Abstract The {{electronic}} power conversion system and control for an advanced <b>mobile</b> <b>generator</b> set is described. The military generator set uses an internal combustion diesel engine to drive a radial-gap permanent magnet alternator at variable speed. The speed of the engine is determined from a user selectable interface that for a given load and ambient thermal conditions controls the engine to run at its most efficient operating point. It is also possible to control the engine to run where it is most audibly quiet, at its least-polluting operating point, or at its most reliable, stiffest point such that it is less sensitive to load transients. The variable frequency, variable voltage produced by the permanent magnet alternator is diode-rectified to dc voltage, and an inverter is used to produce selectable frequency, controllable ac voltage. The power conversion system also incorporates a bi-directional dc-dc converter that can charge 24 V batteries {{that are used to}} start the IC engine and to power auxiliary loads. The bi-directional converter can also draw power from the batteries to help maintain the dc link during severe load transients.

The military generator set uses an internal combustion diesel engine {{to drive a}} radial-gap permanent magnet alternator at variable speed. The speed of the engine is determined from a user selectable interface that for a given load and ambient thermal conditions controls the engine to run at its most efficient operating point. The variable frequency, variable voltage produced by the permanent magnet alternator is diode-rectified to a high voltage (~ 400 V) dc link, and an inverter is used to produce selectable frequency, controllable ac voltage. As part of the power electronics for this unit, a 7 kW bi-directional dc-dc converter has also been developed. The converter can charge 24 V batteries {{that are used to}} start the internal combustion engine and to power auxiliary low voltage dc loads. Additionally, the bi-directional converter can also draw power from the batteries to help maintain the high voltage dc link during severe load transients. Because of stringent weight and volume requirements for this application, the minimum in energy storage elements (high frequency transformers, capacitors, and inductors) was used.
