40|$|A {{need for}} a hand-ergonomics <b>training</b> <b>kit</b> has been {{identified}} to increase critical thinking concerning choice of hand tools. This study deals with the design, use and evaluation of a hand-ergonomics <b>training</b> <b>kit</b> for use in ergonomics training programmes. The effects on awareness of hand ergonomics among training course participants have been evaluated {{by means of a}} questionnaire and interviews at a car production plant in Sweden. The evaluation was carried out about one and a half years after training with the hand-ergonomics <b>training</b> <b>kit.</b> The <b>training</b> <b>kit</b> consists of a guide to practical exercises, equipment for measuring hand size and strength, examples of hand tools for use in practical exercises, equipment for testing and evaluating the hand tools and checklists and judgement forms for qualitative evaluation. In addition, the kit contains relevant scientifically based reference reports on hand ergonomics. The evaluation showed that the practical exercises with the hand-ergonomic <b>training</b> <b>kit</b> had, to a remarkable extent, increased individuals' awareness of anthropometric differences and of the importance of ergonomically well-designed hand tools. After the practical exercises with the <b>training</b> <b>kit,</b> communication within the plant when choosing hand tools seems to be based on objective criteria to a higher degree, however, the results indicate that this communication could be further improved.

The research uses quasi-experimental method with pre and post test design. The material is limited to sequential motion control using two actuators for objects transfer. Control class uses instructional media <b>training</b> <b>kit,</b> while experimental class uses development-result trainer. Essay tests are in form of diagram circuit for application of electroplating products transfer. The results show that the developed pneumatic trainer and <b>training</b> <b>kit</b> are quite effective as media of learning in sequential motion control. Statistical tests indicate no significant difference between the two groups, so that it can be concluded that compared to <b>training</b> <b>kit,</b> the developed pneumatic trainer is not more effective as learning media...|$|R

The training tool was developed by subjecting successive versions to critical feedback provided by focus groups. Then training provided by this new training tool was compared with the training provided by extant literary materials on the two phenomena. Results suggest that the training tool was more effective in teaching the student to recognize sensory awareness and unsymbolized thinking than were essay-based <b>training</b> materials. The <b>multimedia</b> <b>training</b> tool methodology offers a promising, portable method of training that could further our understanding and skill of recognizing inner experience phenomenon identified by DES...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Training</b> <b>Kits</b> for JPJ is a {{courseware}} {{which enables}} the candidate {{to understand better}} on {{the rules and regulations}} on the road. The purpose of this report was to examine the implications of the current Driver’s Education Curriculum (DEC) test. The candidates who sit for the test feel bored with the text based test especially the long question with many words. Beside this, some specific term also makes candidates didn’t understand the question as well. Internet searching, journals, books and other related resource are part of the methods for doing this analysis. With the potential to solve these problems, the <b>Training</b> <b>Kits</b> for JPJ has been developing. This <b>Training</b> <b>Kits</b> for JPJ is a courseware which use the Driver’s Education Curriculum (DEC) test’s questions combined with some interactive multimedia elements. With this, candidates will be able to understand better about what the question asking about and will have a better understanding. After the findings, Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phase has been chosen to be used to build up this <b>Training</b> <b>Kits</b> for JPJ’s system and make sure the process of building it become more systematics. The main purpose for this <b>Training</b> <b>Kits</b> for JPJ is to create an interactive environment for the candidates and make sure they can understand the law of traffic better through the courseware which made up with the Driver Education Curriculum (DEC) test’s questions and multimedia elements. If the candidates clearly understand the rules and obey them, then it can really decrease the rate of accidents that occurs on the road.

40|$|Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is an {{industry}} demand practical based subject which required hands on experience of programming and hardware wiring. Because of such nature, the course is usually delivered {{with the help of}} PLC <b>training</b> <b>kit.</b> The kit generally consists of PLC incorporating switches as an input and lamps as an output. However cost of owning a PLC <b>training</b> <b>kit</b> is quite expensive and the PLC itself dominates the total cost. In this project, a solution for catering such an issue is proposed by introducing PLCduino <b>training</b> <b>kit.</b> Basically the systems use standard PLC Ladder diagram and implement it under cheap Arduino microcontroller platform. The Ladder instruction set is automatically converted to the Arduino language with the usage of LDuino software, while the PLC voltage requirement is fulfilled by using couple of relay boards. The system is expected to deliver the same performance of standard PLC system with more than 50 percent cheaper in price...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to develop}} a practical reference guide that trainers and courseware developers can use as an on-the-job performance support tool to develop effective <b>multimedia,</b> computer-based <b>training</b> (CBT) courseware. The foundation for the project was a model that could be applied by corporate training departments to develop in-house expertise for <b>multimedia</b> <b>training</b> production. The purpose was to develop tools {{that can be used to}} teach in-house trainers how to design and develop courseware for <b>multimedia</b> based <b>training</b> following accepted principles and models of adult learning, instructional design, and computer-based <b>training</b> <b>multimedia</b> software design. The framework of the proposed model consisted of the following phases: Tools, Standards, Templates, Staff Development, and Support. The model includes guidelines for the selection of software and hardware tools to support the effort; development and documentation of guidelines and standards for CBT design; creation of templates to facilitate CBT authoring; planning and implementation of a staff development program to teach trainers how to apply the principles of adult learning and the instructional design model to <b>multimedia</b> <b>training</b> and how to use pre-authoring and authoring software tools; and a plan to provide support to novice CBT designers...|$|R
