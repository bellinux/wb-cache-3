This was supplemented by two 4-inch Mark XVI* guns in a single twin turret, a quad-barrelled 2-pounder Mark VIII pom pom, six single 20 mm Oerlikons, a quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tube set, and a rail to launch depth charges. During 1945, the six Oerlikons were replaced with six 40 mm Bofors guns, and two depth charge throwers were added.

50|$|The most {{important}} customer {{of the preceding}} company, the Imperial Russian Navy, did not place any orders in 1914, although Europe was under threat of war. However, Ab Crichton got an order through detour for eight <b>motor</b> <b>cutters</b> for Nikolayev shipyard at Black Sea. The yard had outsourced the project to Turku Andrée & Rosenqvist company, which further outsourced it to Ab Crichton. The terms of the deal were strict regarding maximum weight and minimum speed, but Ab Crichton fulfilled {{the requirements of the}} 156 900 rubles deal.|$|R
50|$|Ab Crichton got {{an order}} for four 162-feet steamers in February 1916. The {{customer}} is not known, but most likely it was the Admiralty, that used the boats later for patrolling in the Finnish archipelago. The order led to shortage of workforce, and in May Ab Crichton published an announcement on newspapers, that the company sought for numerous sheet metal workers. The total headcount reached 500 {{at the end of}} the year. During the same year the company delivered 14 steam engines, some boilers and pumps to Saint Petersburg. In October the company got two orders for vessels: the first one included two 40-feet <b>motor</b> <b>cutters</b> and the second one four 185-feet steamers. The future looked bright.|$|R
50|$|A pulling cutter was a boat {{carried by}} sailing ships {{for work in}} fairly {{sheltered}} water in which load-carrying capacity was needed, for example in laying a kedge. This operation was the placing of a relatively light anchor {{at a distance from}} the ship so as to be able to haul her off in its direction. The oars were double-banked. That is, there were two oarsmen on each thwart. In a seaway, the longboat was preferred to the cutter as the finer lines of the stern of the former meant that it was less likely to broach to in a following sea. In the Royal Navy the cutters were replaced by 25 and 32 ft <b>motor</b> <b>cutters.</b> However, the cutters' traditional work had grown beyond the capacity of a boat as ships became larger. Though primarily a pulling boat, this cutter could also be rigged for sailing.|$|R
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914 the Imperial Russian Navy needed urgently steam and combustion engine propelled cutters. In order to cope with the increased demand, in particular the Russian order, the company built a modern workshop in Uittamo. The older yard got a foundry, sheet metal workshops and other investments. Although the company didn't build steam engines it got an order for eight steam cutters, to be delivered between April and July in the following year. The ships including their engines were produced as subcontracting at the nearby Crichton yard. The largest order of the Russian Navy, 24 <b>motor</b> <b>cutters</b> of 18 metres long, came most likely in early 1916. The vessels were not handed over before the February Revolution. It is assumed that Andrée & Rosenqvist received {{the first quarter of the}} payment, but the remaining part never came. In 1918 the government of the newly independent Finland took possession of the Russian navy vessels, including 70 cutters of various sizes, of which 20 were handed over to Soviet Russia after according to Tartu peace treaty. Presumably Andrée & Rosenqvist got just 250000 marks from the Finnish government for the cutters ordered by Russia. The last bargains with Russia were almost deadly to the company, but it recovered fast after. The total number of cutters delivered to the Imperial Russian Navy during the war is not known.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot <b>motor</b> <b>cutters</b> were fastened this way.|$|R
2500|$|Boat {{building}} is another industry {{with a long}} history in Christchurch and indeed George Holloway (below) started his career building boats on Mudeford Spit. Some of the boatyards have gone, notably Tom Lack's Catamarans (Catalac), liquidated in 1986, and Robert Ives which moved to New Milton around 1982 but many boat yards are still trading including: Elkins, Strides and Purbrook-Rossiter who have been building yachts and dinghies {{on the banks of the}} Avon since 1938. Not forgetting Bob Hoare who built Olympic gold medal winning dinghies in his own back garden. Elkins built a large number of yachts including the Laurent Giles designed Vertues. When the demand for wooden boats fell, moulds for glassfibre boats were built there. Between 1976 and 1981, Fletcher Sports Boats constructed fast power boats and Evolution class yachts at the same site. In 1929 a boat was built with an innovative propulsion system, precipitated by the lack of depth in the harbour. In order to operate in shallow water it is essential to have protected screws which protrude a minimum distance below the hull. The Hotchkiss Propulsion System provided a new approach to the problem whereby water was drawn in through an intake and forced through an outlet in the stern; internal, rotating cones providing the motive power. This cone propulsion is, in a developed form, still in use today. Many of the boats built for use in the harbour were constructed with a slipper stern, a stern which slopes the 'wrong way' so the boat is longer on the waterline than above. This design helps to minimise the disturbance caused by the screw and helps reduce wash. [...] During WWII, the boatyard that was later to become Elkins, was pressed into service by the Admiralty. It produced over 200 specialised craft including 25' <b>motor</b> <b>cutters</b> and 72' landing craft. Purbrook-Rossiter also stopped their normal activities during this time to produce whalers and lifeboats. The beginning of the depression at the end of the 1980s left only a few boatbuilders trading from over 200 years of documented boatbuilding.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{machines}} {{being in}} operational service with military units of  engineer troops are fit to their purpose and their application is relevant in modern conditions. Maintenance of operating conditions in engineering equipment which was produced earlier by the USSR enterprises is {{considered as a}} rather complicated task {{due to lack of}} spare parts because their production has been discontinued. One of the approaches used for maintenance of engineering equipment combat capabilities is modernization of operating drive systems that presupposes replacement of mechanical systems in working element drives by hydrostatic drives which are realized while using modern element base. Usage of hydraulic units in drive systems being in mass production for replacement of mechanical systems manufactured earlier in small batches makes it possible to reduce labour inputs for maintenance and repair of machines. The paper presents some possibilities for development of operating drive systems in engineering equipment. The proposed approach is given through an example of  engineering obstacle-clearing vehicle (IMR- 2 M) and excavation machines (MDK- 3 and MDK- 2 M). Application of a hydraulic drive in working elements of the excavation machines permits to withdraw from cardan  shafts, a gear box, a rotary gear and an overload clutch. A hydraulic <b>motor</b> of the <b>cutter</b> and thrower drive is mounted  on a working element gearbox. While executing modernization of hydraulic systems in excavation machines a pump unit has been proposed for the cutter and thrower drive which consists of a controlled pump and a system for automatic maintenance of the pump operational parameters. While developing the operating drive systems in engineering equipment in accordance with the proposed requirements it is possible to simplify drive systems of working elements and  ensure reliable machinery operation in the units of engineer troops.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Rock salt is {{globally}} predominantly mined by {{drilling and}} blasting. Despite the hazards {{associated with the}} handling of explosives and the complexity of a blasting operation, mechanical mining methods have not played {{a big role in}} winning operations. Mechanical mining methods have been used in rocksalt mines mainly for development or special tasks for many years, but it is improvements of machine weight and <b>cutter</b> <b>motor</b> performance made in the last years that have allowed for an economically feasible mining. Besides roadheaders and Marietta miners mainly used for drifting in rocksalt mines, continuous miners have been utilized in winning mainly in US potash mines. In comparison to the first mentioned machines continuous miners offer unique features making them especially suitable for the use in rocksalt mines. This thesis investigates the suitability of continuous miners for the production of rocksalt. The investigation includes specific boundary conditions as a basis for continuous miner operations as well as the layout of continuous miner systems with emphasis on the haulage chain. The economic and technical viability is demonstrated based on two mine layouts using continuous and batch haulage. The task is achieved by the use of a computer-based tool which has been developed for this investigation. It allows for evaluating a continuous miner operation based on changeable boundary conditions in an arbitrary rocksalt mine. The tool allows for appraising the stability of the selected panel layout, for checking the continuous miner power against minimum power required to cut the rock, for determining the production rates as well as the haulage system performance and for ascertaining the excavation time of a mine panel. Finally, the tool permits to calculate the cost per tonne of the continuous miner system...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Sasol Mining {{embarked}} on a renewal process during the beginning of 1998. The objective of this renewal process {{was based on a}} very clear case for change - Sasol Mining had to improve on its profitability as a coal mining company. The renewal process focussed on the following drivers: Q - The quality of coal delivered to the synthetic fuels plant (Sasol Synfuels) has to improve with respect to contamination. C - Production cost of coal/tonne must be contained, with an annual escalation of 1 % less than the Producer Price Index (PPI). D - Delivery (tonne/continuous miner/shift) must improve. S – The health and safety of the operations has to be improved substantially, e. g. dust in ventilated areas. M - Morale of employees has to be raised substantially. Referring to the above and specifically to `Delivery`, there was a potential threat that some of the underground (in-section) electrical equipment and infrastructure may be stressed beyond their design capacity and limits. A typical example was the question: Will the electric <b>cutter</b> <b>motors</b> on the continuous miner be able to cut continuously at the increased rate? This study proactively investigated the matter and analysed the effect of the increased demand on certain equipment and infrastructure of the electrical in-section systems. The objective was to determine the production capacities (tonne/continuous miner/shift) that can be sustained by utilising present mining equipment and cables. The power consumption of all the equipment in a standard section was measured to determine the present production capacity of various items of mining equipment used in a production section. The data was then evaluated to determine the limitations in the production section. These results will assist Sasol Mining to determine the focus for upgrading different items of production equipment, taking into account the production potential of the insection production equipment.

40|$|This thesis covers {{in detail}} {{a study of}} the {{excavation}} of rock salt by roadheader, the factors affecting performance and finally a specification with operational results of a new production machine to suit the South African Coal Mining Industry. Dosco Overseas Engineering Ltd. the author's employer, is introduced. Reference is made to how, over the years, performance prediction has radically changed from a mere approximation to a position where an accurate value with a performance guarantee is a necessity. Reference is made to the Universities of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Nottingham and Leeds who have been the main suppliers of rock testing facilities. The University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne has had further responsibilities for a specific test programme, funded by Dosco, to establish a Performance Prediction Methodology. A general introduction to the trial site at Domtar Salt, located in Canada, is given, along with the current mining methods and the particular aspects requiring consideration if machine mining were to be adopted. A detailed study over a twelve month period covering three main topics; fines production, performance rates, and cutter pick suitability is described. Results are discussed at length and valuable conclusions are drawn. Extrapolation of the results to predict the performance of a larger machine suitable to Domtar's high production requirements is shown. The ability to relate this study to other applications and, in particular, the aspect of pick penetration and its effect on machine design is discussed. A prediction curve suitable for South African coal is shown, along with the necessary calculations to enable a high production rate and the corresponding effect on machine design. Specification features, such as boom force, cutter head design and <b>cutter</b> <b>motor</b> power, are considered at length. The implications for the machine manufacturer for even larger, more powerful machines is shown. An early correlation· of findings is established by comparison to field results from a smaller single boom, Dosco roadheader. The study concludes that current or new machine design can be favourably influenced to reflect varying market requirements and that accurate prediction of machine performance is possible. A later, overall study of the TB 2500 shows achieved production rates and comments in particular, on machine mining rate and available mining time. Recommendations having particular reference to the equipment suppliers involvement in the sales procedure are given...|$|R
