25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make {{a down payment on}} a farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees for the purpose of making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all worked for <b>me</b> <b>many</b> a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked for me, and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E

500|$|History of a Six Weeks' Tour {{received}} {{three major}} reviews, mostly favourable. However, the book did not sell well. Percy Shelley discovered in April or May 1820 {{that there were}} no profits to pay the printer and when Charles Ollier, the co-publisher, went out of business in 1823, his inventory included 92 copies of the work. Still, Mary Shelley believed the work was successful, and when she proposed another travel narrative, Rambles in Germany and Italy, to publisher Edward Moxon in 1843, she wrote [...] "my 6 weeks tour brought <b>me</b> <b>many</b> compliments". Her comments may have been self-interested, however.|$|E

500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took <b>me</b> <b>many</b> years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Ten were completed in May 1991. Krusen left the band once the sessions were completed, checking himself into rehabilitation. According to Krusen, {{he was suffering}} from personal problems at the time. Krusen said, [...] "It was a great experience. I felt from the beginning of that band that it was something special," [...] and added, [...] "They had to let me go. I couldn't stop drinking, and it was causing problems. They gave <b>me</b> <b>many</b> chances, but I couldn't get it together." [...] In June, the band joined Tim Palmer in England for mixing. Palmer decided to mix the album at Ridge Farm Studios in Dorking, a converted farm that according to Palmer was [...] "about as far away from an L.A. or New York studio as you can get." [...] Palmer made a few additions to the already-recorded songs, including having McCready finish up the guitar solo on [...] "Alive" [...] and tweaking the intro to [...] "Black". Palmer overdubbed a pepper shaker and a fire extinguisher as percussion on [...] "Oceans".|$|E
500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I was so proud of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped <b>me</b> <b>many</b> times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was one guy who would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from <b>me?</b> <b>Many</b> better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|Stalmaster {{convinced}} Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought <b>me</b> <b>many</b> opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|E

Pascal renamed the boy [...] "Gustavus Vassa", after the Swedish noble who had become Gustav I of Sweden, king in the sixteenth century. Equiano had already been renamed twice: he was called Michael while on board the slave ship that {{brought him to the}} Americas; and Jacob, by his first owner. This time, Equiano refused and told his new owner that he would prefer to be called Jacob. His refusal, he says, [...] "gained <b>me</b> <b>many</b> a cuff" [...] – and eventually he submitted to the new name. He used this name {{for the rest of his}} life, including on all official records. He only used Equiano in his autobiography.|$|E

Harvey Milk, who spoke at political rallies at the Temple, wrote to Jones after one such visit: [...] "Rev Jim, It may take <b>me</b> <b>many</b> a day to come back down from the high that I reach today.

[...] Mourinho's fraught relationships with Sergio Ramos and club captain Iker Casillas (a popular player whom Mourinho sidelined in 2013) caused divisions between fans in the [...] "Mourinhistas" [...] and [...] "Madridistas" [...] (the more traditional Real Madrid fans) camps. His relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo became difficult because, according to Mourinho, the player [...] "maybe thinks that he knows everything and that the coach cannot improve him anymore", so was unwilling to accept constructive criticism. Mourinho was also criticised for controversial incidents, including poking Tito Vilanova (then assistant coach at Barcelona) in the eye during a brawl, continual complaints about refereeing bias, clashes with journalists and Real officials, and frequent hints that Barça received favourable treatment from UEFA.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a leading}} magnate of two kingdoms, an {{important}} palatine official, and ruler {{of a large}} marcher barony, Ponce de Cabrera kept a had a large following of knights who helped him rule his territories and discharge his obligations as a vassal of the crown in time of war. One of the first vassals of knightly rank who can be glimpsed in the entourage of Ponce is Pedro Rodríguez de Sanabria, who was with him to witness the first donation of Ponce and María Fernández as husband and wife. At Toledo on 4 May 1145, [...] "at {{the request of the}} Lord Count Ponce, whose knight he is", the emperor made over the deserted village of Calabor in Senabria to Pedro Rodríguez to resettle. On 14 May 1149 the emperor granted the village of Nogales to the count's son-in-law Vela Gutiérrez [...] "out of love for the service which you have done <b>me</b> <b>many</b> times and are doing for me daily." [...] These grants suggest that Ponce's landed estates were meagre in comparison to native-born lords, requiring him to rely on his suzerain to sufficiently compensate his vassals for their service. When the count's daughter and Vela founded a Benedictine monastery at Nogales in 1150, they thanked her father in their foundation charter for his [...] "counsel and aid" [...] (consilio vel auxilio) in obtaining the land.|$|E
2500|$|By the 16th century most {{visitors}} who left accounts argue against {{the notion that}} the pyramids were originally granaries constructed by the patriarch Joseph, if they mention it at all. [...] Many of the visitors inspected the ruins rather closely, often entering the great Pyramid, rather than simply viewing them from a distance. [...] The French traveler Greffin Affagart (Seigneur de Courteilles) visited the Pyramids in 1533 and noted that [...] "some call [...] the granaries of Pharaoh, but this is wrong because they are not hollow on the inside, rather they are sepulchers of some kings of Egypt." [...] The French explorer and naturalist Pierre Belon of Mans, a careful observer, records in 1546 that the great Pyramid [...] "was the sepulcher of the King of Egypt." [...] Another French explorer André Thevet, who visited three years later writes: [...] "The Jews have told <b>me</b> <b>many</b> times that they find in their Chronicles that these Pyramids were the support of the granaries of Pharaoh: that is not likely ... they are sepulchers of kings as appears from Herodotus ... since I saw in one pyramid a great stone of marble carved {{in the manner of a}} sepulcher." [...] Finally, in the 17th century, John Greaves, Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, published the first truly scientific work on the Pyramids, Pyramidographia (1646). He cites many of the ancient authors mentioned above, and dismisses the erroneous etymologies yielding notions of “receptacles and granaries,” and calls attention to the obvious fact “that this figure is most improper for such a purpose, a Pyramid being the least capacious of any regular mathematical body, the straitness and fewness of the rooms within (the rest of the building being one solid and intire fabric of stone) do utterly over-throw this conjecture.” [...] No longer could the notion be held credibly, though for over a millennium it had reigned supreme among European travelers.|$|E
