25|$|NOR {{memory has}} an {{external}} address bus for reading and programming. For NOR <b>memory,</b> <b>reading</b> and programming are random-access, and unlocking and erasing are block-wise.

2500|$|This {{command is}} {{identical}} to a generic <b>memory</b> <b>read,</b> but includes the hint that the read will continue {{to the end of}} the cache line. [...] A target is always permitted to consider this a synonym for a generic <b>memory</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R
50|$|The entry {{protocol}} uses normal <b>memory</b> <b>reads</b> to spin, {{waiting for}} the lock to become free. Test-and-set is only {{used to try to}} get the lock when normal <b>memory</b> <b>read</b> says its free.

2500|$|This {{command is}} {{identical}} to a generic <b>memory</b> <b>read,</b> but includes the hint that a long read burst will continue beyond {{the end of the}} current cache line, and the target should internally prefetch a large amount of data.

30|$|Therefore, {{even when}} the {{feedforward}} predistorter is chosen to be linearly interpolated, the nearest neighbor adaptation {{can be used in}} the update branch of the indirect learning architecture, without much performance penalty. Note that ZOH requires only one <b>memory</b> <b>read</b> and write for each data sample. On the other hand, the linearly interpolated adaptation requires two <b>memory</b> <b>reads</b> and writes per data sample, placing more stringent timing requirements on the adaptation hardware.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} reading achievement, metacognitive knowledge related to <b>reading</b> and <b>memory,</b> <b>reading</b> self-concept, {{and interest in}} reading of 140 German grade 3 and 4 students. The results indicated significant correlations between and among the metacognitive variables and motivational variables, and with reading achievement variables. Examination of good and poor readers showed significant differences in metacognitive knowledge of <b>reading</b> and <b>memory,</b> <b>reading</b> self-concept, interest in reading, and in teacher judgements of reading achievement between the groups. There were differences between the grades in word decoding skills, metacognitive knowledge about <b>reading</b> and <b>memory,</b> and teacher judgements of reading achievement. Reading achievement was predicted by grade level, word decoding, and teacher evaluations of reading achievement. Causal modeling indicated that motivation and metacognition affect reading comprehension in different ways...|$|R
