5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance to do battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E

25|$|Homestead property, {{which follows}} {{its own set}} of unique rules in states like Florida, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> {{separately}} from other assets. In many common law jurisdictions such as Canada, parts of the US, the UK, Australia and India, jointly owned property passes automatically to the surviving joint owner separately from any will, unless the equitable title is held as tenants in common.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors {{deviate from}} the ideal {{capacitor}} equation {{in a number}} of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be analyzed as nearly linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of an ideal capacitor. The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and ordinary (normal, e.g., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{a similar}} long list of demands (which the company had {{traditionally}} countered with in the past), Chandler gave the union only seven demands and advised it that these proposals <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with,</b> strike or no strike. The proposals were aimed at largely ending job transfers and seniority, adding five shifts a week, and instituting a mandatory overtime scheme; the company claimed it had lost $1.3 billion over the previous three years over these issues. Many companies in turnaround seek to improve product design and production processes, and managerial expertise before seeking labor concessions. But McCardell concluded that {{the fastest way to}} achieve cost savings was to persuade workers to accept work rules changes which would have cost employees $100 million. Surprisingly, however, IH agreed to match the pay increase pattern set earlier in the year by automobile manufacturers in Detroit.|$|E
60|$|Upon certain points modern Socialism is emphatic; {{women and}} {{children}} <b>must</b> not <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> as private property, women <b>must</b> <b>be</b> citizens equally with men, children <b>must</b> not <b>be</b> casually born, their parents <b>must</b> <b>be</b> known and worthy; {{that is to say}} there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> deliberation in begetting children, marriage under conditions. And there Socialism stops.|$|R
30|$|We also {{assume that}} the WMN has a single gateway. Though this is {{generally}} not true in large deployments, given static routing, for each node, {{there will be a}} single gateway. We thus partition a multi-gateway WMN into disjoint WMNs, each with a single gateway.

500|$|At {{a council}} at Kingston upon Thames in 838, Ecgberht and Æthelwulf granted {{land to the}} sees of Winchester and Canterbury {{in return for the}} promise of support for Æthelwulf's claim to the throne. The {{archbishop}} of Canterbury, Ceolnoth, also accepted Ecgberht and Æthelwulf as the lords and protectors of the monasteries under Ceolnoth's control. These agreements, along with a later charter in which Æthelwulf confirmed church privileges, suggest that the church had recognised that Wessex was a new political power that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with.</b> Churchmen consecrated the king at coronation ceremonies, and helped to write the wills which specified the king's heir; their support had real value in establishing West Saxon control and a smooth succession for Ecgberht's line. Both the record of the Council of Kingston, and another charter of that year, include the identical phrasing: that a condition of the grant is that [...] "we ourselves and our heirs shall always hereafter have firm and unshakable friendships from Archbishop Ceolnoth and his congregation at Christ Church." ...|$|E

But it is unnecessary {{to put the}} whole German nation to the sword. It is more humane to sterilize them. [...] The army groups, as organized units, would be the easiest and quickest to deal with. ... The population of Germany, excluding conquered and annexed territories, is about 70,000,000, almost equally divided between male and female. To achieve the purpose of German extinction {{it would be necessary}} to only sterilize some 48,000,000 -- a figure which excludes, because of their limited power to procreate, males over 60 years of age, and females over 45. ... Taking 20,000 surgeons as an arbitrary number and on the assumption that each will perform a minimum of 25 operations daily, it would take no more than one month, at the maximum, to complete their sterilization. ... The balance of the male civilian population of Germany could be treated within three months. Inasmuch as sterilization of women needs somewhat more time, it may be computed that the entire female population of Germany could be sterilized within a period of three years or less. Complete sterilization of both sexes, and not only one, is to be considered necessary in view of the present German doctrine that so much as one drop of true German blood constitutes a German. Of course, after complete sterilization, there will cease to be a birth rate in Germany. At the normal death rate of 2 per cent per annum, German life will diminish at the rate of 1,500,000 yearly. Accordingly in the span of two generations that which cost millions of lives and centuries of useless effort, namely, the elimination of Germanism and its carriers, will have been an accomplished fact. By virtue of its loss of self-perpetuation German Will will have atrophied and German power reduced to negligible importance." ...|$|E

50|$|Rust is {{very hard}} to treat. Fungicides such as Mancozeb or Triforine may help but may never {{eradicate}} the disease. Some organic preventative solutions are available and sulphur powder is known to stop germination. High standards of hygiene and good soil drainage and careful watering may minimise problems. Any appearance of rust <b>must</b> <b>be</b> immediately <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by removing and burning all affected leaves.

50|$|Confusion can {{be viewed}} as an {{opposite}} to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding. Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art. Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore <b>must</b> often <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> by those in arts education.|$|R
2500|$|The third step in his {{argument}} is, that the practices just described {{necessarily lead to}} the [...] "masking" [...] of behaviors and personalities, and to a transformation of personality and consciousness.

2500|$|This abuse {{proved to}} be a {{catalyst}} for anti-arena faculty in the school. Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce [...] "incomplete" [...] schedules which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> after the scheduling period).|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem of}} leaks is further aggravated {{by the fact}} that many of them involve {{corrosive}} salt water. This is caused by the proximity of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean, causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel.

Salt water and salt spray are well-known issues that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>dealt</b> <b>with</b> in any marine environment. It has been reported that [...] "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" [...] in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing [...] "hot spots" [...] where water leakage is especially serious.

2500|$|Over {{the past}} few years, [...] "gender mainstreaming" [...] has become a {{preferred}} approach for achieving greater health parity between men and women.
