40|$|Abstract: Neo-Darwinian {{theory of}} {{evolution}} is based mainly on the behaviour of <b>Mendelian</b> <b>populations</b> which by definition should be large and panmictic. In such populations independent assortment of genes into gametes is observed and purifying selection is responsible for elimination the defective genes and keeping them at the low level in the genetic pool. Natural populations do not correspond to the <b>Mendelian</b> <b>populations.</b> Effective populations are much smaller, inbreeding higher, and orga-nization of large number of genes into chromosomes connected with relatively low recombination rate invalidates the law of independent gene assortment. Under such conditions, {{a large number of}} genes is inherited as clusters and evolves as genetic units. Computer simulations have shown that mutations inside clusters are not elim-inated independently by purifying selection but, instead, the whole clusters tend to complement each other. It means that whenever one haplotype carries one of two pos-sible alleles, the other haplotype at that locus carries the other allele; thus inherited recessive deleterious diseases do not affect the health of the phenotype even if their fraction in the genome is high. This complementation seems to be a winning strategy in small or spatially distributed populations. We discuss possible consequences of this complementarity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This note {{concerns}} a one locus, two allele, random mating diploid population, subject to frequency-dependent viability selection. It is already known that {{in such a}} population, any evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS), if only accessible by the genotype-to-phenotype mapping, is the phenotypic image of a stable genetic equilibrium (Eshel, I. 1982.

40|$|It is shown, through {{theory and}} {{computer}} simulations of outbreeding <b>Mendelian</b> <b>populations,</b> {{that there may}} be conditions under which a balance is struck between two factors. The first is the advantage of random assortment, which will, when multilocus selection is for intermediate equilibrium values, lead to higher average heterozygosity than when linkage is introduced. There is some indication that random assortment is also advantageous when selection is toward a uniform distribution of equilibrium values. The second factor is the advantage of linkage between loci having positive epistatic interactions. When multilocus selection is for a bimodal distribution of equilibrium values, an early advantage of random assortment is replaced by a later disadvantage. Linkage disequilibrium, which in finite populations is increased only by random or selective sampling, may hinder the movement of alleles to their selective equilibria, thus leading to the advantage of random assortment. —Some consequences of this approach to the structure of natural populations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The chapter {{explains}} why evolutionary genetics – a mathematical body of theory developed since the 1910 s – eventually {{got to deal}} with culture: the frequency dynamics of genes like “the lactase gene” in populations cannot be correctly modeled without including social transmission. While the body of theory requires specific justifications, for example meticulous legitimations of describing culture in terms of traits, the body of theory is an immensely valuable scientific instrument, not only for its modeling power but also for the amount of work that has been necessary to build, maintain, and expand it. A brief history of evolutionary genetics is told to demonstrate such patrimony, and to emphasize the importance and accumulation of statistical knowledge therein. The probabilistic nature of genotypes, phenogenotypes and population phenomena is also touched upon. Although evolutionary genetics is actually composed by distinct and partially independent traditions, the most important mathematical object of evolutionary genetics is the Mendelian space, and evolutionary genetics is mostly the daring study of trajectories of alleles in a population that explores that space. The ‘body’ is scientific wealth that can be invested in studying every situation that happens to turn out suitable to be modeled as a <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population,</b> or as a modified <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population,</b> or as a population of continuously varying individuals with an underlying Mendelian basis. Mathematical tinkering and justification are two halves of the mutual adjustment between the body of theory and the new domain of culture.

40|$|Abstract — Based on {{the notions}} of <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population</b> and {{biological}} species, the commonly proposed pathways of speciation are discussed {{with respect to the}} roles played by reproductive isolation as well as pre- and postzygotic incompatibility. It is emphasized that evolutionarily meaningful analyses of speciation processes require consideration of the conditions for establishment of the various mechanisms of isolation and incompatibility, which, in turn, necessitates specification of appropriate modes of inheritance of these mech-anisms. Properties desirable for genetic models of speciation are derived and compared with existing models. A general result on the joint evolution of underdominance in fitness and positive assortative mating is used to evaluate the significance of hybrid disadvantage and prezygotic incompatibility in speciation. The conclusions from this evaluation are compared with observations published in an analytical review of studies on incompatibil-ities among Drosophila species and with the results of a genetic analysis in two lacewing species presented as evidence for sympatric speciation...|$|E
40|$|In the now broad field ofhuman dental genetics, {{variations}} {{in the number of}} permanent teeth have attracted repeated attention. Indeed, of articles dealing with population frequencies, pedigree analysis, or estimates of hereditability, the greatest number have been concerned with missing or supernumerary teeth. '- 4 It is not difficult to understand why such tooth number polymorphisms have preempted genetic attention. Missing teeth or supernumerary teeth command notice, for they are evident even to the unaided eye of the morphologically unsophisticated observer. Furthermore, if the propositus is a child or young adult, other siblings are generally available for study, and so (often) are the parents. Missing teeth, moreover, can be surveyed in archeological populations and in museum collections quite as readily as in living individuals. Thus the dental literature truly overflows with two-generation pedigrees of missing incisors, with estimates of the incidence of agenesis in various demographic and <b>Mendelian</b> <b>populations</b> and with reports of missing or supernumerary teeth in clinic patients, dental students, skeletal collections, and isolated remains.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the genetic constitution of extranuclear or non-Mendelian genes, several formulas for {{the variance of}} linkage disequilibrium (nonrandom association of linked genes) were derived under the neutral mutation hypothesis. Two kinds of the variances are mainly considered. One is the variance for the entire population {{and the other is}} the variance within a single germ cell. At equilibrium, both variances differ from that of a <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population</b> with the same parameters. In particular, when the cytoplasmic contribution from a male gamete β is small, as is found in most organisms, the effect of recombination between extranuclear genes is weak because of low within-cell heterogeneity. Then, the total variance for the entire population is large. Other important quantitites determining the variances are the number of extranuclear genomes per cell, n, and the number of cell divisions in a germ cell line per generation, λ. Unless β = 0, even a small contribution from a male gamete becomes significant depending on n and λ...|$|E

40|$|We report {{evidence}} for random drift of mitochondrial allele frequencies in zygote clones of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Monofactorial and bifactorial crosses were done, using strains resistant or sensitive to erythromycin (alleles ER, ES), oligomycin (OR, OS), or diuron (DR, DS). The frequencies of resistant and sensitive cells (and thus {{the frequencies of}} the resistant and sensitive alleles) were determined for each {{of a number of}} clones of diploid cells arising from individual zygotes. Allele frequencies were extremely variable among these zygote clones; some clones were "uniparental," with mitochondrial alleles from only one parent present. These observations suggest random drift of the allele frequencies in the population of mitochondrial genes within an individual zygote and its diploid progeny. Drift would cease when all the cells in a clone become homoplasmic, due to segregation of the mitochondrial genomes during vegetative cell divisions. To test this, we delayed cell division (and hence segregation) for varying times by starving zygotes in order to give drift more time to operate. As predicted, delaying cell division resulted in an increase in the variance of allele frequencies among the zygote clones and an increase in the proportion of uniparental zygote clones. The changes in form of the allele frequency distributions resembled those seen during random drift in finite <b>Mendelian</b> <b>populations.</b> In bifactorial crosses, genotypes as well as individual alleles were fixed or lost in some zygote clones. However, the mean recombination frequency for a large number of clones did not increase when cell division was delayed.

However, facultative parthenogenesis occurs in some Squamata, such as Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) and Burmese python (Python bivittatus). Here, we report facultative parthenogenesis in the green anaconda (Eunectes murinus). We found two fully developed female neonates and 17 undeveloped eggs in the oviduct of a female anaconda isolated from other individuals for eight years and two months at Ueno Zoo, Japan. To clarify the zygosity of the neonates, we analyzed 18 microsatellite markers of which 16 were informative. We observed only maternal alleles and no paternal alleles for all 16 markers. To examine {{the possibility of the}} long-term sperm storage, we estimated allele frequencies in a putative parental stock by genotyping five unrelated founders. If all founders, including the mother, are originated from a single <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population,</b> then the probability that the neonates were produced by sexual reproduction with an unrelated male via long-term sperm storage was infinitesimally small (2. 31 E- 32 per clutch). We also examined samples from two additional offspring that the mother delivered eight years before her death. We consistently observed paternal alleles in these elder offspring, indicating that the mother had switched from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction during the eight years of isolation.

40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} can ground {{communication and}} reciprocal enrichment among {{fields of knowledge}} whose domains are very different. We propose a new mathematical model applicable in biology, specified into ecology and evolutionary biology, and in cultural transmission studies, considered as a branch of economics. Main inspiration for the model are some biological concepts we call “eco-phenotypic” such as development, plasticity, reaction norm, phenotypic heritability, epigenetics, and niche construction. “Physiology” is a core concept we introduce and translate differently in the biological and cultural domains. The model is ecological in that it aims at describing and studying organisms and populations that perform living, intended as a thermodynamic, matter-energy process concerning resources gathering, usage, and depletion in a spatiotemporal context with given characteristics, {{as well as with}} multiplication and space occupation. The model also supports evolution, intended as a dynamics including cumulative change in the features of unique organisms that are connected into breeding populations. The model is then applicable to the economics of cultural transmission in which individuals form their attitudes and patterns of behavior under a complex system of influences derived from their “cultural parents”, other members of the society, and the environment. On the side of biology, an innovative goal is to integrate in a single model all the eco-phenotypic concepts as well as both evolution and ecology. On the side of cultural transmission, eco-phenotypic modeling seems more appropriate in capturing some aspects of cultural systems which are modeled away in the earlier framework based on <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population</b> genetics...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{addresses}} a systematic approach to stochastic models in population genetics; in particular, the Wright-Fisher models affected {{only by the}} random genetic drift. I used various mathematical methods such as Probability, PDE, and Geometry to answer an important question: Ḧow do genetic change factors (random genetic drift, selection, mutation, migration, random environment, etc.) affect the behavior of gene frequencies or genotype frequencies in generations?”. In a Hardy-Weinberg model, the <b>Mendelian</b> <b>population</b> model {{of a very large}} number of individuals without genetic change factors, the answer is simple by the Hardy-Weinberg principle: gene frequencies remain unchanged from generation to generation, and genotype frequencies from the second generation onward remain also unchanged from generation to generation. With directional genetic change factors (selection, mutation, migration), we will have a deterministic dynamics of gene frequencies, which has been studied rather in detail. With non-directional genetic change factors (random genetic drift, random environment), we will have a stochastic dynamics of gene frequencies, which has been studied with much more interests. A combination of these factors has also been considered. We consider a monoecious diploid population of fixed size N with n + 1 possible alleles at a given locus A, and assume that the evolution of population was only affected by the random genetic drift. The question is that what the behavior of the distribution of relative frequencies of alleles in time and its stochastic quantities are. When N is large enough, we can approximate this discrete Markov chain to a continuous Markov with the same characteristics. In 1931, Kolmogorov first introduced a nice relation between a continuous Markov process and diffusion equations. These equations called the (backward/forward) Kolmogorov equations which have been first applied in population genetics in 1945 by Wright. Note that these equations are singular parabolic equations (diffusion coefficients vanish on boundary). To solve them, we use generalized hypergeometric functions. To know more about what will happen after the first exit time, or more general, the behavior of whole process, in joint work with J. Hofrichter, we define the global solution by moment conditions; calculate the component solutions by boundary flux method and combinatorics method. One interesting property is that some statistical quantities of interest are solutions of a singular elliptic second order linear equation with discontinuous (or incomplete) boundary values. A lot of papers, textbooks have used this property to find those quantities. However, the uniqueness of these problems has not been proved. Littler, in his PhD thesis in 1975, took up the uniqueness problem but his proof, in my view, is not rigorous. In joint work with J. Hofrichter, we showed two different ways to prove the uniqueness rigorously. The first way is the approximation method. The second way is the blow-up method which is conducted by J. Hofrichter. By applying the Information Geometry, which was first introduced by Amari in 1985, we see that the local state space is an Einstein space, and also a dually flat manifold with the Fisher metric; the differential operator of the Kolmogorov equation is the affine Laplacian which can be represented in various coordinates and on various spaces.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the molecular pathogenesis of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia in this family. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used exome sequencing to assess all protein-coding regions of the genome in 3 family members and identified a homozygous exon 8 splice junction mutation (c. 894 G>A, also known as E 8 SJM) in LIPA that segregated with the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Because homozygosity for mutations in LIPA is known to cause cholesterol ester storage disease, we performed directed follow-up phenotyping by noninvasively measuring hepatic cholesterol content. We observed abnormal hepatic accumulation of cholesterol in the homozygote individuals, supporting the diagnosis of cholesterol ester storage disease. Given previous suggestions of cardiovascular disease risk in heterozygous LIPA mutation carriers, we genotyped E 8 SJM in > 27 000 individuals and found no association with plasma lipid levels or risk of myocardial infarction, confirming a true recessive mode of inheritance.

40|$|One of the {{limitations}} for aquaculture development in developing countries is the limited availability of trained personnel {{in the areas of}} genetics and statistics. Technical staff involved in aquaculture often have little or no training in quantitative genetics and applied statistics to conduct well designed breeding programs for aquatic animal species. As a result there have been very few genetically improved strains of fish or crustaceans developed and used for aquaculture. In response to the prevailing situation the WorldFish Center has placed a strong emphasis on the enhancement of research capacity and training of national scientists in the area of fish breeding and genetics. Annually we run at least one course in quantitative genetics and its application to genetic resource management. Almost all participants come from National Aquaculture Research Institutions in different countries. Overall, the main aim of our courses is providing students with basic principles in quantitative genetics applied to performance improvement for aquatic animal species. Advanced courses are sometimes organised upon request from partner countries or due to a need for the implementation of projects activities. Areas of genetics covered in our courses include basic <b>Mendelian</b> and <b>population</b> genetics, quantitative genetics, and application of molecular information and reproductive technologies to practical breeding programs. In particular, we focus on aspects of quantitative genetics applied to fish improvement. Topics normally covered in-depth include strain collection and evaluation, establishment of the foundation population, design and implementation of the selection program, effective population size and control of inbreeding, selection index, genetic evaluation systems, estimation of genetic parameters, breeding structure, strategies for the effective dissemination of the improved strain, and use of DNA information in selective breeding programs. Currently, we are broadening the scope of our training program by including other topics such as genetic conservation, risk assessment in relation to the use of improved strains, and resource management and biodiversity. The application of genomic selection will be also included in due course...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} serum complement factor H (CFH) levels in patients of age related macular degeneration (AMD) and examine its association with CFH Y 402 H polymorphism. 115 AMD patients and 61 normal controls were recruited in this study. The single nucleotide polymorphism was assayed by real time PCR and serum CFH levels were measured by ELISA and standardized to total serum protein. Chi-square test was applied to polymorphism analysis while Mann Whitney U-statistic for CFH-levels. Mendelian randomization approach was used for determining causal relationship. The genotype frequency differed between the AMD patients (TT- 18. 3 %, TC- 41. 3 % and CC- 40. 4 %) and controls (TT- 76. 3 %, TC- 13. 6 %, and CC- 10. 1 %) (p = 0001). The frequency of alleles was also significantly different when AMD (T- 39 % and C- 61 %) was compared to controls (T- 83 % and C- 17 %) (p = 0. 0001). Level of serum CFH was significantly lower in AMD patients as compared to normal controls (p = 0. 001). Our data showed that the CFH Y 402 H polymorphism is a risk factor for AMD in the North Indian <b>population.</b> <b>Mendelian</b> randomization approach revealed that CFH Y 402 H polymorphism affects AMD risk through the modification of CFH serum levels...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to develop {{techniques}} to provide the information needed to determine if Lower Columbia River coho salmon represent a 'species' under the Endangered Species Act. Our report features two new nuclear DNA approaches to the improved detection of genetic variation: (1) Studies of DNA-level genetic variation for two nuclear growth hormone genes; (2) Use of arbitrary DNA primers (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, or 'RAPD' primers) to detect variation at large numbers of nuclear genes. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify variable sections (introns) of two growth hormone genes (GH-I and G/f-Z) in several salmonid species. Coho salmon had three DNA length variants for G/-I intron C. Restriction analysis and sequencing provided valuable information about the mode of evolution of these DNA sequences. We tested segregation of the variants in captive broods of coho salmon, and demonstrated that they are alleles at a single <b>Mendelian</b> locus. <b>Population</b> studies using the GH- 1 alleles showed highly significant frequency differences between Lower Columbia River and Oregon Coast coho salmon, and marginal differences among stocks within these regions. These new markers are adequately defined and tested to use in coho salmon population studies of any size. The nature of the variation at GH- 1 (Variable Number Tandem Repeats, or 'VNTRs') suggests that more genetic variants will be found in coho salmon from other areas. GH- 2 intron C also showed length variation in coho salmon, and this variation {{was found to be}} sex-linked. Because PCR methods require minute amounts of tissue, this discovery provides a technique to determine the gender of immature coho salmon without killing them. Chinook salmon had restriction patterns and sequence divergences similar to coho salmon. Thus, we expect that sex linkage of GH- 2 alleles predates the evolutionary divergence of Pacific salmon species, and that gender testing with this system will work on the entire group. Rainbow trout do not show this sex-linked variation. Genetic markers detected by DNA amplification using arbitrary 10 -basepair primers (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA, or 'RAPD' markers), are the newest and most promising method of assessing variation at large numbers of genetic loci. We have demonstrated the inheritance of these markers in rainbow trout, and we have found multiple variable genetic markers in coho salmon. Feasibility studies on the use of RAPDs on large salmon collections are described...|$|R
