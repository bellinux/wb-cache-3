25|$|Mutations in {{the genes}} {{encoding}} for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) occur in 10-20% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and confer a worsened prognosis in low-risk MDS. Because the incidence of IDH1/2 mutations increases as the disease malignancy increases, these findings together suggest that IDH1/2 mutations are important drivers of progression of MDS to a more <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> state.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Malnutrition is {{frequently}} observed in inpatients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> and {{may contribute to}} longer hospital stays. OBJECTIVE: To compare the nutritional status, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin values and length of hospital stay of patients with and without <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: This comparative study assessed indicators of nutritional status, namely body mass index, recent weight loss, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin and length of hospital stay, of 928 surgical patients with and without <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> (50. 2 % females and 49. 8 % males). The chi-square {{test was used to}} compare proportions and the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous measurements between two groups. The significance level was set at 5 %. RESULTS: Patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> had longer hospital stays (P< 0. 0001), furthermore, a higher percentage of patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> had body mass index < 18. 5 (P< 0. 0001) and experienced recent weight changes (P< 0. 0002). Lymphocyte count also differed statistically between the groups (P = 0. 0131), which lower levels were identified among patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases.</b> CONCLUSION: The lymphocyte count, hemoglobin values and weight loss are important findings of nutritional depletion in patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

25|$|Thymidine kinases {{have a key}} {{function}} in the synthesis of DNA and therefore in cell division, as {{they are part of}} the unique reaction chain to introduce thymidine into the DNA. Thymidine is present in the body fluids as a result of degradation of DNA from food and from dead cells. Thymidine kinase is required for the action of many antiviral drugs. It is used to select hybridoma cell lines in production of monoclonal antibodies. In clinical chemistry it is used as a proliferation marker in the diagnosis, control of treatment and follow-up of <b>malignant</b> <b>disease,</b> mainly of hematological malignancies.|$|E
25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and <b>malignant</b> <b>disease.</b> The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E
500|$|Just before {{winning the}} Nobel prize {{and while they}} were on a {{mountain}} climbing trip, the Coris learned that Gerty Cori was ill with myelosclerosis, a fatal disease of the bone marrow. During her years at the Institute for the Study of <b>Malignant</b> <b>Disease,</b> Gerty had studied the effects of X-rays on the human body, which was thought to contribute to her illness. She struggled for ten years with the illness while continuing her scientific work; only [...] in the final months did she let up. In 1957, she died in her home. Gerty was cremated and her ashes scattered. Later, her son erected a cenotaph for Gerty and Carl Cori in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.|$|E

60|$|Now that grievous hurt which Sir Tristram had {{received}} {{at the hands}} of Sir Marhaus did not heal, but instead grew even more rankled and sore, so that there were many who thought that there had been treachery practised and that the spearhead had been poisoned to cause such a <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> as that with which the wounded man suffered.

6000|$|Is {{there any}} radicle of such {{legislation}} in our parliamentary system? Well, {{there are two}} measures just sprouting in the political soil, which may conceivably grow to something valuable. One is the institution of a Legal Minimum Wage. The other, Old Age Pensions. But {{there is a better}} plan than either of these. Some time ago I mentioned the subject of Universal Old Age Pensions to my fellow Socialist Mr Cobden-Sanderson, famous as an artist-craftsman in bookbinding and printing. [...] "Why not Universal Pensions for Life?" [...] said Cobden-Sanderson. In saying this, he solved the industrial problem at a stroke. At present we say callously to each citizen: [...] "If you want money, earn it," [...] as if his having or not having it were a matter that concerned himself alone. We do not even secure for him the opportunity of earning it: on the contrary, we allow our industry to be organized in open dependence on the maintenance of [...] "a reserve army of unemployed" [...] for the sake of [...] "elasticity." [...] The sensible course would be Cobden-Sanderson's: that is, to give every man enough to live well on, so as to guarantee the community against the possibility of a case of the <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> of poverty, and then (necessarily) to see that he earned it.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} frenzy of microbe killing, {{surgical}} instruments were dipped in carbolic oil, {{which was a}} great improvement on not dipping them in anything at all and simply using them dirty; but as microbes are so fond of carbolic oil that they swarm in it, {{it was not a}} success from the anti-microbe point of view. Formalin was squirted into the circulation of consumptives until it was discovered that formalin nourishes the tubercle bacillus handsomely and kills men. The popular theory of disease is the common medical theory: namely, that every disease had its microbe duly created in the garden of Eden, and has been steadily propagating itself and producing widening circles of <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> ever since. It was plain from the first that if this had been even approximately true, the whole human race would have been wiped out by the plague long ago, and that every epidemic, instead of fading out as mysteriously as it rushed in, would spread over the whole world. It was also evident that the characteristic microbe of a disease might be a symptom instead of a cause. An unpunctual man is always in a hurry; but it does not follow that hurry is the cause of unpunctuality: on the contrary, what is the matter with the patient is sloth. When Florence Nightingale said bluntly that if you overcrowded your soldiers in dirty quarters there would be an outbreak of smallpox among them, she was snubbed as an ignorant female who did not know that smallpox can be produced only by the importation of its specific microbe.|$|E
