It is endemic to South America and is found in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. U. laxa grows as a terrestrial plant in wet grasslands and at the <b>margins</b> of <b>pools,</b> usually at altitudes from near sea level to 1100 m.

50|$|Stowe Pool {{has limited}} {{marginal}} vegetation, but its water plants include Polygonum amphibium and spiked water-milfoil. The shallow <b>margins</b> of the <b>pool</b> {{are dominated by}} extensive low-growing blankets of the water plant Chara aspera var. curta a nationally scarce stonewort.|$|R
50|$|This species prefers <b>margins,</b> <b>pools,</b> and backwaters of {{creeks and}} small rivers, with {{moderate}} to high gradients, a permanent flow of clear water, {{and the bottom}} usually consisting of sand, gravel, rock, and occasionally an admixture of silt. F. stellifer is most commonly found in shallow, sandy backwaters near clear creeks with gravel bottoms. Males establish and defend small territories in shallow, quiet-water spawning areas. Spawning occurs between late April and early June. This species does not migrate or prepare a nest. Sexual maturity is reached in the second full spawning season for both sexes, with females having a maximum ovum diameter of 2.75 mm. The average size of this species is 8.01 cm. Maximum age appears to be just over two years for both sexes, as the oldest specimens collected were estimated at 28 months of age. Although this species is not migratory, its distribution {{is affected by the}} alterations of road crossings mentioned by a study done in north Georgia on the Etowah Basin streams. These alterations affect the structure of these aquatic ecosystems, changing how these species travel, eat, and spawn.|$|R
50|$|The great raft spider, as {{with most}} other Dolomedes species, is a {{semi-aquatic}} spider. It inhabits lowland fen and grazing marsh areas and {{is dependent on the}} presence of standing or slow moving neutral to alkaline water. Within these areas it {{can be found on the}} <b>margins</b> of <b>pools</b> or ditches. Emergent vegetation is highly important for use as perches for hunting and basking and to support nursery webs. As a warmth loving species they avoid areas where water surfaces are shaded.|$|R

50|$|Not much {{is known}} about the ecology of Etheostoma akatulo. All darters, as their name implies, dart about on the bottoms of streams and eat small {{crustaceans}} and insects. Etheostoma akatulo occurs in slow to moderate current over sand and fine gravel at depths of 10-50 cm, typically just downstream of riffles, in runs, or along <b>margins</b> of <b>pools.</b> During spawning Etheostoma akatulo males and females have been seen occupying different microhabitats. Substrate dominated by gravel were occupied by lone males and spawning pairs, whereas most lone females were found over a sand-dominant substrate. After the spawning period, Bluemask Darters move to sandy substrates in low-velocity areas of intermediate depth.|$|R

There was no evidence from the biological remains for human activity other than that associated with the initial construction of the feature. The range of plants and invertebrates reflected peatland <b>margins,</b> with <b>pools</b> (perhaps small) and at least some trees.

40|$|Background: Using public {{swimming}} pools during different seasons and poor health behavior could be responsible in transmission of fungal disease through pool water and its environment. Therefore, {{this research was}} conducted to investi-gate fungal agents of indoor public {{swimming pools}} of Ahwaz, capital city of Khouzestan Province, south-west of Iran. Methods: Ten indoor swimming pools of Ahwaz were investigated during two seasons for 6 months. Water specimens were collected by pump and environment samples including shower-bath area, <b>margin</b> of <b>pool</b> walls, dressing rooms, and slip-pers, by sterile carpet pieces. All specimens were cultured in SC and SCC culture media and fungal agents identification were based on macroscopic, microscopic characteristic and complement tests when it was necessary.

5000|$|The male is {{considered}} to be highly aggressive and will defend a given territory from incursions from other males of the species. The male is known to form preferences for prominent perches and will often return to the same perches around the <b>margins</b> of <b>pools</b> and ponds whilst it patrols for intruders. Males have a favourable view of the sky during perching. They look toward a section of the sky away from the sun, with less radiation but a higher UV and blue-violet saturation. Thus, the fovea of the eyes, which is sensitive to blue and UV radiation, is optimally suited to the detection of flying insects against the blue sky. [...] Both sexes are prolific fliers and mating takes place in the air, rather than on perches or amongst the vegetation. The female lays her eggs on floating vegetation. They tend to be easier to approach than Broad-bodied Chasers.|$|R

The nationally scarce species brown beak-sedge Rhynchospora fusca and marsh clubmoss Lycopodiella inundata also occur in this habitat.|$|R

50|$|Occurrence of {{foraging}} {{individuals in}} forest and field matrix relative to that at pools {{has been found}} to increase significantly following rainfall during the wet season, probably due to decreased prey availability at <b>pool</b> <b>margins</b> as amphibian prey taking refuge from desiccation in the mud move into the water, thereby evading foraging ibises. Additionally, swamp eels and crabs which are primarily aquatic and occur in saturated substrate have not been identified in white shouldered-ibis diet because these potential prey could easily evade predation by burrowing or swimming away (Wright et al. 2013b).|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Several {{types of}} instream {{structures}} were evaluated for their potential to provide rearing habitat {{and to increase}} reach carrying capacity for steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri). Evaluation was conducted in each season {{over the course of}} 1 year. Blast pools created in bedrock glides increased the carrying capacity of stream reaches during late summer. Three types of boulder and log structures in gravel-cobble glides did not significantly increase the late summer standing crop of juvenile steelhead. During summer, juvenile steelhead selected the habitat provided by the four types of structures over the untreated glide habitats. The instream structures were used by steelhead for feeding stations, resting areas, and hiding cover. Structures located near the thalweg held substantially more summering steelhead than structures in off-thalweg positions, regardless of structure design. In winter, seven structure designs were evaluated. The structures that were placed in zones of slow water (deep <b>pools,</b> <b>margin</b> backwater <b>pools,</b> and dam pools) provided the most effective winter habitat for juvenile steelhead. The structures with the largest concentrations of boulders and rubble generally held the highest winter densities. During the spring and fall months, habitat utilization was less predictable. Spring and fall were times of transition in which the utilization of habitat structures was probably influenced by changing water temperatures and hydraulic conditions. Prior to initiating habitat modification programs, habitat managers should conduct an on-site examination of the rearing strategy and seasonal habitat needs of the target species. A pre-work evaluation should be designed to gain an understanding of the most likely environmental factors that limit production. Without such preliminary information, and without a follow-up evaluation, managers cannot recognize their mistakes, innovate appropriate new techniques or determine if funds have been wisely spent...|$|R
