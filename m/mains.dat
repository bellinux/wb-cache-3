5|$|Modern Leslie {{speakers}} have an 11-pin interface that {{is safer}} to service, as the <b>mains</b> power is carried separately using a standard IEC <b>mains</b> connector. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in and line out jacks, so a combo preamp {{is no longer}} required. Its settings can also be controlled via MIDI.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 season {{started with}} a 29–16 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. They then {{defeated}} the Stormers and Bulls before losing to the Cats in Johannesburg. Their second loss occurred when the Crusaders defeated them 17–16 at Carisbrook. The Highlanders had gone three seasons, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and 16games unbeaten at Carisbrook before that loss. The Highlanders then defeated the Blues 22–11 to retain the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy. In April that year it was revealed a rift had developed between coach Laurie <b>Mains</b> {{and some of the}} senior players in the squad. Anton Oliver was branded the ringleader by <b>Mains,</b> and after their final game of the season <b>Mains</b> resigned and was replaced by his assistant Greg Cooper.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mains</b> {{described}} {{a number of}} varieties of S.flavida based largely on differences in the shapes and sizes of their spores. All varieties were described from collections made in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January 1908, a fire {{broke out}} in Little Mill, caused by some machinery. The fire lasted for about 12 hours and caused an {{estimated}} £20,000 damage and resulted in 200 employees at the mill losing their jobs. Whilst fighting the fire a fireman was killed when a fire-tender blew over in high winds. The building {{was replaced by a}} new building, New Little Mill, five storeys high, four shorter than its predecessor but occupying a larger area of ground. The new mill had concrete floors and was designed to use <b>mains</b> electricity. The building is the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use <b>mains</b> electricity.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair Scientific Programmable was {{introduced}} in 1975, with the same case as the Sinclair Oxford. It was larger than the Scientific, at , and used a larger PP3 battery, but could also be powered by <b>mains</b> electricity.|$|E
5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local <b>mains</b> water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of <b>mains</b> water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|Albany {{is one of}} {{the first}} cities in the world to have {{installed}} public water <b>mains,</b> sewer lines, natural gas lines and electricity, infrastructure and utilities that attracted and supported substantial new industry to the city and surrounding area during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|All {{houses were}} built with marble-mantelpieced {{fireplaces}} and flues. All houses were supplied with running water supplied from the New River, which flowed through nearby Wood Green. However, not all houses were supplied with gas or <b>mains</b> electricity from the outset, the remainder being lit by candles or oil or paraffin lamps.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, gun {{batteries}} {{were built}} on the island. A twin six pounder emplacement at Galtness Battery on the coast at Salt Ness protected the Wide Firth from German torpedo boats. A Castle Battery was operational from 1941–43, as was an anti-aircraft battery. <b>Mains</b> electricity arrived on Shapinsay in the 1970s, when an underwater cable was laid from Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, <b>mains</b> {{water was}} {{installed}} in the town, and the Isle of Sheppey's first railway station opened at the dockyard. Towards {{the end of the}} 19th century, Sheerness achieved official town status and formed its own civil parish, separate from Minster-in-Sheppey. The 1901 Census recorded the Sheerness parish as having 18,179 residents and 2,999 houses.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season the Highlanders were coached by Gordon Hunter before {{he joined the}} All Blacks {{selection}} panel. Glen Ross took over in 1997, and was not reappointed for the 1998 season. Tony Gilbert was appointed for the 1998 season, and again coached the team in 1999 before being appointed co-coach for the All Blacks. Peter Sloane was appointed Gilbert's successor for the 2000 season, and also coached them in 2001 before moving to coach the Blues. Laurie <b>Mains</b> returned to New Zealand from South Africa to replace Sloane for the 2002 season. <b>Mains</b> resigned following the 2003 season after a rift between him and senior players. Greg Cooper replaced <b>Mains</b> and coached the team from 2003 until 2007, {{when he left the}} franchise to take up the assistant coaches position with the Blues. Glenn Moore coached the club from 2008 through until 2010, when he was relieved of his duties after the club posted only 10 wins against 29 losses in his three years in charge. His replacement was former All Black flanker Jamie Joseph, who coached between 2011 and 2016. Tony brown took over as head coach in 2017.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mains</b> {{water and}} {{sewerage}} services {{are provided by}} Thames Water Utilities Limited, a private sector water supply company, whilst water abstraction and disposal is regulated by the Environment Agency. Reading's water supply is largely derived from underground aquifers, and as a consequence the water is hard.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1961 {{the light}} was electrified, with <b>mains</b> {{electricity}} as the power source, and an intensity of 1,000,000cd. The drive was replaced with a 0.3 amp electric motor. At {{the same time the}} staff was cut from three lightkeepers to two.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 {{range of}} Naim {{equipment}} has aluminium chassis and sleeves; the fascia is die-cast zinc. Inside, circuit boards float, and the rear-mounted <b>mains</b> switch and IEC socket are decoupled to reduce microphony. Techradar {{noted that the}} XS, launched in late 2008, is the first Naim device to use a new bayonet PCB-mounting technique to float the circuitry.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary <b>mains</b> power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable. Spinet organs contained a built-in power amplifier and loudspeakers, so did not require a tone cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by {{government}} to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. <b>Mains</b> {{water and sewerage services}} are provided by Yorkshire Water.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rainfall}} is low, Sismiut has abundant natural {{supplies of}} fresh, drinkable surface water, collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq. Water is also pumped to the waterworks from another lake around 2.5 kilometers {{away in the}} mountains. The water <b>mains</b> are preinsulated and electrically heated to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E
5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, both natural and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas <b>mains,</b> electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} {{is the responsibility}} of Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire), which is wholly owned by MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company. There is no domestic gas <b>mains</b> supply. Water is supplied by Yorkshire Water from Embsay Reservoir. Yorkshire Water is responsible for wastewater disposal, and a small-scale treatment plant is located adjacent to the River Wharfe south of Hebden Beck. Refuse collection is handled by Craven District Council, and North Yorkshire County Council provides a household waste and recycling centre at Skibeden, between Bolton Abbey and Skipton.|$|E
5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with <b>mains</b> supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to <b>mains</b> water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Bush and Marshall {{teamed up}} with {{physicist}} Charles G. Smith, who had invented a device called the S-tube. This enabled radios, which had previously required {{two different types of}} batteries, to operate from <b>mains</b> power. Marshall raised $25,000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7, 1922, to market the invention, with Bush and Smith among its five directors. The venture made Bush wealthy, and the company, now known as Raytheon, ultimately became a large electronics company and defense contractor.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} a 1989 {{failure of the}} submarine cable and problems with the diesel generator, the light was converted to solar power with battery storage. The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the <b>mains</b> forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply <b>mains</b> power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Charles M. Schwab {{bought the}} Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town {{as well as the}} mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water <b>mains,</b> telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.|$|E
5|$|Laurie <b>Mains</b> {{replaced}} Wyllie in 1992, and {{was given}} the job of preparing the side for the 1995 event in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. Their status as favourites was enhanced when a young Jonah Lomu scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. They managed to take hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 15-12 to Joel Stransky's drop goal.|$|E
5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various {{attempts were made}} by the local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council were unhappy about a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A <b>mains</b> sewer system was only installed in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rugby Football Club, a rugby union club, {{is located}} at Bathgate Park to the {{southeast}} of Caversham. Southern is consistently among Dunedin's stronger club sides, and has been Otago club champion on over 20 occasions. It was formed from a merger of the Caversham and Pacific clubs in 1899. Southern's players have included over 20 All Blacks, including Stephen Bachop, Stu Forster, Jamie Joseph, Laurie <b>Mains,</b> and Gary Seear.|$|E
5|$|Two {{settlements}} {{existed on}} Stroma: Nethertown, {{in the north}} of the island, and Uppertown or Overtown, in the south. They originally belonged to the Freswick estate, which owned Nethertown, and the Mey estate, which owned Uppertown. Between the two was <b>Mains</b> of Stroma, the island's principal farm. A track runs {{the entire length of the}} island, connecting the lighthouse at the north tip with the two settlements and the harbour on the south coast.|$|E
5|$|Water {{efficiency}} is being improved {{on a global}} scale by increased demand management, improved infrastructure, improved water productivity of agriculture, minimising the water intensity (embodied water) of goods and services, addressing shortages in the non-industrialized world, concentrating food production in areas of high productivity, and planning for climate change, such as through flexible system design. A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible. At the local level, people are becoming more self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and reducing use of <b>mains</b> water.|$|E
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with <b>mains</b> electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by <b>mains</b> electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|For the US Navy, the Battle of Savo Island would {{institute}} many changes. Virtually every cruiser {{would be}} retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire <b>mains</b> {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle loop design that could be broken many times and still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief would order sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the <b>mains</b> in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1898, A Murray {{became part}} of the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited (FCSDA). The mill complex began to decline in the early 20th century as the canal basin was filled in and Little Mill burnt down. The mill was {{replaced}} with the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use <b>mains</b> electricity. The mill complex continued producing cotton until the 1950s. The mills were later leased out to other companies and in some cases allowed to fall into disrepair. Between 2000 and 2003, Urban Splash redeveloped Fireproof and Doubling Mill into offices, winning a RIBA Award. The rest of the complex underwent a £17M regeneration between 2004 and 2006 and are proposed to be used as flats and a hotel.|$|E
