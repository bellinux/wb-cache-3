5000|$|On October 2, 2007, Harry Reid {{authored}} {{a two-page}} letter to Mark Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications (the radio company which broadcasts the Rush Limbaugh show) requesting that he [...] "publicly repudiate these comments and ask <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh</b> to apologize." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Senate rebuke drew {{criticism}} from Congressional Republicans like Congressman Doug Lamborn of Colorado who {{said on the}} floor of the House of Representatives, [...] "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to denounce the liberals' fraudulent attacks on Rush Limbaugh. Anyone who reads the widely available transcript, as I have done, sees that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh</b> was appropriately referring to the pretenders who pose as medal winners, or who falsely claim to have committed atrocities in Iraq, when he used the phrase [...] "phony soldiers." [...] No, the real scandal here is that liberals in America and here in this Congress are willing to manipulate facts to smear those they disagree with. But there’s an even more insidious agenda by liberals going on, and that is to reinstitute the so-called Fairness Doctrine, which is actually a way to silence conservatives on the radio waves. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh</b> deserves mega kudos for being a forceful and effective voice on the side of common sense and for being an example of the First Amendment in action. After all, isn’t that what our country is supposed to be about?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{listeners}} {{to the show}} {{are referred to as}} [...] "Ditto-heads". Early in the show's run, listeners began to use the variations on the expression [...] "ditto" [...] to speed up the beginnings of calls, which tend to open with the listener expressing his or her gratitude to the host and an appreciation of the show. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh</b> claims the term originated with a caller who said [...] "ditto what the previous caller said".|$|E
500|$|Limbaugh's {{appearance}} in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, [...] "It is to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh's</b> credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of Family Guy, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America’s truck stop and dive bar bathrooms." [...] Foster went on to add, [...] "I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye." [...] Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers [...] "heartless jerks." [...] In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, [...] "What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template. He’s entitled to his opinion, {{worked very hard to}} reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda— that’s how it’s supposed to work. But {{at the same time he}} doesn’t completely shut us out." [...] Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest {{appearance in}} the episode [...] "genuinely funny," [...] and David Weigel of Slate commented, [...] "I'm not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline [...] is a perfect conservative narrative." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} {{primaries}} of the 2010 U.S. election season, Chafets identified Rush Limbaugh as [...] "the brains {{and the spirit}} behind" [...] the Republican Party's [...] "resurgence" [...] {{in the wake of}} the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. Chafets reported that Sarah Palin's [...] "biggest current applause line — Republicans are not just the party of no, but the party of hell no — came courtesy of <b>Mr.</b> Limbaugh." [...] <b>Limbaugh</b> is the subject of Chafets' 2010 book Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to Limbaugh's comments, United States Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid {{sent a letter}} to Mark P. Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications. The letter of complaint requested that Mays [...] "publicly repudiate these comments and ask <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh</b> to apologize" [...] for the remarks. The Reid letter was signed by 41 Democratic senators. Limbaugh obtained the letter and sold it on eBay for $2,100,100, the record for a charitable auction on that site. He promised to donate the funds to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation with a matching donation of his own bringing the total to $4.2million.|$|E
5000|$|On October 2, 2007, Mark Mays sent a {{reply to}} Senator Reid stating, [...] "I have {{carefully}} read the transcript from the episode in question. I {{hope you will}} appreciate that I can not speak with authority to whom exactly Mr. Limbaugh's comments were directed or what was his intent. Only <b>Mr.</b> <b>Limbaugh</b> can speak to those issues, which he has done." [...] Mays goes on {{to explain to the}} Senate Majority leader that, [...] "The first Amendment gives every American the right to voice his or her opinion, no matter how unpopular. That right is one I am sure you agree must be cherished and protected." [...] Mays then turned the Reid letter over to Rush Limbaugh.|$|E
