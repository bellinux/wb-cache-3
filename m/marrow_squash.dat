5000|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the first}} mention of {{vegetable}} marrows dates to 1822, zucchini to 1929, and courgettes to 1931. Before {{the introduction of}} Cucurbita species from the New World, marrow signified the immature, edible fruits of Lagenaria, a cucurbit gourd of African origin widely grown since Antiquity for eating when immature and for drying as watertight receptacles when grown to maturity.Marrows are commonly cultivated in the British Isles, and the term [...] "marrow" [...] for the plant and for the fruit is still current there, especially for the striped, thicker-skinned cultivar. However, both in North America (since the 1920s) and in Britain (since the 1960s), thinner-skinned immature marrows have gained popularity due to their tender skin, firmer texture and distinct flavour. Hedrick (1928) in his book The vegetables of New York p.50, describes the [...] "English Vegetable Marrow" [...] as [...] "one of the earliest forms of <b>marrow</b> <b>squash</b> grown, but has never been exceedingly popular in this country".|$|E
50|$|The {{debate about}} the {{relationship}} of C. pepo, C. fraterna, and C. texana {{have been going on}} since at least 1857. C. pepo has more similarities to C. fraterna than it does to Cucurbita texana which is also claimed to be an ancestor of C. pepo. Their isozymes are very similar. C. fraterna shares alleles with C. pepo at all 25 studied loci, indicating C. fraterna is C. pepos nearest relative. C. pepo is most likely an early domesticated form of C. fraterna. It crosses well with both C. pepo and C. texana. C. pepo could be a compilospecies of C. fraterna and C. texana, which appear to be two species that were originally separate. Based on genetic allele analysis, there are two distinct groups within C. pepo: pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and <b>marrow</b> <b>squash</b> are in one, and ornamental gourds, crookneck squash, acorn squash, pattypan squash, and a few others are in the other. C. fraterna is genetically closer to the first group and C. texana is genetically closer to the second group.|$|E

40|$|Methods {{which have}} been used to {{determine}} megakaryocyte ploidy in animals and humans are reviewed. Although the number of megakaryocyte nuclear units counted in bone <b>marrow</b> <b>squashes</b> is roughly proportional to ploidy, accurate determinations of DNA content require the use of microphotometry or flow cytometry. New techniques should make it possible to distinguish polyploidizing megakaryoblasts from promegakaryocytes and mature megakaryocytes which have arrested polyploidization. Only the latter should be included in histograms of the number of endoduplications, since only those have expressed their full polyploidization potential. Statistical techniques are available for analysis and comparison of both raw ploidy distributions or histograms of endoduplication numbers...|$|R

50|$|Wild C. pepo {{is still}} {{found in the}} same areas as C. fraterna in Mexico. Their {{isozymes}} are very similar. C. pepo has more similarities to C. fraterna {{than it does to}} C. texana, which is also claimed to be an ancestor of C. pepo. All studied C. fraterna alleles are also found in C. pepo. Consequently, C. fraterna is the nearest relative of C. pepo. C. pepo is most likely an early domesticated form of C. fraterna. It crosses well with both C. pepo and C. texana. Unlike most wild Cucurbita species, some fruit specimens of C. fraterna have been found that were not bitter. Its usual habitat is dry upland scrub areas. C. pepo could be a compilospecies of C. fraterna and C. texana, which appear to be two species that were originally separate. Based on genetic allele analysis, two distinct groups occur within C. pepo: pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and <b>marrow</b> <b>squash</b> are in one; and ornamental gourds, crookneck, acorn, scallop, and a few others in the second one. C. fraterna is genetically closer to the first group and C. texana is genetically closer to the second group. Ornamental gourds found in Texas are called var. texana and those found outside of Texas (Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana) are called var. ozarkana. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C. pepo, Paris suggested that the original wild specimen was a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He also suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants, and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and pumpkin.|$|E

60|$|It is said that, {{a list of}} {{the summer}} {{vegetables}} which are exhibited on New York hotel tables being shown to a French artiste, he declared that to serve such a dinner properly would take till midnight. I recollect how I was once struck with our national plenteousness on returning from a Continental tour, and going directly from the ship to a New York hotel, in the bounteous season of autumn. For months I had been habituated to my neat little bits of chop or poultry garnished with the inevitable cauliflower or potato, which seemed to be the sole possibility after the reign of green peas was over. Now I sat down all at once to a carnival of vegetables,--ripe, juicy tomatoes, raw or cooked; cucumbers in brittle slices; rich, yellow sweet potatoes; broad Lima-beans, and beans of other and various names; tempting ears of Indian corn steaming in enormous piles, and great smoking tureens of the savory succotash, an Indian gift to the table for which civilization need not blush; sliced egg-plant in delicate fritters; and <b>marrow</b> <b>squashes,</b> of creamy pulp and sweetness: a rich variety, embarrassing to the appetite, and perplexing to the choice. Verily, the thought has often impressed itself on my mind that the vegetarian doctrine preached in America left a man quite as much as he had capacity to eat or enjoy, and that in the midst of such tantalizing abundance he really lost the apology which elsewhere bears him out in preying upon his less gifted and accomplished animal neighbors.|$|R

60|$|September 9th.--Mr. Thaxter rowed me this morning, in his dory, to White Island, {{on which}} is the lighthouse. There was {{scarcely}} a breath of air, and a perfectly calm sea; an intensely hot sunshine, with a little haze, so that the horizon was indistinct. Here and there sail-boats sleeping on the water, or moving almost imperceptibly over it. The lighthouse island would be difficult of access in a rough sea, the shore being so rocky. On landing, we found the keeper peeling his harvest of onions, which he had gathered prematurely, because the insects were eating them. His little patch of garden {{seemed to be a}} strange kind of soil, as like marine mud as anything; but he had a fair crop of <b>marrow</b> <b>squashes,</b> though injured, as he said, by the last storm; and there were cabbages and a few turnips. I recollect no other garden vegetables. The grass grows pretty luxuriantly, and looked very green where there was any soil; but he kept no cow, nor even a pig nor a hen. His house stands close by the garden, --a small stone building, with peaked roof, and whitewashed. The lighthouse stands on a ledge of rock, with a galley between, and there is a long covered way, triangular in shape, connecting his residence with it. We ascended into the lantern, which is eighty-seven feet high. It is a revolving light, with several great illuminators of copper silvered, and colored lamp-glasses. Looking downward, we had the island displayed as on a chart, with its little bays, its isthmus of shingly beach connecting two parts of the island, and overflowed at high tide; its sunken rocks about it, indicated by the swell, or slightly breaking surf. The keeper of the lighthouse was formerly a writing-master. He has a sneaking kind of look, and does not bear a very high character among his neighbors. Since he kept the light, he has lost two wives,--the first a young creature whom he used to leave alone upon this desolate rock, and the gloom and terror of the situation were probably the cause of her death. The second wife, experiencing the same kind of treatment, ran away from him, and returned to her friends. He pretends to be religious, but drinks. About a year ago he attempted to row out alone from Portsmouth. There was a head wind and head tide, and he would have inevitably drifted out to sea, if Mr. Thaxter had not saved him.|$|R
5000|$|A marrow is a vegetable, {{the mature}} fruit of certain Cucurbita pepo cultivars. The {{immature}} {{fruit of the}} same or similar cultivars is called courgette (in Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and New Zealand) or zucchini (in North America, Australia, Germany and Austria). Like courgettes, marrows are oblong, green <b>squash,</b> but <b>marrows</b> have a firm rind and a neutral flavour, making them useful as edible casings for mincemeat and other stuffings. They can be stored for several weeks after harvest (like pumpkins and other winter squash), to be processed for food when required. They are a popular vegetable ("overgrown when picked and insipid when cooked...") in Great Britain and areas with significant British influence, though their popularity is waning in favor of immature summer <b>squash</b> like courgette.Giant <b>marrows</b> are grown competitively in the United Kingdom where the term [...] "marrow" [...] is often restricted to the striped, thick-skinned cultivar.In a culinary context, marrows are treated as a vegetable; usually cooked and presented as a savory dish or accompaniment. Botanically, marrows are fruit, a type of botanical berry, being the swollen ovary of the marrow flower. <b>Marrows,</b> like all <b>squash,</b> have their ancestry in the Americas.|$|R
