40|$|Autonomous {{agents are}} mobile {{applications}} that are launched on data warehouses to perform specific queries or {{to search for}} patterns in data. With <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology,</b> a developer is not bound by more traditional distributed computing models, for example, two-tier client-server models, three-tier middleware-oriented models, and so on.

40|$|In recent years, {{educational}} {{information on}} the web has increased exponentially, and web-based learning environments are becoming mainstream applications on the Internet. But these environments face some common deficiencies, such as slow access, no adaptivity to individual student, limitation by bandwidth, and so on, which need to be resolved. Meanwhile, the research in Intelligent <b>Agents</b> <b>technology</b> has {{received a lot of}} attention in Information Systems Research and Development area. This project investigated <b>mobile</b> <b>agents</b> <b>technology</b> and its benefits, and applied this technology to address the problems that limit the potential of web-based learning environments. This project has developed a system, using <b>mobile</b> <b>agents</b> <b>technology,</b> to capture interactions over the Internet and to provide a continuous interaction pattern for a given student, even in off-line mode {{or in the case of}} unreliable connection. The <b>mobile</b> <b>agents</b> <b>technology</b> is used as the communications channel between client and server instead the traditional approaches. The system uses two step student modelling architecture, which consists of the local and central individual student models and central group student model. There are primarily three parts of student model in the system: local individual student model that resides in student's machine, central individual student model that resides on the central server, and central group student model that sits on the central server. This two-step modelling mechanism largely improves capturing interactions of a given student in the web-based learning environment, even in off-line mode, and enables the system to provide adaptation at different granularity. The combination of two-fold student modelling and <b>mobile</b> <b>agents</b> <b>technology</b> provides an attractive alternative to implement and improve web-based learning environments. The methodology used in this system addresses the problem of adaptation, which is one of the main bottlenecks that limit the development of web-based intelligent educational systems...|$|R

Due to the variety of the structures and the sizes of today's websites, validating hyperlinks has become quite a difficult task. Therefore, the <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology</b> is introduced as a solution for the critical problem of limited bandwidth we face nowadays.

Yet, a number of criteria should be applied to electronic commerce applications to assess which areas are best suited for mobile agents. A major requirement to build confidence in <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology</b> is the availability of adequate security mechanisms.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>{{technology}}</b> and Web service technology compensate {{each other}} and play very important roles in e-service applications. The mechanism of Web services technology naturally provides a platform for deploying <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology.</b> Therefore, {{the integration of the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology</b> and Web Service technology has been actively investigated in recent years. On the other hand, the security issues of the integration system have not drawn much attention. In this paper, we present a new security architecture for the integration of mobile agent and the Web services technology. This architecture provides a new authentication scheme for Web service provider to verify the mobile agent owner's identity by employing an identity-based signature protocol without using the username/password pair, which is infeasible for mobile agent. We also propose a new Web services and mobile agent system confidentiality protocol, which provides an alternative method to current security mechanisms without using certification authorities (CA) based public key infrastructure. With this scheme, it can simplify the key management and reduce the computation load particularly for group-oriented web services. In addition, this scheme also inherently has the non-repudiation property. 8 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, speech {{researchers}} and software engineer {{make an effort}} to integrate speech function into internet applications. Intelligent Agent for Speech Recognition and Translation prototype has been build to achieve that purposed. This prototype also proposed a new framework for speech recognition, word translation and <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology.</b> Intelligent Agent for Speech Recognition and Translation is a system that recognized human voice in spoken English, then translate English word to Malay word. Generally, this prototype is a merge of two areas, speech recognition and word translation and using <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology</b> to integrate them. This prototype is a system executed in Local Area Network (LAN) environments and also called Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR) system. DSR system divided into two parts, front-end processing (feature extractions) and back-end processing (recognition). There is a server which connected with a number of client devices. At the client side, the system will received human voice in spoken English and front-end processing will be done here. Then the feature files will be transmits to the server side which executed the back-end processing. When the voice has been recognized, the result will be translated into Malay word in text. After translation process is done, the Malay word in text will be send back to the client computer. All these processes will be handled and monitor by agent. With contribution from <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology,</b> the efficiency of speech recognition server can be improved compared with traditional distributed speech recognition server in term of time processing. By using <b>mobile</b> <b>agent</b> <b>technology,</b> speech recognition server can perform their task as parallel processing.
