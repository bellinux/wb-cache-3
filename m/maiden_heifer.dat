40|$|The {{performance}} of heifers {{at their first}} (<b>maiden</b> <b>heifers)</b> and second matings (first lactation heifers) was recorded between 2003 and 2008 to establish current heifer fertility levels on 14 commercial cattle properties in the Northern Territory (NT). Pregnancy rates in <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> (joined first at ~ 2 years of age) were generally adequate (> 75 %) to produce enough pregnant replacement breeders. Pregnancy rates in first lactation heifers were often very low (70 %). Calf loss between pregnancy diagnosis and weaning in first lactation heifers was often high (> 30 %). The average of the calf loss figures from all the herds studied was 22 %...|$|R
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper [Folley & Malpress, 1944] {{it has been}} shown that lactation can be induced in <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> or dry cows by the subcutaneous implantation of tablets of diethylstilboestrol (hereinafter called stilboestrol) or hexoestrol. Dodds, Golberg, Lawson & Robinson [1938] found that stilboestrol was almost as active in the rat, by the vaginal-smear test, when given by mouth as when subcutaneously injected. It was therefore interesting to see whether lactation could be induced in cows and heifers by oral administration of synthetic oestrogens, since the feeding method possesses obvious practical advantages. Induction of lactation in goats by oral administration of stilboestrol was reported by Lewis & Turner [1942]. MATERIAL AND METHODS Experimental animals A series of preliminary experiments was carried out on seven <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> and one heifer (Regality) which had aborted early in pregnancy, each of which re-ceived individual treatment. Four of these (three Shorthorns and one pedigree Guernsey) belonged to this Institute; the other four were Ayrshires belonging t...|$|R
40|$|Part of {{this study}} {{involved}} establishing current heifer fertility levels on Northern Territory (NT) commercial cattle properties. Performance recording on 14 properties found that there is scope for large improvement on many stations.

Some of the main findings of the performance recording were that pregnancy rates in 2 year old <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> are generally adequate (> 75 %), but foetal and calf loss rates in first calf heifers are often high (> 30 %) and reconception rates are often low...|$|R
40|$|What is calf wastage. Breeding female {{cattle in}} north Australia {{contribute}} best to business success by producing a heavy weaner each {{year at the}} first weaning round. This maximises increase in value by the cow unit over the year, generally from mid-year to mid-year. The ability to cycle in both <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> and lactating cows is the primary limitation to achieving this. Wastage of a calf at any stage between conception and weaning also substantially limits fertility and value increase at a herd level. Embryo loss may result in later calves as cows re-conceive; the calves produced are smaller at weaning {{and have to be}} weaned later into the dry season. Late calf wastage usually results in breeders missing a calf for the year. Late calving often also results in failure to cycle, thus cows rear a calf in the subsequent year...|$|R

40|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that the productivity of New Zealand beef herds has improved over time. Data from the NZ Meat and Wool Board’s Economic Service (2006) suggest that the average national calving percentage has declined over the last two decades. During the same period cattle carcass weights have increased but so too has the average cow live-weight which has resulted in increased maintenance costs of the cow herds. It is unclear whether production efficiency in the industry has improved or declined over time. The aim of this research was to develop means of improving productivity in commercial beef herds through practical methods of performance recording. The objectives were firstly to establish current management practices in commercial herds and secondly to develop an objective system for cow selection and culling which would have practical application in commercial herds. 	 Beef management survey Ninety two commercial beef producers with more than 100 breeding cows from the greater Canterbury region of New Zealand were surveyed. Pasture control was the main reason given for owning a beef herd. Size and conformation were the main selection criteria for choosing replacement heifers and bulls. Over 80 % of herds retained their own heifers as replacements and > 60 % mated yearling heifers to first calve at two years of age. Fertility was poor in the surveyed herds. In-calf rates at pregnancy testing averaged 88 % for <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers,</b> 92 % for rising second calvers and 93 % for mixed age (m. a.) cows. There {{was no significant difference between}} in-calf rates of <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> mated to first calve at two or three years of age; nor was there any significant difference between the re-breeding success of the two groups. Heifers mated at least one week earlier than m. a. cows, achieved a re-breeding success 4. 7 % greater (P 0. 90). Performance-based culling of previously unselected commercial beef herds based on the EGCW Index will result in improved productivity due to the moderately high repeatability of calf weaning weight. Objective data from extensively grazed commercial herds will also make possible the use of commercial herd data in genetic evaluations of herd sires...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Five Friesian <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> {{and four}} Friesian or Ayrshire cows were {{assigned}} to each of four treatments, namely: (1) controls;(2) melengestrol acetate (MGA) 1 mg orally daily for 14 days; (3) MGA+ 2500 i. u. HCG at 72 hr after the last administration of MGA; and (4) MGA+ 0 =. mg oestradiol benzoate on Day 1 of MGA treatment, + 2500 i. u. PMSG at 36 hr + 2500 i. u. HCG at 72 hr after the last administration of MGA. Jugular vein blood was sampled daily over the oestrus period in the control animals and daily after the last dose of MGA until {{the day after the}} first oestrus. The concentrations of progesterone and total oestrogens in peripheral plasma samples were assayed by radioimmunoassay with-out chromatographic separation. In the control animals, the total oestrogen concentration increased from 7 pg/ml 4 days before oestrus to 14 pg/ml on the day of oestrus, then decreased to 9 pg/ml 1 day after oestrus. Treatment with MGA alone did not alter this pattern at the first synchronized oestrus. Adminis-tration of HCG 72 hr after MGA withdrawal apparently depressed total oestrogen concentration. This was counteracted by prior treatment with PMSG. A comparison of the data from animals receiving MGA only and from controls indicates no adverse effect on release of oestrogens from ovarian follicles after cessation of MGA treatment. The progesterone concentration in control animals decreased from 9 ng/ml 4 days before oestrus to 0 =. 5 ng/ml on the day of oestrus. The MGA-treated animals had low progesterone values for several days before oestrus. Three of the sixteen animals treated with gonadotrophins had progesterone concentrations higher than basal values...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{selection}} for improved fertility in cattle {{has historically been}} considered problematic due to the very low heritability of reproductive traits such as weaning rate. However, the preliminary findings from research conducted by the CRC for Beef Genetic Technologies indicates that critical component traits of fertility such as age at puberty in tropically adapted cattle is highly heritable. Further, CRC researchers have demonstrated that standardised, readily measured male traits such as scrotal circumference and percent morphologically normal sperm are heritable and genetically correlated with the important female traits of age at puberty and interval from calving to first post-partum ovulation. These findings indicate that genetic {{selection for}} improved fertility of tropically adapted male and female genotypes is possible and should be utilised particularly in bull breeding herds as a long term strategy to improve herd fertility. In addition, to improve the rate of genetic improvement in fertility and other key traits affecting the profitability of beef herds, producers should consider implementing the routine use of artificial insemination (AI) with semen from high genetic merit bulls in mobs of selected females, particularly <b>maiden</b> <b>heifers.</b> However, there is good evidence that the response of females to hormonal treatments to synchronise ovulation to enable AI at a fixed time is significantly influenced by genotype, with high grade Bos indicus female having significantly lower rates of ovulation and hence lower conceptions rates than Bos indicus x Bos taurus and Bos taurus females. Modifications to synchronisation protocols which result in a more physiologically normal hormonal profile during development of the ovulatory follicle in Bos indicus heifers {{have been shown to}} significantly improve rates of ovulation and subsequent corpus luteum development, and thus the likelihood of conception to AI...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} a single measurement of plasma insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) could predict the number of viable embryos obtained from donors and the likelihood of pregnancy in recipients in multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) programs in cattle. The embryo yields from 101 embryo recoveries were examined in <b>maiden</b> Holstein <b>heifers</b> (n= 75) and multiparous Holstein cows (lactating cows n= 20, dry cows n= 6). Donors were super stimulated with FSH and embryo recovery was done non-surgically 7 days after artificial insemination. Embryos were classified according to the IETS criteria. Pregnancy rates in 100 <b>maiden</b> Holstein <b>heifer</b> recipients were analysed. Recipients were on day 7 +/- 1 of the estrous cycle at transfer. Pregnancy diagnosis was carried out at day 30 (PD 30) and rechecked at day 60 (PD 60) after transfer. Blood samples from coccygeal vessels taken at the time of embryo recovery (donors) and transfer (recipients) were analysed for IGF- 1, insulin, beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), urea and cholesterol. There was a negative correlation between the number of viable embryos and insulin (r=- 0. 33, P= 0. 025) in donor heifers. In donor cows, the number of viable embryos was correlated with IGF- 1 (r= 0. 43, P= 0. 028) and cholesterol (r=- 0. 43, P= 0. 027). In recipients, PD 30 and PD 60 were not affected by any of the circulating parameters analysed. Insulin, IGF- 1 and cholesterol only explained 8. 9, 13. 9 and 15. 8 % of the variation in the production of viable embryos, respectively. Several factors affect MOET programs and under the circumstances of the present study the usefulness of hormonal and metabolic profiles as predictors of the outcome of this biotechnology was limited...|$|R
50|$|The gadfly, {{a type of}} fly plaguing cattle, {{typically}} ones {{belonging to}} either the family Tabanidae (horse-flies) or the family Oestridae (bot flies), appears in Greek mythology as a tormenter to Io, the <b>heifer</b> <b>maiden.</b> Zeus lusts after Io and eventually turns her into a white heifer to hide her from his jealous wife, Hera. Hera is not fooled, and demands Io as a gift from Zeus. She then assigns Argus, the 100-eyed monster, the job of guarding Io. Hermes (ordered by Zeus) kills Argus and frees Io.

40|$|One aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{reproductive}} performance of cows and heifers when resynchronizing returns to estrus for a second insemination by treating with an intravaginal progesterone-releasing device (IVD) for 7 or 8 d when estradiol benzoate (EB) was administered at the start of treatment and again 24 h after device removal. An additional aim was to document the pattern of onset and characteristics of estrus with each resynchrony treatment. Lactating cows in three herds were synchronized for a first estrus and AI by treatment with an IVD for 8 d, starting on Day 0, cloprostenol (0. 5 mg im) at device removal and EB at device insertion (2. 0 mg im) and 24 h after removal (1. 0 mg im). Cows were resynchronized for a second estrus starting on Day 23 by reinsertion of IVDs for 7 (IVD- 7 -EB; n = 449) or 8 d (IVD- 8 -EB; n = 445) with EB (1. 0 mg im) administered at device insertion and 24 h after removal. Cows were resynchronized for a third estrus by administration of EB (1. 0 mg im) on Day 46, but subsequent treatments (no further treatment, reinsertion of CIDR or administration of EB on Day 55) varied among herds as part of separate studies. <b>Maiden</b> <b>heifers</b> (7 -Day, n = 68; 8 -Day, n = 69) were similarly treated as cows in a separate herd, but doses of EB were always 1. 0 mg im at device insertion and 0. 75 mg im 24 h after removal. Heifers were not resynchronized for a third estrus. Cattle were inseminated on detection of estrus at each synchronized estrus. Cumulative pregnancy rates 4 week (66. 0 %, 276 / 418 versus 59. 1 %, 247 / 418) and 7 week (72. 7 %, 304 / 418 versus 67. 7 %, 283 / 418) after the start of AI were greater (P < 0. 05) in the IVD- 7 -EB cows compared to the IVD- 8 -EB cows, respectively; this was associated with a 9 % increase in conception rates at the second estrus (P = 0. 051) in the IVD- 7 -EB cows. Treatment did not significantly affect reproductive performance in heifers. Characteristics of estrus measured with radiotelemetry did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups, but more cows were detected in estrus 36 h after removal of IVDs in the IVD- 8 -EB cows compared to the IVD- 7 -EB cows (P < 0. 05). We concluded that reproductive performance in resynchronized dairy cows but not heifers was greater following resynchronization of estrous cycles after AI with an IVD for 7 compared to 8 d when EB was injected at the start of treatment and 24 h after device removal...|$|R
