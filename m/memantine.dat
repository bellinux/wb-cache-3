5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) and the other (<b>memantine)</b> is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to determine how}} the extra chromosome 21 material causes Down syndrome, as currently this is unknown, and to develop treatments to improve intelligence in those with the syndrome. One hope is to use stem cells. Other methods being studied include the use of antioxidants, gamma secretase inhibition, adrenergic agonists, and <b>memantine.</b> Research is often carried out on an animal model, the Ts65Dn mouse.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas <b>memantine</b> and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

25|$|NMDA antagonists, such as dextromethorphan, ketamine, and <b>memantine.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> {{acts as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} {{at different}} neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at potencies possibly similar to the NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors, but this is difficult to ascertain with accuracy because of the rapid desensitization of nAChR responses in these experiments. It can be noted that <b>memantine</b> is an antagonist at Alpha-7 nAChR, which may contribute to initial worsening of cognitive function during early <b>memantine</b> treatment. Alpha-7 nAChR upregulates quickly in response to antagonism, which could explain the cognitive-enhancing effects of chronic <b>memantine</b> treatment. It {{has been shown that}} the number of nicotinic receptors in the brain are reduced in Alzheimer's disease, {{even in the absence of}} a general decrease in the number of neurons, and nicotinic receptor agonists are viewed as interesting targets for anti-Alzheimer drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> {{acts as an}} agonist at the {{dopamine}} D2 receptor {{with equal}} or slightly higher affinity than to the NMDA receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> is used {{to treat}} moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, {{especially}} {{for people who are}} intolerant of or have a contraindication to AChE (acetylcholinesterase) inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> is, in general, well-tolerated. Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of people) include confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations. Less common {{adverse effects}} include vomiting, anxiety, hypertonia, cystitis, and increased libido.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> {{acts as a}} non-competitive {{antagonist}} at the 5-HT3 receptor, with a potency {{similar to}} that for the NMDA receptor. The clinical significance of this serotonergic activity {{in the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease is unknown.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> {{has been}} studied in {{dementia}} with Lewy bodies, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, as an augmentation therapy for anxiety disorders, ADHD, {{as well as to}} help slowing down or even reversing the tolerance development to opioids.|$|E
25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that haloperidol {{may be more effective}} than the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and that the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, <b>memantine</b> has been shown to significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of <b>memantine</b> in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Memantine</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with a moderate decrease in clinical deterioration with only a small positive effect on cognition, mood, behavior, and the ability to perform daily activities in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. There {{does not appear to be}} any benefit in mild disease.|$|E
25|$|Shuster and Dodman tested {{pharmaceutical}} treatment on canines with CCD {{to see if}} it would work as effectively as it does in humans. They used glutamate receptor blockers (<b>memantine)</b> and fluoxetine, commonly known as the antidepressant Prozac, to treat and observe the reactions of 11 dogs with compulsions. Seven of the 11 dogs significantly reduced their compulsions in intensity and frequency after receiving medication.|$|E
25|$|All medical {{applications}} known so far involve not pure adamantane, but its derivatives. The first adamantane derivative {{used as a}} drug was amantadine – first (1967) as an antiviral drug against various strains of flu and then to treat Parkinson's disease. Other drugs among adamantane derivatives include adapalene, adapromine, amantadine, bromantane, carmantadine, chlodantane, dopamantine, <b>memantine,</b> rimantadine, saxagliptin, tromantadine, and vildagliptin. Polymers of adamantane have been patented as antiviral agents against HIV.|$|E
25|$|It {{acts as an}} agonist at the σ1 {{receptor}} with a low Ki of 2.6 µm (2600nm). The {{consequences of}} this activity are unclear (as the role of sigma receptors in general is not yet that well understood) and <b>memantine</b> is probably too weak at the sigma binding site to exhibit significant agonist effects, only exhibiting partial agonism or antagonism. Some of memantine's adverse effects arise through this route.|$|E
25|$|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} {{seems to}} play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and dextromethorphan can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance. Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very short half life (dextromethorphan), weak activity (<b>memantine)</b> or unacceptable side effects (ketamine).|$|E
500|$|Glutamate is an {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter of {{the nervous}} system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. <b>Memantine</b> is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. <b>Memantine</b> {{has been shown to}} have a small benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Reported adverse events with <b>memantine</b> are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. The combination of <b>memantine</b> and donepezil {{has been shown to be}} [...] "of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness".|$|E
500|$|Uncompetitive antagonists {{differ from}} non-competitive antagonists {{in that they}} require {{receptor}} activation by an agonist before they can bind to a separate allosteric binding site. This type of antagonism produces a kinetic profile in which [...] "the same amount of antagonist blocks higher concentrations of agonist better than lower concentrations of agonist". <b>Memantine,</b> used {{in the treatment of}} Alzheimer's disease, is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor.|$|E
500|$|... {{the safety}} and {{efficacy}} of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments had been or were being investigated in over 1,500 clinical trials worldwide, and approximately a quarter of these compounds are in PhaseIII trials, the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies. On the other hand, in the decade 2002–2012, 244 compounds were assessed in Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III trials, and {{only one of these}} (<b>memantine)</b> received FDA approval (though others were still in the pipeline).|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many other}} NMDA antagonists, <b>memantine</b> behaves as a dissociative {{anesthetic}} at supratherapeutic doses. [...] Despite isolated reports, recreational use of <b>memantine</b> is rare {{due to the}} drug's long duration and limited availability. Also <b>memantine</b> seems to lack most of the psychoactive effects recreational users are looking for, like euphoria, hallucinations etc.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Memantine</b> is a low-affinity voltage-dependent uncompetitive {{antagonist}} at glutamatergic NMDA receptors. By binding to the NMDA receptor with {{a higher}} affinity than Mg2+ ions, <b>memantine</b> is able to inhibit the prolonged influx of Ca2+ ions, particularly from extrasynaptic receptors, which forms the basis of neuronal excitotoxicity. The low affinity, uncompetitive nature, and rapid off-rate kinetics of <b>memantine</b> {{at the level of}} the NMDA receptor-channel, however, preserves the function of the receptor at synapses, as it can still be activated by physiological release of glutamate following depolarization of the presynaptic neuron. [...] The interaction of <b>memantine</b> with NMDA receptors plays a major role in the symptomatic improvement that the drug produces in Alzheimer's disease. However, there is no evidence as yet that the ability of <b>memantine</b> to protect against NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity has a disease-modifying effect in Alzheimer's, although this has been suggested in animal models.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Memantine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} and patented by Eli Lilly and Company in 1968 as an anti-diabetic agent, {{but it was}} ineffective at lowering blood sugar. [...] Later it was discovered to have CNS activity, and was developed by Merz for dementia in Germany; the NMDA activity was discovered after clinical trials had already begun. [...] <b>Memantine</b> was first marketed for dementia in Germany in 1989 under the name Axura.|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2017 <b>memantine</b> was marketed under many {{brand names}} {{worldwide}} including Abixa, Adaxor, Admed, Akatinol, Alceba, Alios, Almenta, Alois, Alzant, Alzer, Alzia, Alzinex, Alzixa, Alzmenda, Alzmex, Axura, Biomentin, Carrier, Cogito, Cognomem, Conexine, Cordure, Dantex, Demantin, Demax, Dementa, Dementexa, Ebitex, Ebixa, Emantin, Emaxin, Esmirtal, Eutebrol, Evy, Ezemantis, Fentina, Korint, Lemix, Lindex, Lindex, Lucidex, Manotin, Mantine, Mantomed, Marbodin, Mardewel, Marixino, Maruxa, Maxiram, Melanda, Memabix, Memamed, Memando, Memantin, Memantina, <b>Memantine,</b> <b>Mémantine,</b> Memantinol, Memantyn, Memanvitae, Memanxa, Memanzaks, Memary, Memax, Memexa, Memigmin, Memikare, Memogen, Memolan, Memorel, Memorix, Memotec, Memox, Memxa, Mentikline, Mentium, Mentixa, Merandex, Merital, Mexia, Mimetix, Mirvedol, Modualz, Morysa, Namenda, Nemdatine, Nemdatine, Nemedan, Neumantine, Neuro-K, Neuroplus, Noojerone, Polmatine, Prilben, Pronervon, Ravemantine, Talentum, Timantila, Tingreks, Tonibral, Tormoro, Valcoxia, Vilimen, Vivimex, Vizarsin, Witgen, Xapimant, Xapimant, Ymana, Zalatine, Zemertinex, Zenmem, Zenmen, and Zimerz.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} {{in an attempt to}} restore place field firing plasticity in aged subjects. NMDA receptors, which are glutamate receptors, exhibit decreased activity in aged subjects. <b>Memantine,</b> an antagonist that blocks the NMDA receptors, is known to improve spatial memory and was therefore used in an attempt to restore place field plasticity in aged subjects. <b>Memantine</b> succeeded in increasing place field plasticity in aged rat subjects. Although <b>memantine</b> aids in the encoding process of spatial information in aged rat subjects, it does not help with the retrieval of this information later in time. Thus, these place fields in aged mice do not appear to endure like those of young mice. When introduced to the same environment several times, different place fields fire in the CA1 hippocampal region of aged rats, suggesting that they are [...] "remapping" [...] their environment each time they are exposed to it. In the CA1 region, there is an increased reliance on self-motion inputs as opposed to visual inputs compared to the CA1 region of young rats, which relies more on visual cues. The CA3 hippocampal region is affected differently by decreased plasticity than the CA1 region just discussed. Decreased plasticity in aged subjects causes the same place fields in the CA3 region to activate in similar environments, whereas different place fields in young rats would fire in similar environments because they would pick up on subtle differences in these environments. It is evident that pharmaceuticals such as <b>Memantine</b> can have a significant effect in mediating the age-related decline in place field plasticity.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Memantine</b> is used {{to treat}} {{moderate}} to severe Alzheimer's disease. [...] It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors. It was first synthesized by Eli Lilly and Company in 1968 as a potential agent to treat diabetes; the NMDA activity was discovered in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014 as the July 2015 patent {{expiration}} for <b>memantine</b> neared, Actavis, {{which had}} acquired Forest, {{announced that it}} was launching an extended release (XR) form of <b>memantine</b> that could be taken once a day instead of twice a day as needed with the then-current [...] "immediate release" [...] (IR) version, and that it intended to stop selling the IR version in August 2014 and withdraw the marketing authorization. [...] This is a tactic to thwart generic competition called [...] "product hopping". [...] However the supply of the XR version ran short, so Actavis extended the deadline until the fall. [...] In September 2014 the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, filed a lawsuit to compel Actavis to keep selling the IR version on the basis of antitrust law.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, some CNS {{activities}} were discovered at Children's Hospital of Boston in 1995, and Children's licensed patents covering uses of <b>memantine</b> outside {{the field of}} ophthalmology to Neurobiological Technologies (NTI) in 1995.

2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease. <b>Memantine</b> also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil, may improve daytime alertness, but as with the antiparkinsonian drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} <b>memantine</b> {{derivative}} is neramexane which {{was discovered by}} studying number of aminoalkyl cyclohexanes, with <b>memantine</b> as the template, as NMDA receptor antagonists. Neramexane, which can been seen in figure 6, binds to the same site as <b>memantine</b> within the NMDA receptor associated channel and with comparable affinity. It does also show very similar bioavailability and blocking kinetics in vivo as <b>memantine.</b> Neramexane went to clinical trials for four indications, including Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

50|$|<b>Memantine</b> is a NMDA {{receptor}} antagonist {{and is used}} {{to treat}} patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, but is also used as a neuroenhancement drug.
