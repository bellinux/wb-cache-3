40|$|Objectives: The {{economic}} {{burden of}} <b>multimorbidity</b> is considerable. This review analyzed {{the methods of}} cost-of-illness (COI) studies and summarized the economic outcomes of <b>multimorbidity.</b> Methods: A systematic review (2000 – 2016) was performed, which was registered with Prospero, reported according to PRISMA, and used a quality checklist adapted for COI studies. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed COI studies on <b>multimorbidity,</b> whereas the exclusion criterion was studies focusing on an index disease. Extracted data included the definition, measure, and prevalence of multimorbidity; the number of included health conditions; the age of study population; the variables used in the COI methodology; the percentage of <b>multimorbidity</b> vs. total costs; and the average costs per capita. Results: Among the 26 included articles, 14 defined <b>multimorbidity</b> as a simple count of 2 or more conditions. Methodologies used to derive the costs were markedly different. Given different healthcare systems, OOP payments of <b>multimorbidity</b> varied across countries. In the 17 and 12 studies with cut-offs of ≥ 2 and ≥ 3 conditions, respectively, the ratios of <b>multimorbidity</b> to non-multimorbidity costs ranged from 2 – 16 to 2 – 10. Among the ten studies that provided cost breakdowns, studies with and without a societal perspective attributed {{the largest percentage of}} <b>multimorbidity</b> costs to social care and inpatient care/medicine, respectively. Conclusion: <b>Multimorbidity</b> was associated with considerable economic burden. Synthesising the cost of <b>multimorbidity</b> was challenging due to multiple definitions of <b>multimorbidity</b> and heterogeneity in COI methods. Count method was most popular to define <b>multimorbidity.</b> There is consistent evidence that <b>multimorbidity</b> was associated with higher costs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Multimorbidity</b> is {{a growing}} concern worldwide, with {{approximately}} 1 in 4 adults affected. Most of the evidence on <b>multimorbidity,</b> its prevalence and effects, comes from high income countries. Not much is known about <b>multimorbidity</b> in low income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of <b>multimorbidity</b> and examine its association with various social determinants of health in South Africa. Method The data used in this study are taken from the South Africa National Income Dynamic Survey (SA-NIDS) of 2008. <b>Multimorbidity</b> was defined as the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases in an individual. Multinomial logistic regression models were constructed to analyse the relationship between <b>multimorbidity</b> and several indicators including socioeconomic status, area of residence and obesity. Results The prevalence of <b>multimorbidity</b> in South Africa was 4 % in the adult population. Over 70 % of adults with <b>multimorbidity</b> were females. Factors associated with <b>multimorbidity</b> were social assistance (Odds ratio (OR) 2. 35; Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 59 - 3. 49), residence (0. 65; 0. 46 - 0. 93), smoking (0. 61; 0. 38 - 0. 96); obesity (2. 33; 1. 60 - 3. 39), depression (1. 07; 1. 02 - 1. 11) and health facility visits (5. 14; 3. 75 - 7. 05). Additionally, income was strongly positively associated with <b>multimorbidity.</b> The findings are similar to observations made in studies conducted in developed countries.

This should be investigated further in future research on the factors affecting <b>multimorbidity...</b>|$|E
40|$|People {{frequently}} {{live for}} many years with multiple chronic conditions (<b>multimorbidity)</b> that impair health outcomes and are expensive to manage. <b>Multimorbidity</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce quality of life and increase mortality. People with <b>multimorbidity</b> also rely more heavily on health and care services and have poorer work outcomes. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are ubiquitous in <b>multimorbidity</b> because of their high prevalence, shared risk factors, and shared pathogenic processes amongst other long-term conditions. Additionally, these conditions significantly contribute to the total impact of <b>multimorbidity,</b> having been shown to reduce quality of life, increase work disability, and increase treatment burden and healthcare costs. For people living with <b>multimorbidity,</b> MSDs could impair the ability to cope and maintain health and independence, leading to precipitous physical and social decline.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Multimorbidity</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be associated with}} a variety of negative health-related outcomes.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on data obtained from a postal survey designed by the Public Health Service (Gemeentelijke Gezondheids Dienst, GGD) involving 15, 188 persons aged 55 years and over living independently in Limburg, the Netherlands. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusted for potentially important covariates, were performed to evaluate the association between self-reported <b>multimorbidity</b> and three outcomes related to subjective memory complaints. RESULTS: <b>Multimorbidity</b> was indeed related to subjective memory complaints. The association between <b>multimorbidity</b> and subjective memory complaints was positively influenced by age. Moreover, <b>multimorbidity</b> was related to the degree of worrying about memory complaints in people who perceived themselves as forgetful. <b>Multimorbidity</b> was also associated with reporting a larger increase in these subjective memory complaints during the past year. In this latter case, <b>multimorbidity</b> had more prognostic capability in men than in women. Psychological distress was related to all three subjective memory-related outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, which was representative of the Dutch population, <b>multimorbidity</b> was associated with subjective memory complaints.

40|$|Common chronic {{conditions}} are routinely treated following standardised procedures known as clinical pathways.

40|$|<b>Multimorbidity</b> {{is present}} {{in more than one}} quarter of the {{population}} in Australia, and its prevalence increases with age.

In this paper, I propose a two-way clustering framework to identify clusters of most significant non-random comorbid health conditions and disparities in <b>multimorbidity</b> patterns among individuals.
