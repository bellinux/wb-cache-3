50|$|The Outer Gatehouse is of two storeys. The {{structure}} is now roofless {{but all of}} its walls are in a good structural condition. The north and south walls are gabled. The north and south arches of the gateway have two chamfered orders. The gateway also has an inner pair of south arches. The western is a pointed doorway while the eastern is a wader gateway. The north compartment has quadripartite vaulting which has chamfered ribs. The south compartment is also vaulted. In the west wall of the south compartment is a pointed doorway which once gave access to a west chamber. The upper floor of the gatehouse is lit by windows of two lights in {{the northern and southern}} walls. The northern window is flanked by two niches which once held statues. The window still retains its transom and drip <b>moulds.</b> <b>On</b> the <b>end</b> of the drip mouldings are two carved heads. One is of a knight with a closed visor while the other is of a monk. It is grade II* listed.|$|R
50|$|The {{glans penis}} is the {{expanded}} cap of the corpus spongiosum. It is <b>moulded</b> <b>on</b> the rounded <b>ends</b> of the corpora cavernosa penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. At {{the summit of}} the glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice. The circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona glandis, overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus (the coronal sulcus), behind which is the neck of the penis. The proportional size of the glans penis can vary greatly. On some penises it is much wider in circumference than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape.|$|R
50|$|The urethra {{enters the}} bulb nearer to the {{superior}} {{than to the}} inferior surface. On the latter there is a median sulcus (groove), from which a thin fibrous septum (wall) projects into {{the substance of the}} bulb and divides it imperfectly into two lateral lobes or hemispheres. The portion of the corpus spongiosum in front of the bulb lies in a groove on the under surface of the conjoined corpora cavernosa penis. It is cylindrical in form and tapers slightly from behind forward. Its anterior end is expanded {{in the form of an}} obtuse cone, flattened from above downward. This expansion, termed the glans penis, is <b>moulded</b> <b>on</b> the rounded <b>ends</b> of the corpus cavernosum penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces.|$|R
50|$|John Hemmings {{had some}} {{woodworking}} signatures that help distinguish his work {{from that of}} other workers at the Monticello Joinery.

50|$|Customary for a Lutyens memorial, the cenotaph {{stands on}} a base of three steps and is in Portland stone; it is {{situated}} on a lawned area within Brock Barracks, formerly {{the headquarters of the}} Royal Berkshire Regiment. At {{the very top of the}} structure is an urn—a feature Lutyens originally proposed or the cenotaph on Whitehall and which features on the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester. The urn sits on top of a chest tomb, and a three-staged base connects it to the main shaft, which is set back slightly towards the top; the shaft itself is moulded onto a base of two rectangular blocks. Although richer than other memorials, the cenotaph is still sparsely decorated. Attached to it are two painted stone flags carved by Eric Broadbent—the King's Colour on the west side and the regiment's colour on the east—which are joined to <b>moulded</b> wreaths <b>on</b> the <b>ends</b> by laurel swags. Painted flags featured in Lutyens' original proposal for the Whitehall cenotaph (Lutyens proposed six, though the Royal Berkshire Regiment's memorial only features two), but were rejected in favour of fabric, though they feature on several of his other memorials.|$|R

40|$|<b>Mould</b> growth <b>on</b> new {{and used}} {{construction}} timber The growth of <b>mould</b> <b>on</b> building materials varies in both rate and extent from {{one type of}} material to another, depending on the nutrients in the material and on the local conditions. In this respect, wood is a sensitive building material. This investigation has compared the growth of <b>mould</b> <b>on</b> new and on used timber under high humidity conditions (90 - 95 % RH, 22 °C) in a climate test chamber. The used timber was more quickly attacked by mould than was the new timber, {{regardless of whether it}} was simply placed in the chamber or was first sterilised and then sprayed with spores before being put into the chamber. However, when the surface of the used timber samples was sawn off, it behaved {{in the same way as}} new timber. The results show that old timber cannot simply be incorporated in new structures without a second thought, but that it can work just as well as new timber if the exposed surface of the old timber is first removed...|$|R
