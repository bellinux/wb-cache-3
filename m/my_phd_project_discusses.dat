40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} {{the ways in}} which the communication discipline can make a hidden crisis transparent. For this purpose I examine the concept of crisis entrepreneurship from a communication point of view. Using discourse analysis, I analyse the discursive practices of crisis entrepreneurs in the domain of education in the Netherlands. This paper is part of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> in which I examine the dilemmas encountered by crisis entrepreneurs and the interactional solutions they choose in addressing a crisis. In <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> I have analysed how crisis entrepreneurs use discursive practices: (1) to show the factuality of the problem. For example, the way the problem is presented is too theoretical and is not a problem in reality; (2) to present the credibility of the messenger as an authentic, legitimate spokesman. Crisis entrepreneurs may be accused of wanting to attract attention to their own cause; (3) to create the accountability for the problem and the solution. For example, crisis entrepreneurs can be accused of nursing personal grievances or of drawing attention to the issue without actively attempting to solve it. The conclusion is that a communication professional is able to recognize a problem raised by crisis entrepreneurs. Knowledge of interactional dilemmas helps communication professionals understand the potential of crisis entrepreneurs. A communication professional can therefore contribute to the recognition of crises by acknowledging that a crisis entrepreneur is someone who can have a strong hand in the public agenda, i. e., public affairs that are important to the authorities...|$|R

An approach to studying the students'experience of their learning as well as their experience of the context of the learning, combining phenomenography with activity system, is proposed. While the experience of the learning is studied with a phenomenographic approach, an activity system seen "from within" {{through the eyes of a}} learner is used to analyse the experienced context. <b>My</b> <b>Phd</b> <b>project</b> - its background and purpose Phenomenography has proved to be a fruitful approach for studying students'experience of learning in higher education.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 12 Sulfur and {{reactive}} halogens are {{key components}} in tropospheric chemistry and the radiation {{budget of the}} Earth. Tropospheric sulfur and halogen budgets are still not well constrained. Laboratory and modeling studies have revealed {{the important role of}} halogen species in the tropospheric sulfur cycle, such as the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by XO and the oxidation of S(IV) by HOX (X=Cl, Br and I). However, the feedbacks of sulfur-halogen interactions on the halogen cycle have raised little attention. <b>My</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. research involves laboratory measurements and model developments to understand the interaction between sulfur and reactive halogens (especially bromine) in the troposphere, and implications for the global sulfur and reactive bromine budgets. In the first part <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> (Chapter 2), I measured oxygen isotopes of sulfate (Δ 17 O) collected in the remote marine boundary layer (MBL), which reveal the signature of sulfate formed via aqueous-phase oxidation of S(IV) by HOX. Assisted by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we calculated that HOX are responsible for 33 - 50 % of sulfate formation in the remote Southern Hemisphere MBL during spring and summer. This provides the first observational constraint on the contribution of reactive halogens to sulfate aerosol formation. In the second part of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> (Chapter 3), I implemented HOBr+S(IV) reaction into GEOS-Chem to evaluate the contribution of this reaction to both sulfate production and reactive bromine (Bry) removal in the troposphere for the first time. This reaction reduces the global reactive bromine burden by 50 % and contributes to significant sulfate formation even at sub-ppt levels of HOBr. The reduction in Bry resulting from HOBr+S(IV) has implication for the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere through the increase in O 3 and OH abundances. In the third part of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> (Chapter 4), I explored another aspect of tropospheric sulfur-halogen interactions: oxidation of DMS by BrO and Cl radicals. I added 2 new sulfur intermediates dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and methane sulphinic acid (MSIA) as well as 12 new reactions in GEOS-Chem involving the formation of sulfate and methane sulfonic acid (MSA) from the oxidation of DMS in both the gas- and aqueous-phase. BrO and Cl account for 12 % and 4 % of global DMS oxidation, respectively, with large uncertainties stemming from uncertainties in tropospheric BrO and Cl abundances. Multiphase chemistry in cloud droplets and aerosols is critical for the production and removal of MSA in the troposphere. Our updates decrease the conversion yield of DMS to SO 2 from 91 % to 78 % and increase the conversion yield of DMS to MSA from 9 % to 13 %. We suggest that previous climate models with simplified DMS oxidation scheme (gas-phase oxidation by OH and NO 3 only) may overestimate SO 2 and sulfate production in the pre-industrial environment, potentially leading to underestimates in sulfate aerosol radiative forcing calculations in climate models, and that MSA may not be a good ice-core proxy for DMS emissions from sea ice melt. The large uncertainties on reactive halogen abundances are the largest impediment for our understanding of tropospheric sulfur-halogen interactions. To improve our understanding of MBL sulfur chemistry, we need to prioritize measurements of reactive halogen abundances, especially in the marine boundary layer...|$|R

40|$|Free {{word order}} {{languages}} with rich case systems and discontinuous constituents pose {{a serious challenge}} {{to the task of}} constructing an efficient natural language parse system. As Japanese not only allows considerable freedom in word order but pervasive constituent ellipsis, it poses unique difficulties for efficient broad coverage parsing. We have yet to see a broad coverage Japanese grammar/parser that generates linguistically well-motivated syntactic representations for scrambled structures and interprets elided arguments. <b>My</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> is intended to develop a linguistically grounded grammar that sustains parsing efficiency and covers this range of phenomena. I have already implemented a prototype version of the grammar/parser, the details of which are documented in [31] and I will discuss in Section 5. For this prototype I have adopted design principles and parse mechanisms which I believe are computationally and linguistically preferable over the existent Japanese parsing systems. <b>My</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. research <b>project</b> will consist of extending this prototype and completing a full-scale parsing system, by elaborating on the current mechanisms and overcoming a number of outstanding issues concerning word order, discontinuity and argument ellipsis.

The origins of Valach population are approached by evaluating the admixture event that marked the appearance of Moravian Valachs. Methods & data: Focus of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> lies on Y-chromosomal variation, using 12 Y-STR loci haplotype to compute population genetic statistics, to infer Y-chromosomal haplogroup information and to compare Moravian Valachs to other European populations.

Results: Our data reveal a decreased genetic variability in Moravian Valachs compared to other Central European populations. This feature is most probably caused by isolation of Valach population. Multidimensional scaling and comparison of FST distances shows Valach population as related to populations from Poland, Romania and Macedonia. Shared haplotypes and AMOVA tests place the Valachs to the Central European region.

For applications such as point-of-care biosensing, it is fundamental to develop sensors that should be automatic, inexpensive, portable and require a professional skill of the user that should be as low as possible. With the goal of determining the presence of pathogens when present in very small amount, such as for the screening of pathogens in drinking water, an amplification step must be implemented. Often this type of determinations should be performed with simple, automatic and inexpensive hardware: the use of a chemical (or nanotechnological) isothermal solution would be desirable. <b>My</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> focused on the study and on the testing of four isothermal reactions which can be used to amplify the nucleic acid analyte before the binding event on the surface sensor or to amplify the signal after that the hybridization event with the probe.

The goal of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> was to contribute to a better understanding of the biology of the interaction between C. graminicola and its host. C. graminicola produces two type of asexual spores: one is produced on the surface of infected tissues and is thought to be involved in the spread of the disease in the field. The second type of spore, oval in shape, is produced inside the infected plant tissues, and was believed to be involved in the movement of the pathogen inside the plant tissues via the vascular system. I tested this hypothesis with both cytological and molecular approaches. I used strains of C. graminicola expressing green fluorescent proteins (GFP) to inoculate wounded plants, and followed the development of the pathogen over time. This study revealed that C. graminicola is not a vascular pathogen. C. graminicola primarily moved through the rind and vascular fibers. Oval spores were produced in colonized parenchyma cells and remained dormant, and did not appear to be involved in the movement of the pathogen, at least during the early stages of the disease development. I also studied pathogen ingress in the absence of a wound. I inoculated unwounded plants with the GFP expressing strains. C. graminicola efficiently colonized th...|$|R

As a result, we observe more users that become producers and collaborate instead of solely consuming information as they did before. Besides that, the Internet has become a tool for daily use and infor-mation dissemination.

40|$|The {{subject of}} <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> {{is the study}} of the neural coding of sensory-motor {{responses}} in the leech Hirudo Medicinalis. I have used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy and computer vision methods to quantify the leech behavior and simultaneously measure its underlying neuronal activity. Based on this experimental approach, I was able to characterize the motor pattern underlying reflexive behavior in the leech, addressing fundamental issues of systems neuroscience such as population coding and distributed organization of motor responses. In this context, the specific aims of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> can be summarized in three main goals: 1) to develop a new method to quantify the two-dimensional pattern of defmmation induced by muscle contraction on the leech body wall; 2) to investigate the distributed organization of leech reflexive behavior at the level of recruitment and activation of specific classes of motoneurons and muscle fibers; 3) to understand the neural basis of the reliability of leech motor responses, by quantifying their reproducibility at different levels of neural processing. In this scheme, the accomplishment of a specific aim was the starting point to address the next one. Quantitative analysis of defommtion occurring on leech body-wall was the necessary backdrop for characterizing leech sensory-motor responses at the behavioral level. This quantitative analysis of behavior, in tum, was fundamental for comparing reproducibility of leech motor responses with that of neural firing sustaining them. In the following paragraphs, I will summarize the major achievements of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> in relation to established main goals. The first aim of my research was to develop a reliable and innovative method to quantify the pattern of deformation that muscle contraction induces on the leech body-wall. Muscle contraction is usually measured and characterized with force and displacement transducers. The contraction of muscle fibers, however, evokes in the tissue a two and even three-dimensional displacement field, which is not properly quantified by these transducers because they provide just a single scalar quantity. I circumvented this problem by using videomicroscopy and standard tools of computer vision developed for the analysis of time varying image sequences. By computing the so called optical flow, i. e. the apparent motion of points in a time varying image sequence, it is possible to recover a two dimensional motion field, describing rather precisely the displacement caused by muscle contraction in a flattened piece of skin. The obtained two dimensional optical flow can be further analyzed by computing its migin (i. e. the singular point) and four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion, rotation, longitudinal shear and oblique shear. These elementary deformations provide a compact and accurate characterization of the contraction induced by different motoneurons. I demonstrated this technique by analyzing the displacement caused by muscle contraction on the leech body-wall. However, this method can be applied to monitor and characterize all contractions in almost flat tissues with enough visual texture. The second aim of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> was to apply the method described above in order to characterize the pattern of activation of different classes of motoneurons and muscles during leech reflexive behavior. Activation of motoneurons innervating leech muscles causes the appearance of a two dimensional vector field of deformations on the skin surface that can be fully characterized by computing the optical flow. I found that all motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the elementary deformations of the contractions they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong oblique shear, in addition to longihidinal shear and negative expansion. These results clearly showed that contractions induced by different classes of motoneurons and muscle fibers form a set of basic behavioral units. I also investigated the way in which such behavioral units can combine to sustain motor responses and I found that optical flows induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Complex patterns of skin deformation induced by mechanosensory stimulation can therefore be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal, circular and oblique muscle fibers. Based on this conclusion, I found that local bending, a motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the leech skin, is sustained by coactivation of two distinct classes of motoneurons: circular and longitudinal. I also compared the pattern of deformation produced by local bending with that produced by intracellular stimulation of mechanosensory pressure (P), touch (T) and nociceptive (N) cells: optical flows resulting from the activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by mechanical stimulation. This confirmed that local bending is almost entirely mediated by excitation of P cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells. In conclusion, these results revealed the distributed nature of leech reflexive behavior at the level of muscle activation and motoneuron recruitment, showing that complex motor responses result from the linear sum of a small number of basic patterns of deformation. The final step in investigating distributed motor behavior in the leech was to characterize the reproducibility of local bending and that of neural firing sustaining it. I analyzed variability at different levels of processing: mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation and behavior. I found that spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike those in motoneurons. However, the motor response was much more reproducible than the firing of individual motoneurons sustaining it. I showed that this reliability of the behavior is obtained by two distinct biophysical mechanisms: temporal and ensemble averaging. The former is guaranteed by the low pass filtering properties of the leech muscles that contract very slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter of motoneuron spikes. The latter is provided by the coactivation of a population of motoneurons, firing in a statistically independent way. This statistical independence reduces the vm ability of the population firing. These results have a general significance, because they show that reproducible spike trains are not required to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous system can cope with umeliable components to produce reliable action...|$|R

The project will develop a framework for applications that use microgestures to support everyday tasks through invisible and context-aware appearing interface layers underneath object-grasping hands. In an expert study that has been accepted as a full paper at INTERACT 2011, I explore the motor limitations and opportunities of microgestures while grasping objects and valued manual dual-task scenarios by walking through three tasks that involve grasping objects. The outcome of the study is a generic microgesture set for different grasp types and a collection of parameters that have a relevant effect on the choice of the grasping tasks. A further user study in progress is investigating the effect of grasped objects, such as handheld devices, on the feasibility of performing microgestures. Users are asked to perform finger-tip and drags on the front and/or back of a handheld device. The device is two-sided and touch-sensitive, it is made by stacking 2 pads together in a sandwich-like prototype. This allows tracking users’ finger gestures through a camera as well as through front and touch screens. The outcome of the two mentioned studies will describe a design space for out-of-a-grasp microgestures. At the INTERACT doctoral consortium I aim to present this design space and discuss how this can serve as a basis for developing a framework of out-of-grasp microinteractions that are subtasks of grasping tasks. The microinteractions will be developed to support the grasp tasks with regard to their perceived ergonomic and hedonic qualities...|$|R

The preparation and processing of these materials towards the realization of opto-electronic devices {{has been one of}} the main motivations for the recent development of photonics and optoelectronics. <b>My</b> <b>Ph.</b> D <b>projects</b> involves with three aspects: 1. Preparations of atomic-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), e. g. MoS₂, WS₂ and WSe₂ with chemical vapour depositions. In this part, we present the synthesis of large size (> 100 μm) single crystals of atomically thin tungsten disulfide (WS₂), a member of TMDs family, on sapphire substrate. More importantly, we demonstrate a polystyrene (PS) mediated delamination process via capillary force in water which allows recyclable use of the growth substrates; 2. Fabrication of TMDs based photodetectors and study the performance and mechanisms with spatial photocurrent mapping. We developed an efficient photodetector with extremely large photo-responsive active area based on a lateral p-n junction of monolayer-bilayer WSe₂. The junction is produced by partially peeling off the upper layer of a bilayer WSe₂ crystal grown by atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition. Kelvin probe force microscope and photocurrent mapping were used to understand the performance and the mechanism; 3. Atomic layered thin TMDs based flat lenses: fabrication and imaging. An ultrathin flat lens with a thickness of 7 Å, which corresponds to the fundamental physical limit of material thickness, is fabricated on a large monolayer WSe 2 single crystals with direct femtosecond laser writing.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the paper. Available from the {{publisher}} via the link in this record. Previous research has shown that prisoners' families in the UK are greatly affected by imprisonment: financially, socially, emotionally and practically. Despite an ever-growing body of literature, however, the topic of prisoners' families has not yet become one of the key themes in criminology and the sociology of punishment. Criminal justice policy has also failed to engage with the needs of prisoners' families, with criminal justice discourse being largely focused on justice as defined by punishments and deserts. Building on the concept of social justice, this paper argues that a broader understanding of justice within criminal justice is sorely needed if social justice is to be achieved for prisoners' families. It then discusses four types of injustices that are highlighted by thinking of prisoners' families through a social justice lens. It concludes that to do justice for prisoners' families, there is a need to broaden the meaning of justice in criminal justice, and discuss social justice and the collateral consequences of imprisonment.

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> {{has focused}} on the {{characterization}} of TPK 3, a putative channel selective for potassium (K+) with a predicted chloroplast localization in higher plants, from biochemical, physiological and electrophysiological point of view. This protein belongs to the TPK channel family (from Tandem-Pore K+ channels) and displays amino acid sequence homology with another K+ channel studied in our laboratory, called SynK (Zanetti et al., 2010). SynK shows thylakoid localization in Cyanobacteria. The SynK channel {{has been shown to be}} critical for photosynthetic performances in Cyanobacteria, given the photosensitive phenotype displayed by the mutants lacking the SynK protein. Given the homology, we hypothesized that similarly, TPK 3 might be involved in the regulation of photosynthetic processes in higher plants. So far, no information is available about the properties of TPK 3, nor about its physiological roles, neither about its possible involvement in photosynthesis; the work presented in this thesis had the aim of clarifying some important aspects of the functions of TPK 3. Following subcellular localization studies carried out using biochemistry and confocal microscopy techniques, the TPK 3 channel was expressed in E. coli cells for subsequent electrophysiological characterization in a planar lipid bilayer setup in order to prove its function as K+ channel. The unavailability of commercial mutants for tpk 3 gene required setting up of a silencing procedure via RNA interference of the messenger for the protein, in order to analyze the possible physiological roles of TPK 3. The resulting silenced plants have been studied under different growth conditions to determine changes in physiology of the plants including their photosynthetic parameters. In parallel with the TPK 3 project, the most important part of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D., I also followed two other major areas of research: one concerning the study of the functions of two members of plant Glutamate Receptors (GluRs) and the other one concerning the characterization of the plant homologous of the recently identified MCU (Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter) of mammals. This thesis also includes a manuscript (Checchetto et al., 2012) to which I contributed with the heterologous expression of a calcium-activated K+ channel, SynCaK, of Cyanobacteria. ...|$|R

40|$|RNASET 2 is an {{atypical}} tumor suppressor gene, which behaves as {{a member}} of the "tumor antagonizing/malignancy suppressor genes" class. Indeed, in our recent works we have demonstrated that RNASET 2 overexpression in ovarian cancer cells is associated with a strong suppression of their tumorigenicity in vivo, without affecting any in vitro cancer-related growth parameter. Noteworthy, the control of tumor growth apparently relies on a non-cell autonomous mechanism which involves the establishment of a cross-talk between RNASET 2 -overexpressing cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, where the monocyte/macrophage lineage turned out to represent the most likely target of RNASET 2 activity. Within this framework, the principal aim of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>project</b> was to investigate the putative occurrence of a functional cross-talk between the RNASET 2 -overexpressing tumor cell and the innate immune target cells. I demonstrate here that RNASET 2 protein binds the monocyte/macrophage cell surface via a receptor-mediated interaction and exerts a chemotactic activity on this cell lineage. Thus, I propose that the recruitment and the functional activation of such cells within the tumor microenvironment could be responsible for the RNASET 2 -mediated tumor suppression that occurs in vivo. Moreover, I present here data demonstrating both the overexpression and sub-cellular re-localization of RNASET 2 protein in response to different stress-inducing treatments. Thus, as for other members of the T 2 ribonucleases family, I propose that human RNASET 2 could play a cell autonomous role in orchestrating defense mechanisms against stress conditions. Collectively, these data suggest that at the tumor microenvironment level human RNASET 2 could act as an "alarmin", both overexpressed and secreted during the early stages of tumor progression in order to activate innate immune defense mechanisms against the tumor...|$|R
