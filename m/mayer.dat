5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman <b>Mayer,</b> claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument's base. U.S. Park Police shot and killed <b>Mayer.</b> The monument was undamaged in the incident, and it was discovered later that <b>Mayer</b> did not have explosives. After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, <b>Mayer</b> {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, <b>Mayer</b> pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. <b>Mayer</b> looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. <b>Mayer</b> made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, <b>Mayer</b> pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mayer</b> {{claimed his}} first {{victories}} over United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) four-engine bombers on 23 November 1942. Together with fellow pilot Georg-Peter Eder, <b>Mayer</b> developed the head-on attack {{as the most}} effective tactic against the Allied daylight heavy combat box bomber formations. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 16 April 1943 after 63 victories. On 1 July 1943, he was appointed commander of JG2.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Göttingen, Goeppert <b>Mayer</b> wrote her doctorate on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms.

5000|$|... "It was a crappy childhood", said <b>Mayer's</b> nephew Gerald. His {{family was}} poor, and <b>Mayer's</b> father spoke little English {{and had no}} {{valuable}} skills.

With his family speaking mostly Yiddish at home, his goal of self-education when he quit school was made more difficult.|$|R

The band also gave <b>Mayer</b> a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, <b>Mayer</b> added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E

5|$|In the Battle of Britain, <b>Mayer</b> often {{flew over}} the English Channel as the wingman of Helmut Wick. He claimed three further {{victories}} in this campaign, all over Royal Air Force (RAF) Supermarine Spitfires, but was himself shot down or forced to land at the French Coast. Once he had to swim in the Channel for an hour before he was rescued. At the end of 1940 <b>Mayer</b> had four victories to his credit and JG2 was withdrawn from combat to replenish the heavy losses it had sustained. Following a short tour as fighter pilot instructor at the Jagdfliegerschule (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, <b>Mayer</b> {{was sent back to}} the Channel Front.|$|E
5|$|Joe <b>Mayer</b> {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert <b>Mayer,</b> Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. <b>Mayer</b> took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert <b>Mayer</b> to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
