5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with <b>mixed</b> <b>materials.</b> Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
25|$|Several moths in {{the family}} Tineidae are {{commonly}} regarded as pests because their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural proteinaceous fibers such as wool or silk. They {{are less likely to}} eat <b>mixed</b> <b>materials</b> containing some artificial fibers. There are some reports that they may be repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar, by lavender, or by other natural oils; however, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation.

60|$|For {{there is}} {{something}} really pathetic about the Eugenist's neglect of the aristocrat and his family affairs. People still talk about the pride of pedigree; but {{it strikes me as}} the one point on which the aristocrats are almost morbidly modest. We should be learned Eugenists if we were allowed to know half as much of their heredity as we are of their hairdressing. We see the modern aristocrat in the most human poses in the illustrated papers, playing with his dog or parrot--nay, we see him playing with his child, or with his grandchild. But {{there is something}} heartrending in his refusal to play with his grandfather. There is often something vague and even fantastic about the antecedents of our most established families, which would afford the Eugenist admirable scope not only for investigation but for experiment. Certainly, if he could obtain the necessary powers, the Eugenist might bring off some startling effects with the <b>mixed</b> <b>materials</b> of the governing class. Suppose, to take wild and hypothetical examples, he were to marry a Scotch earl, say, to the daughter of a Jewish banker, or an English duke to an American parvenu of semi-Jewish extraction?

40|$|Abstract. Crystalline {{turbostratic}} {{boron nitride}} (t-BN) was prepared {{by a combination}} of precursor compound formation and impurity segregation from boric acid (H 3 BO 3) and urea. A <b>mixed</b> <b>material</b> was prepared by separately dissolving H 3 BO 3 and urea in distilled water then blended them, which was followed by drying. A precursor compound including oxygen was formed from the <b>mixed</b> <b>material</b> upon low-temperature heat treatment at 250 o C. The oxygen-containing impurity was segregated as a boron oxide component by the hydrolysis of the precursor compound during the grinding process in air, leading to the effective layered structure formation and layer stacking of t-BN. Crystalline t-BN nanoparticles with well-stacked layered structures were prepared by leaching the segregated impurity in a hot aqueous solution of the product formed by heat treatment at 1300 o C in a...|$|R
