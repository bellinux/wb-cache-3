25|$|This {{developed}} into the Surge hanging <b>milker.</b> Prior to milking a cow, a large wide leather strap called a surcingle was put around the cow, across the cow's lower back. The <b>milker</b> device and collection tank hung underneath the cow from the strap. This innovation allowed the cow {{to move around}} naturally during the milking process {{rather than having to}} stand perfectly still over a bucket on the floor.|$|E
25|$|It can {{be harmful}} to an animal {{for it to be}} over-milked past the point where the udder has stopped {{releasing}} milk. Consequently, the milking process involves not just applying the <b>milker,</b> but also monitoring the process to determine when the animal has been milked out and the <b>milker</b> should be removed. While parlor operations allowed a farmer to milk many more animals much more quickly, it also increased the number of animals to be monitored simultaneously by the farmer. The automatic take-off system was developed to remove the <b>milker</b> from the cow when the milk flow reaches a preset level, relieving the farmer of the duties of carefully watching over 20 or more animals being milked at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of goat <b>milkers</b> on milking hygiene was investigated, {{by means of}} a qualitative approach, before and after a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) training course. <b>Milkers</b> from three goat dairy farms in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Responses to the questions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed by means of the Discourse of the Collective Subject. <b>Milkers</b> were then trained in a one-hour content and dialogue-based lecture on "GPP principles" and "recommended hygienic procedures for milking". Two months after the training course, <b>milkers</b> were interviewed again with the same questionnaire used before the training course. No difference was found between discourses obtained before and after the training course. Individual analysis of the discourses showed that <b>milkers</b> had previous experience milking of animals, liked their jobs and were willing to learn more about it. However, they had no clear suggestions on how to improve their work routine...|$|R
25|$|In rotary parlors, {{the cows}} are loaded {{one at a}} time onto the {{platform}} as it rotates. The <b>milker</b> stands near the entry to the parlor and puts the cups on the cows as they move past. By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another <b>milker</b> or a machine removes the cups and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E
25|$|Milking is now {{performed}} {{almost exclusively}} by machine, though human technicians are still essential on most facilities. The most common milking machine {{is called a}} cluster <b>milker.</b> This <b>milker</b> consists of four metal cups—one per teat—each lined with rubber or silicon. The cluster is attached to both a milk collection system and a pulsating vacuum system. When the vacuum is on, it pulls air from between the outer metal cup and the liner, drawing milk out of the teat. When the vacuum turns off, it gives the teat an opportunity to refill with milk. In most milking systems, a milking technician must attach the cluster to each cow, but the machine senses when the cow has been fully milked and drops off independently.|$|E
25|$|The first milking {{machines}} were {{an extension of}} the traditional milking pail. The early <b>milker</b> device fit on top of a regular milk pail and sat on the floor under the cow. Following each cow being milked, the bucket would be dumped into a holding tank. These were introduced in the early 20th century.|$|E

40|$|A {{streptococcus}} {{epidemic of}} moderate extent and severity {{was characterized by}} clinical symptoms different from the usual septic sore throat, though the organism found was culturally Streptococcus epidemicus. The infection was traced to the milk from a single quarter of the udder of a cow in a dairy of 112 cows producing an otherwise excellent grade of raw milk. A number of the <b>milkers</b> on the dairy farm were found infected. It was impossible to trace the infection of the cow's udder {{to any one of}} the <b>milkers,</b> though such an infection seems probable since the streptococcus isolated from the cow was in every respect like streptococci isolated from patients and <b>milkers,</b> and different from those usually found in normal cows or cows with garget. Certain recommendations are made to safeguard producers of raw milk against the occurrence of such epidemics...|$|R
25|$|It {{takes the}} average cow {{three to five}} minutes to give her milk. Some cows are faster or slower. Slow-milking cows may take up to fifteen minutes to let down all their milk. Though milking speed {{is not related to}} the quality of milk {{produced}} by the cow, it does impact the management of the milking process. Because most milkers milk cattle in groups, the <b>milker</b> can only process a group of cows at the speed of the slowest-milking cow. For this reason, many farmers will group slow-milking cows so as not to stress the faster milking cows.|$|E
25|$|Centralized {{dairy farming}} as we {{understand}} it primarily developed around villages and cities, where residents were unable to have cows of their own {{due to a lack of}} grazing land. Near the town, farmers could make some extra money on the side by having additional animals and selling the milk in town. The dairy farmers would fill barrels with milk in the morning and bring it to market on a wagon. Until the late 19th century, the milking of the cow was done by hand. In the United States, several large dairy operations existed in some northeastern states and in the west, that involved as many as several hundred cows, but an individual <b>milker</b> could not be expected to milk more than a dozen cows a day. Smaller operations predominated.|$|E
500|$|Daily {{milk yield}} {{generally}} varies from [...] and from 1.3% to 7.8% {{of the body}} weight. Milk yield varies geographically and depends upon the animals' diet and living conditions. At the peak of lactation, a healthy female would typically provide [...] milk per day. Leese estimated a lactating female would yield [...] besides the amount ingested by the calf. The Pakistani dromedary, which is considered a better <b>milker</b> and bigger, can yield [...] when well-fed. Dromedaries in Somalia may be milked between two and four times a day, while those in Afar, Ethiopia, may be milked up to seven times a day.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} sought to {{investigate}} the knowledge of cow <b>milkers</b> on sanitary management of milking and caring {{for the quality of}} milk in the Milkproducing Units in the region of Rio Bonito-RJ, Brazil, through a qualitative approach. In order to achieve this objective, we interviewed ten <b>milkers</b> from farms in the Rio Bonito city, state of Rio de Janeiro, using a semi-structured form, consisting of observations and questions whose responses were recorded, transcribed and analyzed according to the triangulation methodology. Individual analysis of discourses showed that <b>milkers</b> had previous experience milking of animals, but they had no clear ideas on how to improve their workflow. It can be concluded that certain factors like scholarity and production volumes did not influence the application of hygienic sanitary practice and lack of skilled labor leads to failure in effective hygienic sanitary control. ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{herringbone}} {{and parallel}} parlors, the <b>milker</b> generally milks one row at a time. The <b>milker</b> will move {{a row of}} cows from the holding yard into the milking parlor, and milk each cow in that row. Once all of the milking machines {{have been removed from}} the milked row, the <b>milker</b> releases the cows to their feed. A new group of cows is then loaded into the now vacant side and the process repeats until all cows are milked. Depending {{on the size of the}} milking parlor, which normally is the bottleneck, these rows of cows can range from four to sixty at a time. The benefits of a herringbone parlour are easy maintenance, the durability, stability, and improved safety for animals and humans when compared to tie stall ...|$|E

During the summer of 2016, the research conducted centered on a data output analysis of the LELY Astronaut computer program. Data reports from the robotic <b>milkers</b> were collected and analyzed, and the information was examined to determine which and how data was useful and important, or redundant and irrelevant. The information was then used to determine how users could employ robotic <b>milkers</b> to improve dairy management.
