5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E
5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{dominance}} among ants, {{a number}} of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking echidnas burrow down into the hole they have made and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves {{on the head and}} chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, echidnas only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes it <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> echidnas to prey on the winged females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by echidnas.|$|E

25|$|Discrepancy in vowel {{category}} {{significantly reduced}} {{the magnitude of}} the McGurk effect for fusion responses. Auditory /a/ tokens dubbed onto visual /i/ articulations were more compatible than the reverse. This could be because /a/ has a wide range of articulatory configurations whereas /i/ is more limited, which makes it <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> subjects to detect discrepancies in the stimuli. /i/ vowel contexts produce the strongest effect, while /a/ produces a moderate effect, and /u/ has almost no effect.|$|E

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{creation}} of the railway network {{in the second quarter of}} the 19th century facilitated the mobility of the general population, and one beneficiary of this was religion.

25|$|The {{official}} {{explanation for}} this campaign was that the state was vulnerable due to foreign religious efforts (e.g. the Vatican, US evangelical churches) and that therefore the churches in Russia needed to be deprived of all public rights {{with the exception of}} liturgical services conducted within church walls. All of these regulations together made it <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the state to arbitrarily persecute clergy and their families, especially with regard to the discriminatory financial, land use and housing regulations.|$|E
25|$|Australasian Signed English {{was created}} in the late 1970s to {{represent}} English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was, and still is, used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for discussing English in academic contexts. It was thought to be <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than to learn a new language with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.|$|E
25|$|The {{library at}} Gallaudet University, the only Deaf liberal arts {{university}} in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library’s collection {{has grown from a}} small number of reference books to the world’s largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> both library staff and users. The library also houses the university’s archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the scout}} ant is {{observed}} {{to lay a}} pheromone trail on the return journey to the nest, the other ants seem to be unable to follow this trail {{without the help of}} the scout. The scout ant therefore leads the raid from the front, with the other ants following in a column-like formation. Recruitment time varies between 60 and 300 seconds, with all castes taking part in a raid. During the outward journey towards the termites, all ants are laying a pheromone trail, making it <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> them to find their way back to the nest later without having to rely on the scout ant.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the war {{on drugs}} led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize {{proceeds}} of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally have to prove an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and {{it is up to the}} individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes it <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{individuals}} with SP, {{there is almost}} no blocking of exogenous stimuli, which means it is <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> a stimulus to arouse the individual. There may also be a problem with the regulation of melatonin, which under normal circumstances regulates the serotonergic neural populations. Melatonin is typically at its lowest point during REM sleep. Inhibition of melatonin at an inappropriate time would make it impossible for the sleep off neural populations to depolarize when presented with a stimulus that would normally lead to complete arousal. The vestibular nuclei in particular has been identified as being closely related to dreaming during the REM stage of sleep. According to this hypothesis, vestibular-motor disorientation, unlike hallucinations, arise from completely endogenous sources of stimuli.|$|E

The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than a}} trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would be <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{mathematical}} notation {{in use today}} was not invented until the 16th century. Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery. Euler (1707–1783) was responsible {{for many of the}} notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to Barbara Oakley, this {{can be attributed to the}} fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language. Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog. Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.|$|E
25|$|The Court buttressed its {{determination}} {{based upon}} the underlying premises of the directness requirement. First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions. For example, in this case, National could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud. Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can pursue their own claim. Here, the State of New York could file suit and in that situation, it would be <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> a court to calculate New York's damages. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court reversed the Second Circuit's holding that Ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962(c) claim.|$|E
