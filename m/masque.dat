5|$|As {{time goes}} on, Shana and Yuji {{encounter}} several more Flame Haze, such as Margery Daw and Wilhelmina Carmel, and Denizens in Misaki City. An organization of Denizens called Bal <b>Masqué</b> discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo {{and attempt to}} use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal <b>Masqué</b> is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal <b>Masqué,</b> and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which {{will serve as a}} paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, {{and all of the other}} Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself.|$|E

5000|$|The title, <b>Masques</b> et bergamasques (meaning [...] "masks and bergamasks", a bergamask being {{a rustic}} dance), {{comes from the}} opening lines of the Verlaine poem sung as the sixth movement: [...] "Votre âme est un paysage choisi / Que vont charmant <b>masques</b> et bergamasques." [...] Fauré {{reportedly}} said of <b>Masques</b> et bergamasques that [...] "it is like the impression you get from the paintings of Watteau." ...|$|R
5|$|The Gray's Inn <b>masque</b> in 1588 {{with its}} centrepiece, The Misfortunes of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, is {{considered}} by A.W. Ward be the most impressive <b>masque</b> thrown {{at any of the}} Inns. William Shakespeare performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, Lord Southampton, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play The Comedy of Errors was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the Night of Errors and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written for readers instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the <b>masque</b> in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the <b>masque</b> out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E
5|$|The fairies mock {{the drunken}} poet and drive him away. With its quick repartee and its broadly “realistic” {{portrayal}} of the poor victim, the <b>Masque</b> of the Drunken Poet is the closest episode in Purcell’s London stage works to full-fledged opera as the Italians knew it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Masques</b> were multimedia, {{for they}} almost always {{involved}} costuming and {{music as a}} method of conveying the story or narrative. Ben Jonson, for example, wrote <b>masques</b> with the architect Inigo Jones. William Davenant, who would become one of the major impresarios of the English Restoration, also wrote pre-Revolutionary <b>masques</b> with Inigo Jones. The role of the architect was that of designer of the staging, which would be elaborate and often culminate in a fireworks show.|$|R

5|$|Percy Bysshe Shelley was in Italy and did {{not hear}} of the {{massacre}} until 5 September. His poem, The <b>Masque</b> of Anarchy, subtitled Written on the Occasion of the Massacre at Manchester was sent for publication in the radical periodical The Examiner but because of restrictions on the radical press, was not published until 1832, {{ten years after the}} poet's death.|$|E
5|$|Prospero then {{explains}} that he tested Ferdinand, and betroths a willing Miranda to him. He then asks Ariel to bring some other spirits and create a <b>masque</b> to entertain the young couple. These spirits present a blessing by Iris, Ceres, and Juno, followed by dancing. Prospero suddenly remembers the plot against his life, dismisses the spirits and Miranda and Ferdinand, and sets a trap for Caliban, Trinculo, and Stephano. They are chased offstage by goblins {{in the shape of}} hounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the <b>masque</b> within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the <b>masque</b> genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E
50|$|Jonson's {{text for}} Pan's Anniversary was first {{published}} in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641, though it was mis-dated to 1625 and placed out of the proper chronological order of the <b>masques</b> in that volume. The title page for the work is unique among Jonson's <b>masques</b> in placing Inigo Jones's name before Jonson's. Some of Jones's designs for the <b>masque's</b> sets survive; they consist, unsurprisingly, of forest and mountain scenes typical of the pastoral form.|$|R

5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand <b>masque,</b> call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the <b>masque</b> precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

At Christmas the students ruled the Inn for the day, appointing a Lord of Misrule called the Prince of Purpoole, and organising a <b>masque</b> entirely on their own, with the Benchers and other senior members away for the holiday.|$|E

5|$|His early {{major works}} for the voice {{included}} The <b>Masque</b> at Kenilworth (1864); an oratorio, The Prodigal Son (1869); and a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea (1871). He composed a ballet, L'Île Enchantée (1864) and incidental music {{for a number of}} Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his Symphony in E, Concerto for Cello and Orchestra, and Overture in C (In Memoriam) (all three of which premiered in 1866). These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat. He worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns, popular songs, and parlour ballads.|$|E

In 1889, Flora's Feast: A <b>Masque</b> of Flowers was published, featuring flowers represented as human figures, for which Evans used as many as eight colour blocks.

Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular.

5|$|Of Messager's works {{performed}} by other artists, there are complete recordings {{of several of}} his operas, and extracts from others. There have been two complete sets of Véronique– a 1953 Decca mono recording conducted by Pierre Dervaux, and a 1969 stereo EMI recording conducted by Jean-Claude Hartemann. Other complete sets of Messager operas include L'amour <b>masqué</b> (1970; conductor, Raymond Legrand), La Basoche (1960; Tony Aubin), Coups de roulis (1963; Marcel Cariven), Fortunio (1987; John Eliot Gardiner), Isoline (1947; Louis Beydts), Monsieur Beaucaire (1958; Jules Gressier), and Passionnément (1964; Jean-Paul Kreder).|$|E
5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's text to music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a <b>masque</b> featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E
5|$|Singers {{who have}} {{recorded}} individual numbers from Messager's operas include role creators such as Jean Périer (Véronique), Lucien Fugère (La basoche), Pierre Darmant and Yvonne Printemps (L'amour <b>masqué),</b> Koval (Passionnément), Marcelle Denya (Coups de roulis), and Maggie Teyte (Monsieur Beaucaire), {{as well as}} other contemporaries Aino Ackté, Emma Eames, and John McCormack whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Singers of the next generation who recorded Messager numbers included Georges Thill and Ninon Vallin.
