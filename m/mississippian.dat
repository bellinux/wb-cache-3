5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that after the}} collapse of the Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and <b>Mississippian</b> culture around 900 AD. The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD. Their settlements, like those of the Hopewell, were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds. Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River. The <b>Mississippian</b> mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell. The agrarian <b>Mississippian</b> culture was the first to grow maize in the region. The people also developed the bow and arrow and copper working during this time period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mississippian</b> {{society was}} complex, dense, and highly developed; the largest <b>Mississippian</b> city of Cahokia (in Illinois) {{contained}} {{as many as}} 30,000 inhabitants. They had a class society with certain groups specializing as artisans. The elite held related political and religious positions. Their cities were typically sited near rivers. Representing their cosmology, the central developments were dominated by a large central mound, several smaller mounds, and a large open plaza. Wooden palisades were built later around the complex, apparently for defensive purposes. The remains of a major settlement known as Angel Mounds lie east of present-day Evansville. <b>Mississippian</b> houses were generally square-shaped with plastered walls and thatched roofs. For reasons that remain unclear, the Mississippians disappeared {{in the middle of}} the 15thcentury, about 200years before the Europeans first entered what would become modern Indiana. <b>Mississippian</b> culture marked the high point of native development in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{indigenous peoples}} traveled through Oklahoma {{as early as}} the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita, Kichai, Teyas, Escanjaques, and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern Plains Villagers lived in the central and west of the state, with a subgroup, the Panhandle culture people living in panhandle region. Caddoan <b>Mississippian</b> culture peoples lived {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, was a major <b>Mississippian</b> mound complex that flourished between AD 850 and 1450.|$|E

5|$|Four major rock {{formations}} {{are present in}} Worlds End State Park, all at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The Loyalsock gorge rim and {{the upper part of}} its walls are the late <b>Mississippian</b> Mauch Chunk Formation, which is formed with grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Below this is the <b>Mississippian</b> Burgoon Formation, which comprises buff-colored sandstone and conglomerate. The creek bed and base of the gorge walls are the late Devonian and early <b>Mississippian</b> Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone.|$|E
5|$|From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians {{and later}} Archaic-Indians lived as {{communities}} of hunter-gatherers {{in the area}} that covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the <b>Mississippian</b> culture, a mound-building Native American people that had developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the <b>Mississippian</b> culture. They inhabited the region of modern-day Tipton County during the time of first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the <b>Mississippian</b> period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe. The exact origins of the Chickasaw are uncertain. Several prehistoric Indian settlements were located in the vicinity of what would later become Randolph.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{indigenous}} {{cultures in}} North America grew increasingly complex, and some, {{such as the}} pre-Columbian <b>Mississippian</b> culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. From approximately 800 to 1600 AD the <b>Mississippian</b> culture flourished, and its largest city Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, lasting {{until the end of}} the Revolutionary War.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee, United States, {{located on}} the banks of the Mississippi River. The lands of the Mississippi River Basin were {{inhabited}} by Paleo-Indians and later Native American tribes of the <b>Mississippian</b> culture for thousands of years. The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated the Mississippi River valley near Randolph during the <b>Mississippian</b> period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph. French explorer Cavelier de La Salle built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|Next below {{these is}} the <b>Mississippian</b> Burgoon Sandstone, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and {{conglomerate}} inclusions. Below this is the late Devonian and early <b>Mississippian</b> Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation, some 375million years old. This layer is relatively soft and easily eroded, which helped to form the Pine Creek Gorge. The source of Upper Pine Bottom Run is on Mauch Chunk rock, and the stream cuts deeper as it flows east to Pine Creek. In the park Upper Pine Bottom Run has cut through layers of Burgoon sandstone and Huntley Mountain rock, and downstream of the park to its mouth the deepest parts of the valleys are made of the Catskill Formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlements in}} the middle Mississippi Valley {{were built in the}} 10th century by the people of the <b>Mississippian</b> culture, who constructed more than two dozen platform mounds within the area of the future European-American city. These were related {{to the center of the}} culture at the very large complex of Cahokia Mounds, on the east side of the Mississippi River. The <b>Mississippian</b> culture ended for unknown reasons in the 14th century and these sites were empty for some time. Siouan-speaking groups such as the Missouria and the Osage migrated from the eastern Ohio Valley to the Missouri Valley. They lived in villages along the Missouri and Osage rivers. Both groups competed with northeastern tribes such as the Sauk and the Meskwaki, and all four groups confronted the earliest European explorers of the middle Mississippi Valley.|$|E

5000|$|The Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a Ku Klux Klan {{splinter}} group, {{was founded}} {{and led by}} Samuel Bowers of Laurel, Mississippi. As the summer of 1964 approached, white <b>Mississippians</b> prepared for what they perceived was an invasion from the north. College students had been recruited in order to aid local activists who were conducting grassroots community organizing, voter registration education and drives in the state. Media reports exaggerated the number of youths expected. One Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) representative {{is quoted as saying}} that nearly 30,000 individuals would visit Mississippi during the summer. Such reports had a [...] "jarring impact" [...] on white <b>Mississippians</b> and many responded by joining the White Knights.

5|$|The main rock {{formations}} {{in the area}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. These formations are all primarily made of sandstone, but also contain conglomerate, shale, and siltstone. They were formed during the Devonian, <b>Mississippian</b> and Devonian, and the <b>Mississippian,</b> respectively. The Catskill Formation is mostly found in the lower and middle reaches of the watershed, along the creek and its tributaries. The Huntley Mountain Formation is found in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed and on some of the streams in that part of the watershed. The Burgoon Sandstone is found in the watershed, but not on many of its streams.|$|E
5|$|The soils in {{the lower}} part of the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are highly acidic, deep, and well-drained. A total of 22 percent of the surface rock in this area is interbedded sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning coal seam is found in the Kettle Creek watershed. Rock formations in the Kettle Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the <b>Mississippian</b> epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the <b>Mississippian</b> epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny Group is the only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} major rock {{formations}} from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods {{are present in}} Quehanna Wild Area. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points on the plateau, is the Pennsylvanian Allegheny Formation, which has clay, coal, limestone, sandstone, and shale. Below this is the Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal, and which forms much of the Quehanna plateau. The next formations {{are found in the}} valleys and gorges which the creeks have eroded over time. The first of these is the <b>Mississippian</b> Pocono Formation, which is buff colored with shale, coal, and conglomerate inclusions; parts of this formation are also known as the Burgoon Sandstone. Below this is the late Devonian and early <b>Mississippian</b> Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. The lowest and oldest layer is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation.|$|E

5|$|Before 1600, a major {{war broke}} out in eastern North America among Native Americans; it was later called the Beaver Wars. Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors. The Iroquois were opposed by a {{confederation}} of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee, Miami, Wea, Pottawatomie, and the Illinois. These tribes were significantly less advanced than the <b>Mississippian</b> culture that had preceded them. The tribes were semi-nomadic, used stone tools rather than copper, and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their <b>Mississippian</b> predecessors. The war continued with sporadic fighting {{for at least a}} century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans. They achieved this goal for several decades. During the war, the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west. They kept control of the area for hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|The main rock {{formations}} in {{and near the}} watershed of Nanticoke Creek include the Mauch Chunk Formation (which dates to Late <b>Mississippian</b> and Early Pennsylvanian times), the Pottsville Group (from Pennsylvanian times), and the Llewellyn Formation (also from Pennsylvanian times).
