25|$|Ridge regression, {{and other}} forms of penalized {{estimation}} such as Lasso regression, deliberately introduce bias into the estimation of β {{in order to reduce the}} variability of the estimate. The resulting estimators generally have lower mean squared error than the OLS estimates, particularly when <b>multicollinearity</b> is present or when overfitting is a problem. They are generally used when the goal is to predict the value of the response variable y for values of the predictors x that have not yet been observed. These methods are not as commonly used when the goal is inference, since it is difficult to account for the bias.|$|E

5000|$|Leave {{the model}} as is, despite <b>multicollinearity.</b> The {{presence}} of <b>multicollinearity</b> doesn't affect {{the efficiency of}} extrapolating the fitted model to new data provided that the predictor variables follow {{the same pattern of}} <b>multicollinearity</b> in the new data as in the data on which the regression model is based.|$|E

50|$|<b>Multicollinearity</b> may {{represent}} a serious issue in survival analysis. The problem is that time-varying covariates may change their value over the time line of the study. A special procedure is recommended {{to assess the impact}} of <b>multicollinearity</b> on the results.|$|E
50|$|So {{long as the}} {{underlying}} specification is correct, <b>multicollinearity</b> does not actually bias results; it just produces large standard errors in the related independent variables. More importantly, the usual use of regression is to take coefficients from the model and then apply them to other data. Since <b>multicollinearity</b> causes imprecise estimates of coefficient values, the resulting out-of-sample predictions will also be imprecise. And if the pattern of <b>multicollinearity</b> in the new data differs from that in the data that was fitted, such extrapolation may introduce large errors in the predictions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Multicollinearity</b> (as {{long as it}} is not [...] "perfect") can {{be present}} {{resulting}} in a less efficient, but still unbiased estimate.

Correlation values (off-diagonal elements) of at least 0.4 are sometimes interpreted as indicating a <b>multicollinearity</b> problem. This procedure is, however, highly problematic and cannot be recommended. Intuitively, correlation describes a bivariate relationship, whereas collinearity is a multivariate phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|Many {{research}} areas see increasingly {{large numbers}} of variables in only few samples. The low sample to variable ratio creates problems known as <b>multicollinearity</b> and singularity. Because of this, most traditional multivariate statistical methods cannot be applied.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} lateral {{collinearity}} expands {{on the traditional}} view of <b>multicollinearity,</b> comprising also collinearity between explanatory and criteria (i.e., explained) variables, {{in the sense that}} they may be measuring almost the same thing as each other.|$|E
5000|$|In case {{of perfect}} <b>multicollinearity</b> the design matrix [...] {{has less than}} full rank, and {{therefore}} the moment matrix [...] cannot be inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model , the ordinary least-squares estimator [...] does not exist.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that using the Shapley value, a game theory tool, the model {{could account for the}} effects of <b>multicollinearity.</b> The Shapley value assigns a value for each predictor and assesses all possible combinations of importance.|$|E
5000|$|Note that in {{statements}} of the assumptions underlying regression analyses such as ordinary least squares, the phrase [...] "no multicollinearity" [...] is sometimes used to mean the absence of perfect <b>multicollinearity,</b> which is an exact (non-stochastic) linear relation among the regressors.|$|E
5000|$|If a multivariable {{regression}} {{finds an}} insignificant coefficient {{of a particular}} explanator, yet a simple linear regression of the explained variable on this explanatory variable shows its coefficient to be significantly different from zero, this situation indicates <b>multicollinearity</b> in the multivariable regression.|$|E

50|$|In statistics, the {{variance}} inflation factor (VIF) quantifies the severity of <b>multicollinearity</b> in an ordinary least squares regression analysis.

5000|$|A {{violation}} of this assumption is perfect <b>multicollinearity,</b> i.e. some explanatory variables are linearly dependent.

50|$|In statistics, <b>multicollinearity</b> (also collinearity) is a {{phenomenon}} in which two or more predictor variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. <b>Multicollinearity</b> does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least within the sample data set; it only affects calculations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, {{but it may not}} give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} a formal detection-tolerance or the {{variance inflation factor}} (VIF) for multicollinearity:where [...] is the coefficient of determination of a regression of explanator j on all the other explanators. A tolerance of less than 0.20 or 0.10 and/or a VIF of 5 or 10 and above indicates a <b>multicollinearity</b> problem.|$|E
5000|$|One {{consequence}} of {{a high degree of}} <b>multicollinearity</b> is that, even if the matrix [...] is invertible, a computer algorithm may be unsuccessful in obtaining an approximate inverse, and if it does obtain one it may be numerically inaccurate.
