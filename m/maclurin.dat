30|$|Natural {{flavonoid}} compounds {{were detected}} in sample P. 9, containing {{as the main}} components 3, 4 -dihyxroxybenzoic acid, morin and <b>maclurin,</b> molecular markers of old fustic, and traces of rhamnetin and emodin, molecular markers of buckthorn berries. Interestingly, the jar containing the powdered samples was labelled as “Stil de grain Brun employable surfin”, which is usually obtained by treating unripe buckthorn berries [40]. Thus, a mixture of different natural sources can be hypothesised {{for the production of}} this material.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical procedure based on GC-MS to identify in textiles {{the most common}} flavonoid yellow dyes used in Europe since ancient times, extracted from weld, young fustic, dyer's broom, sawwort and the berries of some species of Rhamnus. Later on, old fustic and quercitron bark were introduced as sources of yellow colours. The method {{is based on the}} solvent extraction of flavonoids from raw plant materials (weld, dyer's broom and old fustic), aged and not aged alum-mordanted wool dyed specimens; subsequently, flavonoids are derivatised with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide and analysed by GC-MS. The method easily allows the identification of a dyestuff by the detection of the molecular markers apigenin, luteolin, genistein, morin, <b>maclurin,</b> together with 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, 2, 4, 6 - trihydroxybenzoic acid, which survive in aged textiles. Two photo-oxidative degradation pathways for colour fading, one involving the mordant metallic ion and the other the light as a catalyst, are suggeste...|$|E
40|$|Consumers are {{increasingly}} demanding natural food ingredients {{that are expected}} to be safe and healthy. Processing of mango fruits generates a significant amount of by-products such as peels and seeds which represent up to 60 % of the fruit. Mango by-products are an important source of bioactive phenolic compounds. Phenolic characterization is an essential step for the utilization of mango by-products as food ingredients, and so provides an added value to mango production in Spain. In this regard, the use of high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) with negative ion detection has shown to be a powerful technique for the characterization of phenolic compounds of peel and seed extracts of three mango varieties (Keitt, Sensation and Gomera 3) produced in Spain, obtained by different microwave-assisted extraction conditions. Thus, in the present work, thirty compounds were identified that belong to five phenolic families: gallates and gallotannins; flavonoids mainly quercetin derivatives; ellagic acid and derivatives; xanthones principally mangiferin; benzophenones and derivatives such as <b>maclurin</b> derivatives. The contribution of each of these groups depends on the mango variety, the part of fruit studied (peel or seed) and the extraction conditions used. PCA analysis suggested that the extraction method had a greater influence on the phenolic content than variety or the mango by-product analyzed. These results highlight the importance of mango by-products as a source of natural bioactive phenolic compounds. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study aims {{to unveil}} the {{cosmeceutical}} traits of Jania rubens by highlighting its mineral composition, antioxidant potential, and presence of bioactive molecules using non-targeted metabolite profiling. This {{study showed that}} among minerals, (macro), Ca (14790. 33 + 1. 46 mg/ 100 g dry weight (DW)) and in (micro) Fe (84. 93 + 0. 89 mg/ 100 g DW) was the highest. A total of 23 putative metabolites in the +ESI (Electrospray Ionization) mode of LCMS-TOF (Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry-Time of Flight) were detected. Two anthocyanins—malonylshisonin and 4 ′′′-demalonylsalvianin (m/z 825. 19; anti-aging, antioxidant, anticancer properties) were detected. Two flavonoids, viz, medicocarpin and agecorynin C, 4 ′-O-methylglucoliquiritigenin—a flavonoid- 7 -O-glycoside, and 5, 6, 7, 8, 3 ′, 4 ′, 5 ′-heptamethoxyflavone, a polymethoxygenated flavone (m/z 415. 15), were detected. <b>Maclurin</b> 3 -C-(2 ″, 3 ″, 6 ″-trigalloylglucoside) (m/z 863. 15) (antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer traits) and theaflavonin (m/z 919. 18), belonging to the class of theaflavins (whitening and anti-wrinkle agent), were obtained. Pharmacologically active metabolites like berberrubin (m/z 305. 1; antitumor activity), icaceine (m/z 358. 24; anticonvulsant properties), agnuside (m/z 449. 15; constituent for treatment of premenstrual syndrome), γ-coniceine (m/z 108. 12; formulations to treat breast cancer), eremopetasitenin B 2, and eremosulphoxinolide A (m/z 447. 18; therapeutic effect of allergy and asthma) were observed. 6 -O-Methylarmillaridin (m/z 445. 18) (antimicrobial and antifungal) and simmondsin 2 -ferulate, (m/z 534. 21) (insecticidal, antifungal and antifeedant) were detected. Aromatic lignans, viz, 8 -Acetoxy- 4 ′-methoxypinoresinol, sesartemin, and cubebinone (m/z 413. 16), {{in addition to an}} aromatic terpene glycoside, tsangane L 3 glucoside (m/z 357. 23), were detected. Zizybeoside I, benzyl gentiobioside, and trichocarposide were also detected. The determination of antioxidant potential was performed through assays such as like DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl), FRAP (Ferric Ion Reducing Antioxidant Power), ABTS (2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenz-thiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid)), and total antioxidants. Therefore, this study progresses the probability for the inclusion of J. rubens as an ingredient in modern day cosmetic formulations...|$|E
