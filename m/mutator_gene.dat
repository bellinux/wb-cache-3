The mutS 1 gene was cotransduced with argB at a frequency of 2. 4 %; the gene order in this region of the chromosome is thy argB mutS 1. To determine whether a relationship commonly exists between azaserine resistance and the mutator property, 12 additional azaserine-resistant derivatives of B/UV were developed and tested for the mutator phenotype.

Increased bacterial genome size (or gene number) appears to rely on increased genomic GC content; however, it is unclear whether the changes are directly related to certain environmental pressures. Certain environmental and bacteriological features are related to GC content variation, but their trends are more obvious when analyzed under the dnaE-based grouping scheme. Most terrestrial, plant-associated, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are members of the dnaE 1 |dnaE 2 group, whereas most pathogenic or symbiotic bacteria in insects, and those dwelling in aquatic environments, are largely members of the dnaE 1 |polV group. Conclusion Our studies provide several lines of evidence indicating that DNA polymerase III α subunit and its isoforms participating in either replication (such as polC) or SOS mutagenesis/translesion synthesis (such as d naE 2), play dominant roles in determining GC variability. Other environmental or bacteriological factors, such as genome size, temperature, oxygen requirement, and habitat, either play subsidiary roles or rely indirectly on different <b>mutator</b> <b>genes</b> to fine-tune the GC content.

The frequency of reversion of trpA 46 on an F episome was increased by mutU 4 on the chromosome. The <b>mutator</b> <b>gene</b> did not increase mutation frequencies in virulent phages or in lytically grown phage λ. The mutU 4 mutation predominantly induced transitional base changes.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found high {{frequencies}} of bacteria with increased genomic rates of mutation in both clinical and laboratory populations. These observations may seem surprising in light of earlier experimental and theoretical studies. <b>Mutator</b> <b>genes</b> (genes that elevate the genomic mutation rate) are likely to induce deleterious mutations and thus suffer an indirect selective disadvantage; at the same time, bacteria carrying them can increase in frequency only by generating beneficial mutations at other loci. When clones carrying <b>mutator</b> <b>genes</b> are rare, however, these beneficial mutations {{are far more likely}} to arise in members of the much larger nonmutator population. How then can mutators become prevalent? To address this question, we develop a model of the population dynamics of bacteria confronted with everchanging environments. Using analytical and simulation procedures, we explore the process by which initially rare mutator alleles can rise in frequency. We demonstrate that subsequent to a shift in environmental conditions, there will be relatively long periods of time during which the mutator subpopulation can produce a beneficial mutation before the ancestral subpopulations are eliminated. If the beneficial mutation arises early enough, the overall frequency of mutators will climb to a point higher than when the process began. The probability of producing a subsequent beneficial mutation will then also increase. In this manner, mutators can increase in frequency over successive selective sweeps. We discuss the implications and predictions of these theoretical results in relation to antibiotic resistance and the evolution of mutation rates. ...|$|R

40|$|Resistance to adenine analogs such as 2, 6 -diaminopurine {{occurs at}} a rate of {{approximately}} 10 (- 3) per cell per generation in mouse L cells.

Transformation of L cell mutants with Chinese hamster ovary cell DNA results in transformants with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity characteristic of Chinese hamster ovary cells. No activation of the mouse gene occurs on hybridization with human fibroblasts. That this high frequency event is the result of mutation rather than an epigenetic event is supported by antigenic and reversion studies of the 2, 6 -diaminopurine-resistant clones.

In minimal medium, the mutD 5 -induced mutation frequencies are still 50 to 100 times above co-isogenic wild-type (mut+) levels. Similar results were obtained with all markers tested. Mutant frequencies can be raised by thymidine in the medium at concentrations as low as 0. 04 μM, or by the endogenous generation of thymidine from thymine plus a deoxyribosyl donor.

In addition, eight mutator strains derived from E. coli B/UV are still unmapped. Some effort was made to deduce the mode of action of the <b>mutator</b> <b>genes.</b> These isolates have been examined for possible defects in deoxyribonucleic acid repair mechanisms (dark repair of ultraviolet damage, host-cell reactivation, recombination ability, repair of mitomycin C damage).

PurA+ transductants that receive mut from NTG 119 or NTG 35 are all more sensitive to mitomycin C than is the PurA recipient. Unless transduction selects for sensitivity, a probable interpretation is that defective repair of mitomycin C-induced damage is related to the mode of action of mut in these transductants and the donor. Abnormal purine synthesis may be involved in the mutability of some strains with cotransduction of the mutator properly and purA (100 % cotransduction for NTG 119).

When the lacZ antisense RNA was expressed using these vectors, lacZ expression was successfully silenced by all the vectors, but the expression level of the antisense RNA and silencing efficacy differed depending on the used vectors.

40|$|Studies {{from many}} {{laboratories}} document that the MYC oncogene produces a pleiotropic transcription factor, Myc, which influences genes driven by all three RNA polymerases to orchestrate nutrient import with biomass accumulation for cell divi-sion. Myc {{has been shown}} to activate genes involved in glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and mitochondrial biogenesis to provide ATP and anabolic substrates for cell mass accumulation. Myc stimulates ribosome biogenesis and orchestrates the energetic demand for biomass accumulation through its regulation of glucose and glutamine import andmetabolism. When normal cells are deprived of nutrients, endogenous MYC expression diminishes and cells withdraw from the cell cycle. However, ectopic MYC-driven cancer cells are locked in a state of deregulated biomass accumulation, which renders them addicted to glucose and glutamine. This addictive state can be exploited for cancer therapy, because nutrient deprivation kills Myc-driven cells and inhibition of the Myc targets, lactate dehydrogenase A or glutaminase, diminishes tumor xenograft growth in vivo.

However, the pattern of hypermutation in these cell lines differed significantly. In one line (HCT 116), microsatellite mutations occurred at a remarkably high rate (approximately 10 (- 2) mutations per cell per generation), whereas this rate was considerably lower in the two other lines (DLD- 1 and HCT 15). The rate of mutation at the locus encoding hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase was substantially elevated (200 - to 600 -fold) in all three tumor cell lines, yet the types of mutations arising differed. A specific frame-shift hotspot accounted for 24 % of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mutations in HCT 116. The frequency of mutations at this site was reduced significantly in DLD- 1 and HCT 15 lines.
