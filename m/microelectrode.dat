5|$|Evidence from <b>microelectrode</b> {{recordings}} {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical {{properties}} of Na+-selective glass <b>microelectrodes</b> were studied and {{compared with those}} of K+-selective glass <b>microelectrodes.</b> The selectivity of Na+-selective glass <b>microelectrodes</b> depended on the ion concentration of test solutions. With aging, resistance of Na+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> increased and their selectivity for Na over K decreased. Na+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> potential measured in NaCl solution remained constant with aging, while the potential measured in KCl solution decreased and became more positive. The changes in resistance and potential of Na+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> {{may be due to the}} effects of the less mobile cation, i. e., H+ or K+ on the Na ion exchange in the Na-sensing region. The results indicate that Na+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> must be used as soon after filling as possible. The selectivity of Na+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> increased with increase of the sensitive exposed-tip length, whereas their response time became slow due to a large recessed volume, indicating requirement of an optimum exposed-tip length for intracellular applications. The changes in the {{properties of}} Na+-selective glass <b>microelectrodes</b> with aging contrasted with those of K+-selective glass <b>microelectrodes</b> in which resistance decreased and K+-selectivity increased. The K+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> required aging before use for a high selectivity and low resistance. The K+-selective <b>microelectrodes</b> with low resistance after sufficient aging can be used without insulation to measure K+ and Na+ activities in aqueous solutions.

25|$|In 1983, {{designer}} drug users took MPTP, which created a Parkinsonian syndrome. Later that same year, researchers reproduced the effect in non-human primates. Over {{the next seven}} years, the brain areas that were over- and under-active in Parkinson's were mapped out in normal and MPTP-treated macaque monkeys using metabolic labelling and <b>microelectrode</b> studies. In 1990, deep brain lesions were shown to treat Parkinsonian symptoms in macaque monkeys treated with MPTP, and these were followed by pallidotomy operations in humans with similar efficacy. By 1993, it was shown that deep brain stimulation could effect the same treatment without causing a permanent lesion of the same magnitude. Deep brain stimulation has largely replaced pallidotomy for treatment of Parkinson's patients that require neurosurgical intervention. Current estimates are that 20,000 Parkinson's patients have received this treatment.|$|E

The currents at conical-tip <b>microelectrodes</b> and finite conical <b>microelectrodes</b> both converge to that of a microdisk electrode at small cone heights and large cone angles, and to that of a cylindrical electrode portion of equal length and half the radius at large cone heights and small cone angles.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of metallic microstructures by electroforming is {{an important}} step within the LIGA process. In the electroforming step, small gaps as well as large structures on one substrate have to be filled with metal up to the same height. These gaps, electrochemically characterized as recessed <b>microelectrodes,</b> may have structural heights of up to several hundred micrometers and lateral dimensions down to only a few micrometers. Microstructured LIGA substrates consist of arrays of recessed <b>microelectrodes</b> with different lateral dimensions. Mass transport is of critical importance during electroforming of microstructured substrates, since different concentration profiles result in gaps of different lateral sizes. Consequently, the convective diffusion during the electroforming of recessed <b>microelectrodes</b> influences metal distribution and deposit properties. Therefore it is necessary to determine the influence of convective diffusion on electroforming of recessed <b>microelectrodes,</b> especially LIGA microstructures. Investigations were performed by electrochemical means with newly developed <b>microelectrodes.</b> The convective diffusive mass transport situation during the electroforming of recessed <b>microelectrodes</b> could be described satisfactorily.
