5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist <b>macroeconomic</b> inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based <b>macroeconomic</b> variables, {{and the creation of a}} two-sector system.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>macroeconomic</b> scale, Lars-Hendrik Röller and Leonard Waverman {{suggested}} a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth. Few dispute {{the existence of}} a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent recession highlighted limitations of existing <b>macroeconomic</b> theories, models, and econometrics. The popular press discussed post-Keynesian economics and Austrian economics, two heterodox traditions that have little influence on mainstream economics.|$|E
5|$|The contradiction here is {{that high}} <b>macroeconomic</b> {{stability}} {{in the form of}} ongoing historically low inflation over time leads to economic problems, creating higher interest rates and political and economic instability for the weaker partners.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{cause of}} Argentina’s historical backwardness {{appears to be}} its institutional framework. In <b>macroeconomic</b> terms, Argentina {{was one of the}} most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities by enhancing <b>macroeconomic</b> models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. In both of these cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of <b>macroeconomic</b> variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E
5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of <b>macroeconomic</b> variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects <b>macroeconomic</b> variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a <b>macroeconomic</b> solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|As the reconstituted Central Bank of Somalia fully assumes its {{monetary}} policy responsibilities, {{some of the}} existing money transfer companies are expected {{in the near future}} to seek licenses so as to develop into full-fledged commercial banks. This will serve to broaden the scope of the national payments system to include formal cheques, which in turn is expected to reinforce the effectiveness of the use of {{monetary policy}} in domestic <b>macroeconomic</b> management.|$|E
5|$|Favourable <b>macroeconomic</b> {{performance}} {{has been a}} necessary but not sufficient condition for the significant reduction of poverty amongst the Indian population. The rate of poverty decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991). The improvements in some other non-economic dimensions of social development have been even less favourable. The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson) {{attempted}} to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings {{in terms of}} formal mathematical models. In what had {{become known as the}} neoclassical synthesis, they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream <b>macroeconomic</b> thought for the next 40 years.|$|E
5|$|The CBO in June 2015 {{forecasted}} that {{repeal of}} ACA {{would increase the}} deficit between $137 billion and $353 billion over the 2016–2025 period, depending {{on the impact of}} <b>macroeconomic</b> feedback effects. The CBO also forecasted that repeal of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2015, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for <b>macroeconomic</b> policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue <b>macroeconomic</b> policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{according}} to <b>macroeconomic</b> theory, a well-regulated fractional-reserve bank system also benefits {{the economy by}} providing regulators with powerful tools for influencing the money supply and interest rates. Many economists believe that these should be adjusted {{by the government to}} promote <b>macroeconomic</b> stability.|$|E
25|$|Interest is also {{alleged to}} cause <b>macroeconomic</b> instability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> risk: risks {{related to}} the {{aggregate}} economy the bank is operating in.|$|E
25|$|Inventories {{also play}} an {{important}} role in national accounts and the analysis of the business cycle. Some short-term <b>macroeconomic</b> fluctuations are attributed to the inventory cycle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> {{analysis}} also considers {{factors affecting}} the long-term level {{and growth of}} national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, technological change and labour force growth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> policy {{focuses on}} high level {{government}} decisions which affect overall national economies rather than lower level decisions concerning markets for particular goods and services.|$|E
25|$|Biggeri and Mehrotra {{have studied}} the <b>macroeconomic</b> factors that {{encourage}} child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour {{is a serious problem}} in all five, {{but it is not a}} new problem. <b>Macroeconomic</b> causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major <b>macroeconomic</b> factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.|$|E
25|$|The ASEAN+3 <b>Macroeconomic</b> and Research Office (AMRO) started {{operations}} in Singapore in May 2011. It performs a key regional surveillance {{function of the}} US$120billion Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) currency swap facility.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the <b>macroeconomic</b> data the Greek {{government}} {{reported to}} the European Union before entering the eurozone was shown to be probably fraudulent using Benford's law, albeit years after the country joined.|$|E
25|$|Doing Business {{does not}} measure {{all aspects of}} the {{business}} environment that matter to firm or investors, such as the <b>macroeconomic</b> conditions, or the level of employment, corruption, stability or poverty, in every country.|$|E
25|$|Economist Mark Blaug {{has criticized}} over-reliance on methodological individualism, arguing it would rule out all <b>macroeconomic</b> propositions that cannot {{be reduced to}} microeconomic ones, and hence reject almost the whole of {{received}} macroeconomics.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} gold can be {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} <b>macroeconomic</b> variables. Such variables include the price of oil, the use of quantitative easing, currency exchange rate movements and returns on equity markets.|$|E
25|$|Since the Treasury–Fed Accord of 1951, the Federal Reserve {{was freed}} from the {{constraints}} of fiscal influence and {{gave way to the}} development of modern monetary policy. According to John B. Taylor, this allowed the Federal Reserve to abandon discretionary <b>macroeconomic</b> policy by the US Federal government to set new goals that would better benefit the economy. Through systematic monetary policy free from fiscal concerns, structured <b>macroeconomic</b> policy helped usher in the Great Moderation. Also, the Federal Reserve’s change in communicating its monetary policy plans contributed to the Great Moderation. The increased transparency could result in more effective monetary policy.|$|E
25|$|Fisher's debt-deflation theory {{initially}} lacked mainstream influence {{because of}} the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented {{no more than a}} redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant <b>macroeconomic</b> effects.|$|E
25|$|Okonjo-Iweala served {{twice as}} Nigeria’s Finance Minister {{and also as}} Minister of Foreign Affairs. She was the first female to hold both positions. During her first term as Minister of Finance under President Obasanjo’s Administration, she spearheaded {{negotiations}} with the Paris Club of Creditors {{that led to the}} wiping out of US$30 billion of Nigeria’s debt, including the outright cancellation of US$18 billion. In 2003 she led efforts to improve Nigeria’s <b>macroeconomic</b> management including the implementation of an oil-price based fiscal rule where revenues accruing above a reference benchmark oil price were saved in a special account, “The Excess Crude Account” which helped to reduce <b>macroeconomic</b> volatility.|$|E
25|$|Investors using {{fundamental}} analysis analyze the <b>macroeconomic</b> situation, which includes international economic indicators, such as GDP growth rates, inflation, interest rates, productivity and energy prices. They would also analyze the yearly global gold supply versus demand.|$|E
25|$|The ASEAN+3 <b>Macroeconomic</b> Research Office (AMRO) {{will serve}} as the {{independent}} regional surveillance unit of the CMIM. The establishment of AMRO will ensure timely monitoring and analysis of the ASEAN+3 economies, which will in turn aid in the early detection of risks, swift implementation of remedial actions, and effective decision-making of the CMIM. In particular, the AMRO will, during peace time, conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and, on this basis, prepare quarterly consolidated reports on the <b>macroeconomic</b> assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries. On the other hand, the AMRO will, during crisis time, prepare recommendations on any swap request based on its <b>macroeconomic</b> analysis of the swap requesting member and monitor the use and impact of funds once any swap request is approved. AMRO was officially incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in Singapore on 20 April 2011 and its office is at the Monetary Authority of Singapore complex in Singapore. Governance of AMRO is being exercised by the Executive Committee (EC) and its operational direction by the Advisory Panel (AP). AMRO is currently headed by Dr Yoichi Nemoto of Japan, who is serving his second 2-year term until 26 May 2016.|$|E
25|$|Hedge funds using {{a global}} macro {{investing}} strategy take sizable positions in share, bond or currency markets {{in anticipation of}} global <b>macroeconomic</b> events in order to generate a risk-adjusted return. Global macro fund managers use <b>macroeconomic</b> ("big picture") analysis based on global market events and trends to identify opportunities for investment that would profit from anticipated price movements. While global macro strategies have {{a large amount of}} flexibility (due to their ability to use leverage to take large positions in diverse investments in multiple markets), the timing of the implementation of the strategies is important in order to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns. Global macro is often categorized as a directional investment strategy.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Salinas was {{succeeded by}} Ernesto Zedillo, {{followed}} by the Mexican peso crisis and a $50 billion IMF bailout. Major <b>macroeconomic</b> reforms were started by President Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% {{by the end of}} 1999.|$|E
25|$|Morocco {{has made}} major {{progress}} {{in recent years}} to increase economic growth and strengthen the economy's resilience to shocks. The gains reflect sound <b>macroeconomic</b> policies and sustained structural reforms, and are reflected in the gradual improvement in livingstandards and per capita income.|$|E
25|$|A {{long period}} of {{political}} instability has resulted in depressed economic activity, deteriorating social conditions, and increased <b>macroeconomic</b> imbalances. It takes longer on average to register a new business in Guinea-Bissau (233 days or about 33 weeks) {{than in any other}} country in the world except Suriname.|$|E
25|$|On a <b>macroeconomic</b> level {{public health}} {{policies}} should be adapted and developed towards more inclusive and diversified approaches regarding minorities such as LGBT, {{as this is}} proved to be beneficial {{to the health of}} the affected minorities, which in return lowers the cost for the overall public health system.|$|E
25|$|Keynesian {{economics}} has two successors. Post-Keynesian economics also {{concentrates on}} <b>macroeconomic</b> rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally {{associated with the}} University of Cambridge {{and the work of}} Joan Robinson.|$|E
