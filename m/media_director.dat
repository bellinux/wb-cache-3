5|$|Daniel Scavino, social <b>media</b> <b>director</b> for Trump's presidential {{campaign}} began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to {{general manager of}} the club after Trump's purchase. In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the Republican primaries.|$|E

[...] The kiss was shot in profile, locked lips clearly visible, rather than using the normal angle for same-sex kisses, in which the partner's head blocks the view of the actual contact.

[...] The episode won its time slot among young adult viewers during its showing in the November 1999 sweeps, even beating Monday Night Football.

On May 12, Tommy Hilfiger was announced as the main tour sponsor. During the time of the announcement, Spears was being featured in the company's [...] "AllStars" [...] campaign. On December 17, during the premiere of the music video of [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] on TRL, Spears called the show to announce March 2000 United States tour dates. The extension, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, was considered a prelude to her future world tour, Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. The leg's main sponsor was Got Milk?. <b>Media</b> <b>director</b> Peter Gardiner explained, [...] "Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk". Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began. The secondary sponsor was Polaroid and the corporation released the I-Zone as the tour's official camera. Spears used the I-Zone onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product. The show was divided into segments, separated by interlude, ending with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album and several covers. Some changes were made during the 2000 leg, with the covers replaced by songs from her second studio album, Oops!... I Did It Again. The tour received positive critical appreciation. During the tour, Spears was accused of lip synching, although she denied these claims. On April 20, 2000, the concert at Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu, Hawaii, was taped. It was slightly altered from its Crazy 2k incarnation and featured different costumes. On June 5, 2000, it was broadcast on Fox. The special was aired several times during the year. On November 21, 2000, JIVE Records released the Live and More! DVD, which included the Fox special. It was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA for shipping 300,000 units.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1999, WCW {{enhancement}} talent Lenny Lane persuaded Lodi to {{team with}} him as The West Hollywood Blondes, a gay Californian duo with pink trunks and flamboyant haircuts who were later revealed to be brothers. The name was {{a reference to the}} Hollywood Blonds, a popular tag team of the early 1990s consisting of Steve Austin and Brian Pillman. The Blondes were highly controversial, and their depiction of homosexuality was protested by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Entertainment <b>Media</b> <b>Director</b> Scott Seomin wrote in a letter sent to Turner Network Television president Brad Siegel, stating, [...] "The character of Lenny is presented with the intention to incite the crowd to the most base homophobic behavior." [...] Seomen later stated [...] "the audience's reaction [...] gives permission to viewers to do harm to gay people in a very literal way – it's appalling." [...] TNT quickly capitulated to the demands of GLAAD, removing Lenny and Lodi from the active roster for six months. It is rumored that the bad press caused by the incident was a determining factor in the firing of Eric Bischoff as vice president of WCW by Ted Turner.|$|E
