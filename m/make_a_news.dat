40|$|Audiences usually {{identify}} {{the history of}} television news broadcasts {{with the history of}} national television news. In Belgium, where television was simultaneously launched by a French-speaking and a Dutch-speaking broadcaster in 1953, things were more complicated. Each broadcaster developed a policy of its own and each had a different vision vis-A-vis the necessity of self-produced televised news. Whereas the Dutch-speaking NIR (currently: VRT) immediately set up a news broadcast of its own, the French-speaking INR (currently: RTBF) took over the television news of the French RTF broadcaster for three years (1953 - 1956). Both NIR and INR seem to have had a different view of the possibilities of this new medium, but in reality both were driven by the same need to meet the expectations of their audiences. In the French-speaking south of the country, those expectations were subjected to the attractive forces of French television. Striving for quality, the INR did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>news</b> broadcast of its own for three years.

He and Marge then ride the Viking ship ride together. Chief Wiggum arrives attempting to save Marge, but he is caught in the ride. Dwight jams the ride's gears by throwing in his own body to save Wiggum (referencing The Brave Little Toaster). He survives, fortunately, and returns to prison after being hospitalized and making a full recovery. Back at the prison, Marge finally visits Dwight, who gives her a flattened dandelion encased in a bar of soap he had carved for her with a message on the back intending to recruit her in helping him attempt another prison break. Marge does not agree to the escape attempt and Dwight, although saddened, says she can keep the token.|$|R

40|$|Want to help {{making the}} world a better place? Do it with HypOCycle! HypOCycle is a {{bachelor}} thesis that started in September 2007. The project is owned by Lars-Johan Hjertz and Erik Westerlund. HypOCycle is probably the only bike in the world that has a linear pedal movement. The movement comes from a new engine technique that hasn’t even been brought to the market yet. The motion is called hypocycloid, hence the name. In today’s engines {{there is a lot of}} problem because of a phenomenon called piston bank. This emerges when the piston’s linear motion is being transformed to a rotating motion trough the connecting rod that is going to drive the crankshaft around. When the connecting rod is creating a rotating motion it is creating side forces up in the cylinder. These forces are creating friction and wear on the piston and the cylinder. Today’s engines have an efficiency loss in total of 70 %. 30 % is lost in the cylinder. Solving this problem could result in a heavy increasing of the efficiency. The group has under this project solved this problem with a hypOCycloid motion. After presenting the idea to ALMI the group received a scholarship that was used to have AWA patent <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>news</b> search for us. Caroline Isaksson at AWA patent found similar patents concerning the hypocycloid. Fortunately the patent concerns only one cylinder. Test has been made on these models and they show that the fuel consumption has decreased with 50 %. The group had ideas concerning several cylinders. After discussing these ideas with Wärtsilä among others the group realized that these kinds of project would cost too much and be too advanced to proceed with at this stage without a company backing us up. The group took the decision to continue developing this motion and illustrate it on a bicycle. The bike has at linear pedal motion and therefore the pedals can be resembled as pistons. HypOCycle is now the only bike of its kind and we are very proud of our result...|$|E
