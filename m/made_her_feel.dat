5|$|Manning {{told the}} court that, during her {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed a friendship with someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, {{four hundred}} yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time. On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street. Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On {{the day of the}} disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew {{and so he did}} not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> more lonely and isolated.|$|E
60|$|An {{unconscious}} look of assent in Bathsheba's eyes betrayed {{that something}} more than his coldness had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> also <b>feel</b> that Liddy would be superfluous in the suggested scene. She had felt it, even whilst making the proposal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he's {{not exactly}} young," [...] {{answered}} Mary, with a peculiar expression that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> questioner <b>feel</b> still more uncomfortable, [...] "yet he is scarcely middle-aged, {{but he certainly}} is the most splendid fellow on the frontier; and he saved my life once." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with the same {{steadiness}} which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> eyes <b>feel</b> heavy upon him, and made him shrink. She wanted his strength of nerve to support her, and he submitted at once, his one aim being to give her out of himself whatever she wanted.|$|R
5|$|The odd {{relationship}} between Stratus and James continued into 2006, {{with the two}} Divas competing {{against each other in}} a title match at New Year's Revolution, where Stratus emerged victorious. Despite the defeat, James continued to be enamored of Stratus which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable, and on March 6, Stratus confronted James, telling her that she needed space. The duo briefly reconciled on the March 18 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event, teaming together to defeat Candice Michelle and Victoria; however, after the match, James turned on Stratus and attacked her. A match at WrestleMania 22 saw Stratus lose the Women's Championship to James, ending her 448-day reign. The match, at the time, was widely {{recognized as one of the}} best women's matches in the company. During a rematch at Backlash, Stratus suffered a legitimate dislocated shoulder after taking a bump to the outside of the ring. While she was rehabilitating for six weeks, she continued to appear on-screen.|$|E
25|$|Growing up she famously {{said she}} never fit into the {{religious}} and conservative views of Nigeria. Living in rural Nigeria made her unaware of her medical condition known as Gender dysphoria. She said the constant feeling of wanting to present herself as a female <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> lost, {{as if there was}} something inhumanly wrong with her.|$|E
25|$|The {{theme of}} stars re-emerged when Jason and Sam went star gazing after their wedding {{reception}} on September 28, 2011. Later, after Franco's {{attack on the}} couple during their honeymoon, Jason held Sam as they gazed at the stars because they <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> safe. Jason and Sam star-gazed several times throughout the year. Stars emerged again on February 8, 2012, after Sam and Jason learned {{that they were going}} to be parents. Jason took Sam back to the honeymoon cabin he had built for them and they stargazed. They also promised each other that they would teach their child all about the constellations.|$|E
60|$|Lady Worsley was a handsome, {{commanding}} old dame, who soon <b>made</b> <b>her</b> charge <b>feel</b> {{the social}} gulf between a county magnate and a clergyman's niece. She decidedly thought that Mistress Anne Jacobina held her head {{too high for}} her position, and was, moreover, conceited of an unfortunate amount of good looks.|$|R
6000|$|Desperately {{she opened}} the door, {{clasping}} {{her hands on the}} place whence her heart had slipped down to her bare feet. But she knew it was he before she heard him whisper: [...] "Nedda!" [...] and, clutching him by the sleeve, she drew him in and closed the door. He was wet through, dripping; so wet that the mere brushing against him <b>made</b> <b>her</b> skin <b>feel</b> moist through its thin coverings.|$|R
5000|$|After that, {{her mother}} died, and Stu and Tommy (Janet's younger brother) {{moved in with}} her and Wade, after he sold their old house. She <b>made</b> <b>her</b> family <b>feel</b> welcomed and loved. For ten years, Janet and Wade were very happy. (they helped bring humor and {{stability}} to the show, thanks to the talented Millee Taggart and John Cunningham who could play both drama scenes and comedy scenes with relative ease.) Her character is most frequently remembered as Janet Collins.|$|R
25|$|She {{became a}} fan of hip hop music {{at the age of}} 14 and {{improved}} her English by listening and rapping along to famous American rappers such as Eminem. At the age of 15, she started hanging out with lots of bad guys, which made her parents worry about her and therefore always keep an eye on her. The reason she chose music to be her career is that it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> safe. She was also interested in skateboarding, and accepted the invitation to join a nu-metal band covering Linkin Park’s songs. She then quickly became a well-recognized and respected rapper from the Vietnamese underground scene.|$|E
25|$|Baker, the character's recast, {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} taking over a prominent character. She said she had studied scenes of Havins as Babe, {{and that she was}} focused on her portrayal as the character. Before landing the role, Baker was screen tested with actors who often interact with the character (Jacob Young, who portrays JR Chandler and Bobbie Eakes, portrayer of the character's mother, Krystal). A few days after her audition, she received a phone call informing her that she had won the part. Baker said that she was treated with a warm welcome {{from the rest of the}} cast and Havins herself, and that this has <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> at home while on set.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Suzanne Rogers was {{diagnosed}} with a rare muscle disorder called Myasthenia Gravis. This disease affected her facial muscles and the medication she needed <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> ill, with her face appearing swollen while also suffering hair loss. Rogers was forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse. Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to the show for a year. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, approached executive producer Betty Corday about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has myasthenia gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, Maggie began to notice some symptoms of the disease returning.|$|E
60|$|At her side, half {{hidden under}} the fold of blanket, lay a tiny bundle. Its human shape startled Shefford. Then {{he did not need}} to be told the tragedy. When he looked again at Glen Naspa's face he seemed to {{understand}} all that had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> older, to <b>feel</b> the pain that had lined and set her lips.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} {{somewhat}} bewildered, {{but she was}} carried along by this flood of exceeding joy and gladness. The Marmion and Theseus images had been dispelled by the reality, and, with Mr. Dutton's sharp reproof fresh upon her, she felt herself to have been doing a great injustice to her father; believed all that her mother did, and found herself {{the object of a}} romantic recognition--if not the beggar girl become a princess, at any rate, the little school-teacher a county lady! And she had never seen her mother so wildly, overpoweringly happy with joy. That <b>made</b> <b>her,</b> too, <b>feel</b> that something grand and glorious had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no modern accomplishments to earn {{a living}} by. Mine are all old-fashioned; and no one cares for such nowadays, except in servants. I may be very glad of them, though; for playing lady doesn't seem half so honest as going out to service, when one has nothing but an empty pair of hands," [...] she said with a wistful yet courageous look at the wintry world outside, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{companion}} <b>feel</b> a strong desire to counsel and protect this confiding young Columbus, who knew so little of the perils which would beset her voyage in search of a woman's El Dorado.|$|R
25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} sexual {{harassment}} can vary. In research {{carried out by the}} EU Agency for Fundamental Human Rights research, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29 %) who has experienced sexual harassment says that she felt fearful {{as a result of the}} most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Alexandra's death, Yakov {{remarried}} {{with the}} children's German governess. While they materially {{were brought up}} in comfort, the children had little emotional support from their step-mother. As a result, Parnokh felt {{that she had been}} forced to grow up too fast and did not have a childhood. In 1894, she entered the Mariinskaya Gymnasium and from this period, began writing profusely, producing around 50 poems which are representative of her juvenilia. Unlike her brother's teenage writings, Parnokh's works from the period do not reflect influences of the decadent or symbolist artists who were prolific at this time. Instead, her work explored her feelings, burgeoning lesbianism, and fantasies with a more psychological, than artistic purpose. Through her poetry, she became unperturbed by disapproval and seemed to accept her lesbianism as an innate trait that made her unique and different. In addition, she suffered from Graves' disease, which affected her looks and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> increasingly unusual, as did her intense identification with both Russia and her Jewishness—a position not shared by her father's indifference to his religion nor her brother's loathing of Russia and the antisemitism he faced.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Peedles, {{speaking}} without rising, {{from personal}} observation in the daytime--which she hoped {{would not be}} deemed a liberty; literature, even in manuscript, being, so to speak, public property--found herself {{in a position to}} confirm all that Mr. Jarman had remarked. Speaking as one not entirely without authority on the subject of literature and the drama, Mrs. Peedles could say that passages she had read had struck her as distinctly not half bad. Some of the love-scenes, in particular, had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> to <b>feel</b> quite a girl again. How he had acquired such knowledge was not for her to say. Cries of [...] "Naughty!" [...] from Jarman, and [...] "Oh, Mr. Kelver, I shall be quite afraid of you," [...] roguishly from Miss Sellars.|$|R
2500|$|The once {{cheerful and}} happy Du Kai Qi {{has grown up}} to be a cold, fierce and {{isolated}} person due to her harsh upbringing. Her father is a money asking, alcoholic and abusive person. Even though both of her parents have been separated for many years, her father still harasses and abuses her mother for money. With so many difficulties in her life, it has <b>made</b> <b>her</b> liked to be left alone. Kai Qi works as an assistant chef at [...] "Figaro Cuisine", a fancy French restaurant owned by her mother's former employer. At Figaro's, it brings her pleasant memories of her childhood when both she and her mother had their most delicious meal there. Knowing how happy that meal <b>made</b> <b>her</b> mother <b>feel,</b> it drives <b>her</b> to become an accomplished chef hoping to provide a better life for her and her mother. Already struggling financially, she is forced to take in her young nephew when his father abandons him to get remarried.|$|R
6000|$|Kenton was {{so unhappy}} {{that he could}} not wait for his wife to come to him in their own room; he broke in upon her and Ellen in the parlor, and at his coming the girl flitted out, in the {{noiseless}} fashion which of late had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> father <b>feel</b> something ghostlike in her. He was afraid she was growing to dislike him, and trying to avoid him, and now he presented himself quite humbly before his wife, as if he had done wrong in coming. He began with a sort of apology for interrupting, but his wife said it was all right, and she added, [...] "We were not talking about anything in particular." [...] She was silent, and then she added again: [...] "Sometimes I think Ellen hasn't very fine perceptions, after all. She doesn't seem to feel about people as I supposed she would." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{discussions with}} Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, Bernier {{resigned}} as Minister of Foreign Affairs, {{a day before}} the airing of Couillard's interview with TVA. Political commentators called the affair a {{threat to national security}} due to Bernier's carelessness and to Couillard's background with motorcycle biker gangs. [...] According to Couillard, Bernier's response to the subsequent media coverage <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> betrayed and abandoned.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Interview magazine, she revealed, while questioned about her kissing scene with Pitt, that kissing him had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable: [...] "I thought it was gross, that Brad had cooties. I mean, I was 10." [...] Her performance earned her the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, the Saturn Award for Best Young Actress, and her first Golden Globe Award nomination.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and a world tour, Beyoncé took a career hiatus in 2010 [...] "to live life [...] to be {{inspired}} by things again". During her hiatus, she [...] "killed" [...] Sasha Fierce, the alter-ego used in her previous studio album, as she felt she could now merge her two personalities. She severed professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, who had guided her career since the 1990s with Destiny's Child, noting that the decision <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> vulnerable.|$|E

60|$|The Miss Bertrams' {{admiration of}} Mr. Crawford was more rapturous than {{anything}} which Miss Crawford's habits <b>made</b> <b>her</b> likely to <b>feel.</b> She acknowledged, however, that the Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men, that two such {{young men were}} not often seen together even in London, and that their manners, particularly those of the eldest, were very good. He had been much in London, and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund, and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being the eldest was another strong claim. She had felt an early presentiment that she should like the eldest best. She knew it was her way.|$|R

While at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, she met Francis J. Underwood, a Harvard Law student from South Carolina. She is from a wealthy family, and the show characterizes her as a [...] "Dallas Debutante" [...] and [...] "Lily White". [...] She recounts her father's taking her to Dealey Plaza, where John F.

Eventually she returned to Utah, where she did research in the LDS Church Archives, gaining access to some highly restricted materials by claiming to be [...] "Brother McKay's daughter," [...] a subterfuge that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "guilty as hell."

50|$|The {{marriage}} was unhappy. Their son, Lennart, later wrote an autobiography {{in which he}} revealed several details of the Swedish royal family. The autobiography tells of how Maria, like her aunt and namesake the duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, felt that she had married beneath herself in marrying a younger son of the king of Sweden, and this caused problems of ego between the couple. Maria insisted that the servants address her by her correct style Your Imperial and Royal Highness, {{to the chagrin of}} her husband, who was merely a Royal Highness. When apprised of the matter, Wilhelm's father King Gustav V {{had no choice but to}} acquiesce with his daughter-in-law's wish, which was perfectly valid in law, and order that the imperial style be used invariably for Maria. Nor was this all. Maria also <b>made</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>feel</b> sexually inadequate. In later years, she would tell people that her husband was a homosexual, or at least sexually inadequate. The suggestion of homosexuality was probably a malicious falsehood because Wilhelm later had a lifelong relationship with another woman.|$|R
