[...] First Regional Symposium on Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, 27 – 30 November 2013, St. Julian’s, MaltaThe sandeel {{fishery in}} Catalonia targets two species, Gymnammodytes cicerelus and Gymnammodytes semisquamatus, which are small {{short-lived}} forage fish typically found in shallow sandy bottoms in the Mediterranean. The fishery {{is based on}} small-scale seines which operate on a daily trip basis, and landings are entirely aimed at direct human consumption. The Co-management Committee, created in April 2012 with the responsibility to manage the fishery, {{proved to be a}} watershed in the performance of the fishery. The Committee is composed by representatives of five main pillars: fishermen, Catalan authorities, Spanish central authorities, scientists and NGOs, all on equal footing with respect to decision-making regarding the rules and their implementation. A regular follow up of the fishing activity is being made by a Permanent Commission of the Committee which is meeting once a month. The functioning of the Co-management Committee and the permanent adaptation of the management and control measures has proven to be extremely successful. The first very encouraging and promising results can be summarized as follows: 1) a strong sense of ownership of the management process among all relevant stakeholders resulting in very high adherence to the rules; 2) profits for fishermen had multiplied per three in spite of fishing effort being reduced by half, basically due to the eradication of a previously existing black market and to the implementation of an individual daily quota; and 3) a positive social impact on the local communities through an increment of vessels¿ crew. The experience is also being highly instructive for all stakeholders as regards the relevance of bottom-up participative approaches in improving fisheries management. Moreover, the strong buy-in from the administrations involved crystalizes in their promotion of the replication of the model to other fisheries.
