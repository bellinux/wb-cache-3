The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects of massage on perceived <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> <b>pain,</b> inflammatory and immune markers, ROM, and mood state. Fourteen, recreationally active, women participated in a randomized crossover design study, consisting of 1) 60 min. full body massage following unaccustomed exercise and 2) 60 min. of rest. following unaccustomed exercise. Perceived <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> <b>pain,</b> active range of motion (ROM), mood state, along with blood concentrations of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), and neutrophil count (NC), was assessed at baseline, 4 hrs, and 24 hrs following both treatment and control conditions. The aims of this study were 1) to decrease the effects of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and increase time to recover, and 2) to investigate the effect of massage vs. passive rest on inflammatory and immune markers within the blood. We hypothesized 1) an increase in ROM, a decrease in perceived physical soreness and perceived physical pain, as a result of the massage, compared to control, and 2) a decrease in blood plasma inflammatory markers, CRP, NC, CK, and IL- 6, as a result of the massage, compared to control. We found massage following exercise to 1) significantly decreased perceived pain (p= 0. 001), 2) significantly increased immune iv markers (WBC (p= 0. 012) and NC (p= 0. 012)), and 3) significantly decreased ROM (p= 0. 02), compared to control.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>AND</b> OBJECTIVES: <b>Pain</b> {{symptoms}} are common among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans, {{many of whom}} continue to experience persistent pain symptoms despite multiple pharmacological interventions. Preclinical data suggest that neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone demonstrate pronounced analgesic properties, and thus represent logical biomarker candidates and therapeutic targets for pain. Allopregnanolone is also a positive GABAA receptor modulator with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and neuroprotective actions in rodent models. We previously reported inverse associations between serum allopregnanolone levels <b>and</b> self-reported <b>pain</b> symptom severity in a pilot study of 82 male veterans. METHODS: The current study investigates allopregnanolone levels in a larger cohort of 485 male Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans to attempt to replicate these initial findings. Pain symptoms were assessed by items from the Symptom Checklist- 90 -R (SCL- 90 -R) querying headache, chest <b>pain,</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> <b>and</b> low back <b>pain</b> over the past 7 days. Allopregnanolone levels were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Associations between <b>pain</b> ratings <b>and</b> allopregnanolone levels were examined with Poisson regression analyses, controlling for age and smoking. Bivariate nonparametric Mann–Whitney analyses examining allopregnanolone levels across high {{and low levels of}} pain were also conducted. Allopregnanolone levels were inversely associated with <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> [P = 0. 0028], chest pain [P = 0. 032], <b>and</b> aggregate total <b>pain</b> (sum of all four pain items) [P = 0. 0001]. In the bivariate analyses, allopregnanolone levels were lower in the group reporting high levels of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> [P = 0. 001]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are generally consistent with our prior pilot study and suggest that allopregnanolone may function as an endogenous analgesic. Thus, exogenous supplementation with allopregnanolone could have therapeutic potential. The characterization of neurosteroid profiles may also have biomarker utility...|$|R

The growing numbers of HIV- 1 infected individuals in the past thirty years have increasingly become a global concern. The virus has cost us more than 20 million lives since its identification in the early 1980 s. HIV compromises the health of the infected individuals by decreasing CD 4 + T helper lymphocytes, a crucial component of the immune system. The body implements cellular and humoral immune responses in an attempt to fight the infection. This chronic infection can persist for weeks, or even over a decade until the immune system is finally overcome. The condition can advance to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which manifests through life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers. This fatal disease has many routes of transmission: sexual, injection drug use, and mother-to-child. The clinical signs of HIV- 1 infection are often overlooked because it can be nonspecific such as, fever, <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> <b>and</b> joint <b>pain.</b> However, one area of common HIV- 1 manifestations is in the oral cavity. Oral mucosa is a natural habitat for many microorganisms. It can serve as a delicate expression of the body's immune status. For example, oral lesions and periodontal conditions are observed in patients with low CD 4 T-cell count, corresponding with the decrease in immune defense mechanism during HIV- 1 infection. Dentists can help in ameliorating the HIV- 1 /AIDS pandemic by using their expertise to identify oral signs of the deadly infection. This review aims to evaluate the effects of HIV- 1 infection on oral health and to then examine how dentists can {{play a crucial role in}} HIV- 1 testing and early diagnosis. Currently, 2. 7 million new HIV- 1 infections occur per year. High active antiretroviral therapy has improved many lives of those afflicted with this condition and will continue to do so. However, the key to ending this HIV- 11 AIDS pandemic is through education, early diagnosis and the cooperation between the general population and the health care providers...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{difference}} in the report of bodily pain experienced by patients who develop temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and by those who do not develop TMD over a 3 -year observation period. Methods: This is a 3 -year prospective study of 266 females aged 18 to 34 years initially free of TMD pain. All patients completed the Symptom Report Questionnaire (SRQ) at baseline and yearly intervals, and at the time they developed TMD (if applicable). The SRQ is a self-report instrument evaluating the extent <b>and</b> location of <b>pain</b> experienced in the earlier 6 months. Statistical analysis was carried out using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Over the 3 -year period, 16 patients developed TMD based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD.

Several interventional modalities have been studied without a conclusive evidence of efficacy. Objective: This study was carried out as part of a continuous attempt to find an effective and quick relief for DOMS. The study investigated the comparative effects of warm-up exercises and infrared radiation in ameliorating the symptoms associated with DOMS. Materials and Methods: Sixty volunteer subjects between the age of 16 years and 35 years had DOMS induced in the left biceps brachii muscle. They were randomized into three groups with 20 subjects in each group. The groups were allocated as follows: Group A as control that received no treatment, Group B had a bout of warm-up exercises consisting of 10 sets of maximal elbow flexion and extension after which DOMS was experimentally induced, and Group C had infrared radiation for 20 min  after which DOMS was experimentally induced. Assessment for <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> joint range of motion (ROM) was carried out immediately after inducing DOMS and it was repeated 24 h and 48 h later using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), deep palpation (DP), and goniometry, respectively. Results: The infrared group (Group C) had significantly lower scores on NPRS and DP throughout the 3 days compared with the control while the significant effects of warm-up exercises were seen from day 2. There was, however, no significant difference (P > 0. 05) in the range of movement (ROM) scores. Compared with warm-up exercises (Group B), infrared resulted in significantly lower NPRS and DP scores and greater ROM only on day 1. Conclusion: Infrared radiation (IRR) is effective in ameliorating the symptoms of DOMS immediately after treatment on day 1 while the effect of warm-up exercises is seen 24 h later. IRR, thus, has a better effect than warm-up exercises in ameliorating the symptoms associated with DOMS...|$|R

This study&# 39;s objectives were to examine numerical pain intensity ratings, from (0 to 10 cm on the visual analog scale [VAS]) across multiple severities of commonly experienced acute pain conditions {{to determine whether the}} ratings differed between these pain conditions and/or between individuals. Methods: A community sample (N= 365, 66 % female) rated their anticipated pain intensity (VAS) for threshold, mild, moderate, severe, and tolerance level, using several common pain conditions: headache, toothache, joint injury, delayed-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> burns, <b>and</b> “general <b>pain.</b> ” Results: Cluster analysis revealed three subgroups of individuals, suggesting three types of underlying pain rating schema: 1) Low Rating subgroup (low VAS pain intensity ratings across all the pain severity categories); 2) Low/High Rating subgroup (low VAS pain intensity rating for mild, but high VAS pain intensity rating for severe pain); and 3) High Rating subgroup (high VAS pain intensity ratings across all the pain severity categories). Overall, differences between pain conditions were small: <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> pain intensity was consistently rated lower than the other pain types across severities. The highest pain ratings varied between joint injury <b>and</b> general <b>pain,</b> depending on severity level. No effects of sex or current experience of pain were noted.

40|$|Introduction Runners often sustain lower {{extremity}} injuries (19 - 79 %) (van Gent et al, 2007). In a theoretical model {{it has been}} described that a disturbance in perceived stress and recovery can {{increase the risk of}} sustaining an injury (Williams & Andersen, 1998). Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate changes in perceived stress and recovery preceding an injury of competitive runners. Methods Twenty-four competitive runners were monitored over one full training season (46 weeks). Every week, the runners filled an on-line RESTQ-sport (Nederhof et al, 2008). Furthermore, runners and their coaches kept a log with injuries and physical complaints. A non-traumatic injury was defined as any pain, soreness or injury that was not caused by trauma and resulted from training and led to a decrease in training duration or training intensity for at least one week (Jacobsson et al, 2013). Because baseline levels of perception of stress and recovery vary largely between runners, the 19 scales of the RESTQ-Sport were normalized to Z-scores based on the runner’s individual average and standard deviation of the whole season (excl. injured periods). The normalized scores of 1, 2 and 3 weeks before the first sustained injury were compared to 0, which is the average normalized score, by repeated measures ANOVA’s. Results Twenty-two runners sustained a non-traumatic {{lower extremity}} injury. Eight of these runners filled out the RESTQ-Sport all 3 weeks preceding the injury and their data was used for further analysis. The injuries sustained were non-traumatic injuries of the knee, Achilles tendon, ankle, foot and shin. It was shown that 1 week preceding the injury, runners scored lower than the average normalized score on “Success” (Z-score: - 0. 68 ± 0. 62) and 2 weeks preceding the injury runners scored higher than their average on “Fitness/Injuries” (Z-score: 1. 04 ± 1. 12). Discussion A decrease in perceived success may be a marker to predict a non-traumatic lower extremity injury. Also an increase in the perception of <b>muscle</b> ache, <b>soreness,</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> vulnerability to injury (“Fitness/Injury”) preceded injuries. Thereby, monitoring changes in individual stress and recovery may help to prevent non-traumatic injuries...|$|R

Aim: The overall {{aim of this}} thesis was to increase understanding of naprapathic manual therapy and other factors of potential importance for the prognosis of back <b>and</b> neck <b>pain.</b> Specific aims: Study I: 1) to assess and compare the sex-specific recovery from spinal <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> psychological distress as single and comorbid conditions, 2) to describe the interrelationships between these conditions at baseline and at follow-up and 3) to explore whether spinal pain is {{a risk factor for}} onset of psychological distress and vice versa. Study II: to explore the role of the role of good sleep on the prognosis of non-specific neck and/or low back <b>pain.</b> Studies III <b>and</b> IV: to compare the occurrence and severity of adverse events (study III) and the treatment effect (study IV) of naprapathic manual therapy between different treatment technique combinations as part of naprapathic manual therapy. Methods: Study I: a cohort study based on The Stockholm Public Health Cohort including 23, 794 participants. A random sample of the population in Stockholm was approached with postal questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up five years later. Study II: a cohort study that was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial. Information was used from baseline and follow-up questionnaires at 12 and 52 weeks. Studies III and IV: a randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited among patients, ages 18 – 65 years, seeking care for neck and/or back pain. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three treatment arms: 1) naprapathic manual therapy (i. e. spinal manipulation, spinal mobilization, stretching and massage), 2) naprapathic manual therapy excluding spinal manipulation or 3) naprapathic manual therapy excluding stretching. Treatments were provided by students in the seventh semester of a total of eight. Results: Study I: comorbidity of spinal <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> psychological distress was twice as common among women as among men. Recovery was less likely with comorbidity than with single conditions of spinal pain or psychological distress. Overall, 24 % of women and 17 % of men with spinal pain without psychological distress at baseline had psychological distress at follow-up. The corresponding figures for spinal pain among participants with psychological distress without spinal pain at baseline were 24 % and 20 %. Spinal pain was a determinant of psychological distress and vice versa. Study II: patients with good sleep at baseline were more likely to experience a clinically important improvement in <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> pain-related disability compared to patients with impaired sleep at the 1 -year follow-up. Study III: adverse events after combined manual therapy were common and mostly mild and transient. The most common adverse events were <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> increased <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> stiffness. No differences were found between the treatment arms. Women more often had short and long moderate adverse events compared to men.

Isometric elbow extension strength, <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> circumference, and serum CK and TC concentrations were measured before, immediately after, and 2, 24 and 48 hours after the exercise. Results. Statistically reliable changes in isometric strength, serum CK <b>and</b> TC, <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> upper arm circumference occurred within the first 48 hours following eccentric exercise. Serum TC concentrations exhibited a very rapid (within 2 hours) reduction from pre-exercise values after eccentric exercise to a relatively stable concentration of approximately 85 % of baseline. Conclusion. These results suggest that serum TC concentration may follow the time-course of reductions in force generating capacity more closely than other biochemical markers of muscle damage...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the effect of Naproxen in attenuating the symptoms (<b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> level) <b>and</b> signs (plasma CK activity and muscular strength decrement) of delayed onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> (DOMS). Twenty subjects were randomly assigned Naproxen (500 mg BID) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design. Two testing phases, each 8 days in duration, were separated by a washout period of 7 days. Eccentric single-leg exercises were performed on Days 1, 3 and 4 to induce DOMS in the quadriceps muscles. Perception of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> plasma CK, <b>and</b> knee extensor torque were evaluated throughout each phase. Following the eccentric exercise, plasma CK levels were similarly elevated in both Naproxen and placebo conditions. After DOMS had developed, Naproxen reduced the perception of soreness on Day 3 when <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> was highest. Following treatments with Naproxen, peak quadriceps torque during leg extension at 60 $ sp circ$/s was higher compared to placebo, however at higher velocity (180 and 300 $ sp circ$/s) peak muscle torques were similar. The data indicate that therapeutic doses of Naproxen do not prevent CK release into the plasma but decreases the perception of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> positively influences quadriceps peak torque...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that vibration treatment reduces delayed-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> swelling and enhances recovery of muscle function after eccentric exercise. DESIGN: A randomized crossover design was used. Fifteen young men performed ten sets of six maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors with the right arm for one occasion and the left arm for the other occasion separated by 4 wks. One arm received a 30 -min vibration treatment at 30 mins after and 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after the exercise (treatment group), and the other arm did not receive any treatment (control group). The order of the treatment and control conditions and the use of the dominant and nondominant arms were counterbalanced among subjects. Changes in indirect markers of muscle damage were compared between arms by a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the treatment group showed significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) less development and faster reduction in delayed-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> at 2 to 5 days after exercise. The recovery of range of motion was significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) faster for the treatment than for the control group. However, no significant effects on the recovery of muscle strength and serum creatine kinase activity were evident. Immediately after the vibration treatment, a significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) decrease in the magnitude of delayed-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> strength and an increase in pressure <b>pain</b> threshold <b>and</b> range of motion were found. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that the vibration treatment was effective for attenuation of delayed-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> recovery of range of motion after strenuous eccentric exercise but did not affect swelling, recovery of muscle strength, and serum creatine kinase activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of a 4 -week plyometric {{training}} on two different surfaces, sand <b>and</b> grass on <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> selected sport-specific performance variables in national level hockey players. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups- grass training group (N= 20) and sand training group (N= 20). After the baseline measurements of strength, endurance, balance, and agility, plyometric training was given for 4 -weeks,three sessions per week. <b>Muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> was assessed at the end of each training session on a 7 -point likert scale. Post-readings of strength, endurance, balance and agility were taken after the 4 -week training programme. Data when compared after plyometric training revealed no significant changes between two groups (p> 0. 05), however players in the sand group experienced less <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> (p< 0. 05) than grass group. There was significant improvement (p< 0. 05) seen in the tested variables in both groups after the training but no significant interaction was found between the two surfaces after the training. These findings suggest that short-term plyometric training on sand/non-rigid surface induces similar improvements in strength, endurance, balance and agility as on firm surface but induces significantly less <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness.</b> Hence, plyometric training on sand is viable option for coaches to enhance performance in athletes, while reducing risk of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> damage...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a warm-up exercise consisting of 100 submaximal concentric contractions would attenuate delayed-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> (DOMS) <b>and</b> decreases in muscle strength associated with eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Ten male students performed two bouts of the elbow flexor exercise consisting of 12 maximal eccentric contractions with a warm-up exercise for one arm (WU) and without warm-up {{for the other}} arm (control: CON) in a randomised, counterbalanced order separated by 4 weeks. Muscle temperature of the biceps brachii prior to the exercise was compared between the arms, and muscle activity of the biceps brachii during the exercise was assessed by surface integral electromyogram (iEMG). Changes in visual analog scale for <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (MVC) of the elbow flexors were assessed before, immediately after, and every 24 hours for 5 days following exercise, and compared between the WU and CON conditions by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. The pre-exercise biceps brachii muscle temperature was significantly (p < 0. 01) higher for the WU (35. 8 ± 0. 2 ℃) than CON condition (34. 4 ± 0. 2 ℃), but {{no significant differences in}} iEMG and torque produced during exercise were evident between conditions. Changes in <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> MVC were not significantly different between conditions, although these variables showed significant (p< 0. 05) changes over time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to examine the levels of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> <b>muscle</b> damage, <b>and</b> performance output in men with (S, n = 24) or without (A, n = 24) chronic compartment syndrome (CACS) -related symptoms after an intense 10 -minute basketball-simulated exercise. Anterior compartment pressure (ICP), <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> perception, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, myoglobin (Mb) concentration, leg strength, and knee joint range of motion (KJRM) were measured at rest, immediately after exercise, and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-exercise (ICP was also measured at 5, 15, and 30 minutes post-exercise). ICP, <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> CK, LDH, <b>and</b> myoglobin increased (p < 0. 05) immediately postexercise and during the next 4 days of recovery in both groups. However, S demonstrated a far more pronounced and prolonged (p < 0. 05) response than A. Leg strength and KJRM declined (p < 0. 05) in both groups, but S demonstrated a greater (p < 0. 05) performance deterioration than A. The {{results of this study suggest}} that intense basketball-simulated exercise increases ICP, <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> <b>and</b> indices of <b>muscle</b> damage with a concomitant decrease of performance. Men with CACS-related symptoms and/or history appear more sensitive to <b>muscle</b> damage <b>and</b> <b>soreness</b> than asymptomatic men, probably due to a compromised blood flow to the muscle producing fluid shifts from vascular to interstitial space and further increasing compartment pressure and muscle cell disruption. Results of the present investigation provide evidence to support proper diagnosis, monitoring, care, and preventive measures for symptomatic individuals prior to participation in activities such as basketball...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relative efficacy of postgame recovery modalities on jump height performance and subjective ratings of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> damage at 1, 18, and 42 hours after professional rugby league competition games. Twenty-one professional rugby league players performed 3 different postmatch recovery modalities: cold water immersion (CWI), contrast water therapy (CWT), and active recovery (ACT). The effects of the recovery treatments were analyzed with mixed modeling including a covariate (fatigue score) to adjust {{for changes in the}} intensity of each match on the postmatch values of the dependent variables of interest. Standardization of effects was used to make magnitude- based inferences, presented as mean with ± 90 % confidence limits. Cold water immersion and CWT clearly recovered jump height performance (CWI 2. 3 ± 3. 7 %; CWT 3. 5 ± 4. 1 %), reduced <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> (CWI 20. 95 ± 0. 37; CWT 20. 55 ± 0. 37), and decreased creatine kinase (CWI 211. 0 ± 15. 1 %; CWT 18. 2 ± 20. 1 %) by 42 hours postgame compared with ACT. Contrast water therapy was however clearly more effective compared with CWI on the recovery of <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> <b>and</b> creatine kinase by 42 hours postgame.

Ten males who had pitching experience participated in the study. After an 18 -day training period, subjects pitched three simulated games. Game A and Game B were separated by four days of rest, while Game B and Game C were separated by two days of rest. CK, LDH, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> were evaluated at the following times: before and immediately after exercise, and six, 24, 48, and 72 hours after exercise. Muscle performance was evaluated by measuring pitch velocity during the games. The CK level was elevated after each game (Game A - 249 U/l; Game B - 243 U/l; and Game C - 240 U/l); then it dropped toward baseline (p≤ 0. 01). CK post-exercise values were not different among games A, B, and C. LDH displayed a response similar to CK; however, there was a reduction over the span of the games (p≤ 0. 05). <b>Muscle</b> <b>soreness</b> was significantly elevated immediately after exercise (p≤ 0. 01) compared to all other measurement times. Pitch velocity was not different among games A, B, and C. Results indicate that muscle damage, as evidenced by CK release, occurs in response to baseball pitching. However CK values, <b>muscle</b> <b>soreness,</b> <b>and</b> pitch velocity are not significantly affected by changes in the amount of recovery time typically scheduled between games...|$|R
