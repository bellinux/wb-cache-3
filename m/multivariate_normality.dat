With the t mixture model-based approach, the normal distribution for each component in the mixture model is embedded in a wider class of elliptically symmetric distributions with an additional parameter called the degrees of freedom. The advantage of the t mixture model is that, although the number of outliers needed for breakdown is almost the same as with the normal mixture model, the outliers have to be much larger. We also consider the use of the t distribution for the robust clustering of high-dimensional data via mixtures of factor analyzers.

The current study aimed to establish the relationship of perception of ethical climate, horizontal violence and authentic leadership style as predictors and turnover intention as an outcome of organizational cynicism along the moderated mediating effect of perceived organizational support in the nursing profession. The study used a quantitative research design, and eight hundred and seventy questionnaires were distributed to collect data from nursing staff working in Punjab region of Pakistan using a non-probability multistage sampling technique. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), <b>multivariate</b> data <b>normality</b> tests, descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to analyze the data. The results revealed a statistically significant direct relationship among the perceptions of ethical climate, horizontal violence, authentic leadership style, organizational cynicism and turnover intention.

Additionally, results indicated a partial mediating effect of organizational cynicism between authentic leadership style and turnover intention. On the contrary, moderated mediating relationship of perceived organizational support could not proceed because of the insignificant mediating effect of organizational cynicism between horizontal violence and turnover intention. Findings of the current study contributed to the literature of organizational behavior by exploring the factors and outcomes of cynicism among healthcare services staff.

40|$|A {{significant}} role for hypothesis testing in econometrics involves diagnostic checking. When checking {{the adequacy of}} a chosen model, researchers typically employ a range of diagnostic tests, {{each of which is}} designed to detect a particular form of model inadequacy. A major problem is how best to control the overall probability of rejecting the model when it is true and multiple test statistics are used. This paper presents a new multiple testing procedure, which involves checking whether the calculated values of the diagnostic statistics are consistent with the postulated model being true. This is done through a combination of bootstrapping to obtain a multivariate kernel density estimator of the joint density of the test statistics under the null hypothesis and Monte Carlo simulations to obtain a p value using this kernel density. We prove that under some regularity conditions, the estimated p value of our test procedure is a consistent estimate of the true p value. The proposed testing procedure is applied to tests for autocorrelation in an observed time series, for normality, and for model misspecification through the information matrix. We find that our testing procedure has correct or nearly correct sizes and good powers, particular for more complicated testing problems.

In Phase I, the estimation of parameters is achieved using the Hotelling T control chart; only after applying the deﬁned ARIMA model, the p variables are treated.
