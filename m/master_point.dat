40|$|An {{efficient}} {{approach for}} the analysis of surface conformed reflector antennas fed arbitrarily is presented. The near field in a large number of sampling points in the aperture of the reflector is obtained applying the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD). A new technique named <b>Master</b> <b>Points</b> has been developed to reduce the complexity of the ray-tracing computations. The combination of both GTD and <b>Master</b> <b>Points</b> reduces the time requirements of this kind of analysis. To validate the new approach, several reflectors and the effects on the radiation pattern caused by shifting the feed and introducing different obstacles have been considered concerning both simple and complex geometries. The results of these analyses have been compared with the Method of Moments (MoM) results...|$|R
