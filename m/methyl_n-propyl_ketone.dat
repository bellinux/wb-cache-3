40|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of {{methyl n-butyl ketone}} {{is known}} to be enhanced by combination with methyl ethyl ketone. This study was conducted to clarify the potentiating effect of aliphatic monoketones on the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl ketone. Rats were subcutaneously injected in the back with 4 mmol/kg/day of methyl ethyl ketone, <b>methyl</b> <b>n-propyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> methyl n-amyl ketone, or methyl n-hexyl ketone mixed with an equimolar dose of methyl n-butyl ketone five days a week for 20 weeks. The maximum motor fibre conduction velocity and the distal latency were measured every two weeks in the tail nerves of the treated animals and controls. All the monoketones tested enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl ketone. Of the compounds tested, methyl n-hexyl ketone, which had the longest carbon chain, enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl n-butyl ketone most strongly. These results suggest that the length of the carbon chain of the aliphatic monoketones combined with methyl n-butyl ketone was related to the enhancement of the neurotoxicity of the neurotoxic compound...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundParabens appear {{frequently}} as antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic products, in pharmaceuticals, and {{in food and}} beverage processing. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed weak estrogenic activity of some parabens. Widespread use has raised concerns about the potential human health risks associated with paraben exposure. ObjectivesAssessing human exposure to parabens usually involves measuring in urine the conjugated or free species of parabens or their metabolites. In animals, parabens are mostly hydrolyzed to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and excreted in the urine as conjugates. Still, monitoring urinary concentrations of p-hydroxybenzoic acid {{is not necessarily the}} best way to assess exposure to parabens. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid is a nonspecific biomarker, and the varying estrogenic bioactivities of parabens require specific biomarkers. Therefore, we evaluated the use of free and conjugated parent parabens as new biomarkers for human exposure to these compounds. ResultsWe measured the urinary concentrations of <b>methyl,</b> ethyl, <b>n-propyl,</b> butyl (n- and iso-), and benzyl parabens in a demographically diverse group of 100 anonymous adults. We detected <b>methyl</b> and <b>n-propyl</b> parabens at the highest median concentrations (43. 9 ng/mL and 9. 05 ng/mL, respectively) in nearly all (> 96 %) of the samples. We also detected other parabens in {{more than half of the}} samples (ethyl, 58 %; butyl, 69 %). Most important, however, we found that parabens in urine appear predominantly in their conjugated forms. ConclusionsThe results, demonstrating the presence of urinary conjugates of parabens in humans, suggest that such conjugated parabens could be used as exposure biomarkers. Additionally, the fact that conjugates appear to be the main urinary products of parabens may be important for risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|Summary. -A tumour {{initiating}} dose of {{ethyl carbamate}} {{was administered to}} mice by subcutaneous injection together with a dose {{of one of the}} homologous esters or an ethyl N-alkyl derivative. The homologues used were the <b>methyl,</b> <b>n-propyl</b> and n-butyl esters, and the derivatives were the N-methyl, N-ethyl and N-n-propyl ethyl esters. The mice were then given promoting treatment with croton oil for 28 weeks. Neither the homologous esters nor the N-substituted derivatives of ethyl carbamate had any influence on the yield of tumours in the skin, lung, or liver. However, increasing the dose of ethyl carbamate increased the yields of tumours. THE administration of ethyl carbamate (urethane) to mice by any route leads to the production of tumours in a variety of tissues (Tannenbaum, 1964). Adenomata of the lung (Nettleship et al., 1943; Shimkin, 1955) are very common. Lymphomata with or without leukaemia (Pietra et al., 1961), haemangiomata of the liver (Trainin, 1963), and hepatomata are less commonly found; tumours of lacrimal gland, skin and of other sites are observed infrequently and only after a long latent period. For skin its carcinogenic action is mainly that of an initiator, that is, tumours usually appear only when the skin is subsequently painted repeatedly with a promoting agent such as croton oil (Graffi et al., 1953; Salaman and Roe, 1953; Berenblum and Haran, 1955). The tumour initiating property of carbamates for skin appears to be limited to the ethyl ester and a few of its N-substituted derivatives (Berenblum et al., 1959 b; Pound, 1967, 1969). The tumour producing property for lung also appears to be restricted to ethyl, ethyl N-methyl and N-hydroxy carbamates although propyl carbamate was considered to have a doubtful effect (Larsen, 1947, 1948; Berenblum et al., 1959 b). However, because of the common chemical structure it might be thought that the homologues, or the N-substituted derivatives, of ethyl carbamate might affect or be affected by similar metabolic systems within the cells of animals injected with them. Some related compounds appear to produce similar abnormalities of the chromosomes during mitosis in the cells of animals, some eggs and plant...|$|R

The chemistry of N-substituted- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles has been well developed due to its high biological activity, however, the preparation of isomerically pure N-substituted- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles is not trivial [1 - 12]. Direct alkylation of 1 (H) - 1, 2, 3 -triazoles usually form...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptability}} of Escherichia coli thioredoxin to {{the substitution}} {{of a series of}} non-natural amino acids has been investigated. Different thiosulfonated alkyl groups were inserted into the hydrophobic core of the protein in position 78 via disulfide bonding with a buried cysteine residue as previously described (Wynn R, Richards FM. 1993. Unnatural amino acid packing mutants of Escherichia coli thioredoxin produced by combined mutagenesis/chemical modification techniques. Protein Sci 2 : 395 - 403). The side chains added to the cysteine included <b>methyl,</b> ethyl, <b>n-propyl,</b> n-butyl, n-pentyl, and cyclo-pentyl derivatives. The side chains appear to exploit the presence of the large cavities to incorporate these variant forms, enabling the protein to fold and have some activity. Solution structural and kinetic data suggested that these substitutions had little effect on the overall fold of the protein. Thermodynamic data revealed that the entropic effect of restricting the side chains in the folded protein has an effect on the stability. The variant forms of thioredoxin have different propensities to form dimers despite the limited structural perturbations. Molecular modeling studies allow the conformation of the side chains to be assessed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{secondary}} sludge addition on black liquor gasification were studied. Additions of 0, 5, 10, and 15 % secondary sludge solids to hardwood black liquor solids were considered. Gasification temperatures were 700 and 900 °C. Residence times were 0. 2, 0. 7, and 1. 2 seconds. Gasification {{was performed in}} a laminar entrained flow reactor. Although both amount and rate of organic carbon conversion increased with temperature, the percentage of sludge addition did not affect percent of feed carbon recovered as organic carbon. Isobutyl and ethyl mercaptan, as well as carbon disulfide, were not produced in reportable quantities. Recoveries were expressed on a percentage-of-feed-element basis. Recovery of sulfur in char was higher for the 100 / 0 (black liquor/secondary sludge) feed than for the 85 / 15 feed. Recoveries of H 2 S were higher for purer (less sludge added) feed stocks for all experiments except those performed 900 °C/ 1. 2 seconds residence time. Recoveries of <b>methyl</b> mercaptan, <b>n-propyl</b> mercaptan, carbon disulfide, and ammonia were relatively independent of sludge addition. Recoveries in char of magnesium, vanadium, and aluminum were higher for th...|$|R
5000|$|The marked {{toxicity}} of esters of monofluorophosphoric acid {{was discovered in}} 1932, when Willy Lange and his PhD student Gerda von Krueger prepared the <b>methyl,</b> ethyl, <b>n-propyl,</b> and n-butyl esters and incidentally experienced their toxic effects. Another homologue of this series of esters, Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, was developed by British scientist Bernard Charles Saunders. On his search for compounds {{to be used as}} chemical warfare agents, Saunders was inspired by the report by Lange and Krueger and decided to prepare the new homologue which he labeled PF-3. It was much less effective as a chemical weapon than the G series agents. It was often mixed with mustard gas, forming a more effective mixture with significantly lower melting point, resulting in an agent suitable for use in cold weather. [...] In military research, due to its physical and chemical similarities and comparatively low toxicity, it is used as a simulant of G-agents (GA, GB, GD, and GF). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate is used in civilian laboratories to mimic lethal nerve gas exposure or organophosphate toxicities. It has also been used to develop a rodent model of Gulf War Syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Alkyl esters of styrenesulfonic acid were synthesized, homopolymerized, and copolymerized with {{a variety}} of comonomers. The {{polymers}} were investigated for hydrolysis behavior under a variety of reaction conditions. ^ Several methods for the synthesis of alkyl styrenesulfonates were investigated. <b>Methyl,</b> ethyl, <b>n-propyl,</b> and isopropyl styrenesulfonates were successfully synthesized in yields of 65, 55, 50, and 40 percent, respectively, starting with sodium styrenesulfonate. Monomer synthesis procedures involving the sulfochlorination of (2 -bromoethyl) benzene were found to be inferior because of sulfone formation which led to insoluble, crosslinked resins. ^ Alkyl styrenesulfonates were homopolymerized and copolymerized by free-radical initiation. Bulk, solution, and emulsion polymerization systems were successfully employed. Comonomers investigated included styrene, acrylamide, acrylic acid, 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonic acid, maleic anhydride, sodium styrenesulfonate, and sodium 2 -sulfoethyl methacrylate. Copolymerization reactivity ratios (r(, 1), r(, 2)) for the copolymerization of methyl styrenesulfonate with styrene, acrylic acid, and maleic anhydride were determined. ^ Hydrolysis studies in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide solutions were performed. The effect of a variety of variables, including copolymerization, solvent, temperature, alkalinity, acidity, and molecular weight, on the kinetics of hydrolysis was investigated. The various homopolymers and copolymers were found to behave similarly to low molecular weight analogs and exhibited the following reactivity towards hydrolysis: methyl 3 ̆e isopropyl 3 ̆e ethyl 3 ̆e n-propyl. However, in solvent systems containing high concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide ((GREATERTHEQ) 90 vol...|$|R
40|$|Four 2 -alkyl (<b>methyl,</b> ethyl, <b>n-propyl</b> and isopropenyl) analogues of {{idazoxan}} (RX 781094) {{have been}} synthesized and assessed {{in terms of}} their central alpha 2 /alpha 1 -adrenoceptor selectivity and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist potency using both in vitro and in vivo tests in the rat. In cortical binding assays using [3 H]-idazoxan and [3 H]-prazosin, idazoxan had a 5 times greater alpha 2 /alpha 1 -selectivity than yohimbine. The 2 -alkyl substituted analogues all showed improved selectivity, being between 17 and 29 times more selective than yohimbine for [3 H]-idazoxan binding sites. In terms of central antagonist potency in vivo, the most favourable substitutions were 2 -ethyl (RX 811033) and 2 -n-propyl (RX 811054). Compared with yohimbine, these analogues were, respectively, 36 and 18 times more potent intravenously and 5 and 7. 5 times more potent orally in their antagonism of guanoxabenz-induced mydriasis in the pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rat. All the analogues had a duration of action similar to that of idazoxan, which was significantly shorter than that of yohimbine. The results indicate that introduction of alkyl groups in the 2 -position of idazoxan greatly increases the alpha 2 /alpha 1 -adrenoceptor selectivity as measured in binding studies. Improved alpha 2 -adrenoceptor affinity and antagonist potency were particularly associated with the 2 -ethyl and 2 -n-propyl analogues...|$|R
