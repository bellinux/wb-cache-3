25|$|<b>Multimodality</b> in {{classrooms}} {{has brought about}} the need for a new definition of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of <b>multimodality,</b> literacy, when defined, usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to express knowledge of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as <b>multimodality</b> becomes more common, not only {{in classrooms}}, but in work and social environments, the definition of literacy extends. Instead of referring only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than just reading and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others.|$|E

25|$|Internally, {{businesses}} use multimodal platforms for {{analytical and}} systemic purposes, among others.

25|$|Because <b>multimodality</b> is {{continually}} evolving from a solely print-based to a screen-based presentation, {{the speaker and}} audience relationship evolves as well. Due to the growing presence of digital media over the last decade, the central mode of representation {{is no longer just}} text; recently, the use of imagery has become more prominent. In its current use for Internet and network-based composition, the term “multimodality” has become even more prevalent, applying to various forms of text such as fine art, literature, social media and advertising. An important related term to <b>multimodality</b> is multiliteracy, which is the comprehension of different modes in communication – not only to read text, but also to read other modes such as sound and image. Whether and how a message is understood is accredited to multiliteracy.|$|E

25|$|As {{classroom}} technologies {{become more}} prolific, so do multimodal assignments. Students {{in the 21st century}} have more options for communicating digitally, be it texting, blogging, or through social media. This rise in computer-controlled communication has required classes to become multimodal {{in order to}} teach students the skills required in the 21st-century work environment. However, in the classroom setting, <b>multimodality</b> is more than just combining multiple technologies, but rather creating meaning through the integration of multiple modes. Students are learning through a combination of these modes, including sound, gestures, speech, images and text. For example, in digital components of lessons, there are often pictures, videos, and sound bites as well as the text to help students grasp {{a better understanding of the}} subject. <b>Multimodality</b> also requires that teachers move beyond teaching with just text, as the printed word is only one of many modes students must learn and use.|$|E
25|$|Given proper <b>multimodality</b> treatment, SCLC {{patients}} with limited disease have median survival rates of between 16 and 24 months, and about 20% will be cured.

25|$|<b>Multimodality</b> {{also can}} be used to {{associate}} a text with a specific argumentative purpose, e.g., to state facts, make a definition, cause a value judgment, or make a policy decision. Jeanne Fahnestock and Marie Secor, professors at the University of Maryland and the Pennsylvania State University, labeled the fulfillment of these purposes stases. A text’s stasis can be altered by <b>multimodality,</b> especially when several mediums are juxtaposed to create an individualized experience or meaning. For example, an argument that mainly defines a concept is understood as arguing in the stasis of definition; however, it can also be assigned a stasis of value if the way the definition is delivered equips writers to evaluate a concept, or judge whether something is good or bad. If the text is interactive, the audience is facilitated to create their own meaning from the perspective the multimodal text provides. By emphasizing different stases through the use of different modes, writers are able to further engage their audience in creating comprehension.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>multimodality,</b> {{at its most}} basic level, can change the way an audience perceives information. The most basic understanding of language comes via semiotics – the association between words and symbols. A multimodal text changes its semiotic effect by placing words with preconceived meanings in a new context, whether that context is audio, visual, or digital. This in turn creates a new, foundationally different meaning for an audience. Bezemer and Kress, two scholars on <b>multimodality</b> and semiotics, argue that students understand information differently when text is delivered in conjunction with a secondary medium, such as image or sound, than when it is presented in alphanumeric format only. This is due to it drawing a viewer’s attention to “both the originating site and the site of recontextualization”. Meaning is moved from one medium to the next, which requires the audience to redefine their semiotic connections. Recontextualizing an original text within other mediums creates a different sense of understanding for the audience, and this new type of learning can be controlled by the types of media used.|$|E
25|$|A {{medium is}} the {{substance}} in which meaning is realized and through which it becomes available to others. Mediums include video, image, text, audio, etc. Socially, medium includes semiotic, sociocultural, and technological {{practices such as}} film, newspaper, a billboard, radio, television, theater, a classroom, etc. <b>Multimodality</b> makes use of the electronic medium by creating digital modes with the interlacing of image, writing, layout, speech, and video. Mediums have become modes of delivery that take the current and future contexts into consideration.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, <b>multimodality</b> grew {{in scope}} {{with the release}} of the Internet, {{personal}} computers, and other digital technologies. The literacy of the emerging generation changed, becoming accustomed to text circulated in pieces, informally, and across multiple mediums of image, color, and sound. The change represented a fundamental shift in how writing was presented: from print-based to screen-based. Literacy evolved so that students arrived in classrooms being knowledgeable in video, graphics, and computer skills, but not alphabetic writing. Educators had to change their teaching practices to include multimodal lessons in order to help students achieve success in writing for the new millennium.|$|E
40|$|Background]Whole-body cancer {{screening}} with <b>multimodalities</b> including [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose {{positron emission tomography}} (FDG-PET) detects {{a wide range of}} tumors. This program has been recognized as an option for opportunistic screening, particularly in Japan. However, reports on diagnostic accuracy have been limited. We aimed to evaluate the detectability and related properties of this screening program among asymptomatic individuals in a community setting. [Methods]The study participants were 1, 762 residents of Osaka Prefecture, Japan, who underwent opportunistic {{cancer screening}} at Higashitemma Clinic for the first time between November 2004 and December 2005. FDG-PET cancer screening was performed with several imaging modalities (e. g., FDG-PET, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography) and fecal occult blood test. Screening records were linked to the Osaka cancer registry within 1 year after the screening to determine sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values. [Results]After excluding 12 participants with cancer detected before the screening, 33 were identified by the cancer registry to have primary cancers. Of these, the present screening program found that 28 were positive (6 prostate, 5 lung, 5 colorectal, 5 thyroid, 3 liver and 4 others). Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were 84. 8 % (28 / 33, 95 % confidence interval 69. 1 – 93. 3), 86. 8 % (1, 491 / 1, 718, 85. 1 – 88. 3) and 10. 1 % (28 / 277, 6. 4 – 12. 9), respectively. [Conclusions]FDG-PET cancer screening with <b>multimodalities</b> reasonably and accurately detects existing asymptomatic cancer. However, the numbers of false negatives and false positives were not insignificant. Facilities that provide the screening should inform participants of relevant information, including the limitations of this program...|$|R

25|$|One shift {{caused by}} multi-literate environments is that private-sphere texts {{are being made}} more public. The private sphere is {{described}} as {{an environment in which}} people have a sense of personal authority and are distanced from institutions, such as the government. The family and home are considered {{to be a part of}} the private sphere. Family photographs are an example of <b>multimodality</b> in this sphere. Families take pictures (sometimes captioning them) and compile them in albums that are generally meant to be displayed to other family members or audiences that the family allows.

25|$|<b>Multimodality</b> also obscures an audience’s {{concept of}} genre by {{creating}} gray areas {{out of what}} was once black and white. Carolyn R. Miller, a distinguished professor of rhetoric and technical communication at North Carolina State University observed in her genre analysis of the Weblog how genre shifted with the invention of blogs, stating that “there is strong agreement on the central features that make a blog a blog. Miller defines blogs {{on the basis of their}} reverse chronology, frequent updating, and combination of links with personal commentary. However, the central features of blogs are obscured when considering multimodal texts. Some features are absent, such the ability for posts to be independent of each other, while others are present. This creates a situation where the genre of multimodal texts is impossible to define; rather, the genre is dynamic, evolutionary and ever-changing.|$|E
25|$|But many HPV+OPC {{present with}} {{involvement}} of the lymph nodes in the neck, and hence a higher stage of disease, generally referred to as locally advanced disease. This group is mostly treated with <b>multimodality</b> therapy, {{with the exception of}} one of the more favourable subgroups with small primary tumours and lymph node involvement confined to a single node no larger than 3nbsp&cm in size, which as noted are considered early stage disease. The three main options for locally advanced but operable disease are resection, neck dissection and adjuvant therapy; chemoradiation (with possible salvage surgery); induction chemotherapy followed by radiation or chemoradiation. However the last option has not been supported in clinical trials that tested it. The primary consideration of surgery for locally advanced disease is to obtain adequate negative margins and spare the patient postoperative chemoradiation. But this must be balanced against the morbidity and functional loss from extensive resection, particularly where the tongue base is involved. To avoid such morbidity, primary chemoradiation is preferred. The management of disease within the cervical lymph nodes has to be taken into account in treating locally advanced disease. Guidelines for all OPC dictate that ectracapsular extension be given postoperative chemoradiation. Where gross neck disease is evident initially primary chemoradiation is usually given.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurriculum Reform Initiatives: A {{global economy}} intent on a {{knowledge}} society requires tertiary education programmes {{to shift from}} traditional, authoritative approaches to curriculum reform that takes into regard {{the development of a}} knowledge based society.

Curriculum development was undertaken through the approach of a pedagogy of multiliteracies, the affordances of cyberliteracies which have extended the trajectory of 21 st century literacies (Unsworth, 2001). This was to enable a transformation of a pedagogy of <b>multimodalities</b> –visual, textual, a multiplicity of semiotic resources, meaning making cultures to construct different dimensions of meaning: linguistic, visual, and digital (New London Group, 2000, Kress, 2000, 2003...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{attention in the}} literature postulating the potential effects of contemporary, technology-enabled new generation learning spaces (NGLS) on both teaching and learning (Brooks, 2011, 2012). This has, in part, been driven by the pervasive and transformative potentiall of ubiquitous access to and use of digital technology in the classroom (Chan et al., 2006). Increased access to mobile technology {{in recent years has}} freed students from the restrictive nature of shared access in tradiitional computer laboratories (Blackmore, Bateman, O'Mara, & Loughlin, 2011). Students now have personal 'anywhere, anytime' access to a boundless library of highly indexed information (Beichner, 2014), which in turn challenges the highly sequential style of instruction that has allowed teachers to preserve their historically authoritative role. Personal access to technology can support more adaptive and connected learning experiences. These experiences are created by connecting teachers and students within <b>multimodalities</b> of teaching and },earning that may have not been possible before (Bocconi, Karnpylis, & Punie, 2012; Hall-van den Elsen & Palaskas, 2014; Swan, van'T Hooft, Kratcoski, & Schenk,er, 2007). <b>Multimodalities</b> afford teachers the ability to orchestrate adaptive learning opportunities using a range of physical, text and visual tools, whilst connecting students with each other. A key element is the connectivity between teachers-students and students-students is established through the creaition of technology-enabled NGLS. The technology-enabled spaces have ubiquitous access to digital technology through one-to-one digital devices connected through wireless infrastructure. The affordances of a NGLS environment has the potential to revolutionize how, where and with whom students learn (Mouza & Lavigne, 2013; Thomas & Brown, 2011). It has the potential to sup,port contemporary pedagogical practices that facilitate highly personalised models of student learning (Bocconi et al., 2012; Magee, 2009; Zandvliet & Fraser, 2004). This personalised model includes learning outside the primacy of the traditional classroom forum (Mouza & Lavigne, 2013). Together these elements intertwine to create a model of teaching and learning that can be radically different to prevailing school cultures (Mouza & Lavigne, 2013). Open Acces...|$|R
2500|$|In {{its most}} basic sense, <b>multimodality</b> is a theory of {{communication}} and social semiotics. <b>Multimodality</b> describes communication practices {{in terms of the}} textual, aural, linguistic, spatial, and visual resources - or modes - used to compose messages. [...] Where media are concerned, <b>multimodality</b> is the use of several modes (media) to create a single artifact. The collection of these modes, or elements, contributes to how <b>multimodality</b> affects different rhetorical situations, or opportunities for increasing an audience's reception of an idea or concept. [...] Everything from the placement of images to the organization of the content creates meaning. This {{is the result of a}} shift from isolated text being relied on as the primary source of communication, to the image being utilized more frequently in the digital age. [...] While <b>multimodality</b> as an area of academic study did not gain traction until the twentieth century, all communication, literacy, and composing practices are and always have been multimodal.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Multimodality</b> has {{developed}} as a theory {{throughout the history of}} writing. The idea of <b>multimodality</b> has been studied since the 4th century BC, when classical rhetoricians alluded to it with their emphasis on voice, gesture, and expressions in public speaking. However, the term was not defined with significance until the 20th century. During this time, an exponential rise in technology created many new modes of presentation. [...] Since then, <b>multimodality</b> has become standard in the 21st century, applying to various network-based forms such as art, literature, social media and advertising. The monomodality, or singular mode, which used to define the presentation of text on a page has been replaced with more complex and integrated layouts. John A. Bateman says in his book <b>Multimodality</b> and Genre, “Nowadays… text is just one strand in a complex presentational form that seamlessly incorporates visual aspect ‘around,’ and sometimes even instead of, the text itself.” [...] <b>Multimodality</b> has quickly become “the normal state of human communication.” ...|$|E

Relying upon the canons of rhetoric in a different way than before, multimodal texts have the ability to address a larger, yet more focused, intended audience. [...] <b>Multimodality</b> does more than solicit an audience; the effects of <b>multimodality</b> are imbedded in an audience’s semiotic, generic and technological understanding.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new co-clustering problem {{of images and}} visual features. The problem {{involves}} a set of non-object images {{in addition to a}} set of object images and features to be co-clustered. Co-clustering is performed in a way that maximises discrimination of object images from non-object images, thus emphasizing discriminative features. This provides a way of obtaining perceptual joint-clusters of object images and features. We tackle the problem by simultaneously boosting multiple strong classifiers which compete for images by their expertise. Each boosting classifier is an aggregation of weak-learners, i. e. simple visual features. The obtained classifiers are useful for object detection tasks which exhibit <b>multimodalities,</b> e. g. multi-category and multi-view object detection tasks. Experiments on a set of pedestrian images and a face data set demonstrate that the method yields intuitive image clusters with associated features and is much superior to conventional boosting classifiers in object detection tasks. ...|$|R
