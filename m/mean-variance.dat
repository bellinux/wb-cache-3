25|$|In {{portfolio}} theory, {{the locus}} of <b>mean-variance</b> efficient portfolios (called the efficient frontier) is {{the upper half of}} the east-opening branch of a hyperbola drawn with the portfolio return's standard deviation plotted horizontally and its expected value plotted vertically; according to this theory, all rational investors would choose a portfolio characterized by some point on this locus.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{portfolio}} theory (MPT), or <b>mean-variance</b> analysis, is {{a mathematical}} framework for assembling {{a portfolio of}} assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk, defined as variance. Its key insight is that an asset's risk and return should not be assessed by itself, but by how it contributes to a portfolio's overall risk and return.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} {{computational}} finance {{as a discipline}} {{can be traced to}} Harry Markowitz in the early 1950s. Markowitz conceived of the portfolio selection problem as an exercise in <b>mean-variance</b> optimization. This required more computer power than was available at the time, so he worked on useful algorithms for approximate solutions. Mathematical finance began with the same insight, but diverged by making simplifying assumptions to express relations in simple closed forms that did not require sophisticated computer science to evaluate.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as <b>mean-variance</b> optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{portfolio}} optimization {{is often}} conducted {{in terms of}} <b>mean-variance</b> analysis. In this context, the efficient set is {{a subset of the}} portfolios parametrized by the portfolio mean return [...] in the problem of choosing portfolio shares so as to minimize the portfolio's variance of return [...] subject to a given value of see Mutual fund separation theorem for details. Alternatively, the efficient set can be specified by choosing the portfolio shares so as to maximize the function the set of efficient portfolios consists of the solutions as b ranges from zero to infinity.|$|E
2500|$|More fundamentally, {{investors are}} stuck with {{estimating}} key parameters from past market data because MPT attempts to model risk {{in terms of}} the likelihood of losses, but says nothing about why those losses might occur. The risk measurements used are probabilistic in nature, not structural. [...] This is a major difference as compared to many engineering approaches to risk management. As estimation errors are critical in MPT, appropriate modeling approaches must be applied. In an MPT or <b>mean-variance</b> optimization framework, accurate estimation of the variance–covariance matrix is paramount. [...] Thus, forecasting with Monte-Carlo simulation with the Gaussian copula and well-specified marginal distributions are effective. [...] Allowing the modeling process to allow for empirical characteristics in stock returns such as auto-regression, asymmetric volatility, skewness, and kurtosis is important. [...] Not accounting for these attributes can lead to severe estimation error in the correlation and variance–covariance matrices that have negative biases (as much as 70% of the true values).|$|E

5000|$|As {{with any}} {{statistical}} model {{it is important}} to check the model assumptions of a GAM. Residual plots should be examined {{in the same way as}} for any GLM. That is deviance residuals (or other standardized residuals) should be examined for patterns that might suggest a substantial violation of the independence or <b>mean-variance</b> assumptions of the model. This will usually involve plotting the standardized residuals against fitted values and covariates to look for <b>mean-variance</b> problems or missing pattern, and may also involve examining Correlograms (ACFs) and/or Variograms of the residuals to check for violation of independence. If the model <b>mean-variance</b> relationship is correct then scaled residuals should have roughly constant variance. Note that since GLMs and GAMs can be estimated using Quasi-likelihood, it follows that details of the distribution of the residuals beyond the <b>mean-variance</b> relationship are of relatively minor importance.|$|E

50|$|Bekkers, Doeswijk and Lam (2009) {{investigate}} the diversification benefits for a portfolio by distinguishing ten different investment categories simultaneously in a <b>mean-variance</b> analysis {{as well as}} a market portfolio approach. The results suggest that real estate, commodities, and high yield add most value to the traditional asset mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. A study with such a broad coverage of asset classes has not been conducted before, not in the context of determining capital market expectations and performing a <b>mean-variance</b> analysis, neither in assessing the global market portfolio.|$|E

50|$|Dollar cost {{averaging}} is gradual entry into risky assets; it is frequently advocated by investment advisors. As indicated above, {{it is not}} confirmed by models with log utility.

5000|$|Portfolios can be {{analyzed}} in a <b>mean-variance</b> framework, with every investor holding the portfolio with the lowest possible return variance consistent with that investor's chosen level of expected return (called a minimum-variance portfolio), if the returns on the assets are jointly elliptically distributed, including the special case {{in which they are}} jointly normally distributed. [...] Under <b>mean-variance</b> analysis, it can be shown that every minimum-variance portfolio given a particular expected return (that is, every efficient portfolio) can be formed as a combination of any two efficient portfolios. If the investor's optimal portfolio has an expected return that is between the expected returns on two efficient benchmark portfolios, then that investor's portfolio can be characterized as consisting of positive quantities of the two benchmark portfolios.|$|E
5000|$|Post-modern {{portfolio}} theory (or PMPT) is {{an extension}} of the traditional modern portfolio theory ("MPT", which is an application of <b>mean-variance</b> analysis or [...] "MVA"). Both theories propose how rational investors should use diversification to optimize their portfolios, and how a risky asset should be priced.|$|E
50|$|If a {{portfolio}} A is marginally conditionally stochastically dominated by some incrementally different portfolio B, {{then it is}} said to be inefficient {{in the sense that it}} is not the optimal portfolio for anyone. Note that this context of portfolio optimization is not limited to situations in which <b>mean-variance</b> analysis applies.|$|E
5000|$|In general, {{when there}} are {{portfolio}} constraints - for example, when short sales are not allowed - {{the easiest way to}} find the optimal portfolio is to use the Black-Litterman model to generate the expected returns for the assets, and then use a <b>mean-variance</b> optimizer to solve the constrained optimization problem.http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/finread/intuition.pdf ...|$|E

The {{amount of}} {{information}} (the covariance matrix, specifically, or a complete joint probability distribution among assets in the market portfolio) needed to compute a <b>mean-variance</b> optimal portfolio is often intractable and certainly has no room for subjective measurements ('views' about the returns of portfolios of subsets of investable assets).|$|E
50|$|If {{investors have}} {{hyperbolic}} absolute risk aversion (HARA) (including the power utility function, logarithmic function and the exponential utility function), separation theorems {{can be obtained}} {{without the use of}} <b>mean-variance</b> analysis.
