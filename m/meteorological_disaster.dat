40|$|Background: Solar {{greenhouses}} {{are very}} popular {{in the north of}} China as a way of meeting the demand for fresh local winter vegetables. Nonetheless, they are more susceptible to biological and meteorological disasters, such as diseases, pests, fog, haze and cold temperatures. Although we have deployed many record keeping equipment and weather stations, we have lower efficiency of usage on data. Big data has great potential in the future. Thus, our aim is to investigate a big data system for disaster forecasting and control to efficiently capture long-term and up-to-the-minute environmental fluctuations inside greenhouses. Methods: A greenhouse disaster survey database was designed from the most important place of solar greenhouse vegetable production, that is the area around Bohai Harbor, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Hebei and Liaoning Provinces. The comprehensive survey provided large amounts of data, such as greenhouse distribution and environment parameter monitoring, for the system. The authors developed and integrated some disease, pest and <b>meteorological</b> <b>disaster</b> warning models using disaster-chain theory. The system was developed using C# in. NET framework. Results: A big data system for greenhouse vegetable disaster was developed combing with monitoring data for diseases and pests, meteorological data and production record data based on the internet of things, while visualization results were illustrated to provide a reference for the prevention decision.

40|$|Abstract Background Meteorological {{disasters}} are {{an important}} component when considering climate change issues that impact morbidity and mortality rates. However, there are few epidemiological studies assessing the causes and characteristics of deaths from meteorological disasters. The present study aimed to analyze the causes of death associated with meteorological disasters in Korea, as well as demographic and geographic vulnerabilities and their changing trends, to establish effective measures for the adaptation to meteorological disasters. Methods Deaths associated with meteorological disasters were examined from 2, 045 cases in Victim Survey Reports prepared by 16 local governments from 1990 to 2008. Specific causes of death were categorized as drowning, structural collapse, electrocution, lightning, fall, collision, landslide, avalanche, deterioration of disease by disaster, and others. Death rates were analyzed according to the meteorological type, specific causes of death, and demographic and geographic characteristics. Results Drowning (60. 3 %) caused {{the greatest number of}} deaths in total, followed by landslide (19. 7 %) and structural collapse (10. 1 %). However, the causes of deaths differed between disaster types. The <b>meteorological</b> <b>disaster</b> associated with the greatest number of deaths has changed from flood to typhoon. Factors that raised vulnerability included living in coastal provinces (11. 3 times higher than inland metropolitan), male gender (1. 9 times higher than female), and older age. Conclusions Epidemiological analyses of the causes of death and vulnerability associated with meteorological disasters can provide the necessary information for establishing future adaptation measures against climate change.

40|$|In recent years, {{forests are}} exposed to various {{meteorological}} disasters. The climate change and warming of atmosphere cause more intensive and frequent occurrences in the atmosphere. This is also reflected in Slovenian forests - in particular {{in the form of}} windthrow, snow-damage, landslides and avalanches, and in 2014 a catastrophic ice storm. Some forecasts indicate that the future will bring more of this kind of disasters. The ice storm in the last year stroke the land the most in history, in particular in terms of damaged trees and areas. According to the available data, the damaged quantities of trees represent more than a two years planned annual cut in Slovenian forests, while about a half of the country was affected. The majority of the damaged wood comes from private forests. The remedying of such extensive meteorological disasters is demanding, dangerous and prolonged - it is also hindered by the specific ownership structure of the forest land in Slovenia and its average size. 75 % of all forest have private owners, and this land is fragmented with a large number of forest holders.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the socio-demographic characteristics and medical causes of death among meteorological disas-ter casualties and compared them with deaths from all causes. Methods: Based on the death data provided by the National Statistical Office from 2000 to 2011, the authors analyzed the gender, age, and region of 709 casualties whose external causes were recorded as natural events (X 330 -X 389). Exact matching was applied to com-pare between deaths from meteorological disasters and all deaths. Results: The {{total number of deaths}} for last 12 years was 2 728 505. After exact matching, 642 casualties of meteorological disasters were matched to 6815 all-cause deaths, which were defined as general deaths. The mean age of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>disaster</b> casualties was 51. 56, which was lower than that of the general deaths by 17. 02 (p< 0. 001). As for the gender ratio, 62. 34 % of the meteorological event casualties were male. While 54. 09 % of the matched all-cause deaths occurred at a medical institution, only 7. 6 % of casualties from meteorological events did. As for occupation, the rate of those working in agriculture, forestry, and fishery jobs was twice as high in the casualties from meteorological disasters as that in the general deaths (p< 0. 001). Meteorological disaster-related injuries like drowning were more prevalent in the casualties of meteorological events (57. 48 %).

It becomes a very important environmental issue and one of the major natural hazards. Its enormous damage on society and life rise extensive concern and research. It is important to know the causation, transportation and radiation effect of dust storm. So we can use a science and efficient approach to avoid the disaster. The government and researchers in China focus on a rapid and effective approach for quick extraction of storm information and timely and correctly warning. The storm usually occurred in the desert, Gobi and hungriness. Therefore due to the limited ground environmental and climatic observations in the relevant regions, satellite remote sensing of objectivity, real-time and macro-scope view, has become an important approach to detect dust storms in China. It is reported that dust storm happened in western Gansu and Neimenggu on March 14 th 2009. MODIS 1 B data of relevant regions were used to detect the dust storm. The key point was to analyze the character of dust storm from MODIS data, and build a appropriate rule to extract the dust information.

The {{results showed that the}} climate of the region was generally dry and the ratio between drought and flood disasters was 85 / 38 during the period of 1208 - 1369. According to the frequencies of drought-flood disasters, the whole period could be divided into three phases. (1) 1208 - 1240 : drought dominated the phase with occasional flood disasters. (2) 1240 - 1320 : long-time drought disasters and extreme drought events happened frequently. (3) 1320 - 1369 : drought disasters were less severe when flood and drought disasters happened alternately. Besides, the reconstructed wet-dry change curve revealed obvious transition and periodicity in the Mongol-Yuan Period. The transitions occurred in 1230 and 1325. The wet-dry change revealed 10 - and 23 -year quasi-periods which were consistent with solar cycles, indicating that solar activity had affected the wet-dry conditions of the study region in the Mongol-Yuan Period.

40|$|Meteorological {{information}} has obvious spatial-temporal characteristics. Although it is meaningful {{to employ a}} geographic information system (GIS) to visualize and analyze the meteorological information for better identification and forecasting of meteorological weather so as to reduce the <b>meteorological</b> <b>disaster</b> loss, modeling meteorological information based on a GIS is still difficult because meteorological elements generally have no stable shape or clear boundary. To date, there are still few GIS models that can satisfy the requirements of both meteorological visualization and analysis. In this article, a spatial lattice model based on sampling particles is proposed to support both the representation and analysis of meteorological information. In this model, a spatial sampling particle {{is regarded as the}} basic element that contains the meteorological information, and the location where the particle is placed with the time mark. The location information is generally represented using a point. As these points can be extended to a surface in two dimensions and a voxel in three dimensions, if these surfaces and voxels can occupy a certain space, then this space can be represented using these spatial sampling particles with their point locations and meteorological information. In this case, the full meteorological space can then be represented by arranging numerous particles with their point locations in a certain structure and resolution, i. e., the spatial lattice model, and extended at a higher resolution when necessary. For practical use, the meteorological space is logically classified into three types of spaces, namely the projection surface space, curved surface space, and stereoscopic space, and application-oriented spatial lattice models with different organization forms of spatial sampling particles are designed to support the representation, inquiry, and analysis of meteorological information within the three types of surfaces. Cases studies are conducted by (1) performing a visualization of radar data that is used to describe the reflectivity factor of a raindrop and the pressure field information acquired from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), and (2) taking cutting analysis as another example where advanced meteorological analysis is performed.

40|$|Executive Summary The {{five-year period}} from 2011 to 2015 {{has been the}} warmest five-year period on record globally, with 2015 being the warmest year on record to date. (1) The period 2011 – 2015 was also the warmest on record for every {{continent}} except Africa. During this period, concentrations of the major greenhouse gases continued to rise and reached record levels for the instrumental period. The record high temperatures from 2011 to 2015, along with the annual record set in 2015, are consistent with established long-term warming trends, the dominant cause {{of which is the}} emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Year-to-year temperature fluctuations occur {{against the backdrop of the}} long-term warming trend, in particular as a result of El Niño and La Niña events. High temperatures have been accompanied by the continuation of long-term trends in other indicators that are consistent with warming, such as rising sea levels and declines in Arctic sea-ice extent and in continental glaciers and ice sheets in Arctic and high-mountain regions. The single most significant event of the period in humanitarian terms was the 2011 – 2012 famine in the Horn of Africa, to which drought in late 2010 and 2011 was a major contributor. More than 250 000 excess deaths in the Horn of Africa were attributed to this event by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. On shorter timescales, no single climate-related disaster in the period 2011 – 2015 was associated with short-term casualties on the scale of some of the worst events of the previous decade, such as the 2003 European heatwave and Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008. However, many of the worst disasters of the period 2011 – 2015 still involved extreme weather and climate. Three tropical cyclones – including one implicated in the period’s worst single <b>meteorological</b> <b>disaster,</b> Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) – were each associated with over 1 000 deaths in the Philippines. (2) Casualties were on a comparable scale in India and Pakistan due to flooding in 2013 and heatwaves in 2015. The South-East Asian flooding of 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in the Caribbean (especially Haiti) and the United States of America in 2012 both resulted in economic losses in excess of US$ 40 billion. (3) Scientific assessments have found that many extreme events in the period 2011 – 2015, especially those involving extreme high temperatures, have had their probabilities sub- stantially increased, by a factor of 10 or more in some cases, as a result of anthropogenic climate change. More than half the events assessed scientifically manifested some degree of anthropogenic climate change signal. In addition, there have been longer-term events that have not yet been the subject of formal attribution studies but that are consistent with projections of near- and long-term climate change. These include, for example, increased incidence of multi-year drought in the subtropics, as manifested during the period in the southern United States, parts of southern Australia and, towards the end of the period, southern Africa. There also have been events, such as the unusually prolonged, intense and hot dry seasons in the Amazon basin of Brazil, in both 2014 and 2015 (especially the latter). While they cannot yet be stated with confidence to be part of a long- term trend, these are of considerable concern in the context of potential “tipping points” in the climate system as identified by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. The present assessment describes the state of the key components of the climate system in the period 2011 – 2015. 4 It focuses on events such as multi-year droughts that require a longer-term perspective than is possible in an annual report. (1) At the time of writing, it is likely that the 2015 record high annual temperature will be exceeded in 2016.

I con-clude that weather emergency management in China should follow the scientific emergency management principle, {{as well as the}} prevention-oriented and emergency rescue-combined principle...|$|R
5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of <b>meteorological</b> <b>disasters</b> all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems.

Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|R

"Although many ancient {{cultures}} believed rainbows {{were good}} omens," [...] Carr (1990:101) explains, [...] "the Chinese {{saw them as}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>disasters.</b> Unlike the auspicious long 龍 dragon symbolizing forthcoming rain, the two-headed hong 虹 was inauspicious because it appeared after a rain shower." [...] The Huainanzi (3, Schindler 1923:322) says both rainbows and comets were warnings from tian [...] "heaven; god". Several classic texts (e.g., Liu Xiang's Shuoyuan and Xinxu) use the phrase baihong guan ri 白虹貫日 [...] "bright rainbow threads the sun". For example, it is a portent of assassination in the Zhanguoce (297, tr. Crump 1979:454) [...] "a white halo pierced the sun." [...] One notable exception is the Mengzi (tr. Legge 1895:171) using yunni 雲霓 [...] "cloud and rainbow" [...] to describe the legendary Tang of Shang: [...] "the people looked to him, as we look {{in a time of}} great drought to the clouds and rainbows." ...|$|R
