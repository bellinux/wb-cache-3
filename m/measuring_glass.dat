A noticeable relaxation of discipline had for some few days pervaded the Nuns’ House.

The housemaids had been bribed with various fragments of riband, and sundry pairs of shoes more or less down at heel, to make no mention of crumbs in the beds; the airiest costumes had been worn on these festive occasions; and the daring Miss Ferdinand had even surprised the company with a sprightly solo on the comb-and-curlpaper, until suffocated in her own pillow by two flowing-haired executioners.|$|E

To measure a glass transition temperature in amber, it has been necessary to alter an already existing experiment from <b>measuring</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperatures between 77 K and room temperature, to temperatures between room temperature and 573 K by the use of an oven. We have come up with a hypothesis that polymerization, release of volatile molecules and the forming of crosslinks in resin, has raised the glass transition temperature above the temperature of the resin, through millions of years, so that the material has glassed. The glass transition temperature has continuously been raised. The amber has polymerized further through millions of years, even though the surrounding temperature has been far below the glass transition temperature. We have constructed a definition of glass, and we conclude through our own experiments and literature studies, that amber from Haiti is a naturally occurring glass...|$|E

40|$|PhDWith an {{increasingly}} ageing population {{the requirement for}} titanium implants will grow. A major challenge is {{to speed up the}} rate and strength of osseo-integration. Bioactive glass coated titanium is postulated to improve bone-bonding ability of titanium. However, bioactive glasses have a higher thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) than titanium and are more prone to crystallization during coating process. Therefore, the aim was to develop a bioactive glass coating that matches the TEC of titanium does not crystallize during coating process and forms surface apatite in vivo and in vitro. To achieve these qualities certain compounds (MgO, CaF 2 and MgF 2 and fluorapatite (FA) crystals) were substituted or added to the glass composition. The glasses were prepared using melt-derived route. The ground glasses were sieved to obtain less than 45 Î¼m diameter glass particles and this powder characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Glass rods were cast to measure TEC, glass transition temperature (Tg) and softening temperature (Ts) using Dilatometry. Glass structure was investigated by <b>measuring</b> <b>glass</b> density and oxygen density.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the behavior of none-structural and structural glass at high temperatures. The main objective of this master thesis is to investigate the capabilities of different glass types when these are used as a structural element with fire resistant requirements. It is therefore important to develop an understanding of the behaviour of various glass types subjected to fire. A literature study is done on glass properties, glass production and methods for making structural glass. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the background information and to gain adequate knowledge about the state of art on the thesis topic. Moreover thermal and mechanical properties of glass were determined. Results of these studies show that all glass properties depend on temperature. Subsequently the finite element model (first DIANA model) was made to simulate a glass test which was performed by others at Empa in Switzerland. A laminated beam model was made in DIANA software. This beam consists of 3 soda lime glass layers and two sentry glass interlayers. This model was used for making a sensitivity analysis about the glass properties which were found during the literature studies. The sensitivity analysis showed that from the material properties uses as input for DIANA models, the heat specific property has the most influence on the glass temperature. As next step, six experiments series were performed at the laboratory of Efectis Netherlands BV in Bleiswijk. The purpose of these tests was to investigate fire behaviour of three different glass types. Annealed, fully tempered and heat strengthened glass were tested horizontally and vertically in different conditions during these experiments. Results of each test were analyzed and discussed before performing the next test. This way, the knowledge about the fire behaviour of the glass and the right method for test performing was developed step by step during this research. Annealed glass performance was very weak at high temperatures due the thermal break phenomenon. It seems to imply that annealed glass (without any improvement) does not have the capabilities to be used as a fire resistant structural element. Based on the different behavior of steel and glass at the high temperature, can be noted that the thermal break phenomenon is occurred at the joint locations (connection between glass and steel support). For this reason joint details need extra attentions if glass needs to be used as a fire resistant structural element. The tests observations shows that 550 - 600 °C is the critical temperature for both fully tempered and heat strengthened glass types. The average furnace temperature was around 615 °C when glass temperature reached the critical temperature (550 °C). The glass behavior changed to plastic phase at the critical temperature. Therefore the glass was not solid anymore and behaved more like liquid material. Afterwards the glass was not able to carry any loads, even not the self-weight. Through the data analysis and the observations of test series 1 to 6 seems to imply that fully tempered and heat strengthened glass, with some improvements, have the capabilities to be used as a structural material under fire loads. It should be mentioned that the relation between maximum allowable tensile stress and temperature, need to be determined first. This information is essential in order to determine if fully tempered glass can be used as fire resistant element. Test setups and the results of the tests are discussed in the chapter “Tests at Efectis” in more details. Single glass layer is tested during all the experiments series. The results show that one layer was not sufficient. This means that using laminated glass is essential in order to have enough fire resistance. The interlayers and the outside glass layers can keep the temperature of the middle layer(s) (loadbearing part) below the critical temperature for certain amount of time. Second DIANA model was made for one of Efectis test in order to see if the finite element model could give a correct estimation of glass behavior at high temperatures. The model results were close to the ones found during the tests. This means DIANA model has the capabilities to predict glass behavior at high temperature. In order to be able to make a model with more precision, glass properties need to be determined. For this reason several material tests should be performed at the beginning of the next research. Metal wires are used for the deflection measuring. The results show that these wires are extended considerably during the performed tests. For this reason this method is not useful for a correct deflection measuring. A new measuring method should be determined in order to have no physical connection between measurement equipment and glass. This way makes <b>measuring</b> <b>glass</b> deflection directly (without any instrument like metal wire) possible. Thermocouples were used for <b>measuring</b> <b>glass</b> temperature surface. These thermocouples were installed on the glass surface. Thermocouples can be placed between layers of laminated glass during the glass production. This way makes more precision temperature measuring possible. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural EngineeringBuilding Engineerin...|$|E

Determination of the nitrate content was performed using an ion-selective method at the Chemical and Toxicological Department of the Regional State Veterinary Medicine Laboratory in the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine. Vegetables were tested for nitrate content using the ion-selective method with the laboratory ion meter AI- 123. Core investigation samples were crushed and homogenized. A 10. 0 g weight of the investigated product, which was prepared according to MIR № 5048 - 89, was placed in a flat-bottomed or a conical flask, which was then filled with 50 cm 3 potassium alumens solution and shaken in a shaking-machine for 5 minutes and then transferred into a <b>measuring</b> <b>glass.</b> The nitrate weight fraction in milligrams per kilogram was obtained together with the weight concentration value of nitrate ions in solution. For our study we selected vegetables grown in both public and private gardens of Uzhgorod district, namely: common onions, radishes, garden parsley, cucumbers, tomatoes, bell peppers, white cabbages, carrots and table beets. 25 samples were selected for each type of vegetable. Nitrate content was determined in the early spring growing period (from February 9 to May 27, 2011) and in the summer growing period (from June 3 to September 28, 2011), because in these particular periods we recorded the most frequent cases of food poisoning from nitrates among the population of the region. A clear trend has been traced towards increasing the nitrate content in food plant production, at levels which exceed the maximum permissible concentration (MPC). The results of {{our research}} demonstrate that the nitrate content exceeded the maximum permissible concentration in 9 kinds of vegetables out of the 11 selected for the investigation, which composes 82 % of total production. In particular, among the selected vegetables an excess of nitrate content, above MPC was recorded in 100 % of cucumbers, 92 % of carrots, 40 % samples of green onions, 40 % of radishes, 40 % of tomatoes, 28 % bell peppers, and 16 % of early white cabbages. However, the most significant nitrate excess, which was more than double the MPC, was observed in 56 % of cucumbers, 20 % of tomatoes, 8 % of radishes in the early spring period and 4 % of tomatoes in the summer period. Consequently, it has been established that the consumption of early vegetable production contributes to the ingestion by humans of significant amounts of nitrates. The application of an agrochemical system based upon sound measurement of the nitrate content would allow us to solve the task of increasing soil fertility and to form a deficit-free and positive balance of biogenic elements and humus in the "soil – plant – fertilizer" system and develop a system of crop production which is balanced in its chemical composition and nutritional value. To sum up, detailed determination of the factors that lead to the accumulation of nitrates in vegetable crops and the development of methods to reduce nitrate concentrations in crop production require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Extremely {{fine steel}} fibres (12 mm diameter) are spun into yarns and then knitted into fabric, which is used, among other applications, as a mould {{cover in the}} {{formation}} of automotive glass. High requirements of the glass quality (absence of dioptric distortions) ask for a perfect evenness of the mould cover surface, which depends on the local distortions of the fabric created during tensioning of the fabric over the mould. In this paper, compression behaviour of steel knitted fabrics combined with the fabric deformation in biaxial tension and shear is studied. Interaction of the fabric with the formed glass depends on the local changes of the fabric compression behaviour due to local fabric deformations on the mould. The deformation of the fabric is further linked to quality of the glass using quantitative optical distortion system based on moire´ patterns to <b>measure</b> <b>glass</b> dioptric distortions. status: publishe...|$|R

When its temperature exceeds this temperature, the exhibiting characters dramatically changes. Although the experimental techniques suited to this temperature measurement are well-established, the full-field optical measurement method has not been employed to characterize this property.

The corrosion behavior of this multiphase waste form {{is expected to be}} complicated by multiple phases and crystal-glass interfaces. A modified single-pass flow-through test was performed on polished monolithic coupons at a neutral pH (25  °C) and 90  °C for 33  d. The <b>measured</b> <b>glass</b> corrosion rates by micro analysis in the samples ranged from 0. 019 to 0. 29  g m− 2  d− 1 at a flow rate per surface area =  1. 73  ×  10 − 6  m s− 1. The crystal phases (oxyapatite and Ca-rich powellite) corroded below quantifiable rates, by micro analysis. While, Ba-rich powellite corroded considerably in O 10 sample. The corrosion rates of C 1 and its replicate C 20 were elevated an order of magnitude by mechanical stresses at crystal-glass interface caused by thermal expansion mismatch during cooling and unique morphology (oxyapatite clustering) ...|$|R
