5|$|Ramboasalamarazaka {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in his father's Zafimamy court at Ikaloy. There {{he received a}} traditional education, including mastery of fanorona, a local board game believed to develop intelligence {{and the ability to}} think strategically. Young nobles being groomed for leadership roles typically learned to perform kabary (a stylized form of public address), including the judicious use of ohabolana (proverbs) to persuasively <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> Young Merina princes also often learned to play the valiha, a bamboo tube zither then reserved for Merina and Zafimamy nobles. Around the age of 12, Ramboasalamarazaka continued his education under the supervision of his grandfather, King Andriambelomasina, at Amboatany and the royal court in Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E

25|$|Although the Hittite empire was {{composed}} of people from many diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, the Hittite language was used in most of their secular written texts. In spite of various arguments over {{the appropriateness of the}} term, Hittite remains the most current term by convention, although some authors <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of using Nesite or Neshite.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, McFarland & Company {{published}} The Meaning and Culture of Grand Theft Auto. Compiled by Nate Garrelts, the 264-page book is {{a collection}} of essays regarding the Grand Theft Auto series, to help audiences better understand the games and to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> about due diligence of game criticism. The book is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the controversies surrounding the series, while the second half takes a theoretical look at the games absent of the controversy.|$|E
25|$|Although a few recent {{depictions of}} Zoroaster show the prophet {{performing}} some deed of legend, {{in general the}} portrayals merely present him in white vestments (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a baresman (Avestan; Middle Persian barsom), which is {{generally considered to be}} another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the Avesta. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the varza—usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head—that priests carry in their installation ceremony. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, as if to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and {{user-friendly}} features {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E

25|$|During England's 1964–65 tour of South Africa, Barlow became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} in the third Test at Newlands after he survived a bat-pad chance when England bowler Fred Titmus thought he had had Barlow caught by Peter Parfitt in the gully. It was already an ill-tempered series, and when Barlow went on to complete his hundred it was little recognised by the England players. Instead, when Tony Pithey reached his half-century shortly afterwards, the England players went overboard in their congratulations to him, seemingly to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> about Barlow's behaviour. The local South African papers attacked England for this, {{and later in the}} same match, English batsman Ken Barrington caused a greater furore when he walked despite not being given out by the same umpire that had not given Barlow out.|$|E
25|$|Marina {{beach is}} a major tourist {{attraction}} of the city. People visiting Chennai <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to visit the beach. It is also the main place for the local people {{to escape from the}} summer heat. The beach is popular for its shops and food stalls run by about 500 shops run by about 1,212 vendors. The memorials and statues, morning walk, joggers' track, lovers' spot, aquarium, and the like make it a hangout for people of all ages. Kite flying and beach cricket are common sports at the beach, and there are also facilities for pony rides. Beach cricket at the Marina dates back several decades. However, Chennai City Police has banned it at different points due to its interference with traffic and beach walkers. The sea is generally rough and waves are strong. There are fishermen colonies present {{at both ends of the}} beach. There are also joyrides, merry-go-rounds and mini giant wheels along the stretch, although they are installed without permission from any government agency.|$|E
500|$|After a preparatory {{school in}} Balham, Bax {{attended}} the Hampstead Conservatoire during the 1890s. The establishment was run – [...] "with considerable personal pomp", according to Bax – by Cecil Sharp, whose passion for English folk-song and folk-dance excited no response in his pupil. An enthusiasm for folk music was widespread among British composers {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, including Parry, Stanford, Vaughan Williams and Holst; Sullivan and Elgar stood aloof, as did Bax, who later put into general circulation the saying, [...] "You should <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk-dancing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{familiarity}} with long-established Babylonian tropes {{suggests that the}} Cylinder was authored by the Babylonian priests of Marduk, working {{at the behest of}} Cyrus. It can be compared with another work of around the same time, the Verse Account of Nabonidus, in which the former Babylonian ruler is excoriated as the enemy of the priests of Marduk and Cyrus is presented as the liberator of Babylon. Both works <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of stressing Cyrus's qualifications as a king from a line of kings, in contrast to the non-royal ancestry of Nabonidus, who is described by the Cylinder as merely maţû, [...] "insignificant".|$|E
500|$|In October 1919, the newspaper's {{headquarters}} {{moved to}} Cluj, and Agârbiceanu followed. Thanks to his literary activity, {{he was part}} of the leadership of the Romanian Writers' Society, and was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1919. He also began contributing to the reviews Gândirea of Cluj, and Flacăra and Cuget Românesc of Bucharest. In 1922, he accompanied other Writers' Society members on a celebratory tour of Transylvania. Like several of his colleagues, Agârbiceanu preserved a bitter memory of the war, and his articles of the time <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of referring to the Hungarians as a [...] "barbarian horde".|$|E
500|$|Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968, {{opening for}} The Byrds, before The Gun and The Deviants. Their {{performance}} was badly {{received by the}} audience and by other attending musicians, including Mick Jagger. In spite of this, the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals, but were received coldly and ignored by the press. In an interview with Melody Maker, Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England {{was due to the}} low wages they were offered and {{to the fact that they}} had very few danceable numbers to attract audience. He stressed that [...] "we <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of warning promoters that we are not a dancing group." ...|$|E

500|$|Shakespeare bequeathed {{the bulk}} of his large estate to his elder {{daughter}} Susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to [...] "the first son of her body". The Quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying. The Halls had one child, Elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending Shakespeare's direct line. Shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, Anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically. He did <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> however, of leaving her [...] "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation. Some scholars see the bequest as an insult to Anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.|$|E

In October 2012, in an interview with Allure, Conrad stated that while [...] "the story told wasn't a dishonest one, the way [...] did it sometimes was". She elaborated that scenes would be reenacted if cameras were not present for a significant occurrence between cast members, and commented that her relationship with Jenner was [...] "pretty brief" [...] and [...] "definitely [...] to drag it out". In July 2013, when discussing the filming of several alternate finale endings, MTV acknowledged that [...] "maybe the term 'reality TV' didn't perfectly apply to The Hills".|$|E
500|$|Quite common {{within its}} range, the leopard {{catshark}} is harmless to humans. It {{is a popular}} subject of public aquariums because of its small size, attractive appearance, and hardiness. The aquarium trade supports a minor fishery that targets the two Poroderma species. This shark is regularly caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and almost invariably discarded despite being edible. Nevertheless, fishing mortality {{is likely to be}} high as many fishers using line gear <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to kill hooked sharks, seeing them as pests that [...] "steal" [...] bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the leopard catshark beyond Data Deficient, though notes that its inshore habitat is heavily fished and otherwise impacted by human activity. The possible distribution of this shark across many small, distinct populations also warrants additional investigation and monitoring.|$|E
