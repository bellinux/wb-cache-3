5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had {{been a matter of}} lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography and previously discovered artifacts. Yoram Tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform as a clue to the Acra's possible position. During Benjamin Mazar's 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the <b>Mount,</b> <b>features</b> were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge cistern. In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the City of David.|$|E

50|$|The latest 5-inch/62 caliber version {{consists}} of a longer barrel L62 Mark 36 gun fitted on the same Mark 45 mount. The gun is designed for use against surface warships, anti-aircraft and shore bombardment to support amphibious operations. The gun <b>mount</b> <b>features</b> an automatic loader with a capacity of 20 rounds. These can be fired under full automatic control, taking {{a little over a}} minute to exhaust those rounds at maximum fire rate. For sustained use, the gun mount would be occupied by a six-man crew (gun captain, panel operator, and four ammunition loaders) below deck to keep the gun continuously supplied with ammunition.|$|E

50|$|The {{receiver}} housing has {{a proprietary}} claw-rail mounting system that permits the attachment {{of a standard}} Heckler & Koch quick-detachable scope mount (also used with the G3, HK33 and G3SG/1). It {{can be used to}} mount daytime optical sights (telescopic 4×24), night sights, reflex sights and laser pointers. The <b>mount</b> <b>features</b> two spring-actuated bolts, positioned along the base of the mount, which exert pressure on the receiver to hold the mount in the same position at all times assuring zero retention. All versions of the quick-detachable scope mount provide a sighting tunnel through the mount so that the shooter can continue to use the fixed iron sights with the scope mount attached {{to the top of the}} receiver.|$|E

50|$|The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was {{designed}} by E. S. Samozhenkov and entered service in 1961 and weighs 7.5 kg. The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was earlier envisioned for the Nikitin-Sokoiov machine gun that was not adopted by the Soviet Union. All types of ammunition belt boxes are carried and mounted separately. The Rakov device is used for loading ammunition belts. The PK machine gun {{is attached to a}} cradle on the 6T2 Samozhenkov mount. The cradle is hinged to a plug-in swivel equipped with a rack-and-pinion traversing mechanism, and a rod-and-screw elevation mechanism. The traversing mechanism is fitted with stops to limit the field of fire. For anti-aircraft fire or fire against ground targets from a kneeling position the cradle mounts a collapsible pole with a pivoting bracket. The <b>mount</b> <b>features</b> non-digging-in spades — sliding spades affect the accuracy of fire less than a «jumping» tripod with dug-in spades. There is an extra folding spade on the front leg for slippery and moving ground. Hinged tripod legs allow a gunner to fire the machine gun from a prone, a sitting, or a kneeling position.|$|E

Recent research at Sandia National Laboratories has demonstrated the importance of surface roughness on solder flow. This paper describes how chemical etching was used to enhance the solderability of surfaces that were normally difficult to wet. The effects of circuit geometry, etch concentration, and etching time on solder flow are discussed. Surface roughness and solder flow data are presented. The results clearly demonstrate the importance of surface roughness on the solderability of fine PWB surface <b>mount</b> <b>features...</b>|$|E
