500|$|Hydrogen cyanide, a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration, {{was first used}} as a pesticide in California in the 1880s.

It was banned after a similar product was used by Germany as a chemical weapon in World War I. In 1922, Degesch was purchased by Degussa, where a team of chemists that included [...] and Bruno Tesch developed a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included delousing clothing and disinfesting ships, warehouses, and trains.|$|E
