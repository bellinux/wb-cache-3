Maximum ice discrimination is achieved with combined C- and L-band full polarimetry, and collocated passive microwave imagery suggests greater than 90 percent classification accuracy.

At {{the time of the}} AIRSAR overflight, ground teams recorded the snow and firn (old snow) stratigraphy, grain size, density, and temperature at ice camps in three of the four snow zones identified by glaciologists to characterize four different degrees of summer melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The four snow zones are: (1) the dry-snow zone, at high elevation, where melting rarely occurs; (2) the percolation zone, where summer melting generates water that percolates down through the cold, porous, dry snow and then refreezes in place to form massive layers and pipes of solid ice; (3) the soaked-snow zone where melting saturates the snow with liquid water and forms standing lakes; and (4) the ablation zone, at the lowest elevations, where melting is vigorous enough to remove the seasonal snow cover and ablate the glacier ice. There is interest in mapping the spatial extent and temporal variability of these different snow zones repeatedly by using remote sensing techniques. The objectives of the 1991 experiment were to study changes in radar scattering properties across the different melting zones of the Greenland ice sheet, and relate the radar properties of the ice sheet to the snow and firn physical properties via relevant scattering mechanisms.

In this paper, we used <b>multifrequency</b> <b>polarimetric</b> synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> imagery acquired over a large area of the Yellowstone National Park (YNP) by the AIRSAR sensor, to estimate the distribution of forest biomass and canopy fuel loads.

These estimates when compared directly to measurements made at plot and stand levels, provided more than 70 % accuracy, and when partitioned into fuel load classes, provided more than 85 % accuracy. Specifically, the radar generated fuel parameters were in good agreement with the field-based fuel measurements, resulting in coefficients of determination of R(sup 2) = 85 for the canopy fuel weight, R(sup 2) =. 84 for canopy bulk density and R(sup 2) = 0. 78 for the foliage biomass...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of spatial statistics in <b>multifrequency</b> <b>polarimetric</b> Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar</b> (SAR) data is presented. The objective is to extract the intrinsic variability of the target by removing the variability from other sources. Three sources which contribute to the spatial variability in the returned power from a distributed target are modelled, they are (1) image speckle, (2) system noise, and (3) the intrinsic spatial variability of the target or texture. Speckle and system noise are modelled based on an understanding of the physics of the SAR imaging and processing systems. Texture is modelled as a random variable which modulates the mean returned power from a distributed target. An image model which accounts for all three sources of variability is presented. The presence of texture is shown to increase the image variance-to-mean square ratio and to introduce deviations of the image a u toco variance function from the expected SAR system response. Two textural parameters, the standard deviation of texture and its autocovariance coefficient, are examined. This statistical approach is illustrated using sea-ice SAR imagery acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory three-frequency polarimetric airborne SAR. Textural modulation of the signal has been detected in the imagery. Results show that for different sea-ice types the spatial statistics seem to vary more across frequency than across polarization and the observed differences increase in magnitude with decreasing frequency. The results also suggest the potential of this approach for discrimination of various sea-ice types and open water in single frequency, single polarization SAR data. Correlation of the spatial statistics to field measurements will be important for the verification of these observations. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

In this paper, a <b>multifrequency</b> multiaperture <b>polarimetric</b> synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> (MFMA POLSAR) system is proposed for imaging of moving targets in foliage. The MFMA POLSAR extends the multifrequency antenna array SAR (MF-SAR) system to multiple polarizations. Full polarization is used in MFMA POLSAR to achieve an optimal polarization adaptive to the environment such that the images obtained by different apertures are of the best coherence that is used to obtain the highest accuracy of the phase estimation.

40|$|Knowledge of {{subsurface}} {{characteristics such}} as permittivity variations and layering structure could provide a breakthrough in many terrestrial and planetary science disciplines. For Earth science, knowledge of subsurface and subcanopy soil moisture layers can enable the estimation of vertical flow in the soil column linking surface hydrologic processes with that in the subsurface. For planetary science, determining the existence of subsurface water and ice is {{regarded as one of}} the most critical information needs for the study of the origins of the solar system. The subsurface in general can be described as several near-parallel layers with rough interfaces. Each homogenous rough layer can be defined by its average thickness, permittivity, and rms interface roughness assuming a known surface spectral distribution. As the number and depth of layers increase, the number of measurements needed to invert for the layer unknowns also increases, and deeper penetration capability would be required. To nondestructively calculate the characteristics of the rough layers, a <b>multifrequency</b> <b>polarimetric</b> <b>radar</b> backscattering approach can be used. One such system is that we have developed for data prototyping of the Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (MOSS) mission concept. A tower-mounted radar makes backscattering measurements at VHF, UHF, and L-band frequencies. The radar is a pulsed CW system, which uses the same wideband antenna to transmit and receive the signals at all three frequencies. To focus the beam at various incidence angles within the beamwidth of the antenna, the tower is moved vertically and measurements made at each position. The signals are coherently summed to achieve focusing and image formation in the subsurface. This requires an estimate of wave velocity profiles. To solve the inverse scattering problem for subsurface velocity profile simultaneously with radar focusing, we use an iterative technique based on a forward numerical solution of the layered rough surface problem. The layers are each defined in terms of a small number of unknown distributions as given above. An a priori estimate of the solution is first assumed, based on which the forward problem is solved for the backscattered measurements. This is compared with the measured data and using iterative techniques an update to the solution for the unknowns is calculated. The process continues until convergence is achieved. Numerical results will be shown using actual radar data acquired with the MOSS tower radar system in Arizona in Fall 2003, and compared with in-situ measurements...|$|E
