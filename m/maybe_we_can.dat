500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E
500|$|The T-1000 and the T-800 {{engage in}} {{physical}} combat, {{with the more}} advanced model succeeding in incapacitating and shutting off the T-800. However, unbeknownst to the T-1000, the T-800 is able to bring itself back online using emergency power. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah but the T-800 takes it by surprise and shoots it into a vat of molten steel with an M79 grenade launcher, destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that {{to ensure that it}} is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to [...] "self-terminate", although John begs the Terminator to reconsider its decision. It bids them farewell as it is lowered into the vat. The Terminator gives a tearful John a hug and final thumbs-up as it disappears into the molten steel and shuts down. Sarah looks to the future with hope, musing that [...] "if a machine ... can learn the value of human life, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much {{has been}} made over {{the years of the}} unusual {{question}} mark suffix to the band's name. In early interviews the band said that the name was [...] "really deep" [...] and intended to raise the question [...] "do you need therapy?", but in a 1992 interview guitarist Andy Cairns admitted that it was a chance design when he was working on band's first record sleeve. Working with Letraset transfers, Cairns misaligned the band's name, and used the [...] "?" [...] icon to fill the space to the right. [...] "And then we thought, well <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> bluff our way through when people start reading into it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a December 3, 2009, {{interview}} with Rusty Humphries, Palin {{was asked about}} President Barack Obama's birth certificate.

I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers." [...] When asked if people had a legitimate reason to question the certificate, she stated, [...] "I think it's a fair question, just like I think past association and past voting records– all of that is fair game." [...] She also stated that the questions were 'fair play' because, [...] "the weird conspiracy theory freaky thing that people talk about that Trig isn't my real son– 'You need to produce his birth certificate, you need to prove that he's your kid,' which we have done.

They greatly outnumber the Romans--at least, the army by which we shall first be attacked--and <b>maybe,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> resist that, <b>we</b> may make terms with Rome for, assuredly, {{in the long run}} she must overpower us." ...|$|R

Channeling poststructural and posthumanist theoretical ideas, such as becoming, rhizomes, assemblages, intra-action, ethico-onto-epistemology, and entanglement, genocide education becomes less about facts, dates, and numbers (though those are still all important) and more {{about what it means to}} live in this worldour entangled entanglements, our response(ability) to ourselves and others (humans, nonhumans, and more-than-humans alike).

2500|$|On {{the final}} day, 3 wickets {{from each of}} Dominic Cork and Muttiah Muralitharan helped dismiss Worcestershire for 191 runs, with David Wigley unable to bat because of a broken hand {{sustained}} when James Anderson bowled a beamer {{at him in the}} first innings. After the match Cork talking about his match performance of 7 for 115 said, [...] "The ball is coming out well at the moment. I've worked hard with Mike Watkinson over the winter with it. It's early season and these sort of conditions suit a bowler like myself." [...] Watkinson, in response, spoke of Lancashire's determination to get straight back into the first Division after the disappointment of relegation last season, [...] ""We talked about {{the start of the season}} and the need to start well and to get a positive number in the wins column is a good feeling.

5000|$|Josie Kafka of Doux Reviews {{rated the}} episode with 2.5/4. [...] "TVD {{has been hit}} or miss all season, and I wonder if that is just, as they say, the new normal.

With others, we know to expect comedy every now and again, usually right before the big sad. <b>Maybe,</b> with TVD, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> expect a constant 2:1 ratio of good:awkward.

On September 14, 2009, Demonoid's torrent tracker went down {{after it was}} reported that they had {{experienced a}} number of hardware problems stemming from power outages.

On November 4, 2009, the tracker, which communicates with a BitTorrent client, began responding to some torrents, and returned to full operation on November 17.

5000|$|Twenty-seven Olympic gold medals, two silver {{medals and}} one bronze medal ~ {{that is what}} Bengal's hockey can boast of. However, all that is history and Kolkata no longer has a hockey Olympian. Despite its {{pioneering}} role {{in the history of}} Indian hockey, Kolkata is the only major metropolis in India without an artificial turf. “How can you hope to produce international class players if you cannot give the players astroturf to play on?” asks Gurbux Singh, secretary of the Bengal Hockey Association. Leslie Claudius agreed that the absence of astroturf is responsible for this decline, but added: “Ours was a different era. We were successful, so the enthusiasm for the game was naturally high. How can you have that today? Even the educational institutions are not interested in hockey nowadays. But you can’t blame them. Young people don't find hockey exciting enough. <b>Maybe</b> if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> give them astroturf, the fast surface can lure them back into the game.” ...|$|R

30|$|As to this issue’s aim {{to probe}} the notion of technoscience, we {{conclude}} that the realisation of a creationist idea(l) within research practices might mark a new era.

This shift is so fundamental, that it is difficult to delineate when looking at individual material practices and technoscientific output that builds upon earlier scientific achievements; but it becomes evident in the narratives that accompany science and technoscience, in current multidisciplinary research ensembles and in the ways (techno)science is made sense of in society.|$|R
