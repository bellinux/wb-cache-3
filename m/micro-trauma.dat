40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} {{are one of}} the most common chronic disorders and can develop from repetitive <b>micro-traumas,</b> which occurs often from one’s occupation. Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) cost the United States billions of dollars annually. Many traditional therapeutic interventions, like manual therapy. electrical stimulation and hot and cold packs, are being utilized to treat WMSD however there is minimal evidence supporting the use of these interventions to treat WMSD. Therefore, ergonomic interventions (EI) has been proposed as a conservative, non-invasive, and cost-effective intervention to treat WMSD as it functions to correct the cause of repetitive <b>micro-traumas</b> due to one’s occupation by adjusting posture, workstations design, and product selection. Aim: The aim of this paper is to (a) briefly overview the theories of WMSD and EI (b) analyze the efficacy of traditional therapeutic interventions (c) establish the practical applications of EI (d) analyze the efficacy of EI, (e) discuss the contraindications of EI and (f) draw conclusions and discuss the future directions of EI in preventing WMSD. Results and Discussion: It was found that traditional therapeutic interventions provides only short-term pain relief for musculoskeletal disorders, prompting the need for a different approach. EI was found to have promising results in treating WMSD, however there is limited evidence in the form of randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) to truly determine the efficacy of EI in addressing WMSD. Further research is needed to determine the efficacy of EI and the long term effects of this intervention in treating WMSD...|$|R

40|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is an {{acquired}} idiopathic lesion of subchondral bone {{that can produce}} delamination and sequestration with or without articular cartilage involvement and instability. The cause of OCD is still debated: the most recognized etiology is the occurrence of repetitive <b>micro-traumas</b> associated with vascular impairment, causing progressive ankle pain and dysfunction in skeletally immature and young adult patients. Ankle OCD is classically located in the medial part of the talus, while lateral and posterior involvement is less frequent. Diagnosis of OCD, based on MRI findings, is quite straightforward; MRI examination can also be very useful for dating the defect and obtaining information about the associated bone bruise. Osteochondritis dissecans, if not recognized and treated appropriately, may lead to secondary osteoarthritis with pain and functional limitation. Surgical treatment is mandatory especially in young patients with unstable cartilage fragments.

40|$|Occupational {{diseases}} {{are a significant}} issue worldwide. These diseases cause major economic and social problems and influence statistics representing sick-leave periods, disabilities, and even deaths. In the developed countries, work within {{the health care system}} is considered among the jobs that are associated with highest risk of developing occupational skin diseases, diseases caused by biological materials as well as illnesses of musculoskeletal systems. In the European Union, approximately 15 % of the employees state that they spend over a half of their working day in the environment that is polluted with toxic materials. Within the health care system and the social care sector, 17 % of the employees manage or are exposed to toxic materials and products, while 12 % work in the environment where, in the air that they breathe, there are aerosols, dust, and biological materials. Between 4. 0 % and 13. 0 % of the European Union employees think that their immediate work environment is directly related with health problems. Up to 13 % of the personnel working in the health care system and the social care sector are convinced that chemical materials present in the work environment serve as causes of skin problems that they experience. In the United States, up to 14 % of the health care personnel develop bronchial asthma, an illness that is caused by working conditions. Moreover, 43 % of nurses and 29 % of doctors experience <b>micro-traumas</b> (pricking – in the majority of cases). As a result, they can be affected by biological materials. In Europe, the risk of musculoskeletal diseases is highest in the spheres of agriculture, construction works, and health care sector. The standardized rates of musculoskeletal system diseases for 100, 000 employees are highest in the health care and the social care sectors, i. e. 4, 260 cases. Up to 37. 5 % of the health care and the social care personnel experience work related stress, 15. 0 % ─ depression, and 10. 3 % ─ anxiety. These employees suffer from fatigue which they experience as a consequence of psychological stress caused by long-time contact with suffering (ill) people or as a reaction to a patient’s death. 5. 3 % of the health care and the social care personnel experience abuse at work places, and 15. 7 % ─ threats. In recent years, abuse and threat at work places, as a major factor influencing work environment, has received much attention. There had been earlier reports regarding victims’ pain, emotional distress, physical invalidation, and ruining of a career though, only in recent years, the problem has been subjected to scholarly investigation. An in-depth research has been performed in Scandinavian countries, where there exist important factors such as informed society, state financed studies, and strict laws governing abuse. In 2003, 13, 682 doctors, 2, 372 dentists, 26, 229 nurses, 2, 390 pharmacists, 1, 245 pharmaceutical assistants, and 7, 894 other specialists with university or college degree worked the health care sector in Lithuania. In the same year, health care personnel constituted 3. 74 % {{of the total number of}} employees in Lithuania. The data, if interpreted with regard to the occurrence of occupational diseases, reveals a peculiar phenomenon – the occurrence of occupational diseases among the health care system personnel is only 1. 75 % of the diagnosed occupational diseases in Lithuania or 0. 0009 % of the total number of the employees in Lithuania. The present study aims to assess the interdependence between health problems among nurses and work environment in the health care institution (X) as well as to suggest means for the prevention of health problems. For the fulfillment of the aims, the following objectives were formulated: 1. 	To investigate data obtained from the nurses regarding their subjective assessment of health condition and work environment. 2. 	To determine and to assess the prevailing health related problems and to investigate their dependence on chemical factors within work environment of the nurses in the institution (X). 3. 	To determine and to assess the prevailing health related problems and to investigate their dependence on psychological factors within work environment of the nurses in the institution (X). 4. 	To determine and to assess ergonomic work conditions and to delineate interdependence with the impairment of musculoskeletal system. The novelty of the present research is embedded in the fact that it has been the first time that a complex study of the interdependence between health problems of the health care sector personnel and their work environment has been conducted. Within the Lithuanian context, for the first time, research into ergonomic work conditions of nurses has been done using research framework developed at Cornell University, USA (Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire). This has been used to determine the relationship between ergonomic factors of work environment and health problems of the musculoskeletal system. The present research will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the specificities related to work conditions of nurses in health care institutions of Lithuania. By extension, it will help find ways to reduce hazardous factors within work environment. The relationship between health problems and work environment determined in the present study will enable to define priorities leading to improvement of work conditions not only in the target institution but also in other health care institutions of Lithuania.

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that muscle {{repetitive}} stress injuries (RSIs) are often related to sport trainings among young participants. As such, understanding the mechanism of RSIs is essential for injury prevention. One potential means would be to identify muscles in risk by applying biomechanical modeling. By capturing 3 D movements of four typical youth sports and building the biomechanical models, the current study has identified several risk factors related to the development of RSIs. The causal factors for RSIs are the muscle over-lengthening, the impact-like (speedy increase) eccentric tension in muscles, imbalance between agonists and antagonists, muscle loading frequency and muscle strength. In general, a large range of motion of joints would lead to over-lengthening of certain small muscles; Limb’s acceleration during power generation could cause imbalance between agonists and antagonists; a quick deceleration of limbs during follow-throughs would induce an impact-like eccentric tension to muscles; and even at low speed, frequent muscle over-lengthening would cause a <b>micro-trauma</b> accumulation which could result in RSIs in long term. Based on the results, the following measures can be applied {{to reduce the risk of}} RSIs during learning/training in youth participants: (1) stretching training of muscles at risk in order to increase lengthening ability; (2) dynamic warming-up for minimizing possible imbalance between agonists and antagonists; (3) limiting practice times of the frequency and duration of movements requiring strength and/or large range of motion to reducing <b>micro-trauma</b> accumulation; and (4) allowing enough repair time for recovery from micro-traumas induced by training (individual training time). Collectively, the results show that biomechanical modeling is a practical tool for predicting injury risk and provides an effective way to establish an optimization strategy to counteract the factors leading to muscle repetitive stress injuries during motor skill learning and training.|$|E
30|$|The {{current study}} explore the {{potential}} use of biomechanical modeling {{in the prevention}} of muscle injuries related to repetitive movement during complex motor skill learning and training in youth sports. The study aimed to (1) reveal the ROM characteristics and the dynamic muscles lengthening of selected motor skills, (2) identify muscles at risk (lengthening > 120  % of its resting length), and (3) compare kinematics of similar skills with different injury rates in order to provide insight into risk assessment and muscle injury prevention. The results of the 4 selected motor-skill {{studies have shown that the}} quantification of ROM, muscles lengthening, and the skills comparison help us reveal factors leading to RSIs. Specifically, the results have unveiled that repetitive over-lengthening and impact-like eccentric loading on muscles are the primary casual-factors of RSIs. Muscle stiffness during learning, practice frequency, duration and strength of loading as well as recovery time could jointly contribute to the development of RSIs (i.e. <b>micro-trauma</b> accumulation). Based on the results, measures for reducing the risk of such injuries related to complex skills’ learning and training in youth sport could be: (1) identifying muscles at risk among popular youth physical activities through biomechanical modeling; (2) targeted stretching training of muscles at risk in order to increase lengthening ability; (3) dynamic muscle warming-up before practice for minimizing possible imbalance between agonists and antagonists; (4) limiting practice times of the frequency and duration of intense movements during training with the aim of reducing <b>micro-trauma</b> accumulation; (5) involving more targeted eccentric-loading training on muscles at risk to raise muscles’ capacity against impact-like eccentric loading and (6) allowing enough repair time for recovery from micro-traumas induced by repetitive training (individual training time). Collectively, the results show that biomechanical modeling is a practical tool for predicting injury risk and provides an effective way to establish an optimization strategy to counteract the factors leading to muscle repetitive stress injuries during motor skill learning and training.|$|E
30|$|Medical {{documentation}} {{has shown}} {{that one of the}} most common leg RSIs in soccer is muscle or tendon strain, which occur over time due to stress on the muscles (including soft tissues) without sufficient time for self-healing and/or an imbalance between agonists and antagonists (Garrrett 2002). The results of this study (i.e. the large ROMs of both the hip and the knee) would suggest that the strain and the imbalance between agonists and antagonists could happen during repetitive over-lengthening of muscle fibers in an improper training program. Therefore, for injury prevention during soccer learning and training, coaches and trainers should pay special attention to the following aspects: (1) stretching training of muscles at risk, (2) dynamic muscle warm-up before practice, (3) limiting practice times of repetitive kicking training, and (4) individual training time. The first aspect would increase muscle lengthening ability. Well trained muscles could reach 180  % of its rest length without injury (Wilkerson 1997). The second one would ascertain that muscle tightness can be minimized; as such the coordination efficiency between agonists and antagonists will be improved. The third one would slow down the rate of <b>micro-trauma</b> accumulation—a key cause of RSIs (Visentin and Shan 2004). The last one will allow individual to have enough repair cycles during periods of relative inactivity in order to allow a self-healing of the <b>micro-trauma</b> accumulated (Visentin and Shan 2004). Unlike impact injuries where there is virtually no time between loading and injury, repair cycles play an import role in prevention of RSIs. Coaches and trainers should be aware that the development of RSIs depends on a net of two biological processes—microtrauma accumulation and repair cycles (Visentin and Shan 2004) and if the microtrauma accumulation is faster than the repair cycles, muscle soreness will occur, resulting additionally in imbalance between agonists and antagonists (Bejjani 1987; Schickendantz et al. 2009). The best prevention would be to keep a dynamic balancing between microtrauma accumulation and repair cycles. In doing so, individual training time is required in practice, as individual muscle soreness requires different recovery time.|$|E

Since exposure to high physical demands is a major risk factor for musculoskeletal injury, monitoring and managing such physical activity levels in workers is a potentially important injury prevention strategy. Current injury monitoring practices are inadequate {{for the provision of}} clinically valuable information about the tissue specific responses to physical exertion. Injury of various soft tissue structures can manifest over time through accumulation of <b>micro-trauma.</b> Such <b>micro-trauma</b> has a propensity to increase the risk of acute injuries to soft-tissue structures such as muscle or tendon. As such, the capacity to monitor biomarkers that result from the disruption of these tissues offers a means of assisting the pre-emptive management of subclinical injury prior to acute failure or for evaluation of recovery processes. Here we have adopted an in-vivo exercise induced muscle damage model allowing the application of laboratory controlled conditions to assist in uncovering biochemical indicators associated with soft-tissue trauma and recovery. Importantly, urine was utilised as the diagnostic medium since it is non-invasive to collect, more acceptable to workers and less costly to employers. Moreover, it is our hypothesis that exercise induced tissue degradation products enter the circulation and are subsequently filtered by the kidney and pass through to the urine. To test this hypothesis a range of metabolomic and proteomic discovery-phase techniques were used, along with targeted approaches. Several small molecules relating to tissue damage were identified along with a series of skeletal muscle-specific protein fragments resulting from exercise induced soft-tissue damage. Each of the potential biomolecular markers appeared to be temporally present within urine. Moreover, the regulation of abundance seemed to be associated with functional recovery following the injury. This discovery may have important clinical applications for monitoring of a variety of inflammatory myopathies as well as novel applications in monitoring of the musculoskeletal health status of workers, professional athletes and/or military personnel to reduce the onset of potentially debilitating musculoskeletal injuries within these professions...|$|E

Secondary to orthodontic movement, several local anti-resorptive and pro-resorptive cytokines {{have been observed}} [11 – 13]. Pro-resorptive cytokines such as interleukin (IL)- 1 family (i.e. IL- 1 β), IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 8 and TNF-α. IL- 1 β which directly induce osteoclastogenesis and promote osteoclast function [14, 15]. Similarly, IL- 6 acts synergistically with IL- 1 and TNF-α on osteoclastogenesis and promotes osteoclast function [14, 15]. IL- 7 works indirectly through the induction of TNF-α, an important augmenter of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) mediated osteoclastogenesis [16] while IL- 8 enhances RANKL expression [17], both increase osteoclast generation and activates osteoclasts. On the other hand, the anti-resorptive cytokine such as IL- 4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) suppresses osteoclastogenesis and T-cell of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, respectively [18, 19].

After one week the second part of the examination was carried out for TMJ problems and pain and tenderness levels of masticatory muscles. Data was analyzed using Wilcoxon statistical test. Results. Women showed more pain compared to men. There was a significant increase in pain in the external acoustic meatus examination one week after root canal therapy. Patients who were treated for their posterior teeth suffered more pain than those who were treated for the anteriors and premolars. Other aspects of the examination were not affected significantly by lengthy root canal therapy. Conclusion. Lengthy dental treatments can harm TMJ and masticatory muscles and wide opening of the mouth during such appointments can worsen the situation. Therefore, it is wise to break the appointment into shorter intervals and let the patients rest during treatment to close their mouth to prevent iatrogenic damage to TMJ...|$|E
40|$|Overuse {{injuries}} are generally {{defined as a}} repetitive <b>micro-trauma</b> to tissue. Many researchers have associated particular biomechanical parameters {{as an indicator of}} such injuries. However, while these parameters have been reported in single studies, in many instances, it has been difficult to verify these parameters as causative to the injury. We have investigated overuse injuries, such as patella-femoral pain syndrome, using a dynamical systems approach. Using such methods, the importance of the structure of coordinative variability (i. e. the variability of the interaction between segments or joints) becomes apparent. We view coordinative variability as functionally important to the movement and different from end-point or goal variability. Using concepts derived from the work of Bernstein, we conducted studies using a continuous relative phase and/or modified vector coding approaches to investigate the coordinative variability of overuse injuries. Consistently, we have found that the higher variability state of a coordinative structure is the healthy state while the lower variability state is the unhealthy or pathological state. It is clear that very high coordinative variability could also result in injury and that there must be a window of ‘higher variability’ in which non-injured athletes function. While this finding that coordinative variability is functional has been shown in several studies, it is still not clear if reduced variability contributes to or results from the injury. Studies are currently underway to determine the potential reasons for the reduced variability in injured athletes. Nevertheless, our laboratory believes that this understanding of how joints interact can be important in understanding overuse injuries...|$|E
40|$|Pencak Silat is a martial {{art that}} has a risk of causing <b>micro-trauma</b> due to {{physical}} impact. This trauma will stimulate the secretion of prostaglandin, a compound in the body which is a mediator of pain and inflammatory response that promote pain in bruised trauma. Passion fruit contains high level of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant substances. The objective {{of this study was}} to understand the effectiveness of passion fruit juice consumption in reducing bruised trauma pain in Pencak Silat athletes of PSHT Belotan Magetan. The research design is a quantitative descriptive with quasi-experimental. The pretest and posttest group of 20 people PSHT Belotan Magetan Pencak Silat athletes with an average age of 13. 4 ± 0. 94 years were divided into treatment group (K 1) and control group (K 0) with 10 subjects respectively. Each treatment group (K 1) subject was given the juice twice a day for 10 consecutive days. We used paired sample T-test to assess the mean variance of the group. The result showed that there was a decrease of pain intensity in both the treatment group and the control group. The pain intensity difference assessed by a Bourbonnais Rating Scale in the treatment group showed a significant difference with the t value of 7, 216 and a probability value of 0, 000, while the control group showed t value of 3, 000 and probability value of 0, 015. There was a decrease in the athlete 2 ̆ 7 s muscle soreness who were given passion fruit juice twice a day for 10 days. The athlete 2 ̆ 7 s pain intensity was in middle category...|$|E
