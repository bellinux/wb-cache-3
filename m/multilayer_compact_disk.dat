40|$|WO 2005083702 A UPAB: 20051011 NOVELTY - Device {{for writing}} to a {{standard}} audio <b>compact</b> <b>disk</b> writes parametric multi-channel information (16 B) to the disk {{in areas that are}} not used for the two channel stereo sound information, e. g. in the user sub- channels. The parametric multi-channel information permits, together with the two base channels, a multi-channel audio representation using more than two audio channels. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:- (A) a <b>compact</b> <b>disk</b> with additional multi- channel sound playback information; (B) a device for playing a <b>compact</b> <b>disk</b> with multi-channel information; (C) a method for writing multi-channel information to a <b>compact</b> <b>disk</b> and; (D) a method for playing a <b>compact</b> <b>disk</b> with multi- channel information. USE - Writing of multi-channel information to an audio CD and playback of such a CD. ADVANTAGE - The invention permits playing of multi-channel enhanced audio CDs in existing CD audio systems. Such systems can be easily upgraded with an upgrade unit {{to take full advantage of}} the additional multi-channel information...|$|R
