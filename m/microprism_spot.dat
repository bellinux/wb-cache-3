50|$|Leitz also {{addressed}} {{complaints about the}} original Leicaflex focusing screen in the SL focusing screen, which offered a ground-glass focusing screen with a central <b>microprism</b> <b>spot.</b> This more conventional configuration did not prevent it from being very bright and comfortable.|$|E
5000|$|Leicaflex - 1964/5 - {{sometimes}} called the Standard - built-in external light meter, clear focusing screen with centre <b>microprism</b> <b>spot.</b> There {{was a great deal}} of pressure to introduce a Leica SLR because of the phenomenal success of the Nikon F (1959).|$|E
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} {{also has}} a focusing screen with a <b>microprism</b> <b>spot</b> focusing aid. The Pentax K1000 SE substitutes a split image rangefinder plus microprism collar focusing screen. The K1000 SE is otherwise identical to the regular K1000, except that the SE's from {{the first two years}} of production in late 1977 to 1978 used a Black Diamond patterned leatherette (Pre 780XXX serial number) for approximately 2500 units and then a brown leather instead of black after that on the later early SE models.|$|E

5000|$|In 1968, Leitz {{responded to}} the critics of the non-TTL meter of the {{original}} Leicaflex by introducing its successor the Leicaflex SL with a TTL meter. The SL designation in the name was an abbreviation of [...] "Selective Light", the name chosen by Leitz for its implementation of TTL metering. This system metered a limited area represented by the viewfinder's central <b>microprism</b> <b>spot.</b> At a time when SLR manufacturers were divided between those embracing TTL metering at full aperture (such as Nikon and Konica), and those with mounts which permitted only stop-down metering (such as Pentax and Canon), Leitz chose to implement full aperture metering on the Leicaflex SL.|$|E
