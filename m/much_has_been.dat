5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare is a herbivore, {{and mostly}} feeds on moorland grasses such as bentgrass (Agrostis), goosegrass (Eleusine), Festuca, fountaingrass (Pennisetum) and bluegrass (Poa). At such altitudes {{in which the}} Ethiopian highland hare lives, {{it is expected to}} reproduce in dry seasons. The female produces one offspring per breeding season. Not <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recorded about its reproduction and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. <b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{written about the}} level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E

Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. <b>Much</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done and <b>much</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private <b>had</b> <b>been</b> flogged, and it <b>had</b> actually <b>been</b> hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid {{for many of these}} improvements since 1999.|$|E
5|$|During the Queen's tenure <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done, {{not only}} to restore and {{maintain}} {{the fabric of the}} building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of the}} Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E

25|$|Major Rock Edict XIV Ashoka said, My dominions are wide, and <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> written, and I shall cause {{still more}} to be written. And some {{of this has been}} stated again and again because of the charm of certain topics and in order that men should act accordingly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{written about}} the {{degradation}} and depletion of natural fish stocks in rivers, estuaries, and the oceans (see also Overfishing). Because industrial fishing has become extremely efficient, ocean stocks of large fish, such as tuna, cod, and halibut have declined by 90% in the past 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Though not <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> written {{specifically}} on the reproductive cycle of S. bullata, Sarcophagids {{are thought to be}} consistent within the family when it comes to life cycle. The eggs themselves are about 0.5 to 3.5 millimeters in length and 0.12 to 0.8 millimeters in width, though hatching occurs within the uterus just before the deposition of larvae.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{provisions}} nor water, {{beyond what}} might be necessary in pulling to the wreck, nor ropes, nor blocks, nor any thing but arms and ammunition, were taken in the boats; for {{the examination of the}} morning had shown the captain, that, notwithstanding so <b>much</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> plundered, a sufficiency still remained in the stranded vessel. Indeed, the fact that so <b>much</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> left was one of his reasons for hastening off himself, as he deemed it certain that they who had taken away what was gone, would soon return for the remainder. The fowling-pieces and pistols, with all the powder and ball in the ship, were taken: a light gun that was on board, for the purpose of awaking sleepy pilots, being left loaded, with the intention of serving for a signal of alarm, should any material change occur in the situation of the ship.|$|R
