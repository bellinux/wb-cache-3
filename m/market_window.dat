40|$|Risk {{consideration}} {{is a valuable}} assessment aid when making strategic software design decisions. Expressing development considerations in terms of risk exposures over an independent variable (e. g. time, cumulative effort, etc.) enables the quantitative assessment of typically qualitative attributes. Assuming total risk exposure is additive over individual risk exposure functions, optimal levels for the individual considerations can be identified as function of loss-magnitude and loss-probability estimates for risk sources. Such levels provide strategic trade off considerations (with respect to risk) and have proven valuable in several previous applications such as “how much testing is enough ” with respect to defect removal and <b>market</b> <b>window</b> strategic risk considerations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} report is to evaluate the pricing performance of market advisory services for the 1995 - 2000 corn and soybean crops. Certain explicit assumptions are made to produce a consistent and comparable set of results across the different advisory programs. These assumptions are intended to accurately depict "real-world" marketing conditions. Several key assumptions are: i) with a few exceptions, the <b>marketing</b> <b>window</b> for a crop year runs from September before harvest through August after harvest, ii) cash prices and yields refer to a central Illinois farm, iii) storage is assumed to occur at on-farm or commercial sites, and iv) marketing loan recommendations made by advisory programs are followed wherever feasible. Based on these assumptions, the net price received by a subscriber to market advisory programs is calculated for the 1995 - 2000 corn and soybean crops. Market and farmer benchmarks are developed for the performance evaluations. Two market benchmarks are specified {{in order to test}} the fragility of performance results to changing benchmark assumptions. The 24 -month market benchmark averages market prices for the entire 24 -month <b>marketing</b> <b>window.</b> The 20 -month market benchmark is computed in a similar fashion, except the first four months of the <b>marketing</b> <b>window</b> are omitted. The farmer benchmark is based upon the USDA average price received series for corn and soybeans in Illinois. The same assumptions applied to advisory program track records are used when computing the market and farmer benchmarks. Four basic indicators of performance are applied to advisory program prices and revenues over 1995 - 2000. The results provide limited evidence that advisory programs as a group outperform market benchmarks, particularly after considering risk. In contrast, substantial evidence exists that advisory programs as a group outperform the farmer benchmarks, even after taking risk into account. Whether the superior performance of advisory programs versus the farmer benchmark is attributed to luck or skill depends on one's theoretical perspective. Efficient market theory favors a luck interpretation, while behavioral market theory favors a skill interpretation. Regardless of the theoretical perspective, {{there is little evidence that}} advisory programs with superior performance can be usefully selected based on past performance. Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} report is to evaluate the pricing performance of market advisory services for the 1995 - 2004 corn and soybean crops. Marketing assumptions applied to advisory program track records are intended to accurately depict “real-world” marketing conditions facing a representative central Illinois corn and soybean farmer. Several key assumptions are: i) with a few exceptions, the <b>marketing</b> <b>window</b> for a crop year runs from September before harvest through August after harvest, ii) on-farm or commercial physical storage costs, as well as interest opportunity costs, are charged to post-harvest sales, iii) brokerage costs are subtracted for all futures and options transactions and iv) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) marketing loan recommendations made by advisory programs are followed wherever feasible. Based on these and other assumptions, the net price received by a subscriber to market advisory programs is calculated for the 1995 - 2004 corn and soybean crops. Market and farmer benchmarks are developed for the performance evaluations. Two market benchmarks are specified {{in order to test}} the sensitivity of performance results to changing benchmark assumptions. The 24 -month market benchmark averages market prices for the entire 24 -month <b>marketing</b> <b>window.</b> The 20 -month market benchmark is computed in a similar fashion, except the first four months of the <b>marketing</b> <b>window</b> are omitted. Given the uncertainties involved in measuring the average price received by farmers, two alternative farmer benchmarks for central Illinois are specified. The market and farmer benchmarks are computed using the same assumptions applied to advisory program track records. Five basic indicators of performance are applied to advisory program prices and revenues over 1995 - 2004. Results show that advisory program prices fall in the top-third of the price range relatively infrequently. There is limited evidence that advisory programs as a group outperform market benchmarks, particularly after considering risk. The evidence is somewhat more positive with respect to farmer benchmarks, even after taking risk into account. For example, the average advisory return relative to the farmer benchmarks is 8 to $ 12 per acre with only a marginal increase in risk. Even though this return is small and mainly from corn, it nonetheless represents a non-trivial increase in net farm income per acre for grain farms in central Illinois. Test results also suggest {{that it is difficult to}} predict the year-to-year pricing performance of advisory programs based on past pricing performance. However, there is some evidence that performance is more predictable over longer time horizons, particularly at the extremes of performance rankings. The results raise the interesting possibility that even though advisory services do not appear to “beat the market,” they nonetheless provide the opportunity for some farmers to improve performance relative to the market. Mirroring debates about stock investing, the relevant issue is whether farmers can most effectively improve marketing performance by pursuing “active” strategies, like those recommended by advisory services, or “passive” strategies, which involve routinely spreading sales across the <b>marketing</b> <b>window.</b> Agricultural Finance, Financial Economics,...|$|R
