40|$|Three months ago, Mr Azizi Mustafa, the Head of Youth Development Division in Perlis Youth and Sport Department (PYSD) {{was called}} upon by <b>Mr</b> <b>Karim,</b> his {{director}} {{for an emergency}} meeting. Judging by his body language, Azizi knew that <b>Mr</b> <b>Karim</b> was unhappy. Something wasn’t quite right, assumed Azizi. <b>Mr</b> <b>Karim</b> then showed him {{a letter from the}} Ministry of Youth and Sport in which PYSD was required to submit a special report regarding department’s failure to produce many young entrepreneurs in Perlis As the person in charge of the youth development program, he knew that the ministry was actually referring to their flagship program known as the Entrepreneurship Training Program (ETP). On his desk, there were several claim forms submitted by the facilitators from the previous program. The amount was almost RM 10, 000. It is almost similar to the limit of each loan provided by the department to successful applicant. He looked on the wall of his office. Several pictures of successful entrepreneurs coming through their program were hanging there. One of them received Entrepreneur of The Year from Malaysia Prime Minister three years ago. Another one on his right just signing a contract worth RM 2 million to supply IT system for a multinational corporation. However, he knew that the numbers was still not enough. Although numerous efforts have been undertaken via various training programs to promote and educate young Malaysian in Perlis to involve in entrepreneurship, the actual numbers who eventualy becoming an entrepreneur was far from encouraging. Both Mr Azizi and <b>Mr</b> <b>Karim</b> knew the importance of entrepreneurs in driving the nation’s economic growth as well as combating unemployment issues. In fact, numerous efforts have been taken by PYSD via the ETP programs to nurture entrepreneurships at all levels involving all kind of activities such as seminars, training, short courses and conferences. Despite all these, the effectiveness of PYSD entrepreneurship training programs remains debatable. Azizi remember two of his favourite quotes by Peter Drucker: “Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It is a practice" and “What gets measured gets improved” Azizi realized that he need to act fast. He formed a special team and set a three months timeline to carry out the investigation...|$|R

40|$|Benzene is {{classified}} by the IARC as carcinogenic to humans. Several sources may contribute for {{the occurrence of}} this toxic compound in foods, such as, environmental and process contamination and the oxidative decarboxilation of benzoic acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid. Benzoate salts and ascorbic acid may be naturally present or added as food additives. A screening for the presence of benzene in foods of the Belgian market was performed. 400 food samples were purchased in local supermarkets. Food selection was based on several criteria, including the natural presence of benzoate, the presence of benzoate as a food additive, the potential presence of environmental or process contaminations, etc. Food samples were analyzed by distillation and isotope dilution HS-GC/MS. This method was fully validated [1] and presents detection limits below the legal limit established by the European Council for benzene in drinking water (1 µg L- 1). Precautions were taken to prevent losses of benzene and/or artefactual benzene formation from benzoic acid during analysis. Preliminary results of 290 samples analysed showed the presence of benzene in 64 % of the samples. 36 % of the samples contained benzene above 1 µg L- 1 and 23 samples (8 %) presented benzene concentrations above 10 µg L- 1. The highest benzene contents were found in coffee, tea and fish products. These high concentrations are possibly due to the production process or specific nature of the food samples. The high number of contaminated samples suggests that environmental contamination of benzene in the food chain should not be underestimated. References [1] R. M. Vinci, M. Canfyn, B.
