Multilateral cooperation may allow nation states to overcome many of globalization's effects. The two prospects for multilateral cooperation are {{the creation of an}} international tax organization and a <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> to replace the current bilateral tax treaty network. Whereas there is currently no organization responsible for the surveillance of the international tax system, such an organization is within the realm of possibility. The perfect home for such an organization would be the OECD given its large expertise and history in taxation. However for political reasons it is difficult to foresee such scenario in the near future. A more likely prospect is the creation of a series of multilateral tax treaties for economic regions. This {{is due to the fact}} that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treaty,</b> as demonstrated by the Nordic Tax Convention, can be most successful within a group of nations that share close cooperation and highly integrated economies such as members of the EU or NAFTA already tied together through trade agreements...|$|E

On the other hand, they may be related when viewed as sequential steps in the process toward developing sustained economic relationships. This article will attempt to bridge that gap. First, Part II of this article discusses the current United States approach toward taxation of international athletes. Next, Part III reviews the history and issues facing tax treaty negotiations between the United States and developing countries, with a focus on the negotiation sticking points between the United States and Brazil. Finally, Part IV of this article argues that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> regarding the singular issue of international athletes is a viable tool to help strengthen economic relations in the Americas.

Thus, dealing with cross-border taxation matters turns {{into one of the}} significant financial and trade projects of China, and the problems of cross-border taxation is still increasing. In order to solve the problems, the <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> between countries, which can provide legal support to help enterprises from both sides with double taxation avoidance and tax issues solutions, are established. To fulfill the [...] "going global" [...] strategy of China and support the domestic enterprises to adapt to the globalization situation, China has been making efforts on promoting and signing <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> with other countries to achieve mutual interests. By the end of November 2016, China has officially signed 102 double taxation avoidance agreements. Out of which 98 agreements have already entered into force. In addition, China signed double taxation avoidance arrangement with Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Region. China also signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Taiwan in August 2015, which has not entered into force yet. According to the Chinese State Administration of Taxation, the first double taxation avoidance agreement was signed with Japan in September 1983. The latest agreement was signed with Cambodia in October 2016. As for the situation of state disruption, China would continue the signed agreement after the disruption. For example, China first signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic in June 1987. In 1990, Czechoslovakia divided into two countries, Czech Republic and Slovakia Republic, and the initial agreement signed with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic was continually used in two new countries. In August 2009, China signed the new agreement with Czech Republic. And {{when it comes to the}} special case of Germany, China continued using the agreement with The Federal Republic of Germany after two Germanys reunited. China have signed double taxation avoidance agreement with many countries. Among them, there are not only countries which have made large investment in China, but also countries which as well-relationship recipient of Chinese investment. As for the agreement quantity, China is now next only to United Kingdom. For those countries which have not signed the double taxation avoidance agreements with China, some of them signed information exchange agreements with China.|$|R

The other is political philosophy, and especially Brennan and Buchanan’s "veil of uncertainty".

The fundamental idea behind the various BEPS projects is that the OECD has fully embraced the idea that double non-taxation can have as deleterious consequences as double taxation and that therefore the various aspects of the current rules that enable multinational enterprises (MNEs) to achieve double non-taxation should be reconsidered. The BEPS Action Plan, adopted by the OECD in July 2013, sets an ambitious time table for the various items, which are supposed to be achieved either by September 2014 or at the latest by December 2015.

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} {{foundation for the}} field of international tax law. The Article refers to this foundation as the institutional competence of nations in global economic development. A nation’s institutional competence is its discretion to make decisions in pursuit of our collective goal of global economic development, discretion that is subject {{to a number of}} standards and limitations. The Article constructs the institutional competence of nations in global economic development from institutional economics, simple game theory, and the literature on social norms. The Article expresses the institutional competence of nations through standards and limitations that reduce the abuse of sovereign discretion and address international collective action problems in the pursuit of global economic development. These standards and limitations allocate prescriptive jurisdiction among nations over the global income tax base. The foundation proposed by the Article would coordinate international taxation with the international regulation of trade. The Article also addresses the proper place of capital export neutrality in the hierarchy of values for economic development, the choice between territorial and worldwide tax systems, the evaluation of tax havens and appropriate responses, the use of anti-deferral regimes, and the possible need for a <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treaty.</b> On this institutional foundation, {{the role of the state}} is both essential and subordinate: sovereignty becomes an instrumental value and national law-making is seen in terms of a conceptual subsidiarity, to use the European term, or a consequentialist federalism in the realm of global economic development. Moreover, non-state actors facilitate sovereign competition and the benefits that such a constraint on the abuse of sovereign discretion brings to the world’s people...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to inform}} {{international}} tax policy development {{in light of}} three of the most prominent <b>tax</b> avoidance channels: <b>treaty</b> shopping, debt structure and transfer pricing. Looking at Canadian domestic tax laws as well as the <b>tax</b> <b>treaties,</b> I find that although several policies in place work well to counter profit shifting, the rules would benefit from strengthening.

Thin capitalization and earnings stripping tests should be widened to include third-party debt and should have added flexibility to recognize that different industries require different levels of leverage. For transfer prices, priority should be given to two-sided profit allocation tests whenever a satisfactory comparable uncontrolled price cannot be found as opposed to the simpler one-sided tests.

40|$|Double {{taxation}} treaties play a {{vital part}} in the international relations between states regarding taxation matters. Since double taxation can occur {{as soon as a}} person has income in more than one state, {{it is very important that}} there can be effective remedies to the problems that can occur in these situations. Double taxation treaties are necessary in most situations created by international trade and they are even more important in such a free flowing economic co-operation such as the EU, where the trade between the Member States is not only free but also very frequent. Most double taxation treaties are based on the Model Treaty created by the OECD. Even states not members of the organization use it as a model for their treaties. This means that treaties between Member States of the EC are often rather similar, but many times have been drafted without consideration taken to EC law. This can create problems since the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has stated in its case law that even though the Member States are solely competent when it comes to direct taxation, that competence must be used in accordance with EC law. Since double taxation treaties are directed at flows of income and capital between states, it is most probable that they can run afoul of EC law. After some judgments of the ECJ the situation is clearer now, but there are still some possible future problems. Examples of such problems are trailing taxes, limitations of benefits and the most favoured nation (MFN) principle. The latter has been before the Court, but there are many questions surrounding the MFN principle that has not been answered satisfactorily. Even if more cases are brought before the Court and it gives more guidance on how the Member States shall conclude treaties with each other, it is still preferable with proper EC legislation on the subject. It must also be mentioned that the ECJ has shown reluctance to disrupting the <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> networks in place and has been reluctant to dismiss rules based on the OECD Model Treaty. Several different solutions to these problems have been put forward, ranging from doing almost nothing and just letting the development in the case law have its way to a complete regulation of these issues through legislation by the EC. The two most interesting solutions presented are a <b>Multilateral</b> EU <b>Tax</b> <b>Treaty</b> or an EU Model <b>Tax</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Both of these two different methods would mean that the problems would have a proper solution in that it would implement common rules that would be applicable over the whole of the EU...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Taxation)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. With the {{international}} platform for cross border investment {{and economic development}} growing year on year at a steady pace, it has become apparent that bilateral income <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> do not always operate effectively in <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> situations. Global transactions involving more than two states are certainly not uncommon {{and it could be}} said that the most fundamental issue in international taxation is double taxation resulting from the taxing rights of different tax jurisdictions that ‘overlap’ with regard to, generally speaking, one taxpayer or one declared income stream. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> situations, commonly known as triangular cases, occur where tax incidence on a particular stream of income is triggered in three countries. These situations typically arise where a person who is a tax resident in two respective countries for tax purposes (a dual resident), or a person who is a tax resident in one country and has a permanent establishment in another, is earning revenue of which the source is in a third country. Taxing rights and jurisdictions of the three countries involved could potentially be in conflict with each other and therefore such situations may bring about lawful international triangular taxation or double taxation which will inevitably discourage enterprises from continuing investment and development internationally. Broad multilateral treaties in the income tax arena are not common 1, and most treaties are still of a bilateral nature, i. e. generally addressing tax scenarios where only two specific countries are involved. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (’the OECD’) Model Tax Convention states this: There are no reasons to believe that the conclusion of a <b>multilateral</b> <b>tax</b> convention involving all Member countries could now be considered practicable. The Committee therefore considers that bilateral conventions are still a more appropriate way to ensure the elimination of double taxation at {{the international}} level. ...|$|R

The pursuit of <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> is therefore advanced as an integral component of U.

The importance of <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> is especially advanced in the context of U.

Yet despite many years of consistent promotion there are currently no <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> between the United States and the developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{arbitration}} {{clause of the}} new Japan-Netherlands <b>tax</b> <b>treaty,</b> {{which is the first}} instance for Japan to adopt an arbitration clause in its <b>tax</b> <b>treaties.</b> Disputes arising from <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> are typically settled through a mutual agreement procedure. Even so, the history of <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> arbitration is not new, the first being the Ireland-UK <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> of 1926. Adoption of an arbitration clause in the Japan-Netherlands <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> appears to have been prompted by the adoption of such clause in the 2008 OECD model <b>tax</b> <b>treaty.</b> The most important feature of the arbitration clause in the Japan-Netherlands <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> is that arbitration is designed as part of the mutual agreement procedure. Only by designing arbitration as such can the basic nature of the mutual agreement procedure be maintained, whereby a dispute settlement is an intergovernmental process and an agreement reached between the competent authorities of the two countries has a domestic effect. It {{should be noted that the}} arbitration procedure under the Japan-Netherlands <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> has three problematic points: transparency, rules for treaty interpretation, and control over arbitration. First, regarding transparency, at least arbitration decisions—which are in principle treated as confidential under the treaty—should be made public. Second, rules for treaty interpretation are defined as part of the arbitration procedure and the relevant provisions are set forth—not in the new <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> itself—but in the implementing agreement concluded along with the treaty. However, such rules should be provided for in the treaty itself, which is an official legal document duly endorsed by the parliaments of both contracting states. Third, regarding control over arbitration, the current system where domestic courts of both contracting states are given the control function is inappropriate. If any organization or body is to exercise control over arbitration, that function must be fulfilled by a separate arbitration committee. It is also possible not to prepare a control system.
