2500|$|Brown {{considered}} it essential {{to maintain the}} triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and strategic bombers; some of the administration's most important decisions on weapon systems reflected this commitment. Although {{he decided not to}} produce the B-1 bomber, he did recommend upgrading existing B-52s and equipping them with air-launched cruise missiles, and gave the go-ahead for development of a [...] "stealth" [...] technology, fostered by William J. Perry, under-secretary of defense for research and engineering, that would make it possible to produce planes (bombers as well as other aircraft) with very low radar profiles, presumably able to elude enemy defenses and deliver weapons on targets. The administration backed development of the MX missile, intended to replace in the 1980s the increasingly vulnerable Minuteman and Titan intercontinental missiles. To insure MX survivability, Brown recommended deploying the missiles in [...] "multiple protective shelters"; 200 MX missiles would be placed in Utah and Nevada, with each missile to be shuttled among 23 different shelters of its own located along roadways-meaning a total of 4,600 such shelters. Although this plan was expensive and environmentally controversial, Brown argued that it was the most viable scheme to protect the missiles from enemy attack. For the sea leg of the triad, Brown accelerated development of the larger Trident nuclear submarine and carried forward the conversion of Poseidon submarines to a fully <b>MIRVed</b> <b>missile</b> capability.|$|E
50|$|After {{an initial}} period focused on making multi-megaton {{hydrogen}} bombs, {{efforts in the}} United States shifted towards developing miniaturized Teller-Ulam weapons which could outfit Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles. The last major design breakthrough in this respect was accomplished by the mid-1970s, when versions of the Teller-Ulam design were created which could fit {{on the end of}} a small <b>MIRVed</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{about three to}} eight warheads can be placed on each <b>MIRVed</b> <b>missile.</b> An improved version, named DF-5B, was shown to the public during the parade in Beijing celebrating 70 years {{since the end of}} World War II on September 3, 2015. By that time, the DoD estimated China of having approximately 20 DF-5 ICBMs, with 10 of them being DF-5B variants containing MIRVs. Although China has had the technology to field MIRV warheads for decades, they have only recently begun to do so, likely in response {{to the development of the}} American ballistic missile defense system. The DF-5B supposedly has an increased throw weight of 5000 kg.|$|E
50|$|Efforts in the United States soon shifted towards {{developing}} miniaturized Teller-Ulam {{weapons that}} could easily outfit intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. By 1960, with the W47 warhead deployed on Polaris ballistic missile submarines, megaton-class warheads were as small as 18 inches (0.5 m) in diameter and 720 pounds (320 kg) in weight. It was later found in live testing that the Polaris warhead did not work reliably {{and had to be}} redesigned. Further innovation in miniaturizing warheads was accomplished by the mid-1970s, when versions of the Teller-Ulam design were created that could fit ten or more warheads {{on the end of a}} small <b>MIRVed</b> <b>missile</b> (see the section on the W88 below).|$|E

50|$|The SS-18 Mod 4 was {{probably}} designed to attack and destroy ICBMs and other hardened {{targets in the}} US. Its increasing accuracy {{made it possible to}} reduce the yield of the warheads and allowed {{an increase in the number}} of warheads from 8 to 10. According to some Western estimates, evidence suggested that the Mod 4 may be capable of carrying as many as 14 RVs (this may reflect observation of the deployment of countermeasures intended to overcome a ballistic missile defense, or to confuse American attack characterization systems). The flight-design tests of the R-36MUTTKh began on 31 October 1977 and in November 1979 the flight tests of the <b>MIRVed</b> <b>missile</b> were completed. The first three regiments were put on alert on 18 September 1979. During 1980 a total of 120 SS-18 Mod 4 missiles were deployed, replacing the last remaining R-36 (SS-9) missiles. In 1982-1983 the remaining R-36M missiles were also replaced with the new R-36MUTTKh and the total number of deployed missiles reached the maximum 308 ceiling established in the SALT-1 treaty. The SS-18 Mod 4 force had the estimated capability to destroy 65 to 80 percent of US ICBM silos using two nuclear warheads against each. Even after this type of attack, it was estimated that more than 1000 SS-18 warheads would be available for further strikes against targets in the US. After 2009, the SS-18 Mod 4s were all eliminated in favor of the newer SS-18 Mod 5.|$|E
