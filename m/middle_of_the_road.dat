5|$|In 1991 and 1992, {{the median}} strip {{of the entire}} freeway was {{significantly}} widened to accommodate the Joondalup railway line, being built under the Northern Suburbs Transit System project. The line was to {{be located in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> reserve, between the freeway carriageways. At the time, the northbound and southbound carriageways, between Loftus Street and McDonald Street, were positioned next to each other, with space for future widening located on {{the eastern side of the}} road reserve. Initially, three new road bridges were constructed over Vincent Street, Powis Street, and Scarborough Beach Road. Once the road bridges had been completed and surfacing works completed, the southbound carriage was relocated, creating the required space for the railway line construction. Additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section, funded from regular road funding sources, whilst the bridges and some associated works were included as part of the costs for the Northern Suburbs Transit System project.|$|E
