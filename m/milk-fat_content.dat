5000|$|Investigators say the {{adulteration}} {{was nothing}} short of a wholesale re-engineering of milk. Researchers established that workers at Sanlu and at a number of milk-collection depots were diluting milk with water; they added melamine to dupe a test for determining crude protein content. [...] "Adulteration used to be simple. What they did was very high-tech", says Chen Junshi, co-chair of the Sino-U.S. workshop and a risk-assessment specialist at China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Investigators subsequently learned that the emulsifier used to suspend melamine also boosted apparent <b>milk-fat</b> <b>content.</b> Sanlu baby formula contained a whopping 2563 mg/kg of melamine, adding 1% of apparent crude protein content to the formula, where normal milk is 3.0% to 3.4% protein. Chen says a dean of a school of food science told him that it would take a university team 3 months to develop this kind of concoction. Investigators have concluded that as-yet-unidentified individuals cooked up a protocol for a premix, a solution normally designed to fortify foods with vitamins or other nutrients but, in this case, it was poisonous. Several milk-collecting companies were using the same premix, Chen says: [...] "So someone with technical skill had to be training them." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{systematic}} factors on production traits over complete lactations {{was investigated in}} 2, 805 Simmental cows born in 1982 and onwards. The cows were housed at three farms in different areas: at the Zlatiborski Suvati dairy farm, Zlatibor, at the Dobricevo Agricultural Farm, Cuprija and at private farms {{in the region of}} Kotraze. The systematic factors (farm, calving season, lactation groups, group (year x season of birth), farm x calving season and farm x lactation group interactions) and age at first conception had statistically highly significant (P 0. 05). No statistically significant effect was produced by age at first conception on complete lactation duration and <b>milk-fat</b> <b>content</b> (P> 0. 05). Determination coefficients ranged from 0. 100 in complete lactation duration to 0. 361 in <b>milk-fat</b> <b>content.</b> Key words: Simmental breed, milk yield, systematic effects...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyses de novo {{synthesis}} of fatty acids in cells. The bovine FASN gene maps to BTA 19, where several QTLs for fat-related traits have been described. Our group recently reported the identification of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), g. 763 G>C, in the bovine FASN 5 â€™ flanking region that {{was significantly associated with}} <b>milk-fat</b> <b>content</b> in dairy cattle. The g. 763 G>C SNP was part of a GC-rich region that may constitute a cis element for members of the Sp transcription factor family. Thus, the SNP could alter the transcription factor binding ability of the FASN promoter and consequently affect the promoter activity of the gene. However, the functional consequences of the SNP on FASN gene expression are unknown. The present study was therefore directed at elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism that could explain the association of the SNP with <b>milk-fat</b> <b>content.</b> Three cellular lines (3 T 3 L 1, HepG 2 and MCF- 7) were used to test the promoter and the transcription factor binding activities by luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, respectively. Band shift assays were also carried out using nuclear extracts from lactating mammary gland (LMG) to furthe...|$|E
