50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>cracks</b> can be {{preserved}} as v-shaped cracks {{on the top}} of a bed of muddy sediment or as casts on the base of the overlying bed. When they are preserved {{on the top of}} a bed, the cracks look as they were at the time of formation. When they are preserved on the bottom of the bedrock the cracks are filled in with younger, overlying sediment. In most bottom-of-bed examples the cracks are the part that sticks out most. Bottom-of-bed preservation occurs when <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> that have already formed and are completely dried are covered with fresh wet sediment and buried. Through burial and pressure the new wet sediment is further pushed into the cracks where it dries and hardens. The <b>mud</b> <b>cracked</b> rock is then later exposed to erosional factors. In these cases, the original <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> will erode faster than the newer material filling in the spaces.

The Curiosity Rover imaged {{what may be}} the first <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> (desiccation cracks) ever found on Mars. They may have been formed from drying mud. The site, called “Old Soaker,” was within an exposure of Murray formation mudstone on lower Mount Sharp. It is hypothesized that these cracks formed more than 3 billion years ago and then were buried by more sediment. All this material eventually turned into rock. Later wind erosion removed the layers that covered the cracked layer. The cracks were filled with material which was resistant to later erosion. This erosion resistant material formed raised ridges, as some of the surrounding layer was removed.This is the first sighting of <b>mud</b> <b>cracks.</b> Previously, Curiosity has examined cracks and ridges of different shapes that were made by groundwater carrying minerals, such as calcium sulfate. Cracks for this process were caused by the pressure of overlying sediments fracturing rock.Gale Crater held ancient lakes that varied in depth and area over time, and sometimes disappeared. <b>Mud</b> <b>cracks</b> show that there were dry times when lakes disappeared.

Here we show, experimentally, how a desiccation crack pattern changes from being dominated by 90 ° joint angles, to 120 ° joint angles. Layers of bentonite clay, a few mm thick, were repeatedly wetted and dried. When dried, the layers crack. These cracks visibly close when rewetted, but a similar crack pattern forms when the layer is redried, with cracks forming {{along the lines}} of previously open cracks. Time-lapse photography was used to show how the sequence in which individual cracks open is different in each generation of drying. The geometry of the crack pattern was observed after each of 25 generations of wetting and drying. The angles between cracks were found to approach 120 °, with a relaxation time of approximately 4 generations. This was accompanied by a gradual change in the position of the crack vertices, as the crack pattern evolved.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{work has}} {{revealed}} that desiccation processes can occur over elongated off-shore mud bars that form on Amazon-derived mud banks. Once <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> appear there, opportunistic mangroves, i. e. Avicennia germinans, commence the colonization process. Through the advantage of buoyancy of the mangrove propagules which can be trapped by the <b>mud</b> <b>cracks,</b> propagules can establish sometimes 1 - 2 kilometres offshore of the adult colonies. In a few months, these pioneer colonies become new sources of propagules, promoting rapid ecosystem expansion. Thus, <b>mud</b> <b>cracking</b> {{may be seen as}} an important factor in mangrove resilience. To investigate this phenomenon, a field experiment was conducted during the 2008 equinoctial spring tide in French Guiana in a study area located on the landward face of an elongated mud bar. A digital elevation model (DEM) was computed from DGPS and high-resolution laser station data. Meteorological data including air temperature and humidity, wind speed and orientation, rainfall, solar radiation, temperatures of the mud surface and at a depth of 30 -cm, were recorded. Additionally, the water content of the upper mud layer was monitored along a topographic transect. An installed camera took instant photographs every half hour. Preliminary results show that climatic conditions are not the main parameter controlling the desiccation process. Strengthening and consolidation of mud are mainly controlled by mud elevation (water loss by draining) and by the local tidal signal (determinant in spatial behaviour). The DEM enabled computation of the tidal frequency emersion signal, an important tool in analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of <b>mud</b> <b>cracking</b> and mangrove colonization...|$|R

Upon thermal cycling between 1316 °C and 110 °C in a 90 % H 2 O/ 10 % O 2 environment flowing at 4. 4 cm/s, it was found that partial delamination occurred with the fracture plane located within a thermally grown oxide (TGO) at the Al 6 Si 2 O 13 –Si interface. Delamination initiated at test coupon edges where the gaseous environment preferentially oxidized the exposed Si bond coat to form b-cristobalite.

40|$|Mud bank {{colonization}} by mangroves on the Amazon-influenced {{coast of}} French Guiana was studied using {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) data which provide unique information on canopy geometry an sub-canopy topography. The role of topography was assessed through analysis of vegetation characteristics derived from these data. Measurements and analyses of mangrove expansion rates over {{space and time}} led to the identification of two distinct colonization processes. The first involves regular step-by-step mangrove expansion to the northwest of the experimental site. The second is qualified as ‘opportunistic’ since it involves a clear relationship between specific ecological characteristics of pioneer Avicennia and <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> affecting the <b>mud</b> bank surface and for which probabilities of occurrence were computed from terrain elevations. It is argued from an original analysis of the latter relationship that <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> cannot be solely viewed as water stress features that reflect desiccation potentially harmful to plant growth.

40|$|International audienceBars are coastal bedforms {{that have}} been widely {{described}} from sandy and gravelly beach, tidal inlet and estuarine-channel environments. The bars described in this paper are muddy wave-formed features associated with the massive mud banks that migrate alongshore {{from the mouth of}} the Amazon to the mouth of the Orinoco in South America. These bars are generally short-lived features that are rapidly reworked and pushed shoreward by waves impinging on the mud banks. Accreted bars become exposed to drying and evaporative processes which favour surface <b>cracking.</b> Such <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> play an important role in the rapid and extensive colonisation of the bank by mangroves as these <b>mud</b> <b>cracks</b> act as mechanical traps for mangrove propagules (Avicennia germinans). At this stage, bars constitute the primary substrate for offshore pioneer opportunistic mangrove formation. Multi-temporal satellite images (SPOT and Landsat ETM images) and wave data from the ERA 40 model generated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and from a NOAA buoy indicate a rising trend in mud bar frequency since the early 2000 s, in response to wave intensification. In these conditions of increased wave forcing, offshore fluid mud deposits are massively mobilized shoreward and reworked into new mud bars. This morphological forcing of the mud bank topography by enhanced wave activity has, in turn, an important impact on the mangrove ecosystem. Although mangroves are generally susceptible to erosion by higher-energy waves, the abundance of bars favours active mud-bank colonizatio...|$|R
