50|$|Seismic {{reflection}} exploration {{grew out}} of the seismic refraction exploration method, which was used to find oil associated with salt domes. Ludger Mintrop, a German <b>mine</b> <b>surveyor,</b> devised a mechanical seismograph in 1914 that he successfully used to detect salt domes in Germany. He applied for a German patent in 1919 that was issued in 1926. In 1921 he founded the company Seismos, which was hired to conduct seismic exploration in Texas and Mexico, resulting in the first commercial discovery of oil using the refraction seismic method in 1924. The 1924 discovery of the Orchard salt dome in Texas led to a boom in seismic refraction exploration along the Gulf Coast, but by 1930 the method had led to the discovery most of the shallow Gulf Coast salt domes, and the refraction seismic method faded.|$|E

After an early education in Belmont, California, Julius Kruttschnitt II went to Yale University, graduating with a B.Phil. in 1906. After a year of postgraduate work, he took a position as a <b>mine</b> <b>surveyor</b> with the Arizona Copper Company. Kruttschnitt married Marie Rose Pickering in San Francisco, California in 1907. He would join the mining department of the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) at their Reforma lead mine in Mexico in 1909. He then moved to Asientos, Mexico to oversee their silver mine. Kruttschnitt was recalled back to Tucson, Arizona in 1912 to oversee the company's mining department and remained there until 1930.|$|E
5000|$|In 1571 the Celle Duke, William the Younger, {{submitted}} {{a plan to}} float logs down the Ise, an activity known as timber rafting (Flößerei). Its purpose was to convey logs from the royal forests to the ducal Residenz town of Celle, where it was needed as fuel for heating Celle Castle and other royal buildings. On the Ise north of Gifhorn were several royal forests {{that could have been}} logged. For some reason the project was not carried out. In 1617 the rafting of logs to Celle was again proposed by the officials of Knesebeck and Gifhorn to the Duke of Celle, by this time Christian the Elder. Estimates at the time put the cost of transporting logs by horse and cart at about 10 times that of rafting them down the river. These plans foundered on the rocks of the Thirty Years War which started in 1618. As a result, timber rafting down the Ise was not introduced until the reign of Duke Christian Louis. For this he called for a senior forester from Harzburg and a <b>mine</b> <b>surveyor</b> from Clausthal to advise him. In the Harz mountains {{they had a lot of}} experience with timber rafting because logs were needed for the ironworks there. Based on the recommendations of the advisors, in 1659 the river was cleared of rubbish, bushes and mud by several hundred farmers conscripted for the purpose. Extensive earthworks were created in order to get rid of the many meanders and shorten the course of the river. The canal cuts in the Ise valley left artificial ox-bows. Wooden sluices with sluice channels were built at Wahrenholz and Gifhorn. The first test run was carried out in 1659 and timber rafting officially began on the Ise in 1661 when 4,400 stères of wood fuel was transported to Gifhorn and from there down the Aller to Celle.|$|E

The University of Southern Queensland Graduation and Prize Awards ceremony were held in April, 2011 for the 2010 academic year. Many of the graduating students obtained their base qualification through the New South Wales or Australian Capital Territory TAFE system either in surveying or the various naming conventions that existed in the past. The NSW/ACT TAFE system provides a foundation for an articulated pathway to tertiary programs that can lead to registration as a land or <b>mine</b> <b>surveyor</b> upon completion of a recognised qualification. The NSW/ACT TAFE graduate is either granted a specified amount of credit towards their chosen degree program or pro rata disposition for incomplete TAFE studies and USQ has well identified articulation pathways for NSW/ACT TAFE students. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The South African Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) {{requires}} the <b>mine</b> <b>surveyor</b> {{to inform the}} manager of all workings within 100 metres of other workings, abandoned areas and hazardous accumulations of water or gas. The main purpose of this requirement {{is to ensure that}} all employees are aware and can take all the necessary precautions against un‐planned breakthroughs, falls of ground and subsidence. In the case where mines are mining through abandoned workings in order to remove remnant pillars and previously unmined reserves, the potential for subsidence and equipment falling into excavated areas become a reality. A single incident where a machine falls into a collapsed working can amount to in excess of R 1 million per incident, excluding the risk of loss of life or serious injury. An unplanned collapse of workings in the specific case study can also lead to sufficient air flow into the old underground to cause spontaneous combustion of the remaining pillars. Although systems for navigation of drill rigs exist the cost to deploy a similar unit to all vehicles in the mining area is prohibitive. A low‐cost system that can navigate a vehicle and indicate to the operator what the subsurface features look like in the direct surroundings of the vehicle was developed using off‐the‐shelf technologies. This paper discusses the process of developing a lowcost navigation system towards a real time information management system for a mining operation. Benefits from this system may be applied in underground navigation and guiding rescue services in the search of illegal miners in abandoned mines...|$|E
40|$|In {{designing}} an {{open pit}} mine to optimise an orebody, numerous considerations are made. These include geological, geotechnical, mining method and equipment selection considerations. To achieve the optimisation of an orebody depends on sound mine design principles and {{adherence to the}} mining sequence with employee’s health and safety being of paramount importance. Mining steeper slope angles for economic gain, mining slope angles steeper than design or ignoring the presence of weak geological structures may seriously {{increase the likelihood of}} slope instability leading to slope failure and possible mineral loss (sterilisation), property damage, mine closure, accidents and fatalities. It is not the objective of slope design to eliminate all slope instability, as slope failures can prove desirable to verify design assumptions. Slope failures are desirable {{as long as they can}} be predicted and managed and that the risk to personnel, equipment and production is mitigated to a tolerable level. Slope stability monitoring is an important tool in confirming the mine design. Slope stability monitoring in the field of mine surveying has ensured the continuous advancement of state-of-the-art spatial measurement technology and techniques. Today’s survey instruments enable the <b>mine</b> <b>surveyor</b> to measure slope movement to a high degree of accuracy and with confidence. It is essential that the slope stability monitoring equipment selected is capable of measuring the degree of movement as determined by the geotechnical engineer. The requirements for a slope stability monitoring system are outlined in this research report with guidelines for establishing and maintaining a slope stability monitoring system. The guidelines have been compiled based on the findings of operational reviews of slope stability monitoring systems. This research report should serve as a reference to mine surveyors involved in slope stability monitoring, focusing primarily on prism monitoring...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to the request to research government rules and regulations that are relative to Mine Survey and could impact on global mining companies in different countries in Africa, a framework has been established to assist and support many companies working in these countries. The framework guides investigations in determining the legal risks to the Company in general and Mine Surveying in particular. Legally appointed personnel fall directly under this risk profile. Furthermore, the primary activities and overlying acts and regulations form workable matrices to address all areas of compliance and risk within the Mine Surveying areas of responsibility. The framework {{takes into account the}} supporting activities which operate within the acts and regulations. These departments are generally not directly accountable to the legislation, but form part of the mining value chain and depend on Mine Surveying results and service. It is therefore appropriate that the investigation into the international component of the framework was conducted as well. The links to international codes and practices were established with special reference to Mine Surveying association and participation. The mining process was researched in its entirety. It was found that there are numerous government departments and associated laws prescribing compliance for Mine Surveyors. The framework describes the various levels of work so that all risk to people, property and equipment is tabled and applicable working standards and guidelines are put in place to mitigate such risk. A uniform standard can guide all Mine Surveyors in establishing the Survey Manual. This manual of standards drives levels of accuracy and therefore training and development of the individual <b>Mine</b> <b>Surveyor.</b> The major finding was that Mine Survey cannot be researched alone as it interfaces with several other mining departments, legal structures and possible international codes. This research has reported on the Ghanaian portion of a global mining company. The Company’s business units in other countries have been benchmarked as well. South African based mining companies have strong Mine Survey structures, while in countries such as Canada and Australia, Mine Surveying is a sub section of Engineering.
