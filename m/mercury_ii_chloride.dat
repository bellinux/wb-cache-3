40|$|In {{this thesis}} work an optical {{tweezers}} system {{was designed and}} used to characterize viscoelastic response of plasma membranes (PMs) to an applied stress under different environmental conditions. In order to perform accurate force measurements we analyzed dynamics of an optically trapped microsphere under altering external viscous drag force using Fourier methods. Next, using optically trapped fluorescent microspheres, we recorded tethering force vs. PM displacement profiles, which revealed the tether formation process, initiated with linear deformation of the PM, followed by a nonlinear regime and terminated with the local separation of PM. Tethering force vs. displacement profiles were used to estimate tether formation force and stiffness parameter of the PM. Integration of the force-displacement profiles yielded the work of tether formation, including linear and nonlinear components. We characterized mechanical properties of the outer hair (OHC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell PMs perfused with 10 mM sodium salicylate (Sal), which is known to affect electromotility of OHCs as well as PM surface charge, morphology of erythrocytes, and PM lipid diffusion. Sal reduced tether formation force, PM stiffness parameter, and equilibrium tethering force in HEK cells, explained by enhanced PM/cytoskeleton compliance. The parameters estimated for OHCs remained the same after Sal perfusion, {{which is consistent with}} the hypothesis that Sal induced reversible hearing loss appears to be more the result of its competition with essential anions and less the result of a change in PM mechanics. Finally, we found that cell perfusion with hypo- and hyperosmotic solutions did not influence equilibrium tethering force, attributed to cellular regulation of the effective PM tension. The observed reduction in magnitude of the fast tethering force relaxation process was related to the stress-minimizing redistribution of the PM lipids. Application of a non-specific transmembrane water transport blocker, <b>mercury</b> (<b>II)</b> <b>chloride,</b> increased steady-state and equilibrium tethering forces and suppressed slow component of the tethering force relaxation. Temporal tethering force profiles obtained from the same PM tethers pulled in several repetitive cycles exhibited different behavior and resulted in reduced forces and time constants explained by essential irreversibility of PM tether elongation involving PM-cytoskeleton dissociation and/or plastic deformations...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{data-driven}} approach aiming to reliably distinguish discriminatory metabolites from nondiscriminatory metabolites {{for a given}} spectroscopic data set containing two biological phenotypic subclasses. The automatic spectroscopic data categorization by clustering analysis (ASCLAN) algorithm aims to categorize spectral variables within a data set into three clusters corresponding to noise, nondiscriminatory and discriminatory metabolites regions. This is achieved by clustering each spectral variable based on the r(2) value representing the loading weight of each spectral variable as extracted from a orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant (OPLS-DA) model of the data set. The variables are ranked according to r(2) values {{and a series of}} principal component analysis (PCA) models are then built for subsets of these spectral data corresponding to ranges of r(2) values. The Q(2) X value for each PCA model is extracted. K-means clustering is then applied to the Q(2) X values to generate two clusters based on minimum Euclidean distance criterion. The cluster consisting of lower Q(2) X values is deemed devoid of metabolic information (noise), while the cluster consists of higher Q(2) X values is then further subclustered into two groups based on the r(2) values. We considered the cluster with high Q(2) X but low r(2) values as nondiscriminatory, while the cluster with high Q(2) X and r(2) values as discriminatory variables. The boundaries between these three clusters of spectral variables, {{on the basis of the}} r(2) values were considered as the cut off values for defining the noise, nondiscriminatory and discriminatory variables. We evaluated the ASCLAN algorithm using six simulated (1) H NMR spectroscopic data sets representing small, medium and large data sets (N = 50, 500, and 1000 samples per group, respectively), each with a reduced and full resolution set of variables (0. 005 and 0. 0005 ppm, respectively). ASCLAN correctly identified all discriminatory metabolites and showed zero false positive (100 % specificity and positive predictive value) irrespective of the spectral resolution or the sample size in all six simulated data sets. This error rate was found to be superior to existing methods for ascertaining feature significance: univariate t test by Bonferroni correction (up to 10 % false positive rate), Benjamini-Hochberg correction (up to 35 % false positive rate) and metabolome wide significance level (MWSL, up to 0. 4 % false positive rate), as well as by various OPLS-DA parameters: variable importance to projection, (up to 15 % false positive rate), loading coefficients (up to 35 % false positive rate), and regression coefficients (up to 39 % false positive rate). The application of ASCLAN was further exemplified using a widely investigated renal toxin, <b>mercury</b> <b>II</b> <b>chloride</b> (HgCl 2) in rat model. ASCLAN successfully identified many of the known metabolites related to renal toxicity such as increased excretion of urinary creatinine, and different amino acids. The ASCLAN algorithm provides a framework for reliably differentiating discriminatory metabolites from nondiscriminatory metabolites in a biological data set without the need to set an arbitrary cut off value as applied to some of the conventional methods. This offers significant advantages over existing methods and the possibility for automation of high-throughput screening in "omics" data...|$|E

30|$|The {{template}} {{synthesis of}} nanostructures has attracted scientists’ {{attention in the}} last years owing to their possible application in fabricating high-density magnetic storage memories [1] and nanoelectrodes for electrochemical processes in nanometric range [2]. In addition, this kind of nanostructures could be integrated in smaller and smaller devices such as filters [3] or sensors [4]. In terms of nanostructure fabrication, choosing a suitable template {{is one of the most}} crucial factors in the synthesis process, because any defect in the template structure could be transferred to the resulting nanostructure by replication. So far, several materials have been used as template for synthesizing nanowires or nanotubes. Nanoporous anodic alumina membranes (NAAMs) have become widely used for the following reasons: first, in contrast to other membranes as polycarbonate membranes, NAAMs present a higher pore density and a narrower diameter pore distribution [5]. Secondly, both the pore diameter and their interpore distance are rather controllable, because they can be adjusted by varying the anodization voltage or changing the electrolyte [6]. Thirdly, by means of a two-step anodization process [7], we can fabricate NAAMs with a self-ordered hexagonally and periodic pore arrangement in a more inexpensive way than with other methods like electron beam lithography [8]. Recently, electrochemical deposition from an electrolyte has been used [9, 10], since it is a fast and well-controlled way of fabricating nanowires and nanotubes by filling porous templates. Nonetheless, as-produced NAAMS have certain disadvantages to be used as template when an electrochemical deposition is desirable. The main disadvantage is that there is an aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) barrier layer between the pore bottom and the aluminium (Al) substrate. This barrier layer electrically isolates the metallic aluminium substrate from the inner side of the pores. For this reason, when an electrodeposition of a metallic or semiconducting material is carried out by direct current (DC) in an as-produced NAAM, it is rather unstable and there is no uniform filling of the pores. Moreover, high electrodeposition potentials are needed for tunnelling the electrons throughout the oxide barrier layer of the pore bottom. Other deposition techniques like electroless deposition [11], chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [12] or sol–gel [13] can avoid this drawback, since the growth of nanowires or nanotubes does not start at the pore tips, but from the pore walls. So far, several methods have been developed for carrying an electrochemical deposition using NAAMs as template. The most commonly used are two. In the first one [9, 10], the nanoporous alumina membrane must be detached from the aluminium substrate by the dissolution of the Aluminium in a saturated solution of cupric chloride and hydrochloric acid (HCl·CuCl 2) [14] or in a saturated solution of <b>mercury</b> (<b>II)</b> <b>chloride</b> (HgCl 2) [15]. Subsequently, the aluminium oxide barrier layer is removed from the pore bottoms by a chemical etching process in a solution of phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4). Finally, an electrical contact is sputtered on one side of the free-standing NAAM. The second one is the pulsed electrodeposition (PED) method [16], in which the NAAM remains on the aluminium substrate. By means of this method, magnetic nanowire arrays of nickel and cobalt have been fabricated [16, 17]. Nevertheless, only free-standing metallic nanowires can be fabricated using this method.|$|E
