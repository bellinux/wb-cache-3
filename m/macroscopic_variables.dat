25|$|In {{the view}} of Jaynes (1957), {{thermodynamic}} entropy, as explained by statistical mechanics, {{should be seen as}} an application of Shannon's information theory: the thermodynamic entropy is interpreted as being proportional to the amount of further Shannon information needed to define the detailed microscopic state of the system, that remains uncommunicated by a description solely in terms of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variables</b> of classical thermodynamics, with the constant of proportionality being just the Boltzmann constant. For example, adding heat to a system increases its thermodynamic entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states of the system that are consistent with the measurable values of its <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variables,</b> thus making any complete state description longer. (See article: maximum entropy thermodynamics). Maxwell's demon can (hypothetically) reduce the thermodynamic entropy of a system by using information about the states of individual molecules; but, as Landauer (from 1961) and co-workers have shown, to function the demon himself must increase thermodynamic entropy in the process, by at least the amount of Shannon information he proposes to first acquire and store; and so the total thermodynamic entropy does not decrease (which resolves the paradox). Landauer's principle imposes a lower bound on the amount of heat a computer must generate to process a given amount of information, though modern computers are far less efficient.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{evolutionary}} robotics experiment that aims at studying how a <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variable</b> can be encoded {{in the collective}} activity {{of a group of}} robots. In particular, we aim at understanding how perception can be the result of a collective, self-organising process. A group of robots is placed in an environment characterised by black spots painted on the ground. The density of the spots is the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variable</b> that should be perceived by the group. The density varies from trial to trial, and robots are requested to collectively encode such density into a coherent signalling activity. Robots have access only to local information, therefore cannot immediately perceive the global density. By exploiting interactions through an all-to-all communication channel, robots should prove capable of perceiving and encoding the global density. We show how such behaviour can be synthesised exploiting evolutionary robotics techniques, and we present extensive analyses of the evolved strategies. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag GmbH Berlin Heidelberg.

2500|$|The {{interpretation}} of entropy in statistical mechanics {{is the measure}} of uncertainty, or mixedupness in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variables,</b> the entropy measures {{the degree to which}} the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to [...] the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged, often taken to be a measure of [...] "disorder" [...] (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.|$|E

5000|$|Actually this thermal [...] "thermodynamic force" [...] is {{a manifestation}} of the degree of inexact {{specification}} of the microscopic initial conditions for the system, expressed in the thermodynamic variable known as temperature, [...] Temperature is only one example, and all the thermodynamic <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variables</b> constitute inexact specifications of the initial conditions, and have their respective [...] "thermodynamic forces".

If one did not know of such inexactitude of specification, one might find the origin of the fluctuations mysterious. What is meant here by [...] "inexactitude of specification" [...] is not that the mean values of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variables</b> are inexactly specified, but that the use of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variables</b> to describe processes that actually occur by the motions and interactions of microscopic objects such as molecules is necessarily lacking in the molecular detail of the processes, and is thus inexact.

Without the external noise a <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variable</b> shows high-dimensional chaos distinguishable from random motion. With the increase of external noise intensity, the collective motion is successively simplified. The number of effective degrees of freedom in the collective motion is found to decrease as -Ï^ 2 with the external noise variance Ï^ 2. It is shown how the microscopic noise can suppress the number of degrees of freedom at a macroscopic level. Comment: 9 pages RevTex file and 4 postscript figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of glassy and disordered {{materials}} exhibit complex, non-exponential, structural relaxation (aging). We propose a simple nonlinear rate equation dÎ´/dt = a [1 -exp (bÎ´) ], where 'Î´' is the normalized deviation of a <b>macroscopic</b> <b>variable</b> from its equilibrium value, to describe glassy relaxation. Analysis of extensive experimental data shows that this equation quantitatively captures structural relaxation, where 'a' and 'b' are both temperature-, and more importantly, history-dependent parameters. This analysis explicitly demonstrates that structural relaxation cannot be accurately described by a single non-equilibrium variable. Relaxation rates extracted from the data imply the existence of cooperative rearrangements on a super-molecular scale. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
