On 16 June 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service {{was held at the}} Flinders Street Baptist Church. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried. There his gravestone was emblazoned with the phrase: 'a good <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> good things'.|$|E
5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want to be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E
5|$|Watt was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1January 1919, {{in recognition of}} his war service. He returned to Australia on 6May {{with the rest of}} 1st Training Wing's personnel, aboard the troopship Kaisar-i-Hind, on which he was the ranking officer. Leaving the AFC soon afterwards, he was elected president of the New South Wales section of the Australian Aero Club. He also served as senior delegate on a committee of veteran military pilots examining applications for appointment to a proposed independent Australian air service. Watt was esteemed as a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not forget old comrades, providing former AFC members with financial aid and helping them re-establish themselves in civilian life. He maintained an interest in commercial flying but refused an offer to take up the position of controller of civil aviation in 1920 owing to his business interests, which included partnership in the family shipping firm of Gilchrist, Watt & Sanderson Ltd, and directorships of mining, rubber, and art corporations. He also turned down invitations to stand for parliament, and to join the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force.|$|E

25|$|Conversely, Yale was {{a violent}} <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not {{hesitate}} to inflict pain on others. When angered by his younger brother Angelo, Yale beat him so badly that he {{wound up in the}} hospital. When two extortionists attempted to shake down the popular hat-check operator of a neighborhood restaurant, Yale battered the two unconscious. In May 1920, Yale traveled to Chicago and personally killed longtime gang boss Big Jim Colosimo at the behest of Chicago Outfit friends Torrio and Capone. Colosimo was allegedly murdered because he stood {{in the way of his}} gang making huge bootlegging profits in Chicago. Although suspected by Chicago police, Yale was never officially charged.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, 1973, after Cox {{refused to}} drop the subpoena, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire the special prosecutor. Richardson {{resigned}} in protest rather than carry out the order. Nixon then ordered Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus to fire Cox, but Ruckelshaus also resigned rather than fire him. Nixon’s search for someone in the Justice Department willing to fire Cox ended with the Solicitor General Robert Bork. Though Bork said he believed Nixon’s order was valid and appropriate, he considered resigning to avoid being “perceived as a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the President’s bidding to save my job.” Bork carried out the presidential order and dismissed the special prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Hyde {{had some}} {{learning}} and {{a share of}} his father's literary genius. The main employment of his old age was the preparation for the press of his father's History of the Rebellion, to which he wrote a preface in which he expounded his Tory philosophy. The work was dedicated to his niece Queen Anne: the Queen, whose poor eyesight made reading something of an ordeal, was not especially pleased, particularly since the preface {{could be interpreted as}} an attack on her own policies. She remarked drily that it was strange that a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not lack sense in other ways should be made ridiculous by his vanity.|$|E

25|$|The Xhosas have {{a strong}} oral {{tradition}} with many stories of ancestral heroes; according to tradition, the leader from whose name the Xhosa people take their name was the first King of the nation. One of Xhosa's descendents named Phalo gave birth to two sons, Gcaleka kaPhalo, the heir, and Rarabe ka Phalo, a son from the Right Hand house. Rarabe was a great warrior and {{a man of great}} ability who was much loved by his father. Gcaleka was a meek and listless <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not possess all the qualities befitting of a future king. Matters were also complicated by Gcaleka's initiation as a diviner, which was a forbidden practice for members of the royal family.|$|E

She was to retain the honors of a queen as she had before in Etruria.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{acting as}} an {{administrator}} and explorer, Gordon {{had to act}} as a diplomat, dealing carefully with Muteesa I, the kabaka (king) of the Buganda who ruled most of what is today southern Uganda, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not welcome the Egyptian expansionism into the Great Lakes region. Gordon's attempts to establish an Egyptian garrison in the Buganda had been stymied by the cunning Mueteesa, who forced the Egyptians to build their fort at his capital of Lubaga, making the 140 or so Egyptian soldiers into his virtual hostages. Gordon chose not to meet Mueteesa himself, instead sending his chief medical officer, a German convert to Islam Dr. Emin Pasha to negotiate a treaty whereas in exchange for allowing the Egyptians to leave the Buganda, the independence of the kingdom was recognised.|$|E

25|$|Jessop was a {{very modest}} <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not seek self-aggrandisement. Unlike other engineers, he was not jealous of rising young engineers, but rather {{encouraged}} them. He would also recommend another engineer if {{he was too busy}} to be able to undertake a commission himself. He recommended John Rennie for the post of engineer to the Lancaster Canal Company, an appointment that helped to establish Rennie's reputation. When Jessop was consulting engineer to the Ellesmere Canal Company, in 1793, the company appointed the relatively unknown Thomas Telford as resident engineer. Telford had no previous experience as a designer of canals, but with Jessop's advice and guidance, Telford made a success of the project. He supported Telford, even when the Company thought that the latter's designs for aqueducts were too ambitious.|$|E
25|$|Ögedei {{was also}} {{known to be}} a humble <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not believe himself to be a genius, and who was willing to listen to and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} case {{investigated by the}} after the war, the KBZPNP commission requested the prosecution of the commanders of the 10th and 17th Divisions, which {{took part in a}} mass murder of several dozen Poles in the village of Włyń near Łódź. All cases of the murder of Polish civilians in that village were turned down by the German prosecutors' office on 22 April 1974. The German authorities argued, that it is not impossible that all the civilians trying to escape from the German forces were in fact partisans. This was the reasoning in the case of certain Ochecki who was shot to death while trying to rescue his cattle from a barn set in flames by the German soldiers. The German authorities argued that it was fair to assume {{that he was trying to}} escape from the German soldiers. The same reasoning was given in the case of a mentally sick person shot the same day. In the case of Wawrzyn Piecyk, who was killed while being wounded and unconscious, it was argued that he might have been pretending to be unconscious in order to escape from the German soldiers, while the case of Józef Jawor, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not stop when requested to and instead hid in his house, where he was shot through the doors, was explained as a killing done during a fight. The case of Maria Konieczna, a deaf woman who was shot after not responding to a German soldier, was considered a common crime, while the killing of Józef Gałka was explained as legitimate, since a picture of his brother in Polish military uniform found in Gałka's wallet was a proof that he might have been a partisan himself. In the same decision, the German authorities declared that the patients of the mental institution in the town of Warta, killed by the soldiers of the 17th Division in the hospital and dressed in hospital pyjamas, were victims of a common crime rather than a war crime or a murder.|$|E

500|$|Saul Steinberg created 85 {{covers and}} 642 {{internal}} drawings and illustrations for The New Yorker, including its March 29, 1976 cover, titled [...] "View of the World from 9th Avenue".

The work is sometimes referred to as A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World or A New Yorker's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers.

It assigned the copyright to Steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting.|$|E
500|$|German {{historian}} Hans Otto Böhm {{commented on}} Oesau as [...] "One {{of my best}} professors". There is little information available on the personal side of Walter Oesau. He had {{good sense of humor}} and liked to spend time with his friends. He was a simple <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not display any flamboyant personal emblems on his aircraft. His aircraft while commanding JG 2 did not have any special markings except for the unit's normal yellow under–cowling. While Oesau commanded, JG 2, like many others, dropped the special symbols for Stab (headquarters flight) units in favor of numerals. This helped make the leader's aircraft anonymous. Unlike other aces, Oesau reportedly never had markings on his rudder representing his personal tally, although this is contradicted by some photos displaying what may be his aircraft rudder painted with score of downed aircraft. The authenticity of the photograph is questioned by some as there are also Ju 87 photos supposedly signed by Oesau (he never flew a Stuka bomber).|$|E

Ramboasalamarazaka frequently made promises to the populace regarding his future reign, which led Andrianjafy perceived as a threat to his authority, leading him to execute citizens of his territory who engaged his nephew in such promises; contrary to his intentions, this response only served to turn popular opinion against Andrianjafy.|$|E

500|$|Lágrimas Cálidas was {{produced}} by Jose Gaviria and Andres Munera. It was recorded at Crescent Moon Studios and Big Dog Studios in Miami, New World Studios in Bogota and Promix Estudios in Medellin. The genre of the album is defined as Tropipop, because it mixes tropical genres such as vallenato and merengue with pop and Caribbean influences. The album opens with [...] "No Te Pido Flores" [...] ("I'm Not Requesting Flowers"), [...] where the predominant instruments are the accordion, guitar and caja vallenata. Lyrically, the song begins with the absence of her man, but then, in the chorus, transitions into a warning not {{to fall in love}} with material things. The second track, [...] "Lágrimas Cálidas" [...] ("Warm Tears"), is a vallenato-stylized pop ballad, expressing her suffering due to being abandoned by her lover. [...] "Te Arrepentiras" [...] ("You'll Regret"), is about a woman who surrendered completely to a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not appreciate her.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of Son of God, [...] "The Real Man", {{documents}} Jesus's life {{up to his}} temptation, and details the historical evidence for his existence. Bowen visits Jerusalem, where he calls Jesus's death [...] "one of the best attested facts in ancient history". He cites the Romano-Jewish historian Josephus as one of 80 sources that confirms that Jesus existed and that describes him as [...] "a wise <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> surprising feats,... won over followers from among Jews and Greeks,... was accused by the Jewish leaders, [...] was condemned to be crucified by Pilate". Bowen interviews James H. Charlesworth from Princeton University about {{the discovery of the}} Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947, then travels to Bethlehem to visit the Church of the Nativity, a structure built over a series of first-century caves and grottos. While there, he speculates that Jesus may have been born in a cave rather than an inn, the more traditional image. Joe Zias, an archaeologist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem confirms this, saying that the Greek word [...] "katalyma" [...] is usually translated into English as [...] "upper room" [...] rather than [...] "inn".|$|E

Lyrically, Aguilera wants to thank the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> her wrong rather than insult him, because he helped make her stronger and work harder, thus making her a fighter. At the chorus, she sings, [...] "'Cause it makes me that much stronger/ Makes me work a little bit harder/ Makes me that much wiser/ So thanks for making me a fighter". The chords in the guitar part are E5 – F5 – G5 – A5 – B5 − C5 – B5 – A5 – G5 – F5 [...] E5.
