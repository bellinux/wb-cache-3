5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and <b>Modernisation</b> Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for <b>modernisation,</b> and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>modernisation</b> of the C {{and other}} {{improvements}} made {{to other parts}} of the network, the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit.|$|E

5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this <b>modernisation,</b> and {{it was used to}} communicate the <b>modernisation</b> of the party to the public; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E
5|$|The <b>modernisation</b> and {{integration}} of the eastern German economy is a long-term process scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east amounting to roughly $80billion.|$|E
5|$|The strike action {{began on}} a local level after postal workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh accused their bosses of cutting jobs and services, which they claimed broke the 2007 Pay and <b>Modernisation</b> Agreement, the {{agreement}} that was struck to end the 2007 strikes, and accused Royal Mail of threatening <b>modernisation</b> of the service. After a series of localised walkouts over the summer months, and after failing to reach an agreement, the CWU opened a national ballot for industrial action in September 2009.|$|E
50|$|As of 2012 in {{addition}} to multiple unit and locomotive repair and <b>modernisations</b> the plant still repairs steam locomotives.|$|R

5|$|An {{estimated}} 76% of Russia’s exports {{depend on}} resources extracted (or manufactured) in Siberia. In order to transport goods from East Asia to Europe, {{they must be}} transported through Siberia by rail. Hence, the region {{plays an important role}} in trade. However, it remains less developed than Russia’s western regions and <b>modernisation</b> plans are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{began to}} develop into a modern town in the early 1900s, with a {{continuing}} strong agricultural presence. <b>Modernisation</b> continued, and the World War II years transformed the population and its activities, establishing the town as a centre of scientific research.|$|E
5|$|Richmond House, at No.79, {{has held}} the Department of Health since 1987. The {{building}} {{is scheduled to be}} a temporary debating chamber from 2020, while the Houses of Parliament undergo a £7 billion refurbishment and <b>modernisation</b> programme.|$|E
50|$|Accidents, {{including}} a fatality in 1993, instigated various <b>modernisations</b> {{which led to}} a reduction of the capacity to the current 47,000 spectators.|$|R
50|$|During 1993, another {{range of}} <b>modernisations</b> took place, which {{included}} mechanical and electrical upgrades to the engine, a facelift of the bodywork, and bigger bumpers.|$|R

5|$|The line {{is due to}} be {{electrified}} {{as part of the}} 21st-century <b>modernisation</b> of the Great Western Main Line, {{which will}} also see the addition of two new running lines to increase capacity. Service frequency will be improved as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme.|$|E
5|$|The line is not electrified, but plans {{remain in}} place to address this {{as part of the}} planned <b>modernisation</b> of the Great Western Main Line. A new {{platform}} will also be built, allowing increased services from London.|$|E
5|$|The {{line through}} Worle is not electrified, {{but there is}} {{significant}} local support {{for it to be}} electrified as part of the 21st-century <b>modernisation</b> of the Great Western Main Line, partly motivated by worries that unless the line is electrified, Weston-super-Mare will lose direct services to London.|$|E
50|$|The ÖBB {{locomotives}} {{received some}} <b>modernisations</b> (e. g. new cabfront windows, with two windows {{instead of the}} original three), and the last examples remained in service until the early 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The factory began {{production}} in 1884 as a planned expansion and {{replacement of the}} North Eastern Railway's Queen Street site; the works was substantially expanded in 1897-1900, and saw further <b>modernisations</b> through the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 the {{blooming}} mill became electrically operated, in the 1950s and 60s further machines {{were converted to}} electric power, LDAC process (basic oxygen steelmaking) was introduced replacing the Gilchrist-Thomas process, and other <b>modernisations</b> and improvements made.|$|R
5|$|The sisters {{returned}} home in 1946; Indefatigable {{was used for}} the rest of the year to transport troops before being placed in reserve in 1947 and Implacable became the training carrier for Home Fleet. Indefatigable was converted into a training ship and reactivated in 1950 for service with the Home Fleet. Implacable was relegated to the reserve that same year and modified into a training ship in 1952. The sisters were scheduled for <b>modernisation</b> during the mid-1950s, but it was cancelled as the <b>modernisation</b> of the carrier in the queue ahead of them proved to be too expensive and lengthy. The sisters were decommissioned in 1954 and sold for scrap in 1955–56.|$|E
5|$|Against these setbacks, the CTR {{still had}} a record year in 1928, with over 30 million journeys. But from 1929, the buses took to the narrow streets in the city centre, as well as routes with low tram traffic such as Chartreux, Maromme and the circular. The tramways {{continued}} as going concerns, and started large programmes of renovation and <b>modernisation</b> in {{the dozen or so}} years before World War II. Between 1928 and 1932, 75 first-generation trams were rebuilt to allow one man operation.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{experimentally}} boilered No. 126, all the M7s entered into British Railways service in 1948. In that year No. 672 fell down the lift shaft which provided rolling stock {{access to the}} Waterloo and City Line at Waterloo, and was cut up. The remainder survived until 1957, {{but over the next}} seven years the remainder of the class was withdrawn as part of the <b>Modernisation</b> Plan..|$|E
50|$|After Peter Emil Refn's {{death in}} 1994, Kirsten Dalgaard and Annette Trampedach {{took over the}} {{responsibility}} for the cinema. They were succeeded by Kim Foss in 1996. All six auditoria underwent renovations and <b>modernisations</b> between 1998 and 2012.|$|R
50|$|On 4 December 2009, the <b>modernisations</b> to the 1905 Mechanics' Hall were officially opened. This hall is {{credited}} with being {{the birthplace of the}} Victorian Farmers Union, which later became the Country Party then National Party of Australia.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{continuous}} <b>modernisations,</b> GAZ found {{it increasingly difficult}} to keep the ageing car in an increasingly competitive consumer market economy, which had matured in Russia by the mid-2000s. GAZ CEO Bo Andersson decided to discontinue the Volga range in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Barcelona's Camp Nou is {{the largest}} stadium in Europe. The club's highest home {{attendance}} was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986. The <b>modernisation</b> of Camp Nou during the 1990s {{and the introduction of}} all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.|$|E
5|$|By October 1951, the {{estimated}} completion date for Victoriouss <b>modernisation</b> {{was already a}} year past the initial estimate of April 1954. Implacable was scheduled to begin her <b>modernisation</b> in April 1953 for completion in 1956, but the Director of Dockyards pointed out that existing schedules prevented her from beginning any earlier than April 1955 unless the modernisations of two cruisers and the guided missile test ship RFA Girdle Ness were delayed. The Controller of the Navy asked if the time and cost of the reconstruction could be reduced, but the minimum modifications were the most expensive as they involved structural alterations. The Controller ordered the Director of Dockyards to plan for rebuilding Implacable between June 1953 and December 1956 even after the latter protested that even a limited <b>modernisation</b> would require about three-quarters of the structural work of the original plan and that the shortage of skilled workers (already insufficient for Victorious by herself) would delay work on both ships. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of structural work, the requirement to replace the boilers was cancelled and the ship would receive existing radars instead of systems then still under development. In January 1952, the ship's new armament was finalized at six twin-gun 3"/70 mounts and three sextuple Bofors mounts. Five months later the Admiralty decided that Victorious would be the last fleet carrier modernised as experience showed that the process would take longer and cost more than was practicable.|$|E
5|$|Captain William Gladstone Agnew assumed command on 15 October 1945. The end of {{hostilities}} following Japan's surrender reduced {{the need for}} new warships, and consequently the ship was not commissioned until 12 May 1946. By this time, a total of £11,530,503, including £3,186,868 for the <b>modernisation</b> of the main armament, had been spent on producing Vanguard.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, the {{government}} of General Franco placed the bank under tight control. It was formally nationalised in 1962. Following the restoration {{of democracy in the}} late 1970s, the bank began a series of transformations and <b>modernisations</b> which continue to today.|$|R
50|$|The cupola {{above the}} central risalit was {{destroyed}} by Allied bombs during the war. Extensive renovations and <b>modernisations</b> were {{carried out in the}} building's interior from 1995 to 2000. The reopening took place on 13 May as part of Expo 2000.|$|R
25|$|The font, of Purbeck Marble, {{is early}} medieval but its carvings are nearly obliterated. The organ was {{installed}} in 1871 with subsequent <b>modernisations.</b> The exterior of the building is of local sandstone, flint and rubble, with evidence of endless repair and reconstruction.|$|R
