40|$|The {{possibility}} is discussed of interpreting fossil data {{in terms of}} changes of past plant biomass, by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> of percentages and concentrations of arboreal (AP) and non-arboreal pollen (NAP), and of the AP/NAP quotient. Changes in the pollen concentration by up to three orders of magnitude in a single core are interpreted as dramatic changes of the plant biomass through time; they {{are consistent with the}} variations of present-day phytomass and of modern pollen influx in different ecosystem of the world. The AP/NAP quotient can also provide general information on changes of forest biomass, when the non-forest vegetation does not significantly change its pollen production. In contrast, pollen percentages, by their inherent numerical properties, cannot adequately represent the variations in the vegetational density, particularly when the AP percentages are high. The {{possibility is}} considered that marked changes of biomass occur during forested periods, even if no significant changes of vegetation composition are recorded...|$|E

Potential risk factors were recorded by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>examination</b> of 1 ' 449 Swiss cows and the management systems of 78 farms during routine claw-trimming, and during personal interviews with the associated farmers. Statistical analysis of animal-based and herd level risk factors were performed using multivariate logistic regression models.

Cleanliness, BCS, affection with other foot lesions, breed, importance of claw health to the farmer, frequency of routine claw-trimming, producing according to the guidelines of the welfare label program RAUS, and silage feeding were shown to be associated with the occurrence of some of the evaluated foot lesions and lameness.

In Europe, for example, though IR achieved subspecialty status and became a subdivision of radiology at the Union of European Medical Specialists in 2009, to date the European Board in Interventional Radiology (EBIR) examination is not required to practice in most European countries. However, as illustrated by the official motto of the European Union « United in diversity », the rules for a license to practice in each country depend on national independent medical authorities.

The attention is paid especially to {{the second half of}} the fifteenth century and the first three decades of the sixteenth century. The thesis is based on the municipal book of the town Vimperk which captures the situation in the town between the years 1479 and 1670. This thesis also deals with the suzerain of Vimperk. Their actions and attitudes had often impact on the town. For the whole 15 th century Vimperk was controled by Kaplirzs of Sulevice. That is why a significant part of one chapter of this thesis deal with them. In Vimperk there ended one of the branches of the Golden Route which meant profit for both the town and the suzerain. Due to this fact, the final part of the thesis discusses the issue of the Golden Route and another trade roades which were in the surroundings of the town and influenced the situation of Vimperk.
