As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but outside, signs reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as [...] "like songs really, about the devil, about friendship, life". One example was [...] "Shadows we are and shadows we depart", written on a stone sundial; another began: [...] "Scan not a friend with a <b>microscopic</b> <b>glass</b> / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass..." [...] This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall, {{and it was an}} aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio, as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles. In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a [...] "bad domestic year", following his split with Boyd – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman, when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.|$|E

40|$|Various {{compounds}} may be entrapped {{into the}} sol–gel materials, including the photosensitive agents. The nanostructure {{of the final}} material depends on the matrix itself, {{as well as on}} the structural properties of doped compound. In this work, sol–gel matrices were produced from silica based precursor tetraethoxysilan (TEOS) in the form of single layers deposited on <b>microscopic</b> <b>glasses.</b> Materials were produced with molar ratios R = 20, 32, 40 (R – the number of solvent (ethanol) moles to the number of precursor (TEOS) moles). Additionally, for each material two various concentrations of photosensitizers were prepared (0. 5 mg/ml and 0. 05 mg/ml). On the basis of AFM images from Atomic Force Microscope Quesant 350, the following roughness parameters were evaluated: roughness average, peak–peak height, surface skewness and fractal dimension. The roughness average S a parameter gives information about the statistical average properties. The peak–peak height S y is defined as the height difference between the highest and the lowest pixel in the image. The surface skewness S sk describes the asymmetry of the height distribution histogram. The fractal dimension S fd is calculated for the different angles by analyzing the Fourier amplitude spectrum. Comparing the results we stated that average roughness increases with increasing R factor for protoporphyrine IX dimethylester (PPIX) (dimethyl- 8, 13 -divinyl- 3, 7, 12, 17 -tetramethyl- 21 H, 23 H-porphine- 2, 18 -dipropionate) and photolon (18 -carboxy- 20 -(carboxymethyl) - 8 -ethenyl- 13 -ethyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 3, 7, 12, 17 -tetramethyl- 21 H, 23 H-porphin- 2 -propionic acid) in higher concentrations. This means that photosensitizers used as dopants influence the smoothness of sol–gel matrix. We also noticed that the smallest roughness is observed in the material doped with PPIX in higher concentration. This was stated for all the images analyzed. This indicates that sol–gel matrix enclosures the PPIX molecules, resulting in smooth material. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} advertisement vehicle wrap {{is thought to}} have been created for Pepsi Co in 1993, which used vinyl to wrap a bus promoting its Crystal Pepsi product. It wasn’t long before bus wrap advertising was everywhere and the new form of vehicle graphics trickled down to smaller businesses and consumers. Wrapping whole vehicles was still challenging. Majority of the difficulties came from premature adhesion and air bubbles under the vinyl. As technology improved, companies like Avery Dennison, 3M and Oracal developed the use of air-channels that made the vinyl repositionable and allowed for bubble-free installation. Air-channel, created using <b>microscopic</b> <b>glass</b> beads incorporated into the vinyl’s adhesive, prevented the vinyl from fully sticking to the substrates surface thereby permitting air flow between adjacent sections. In addition, these beads allow for the vinyl to be repeatedly be removed and reapplied until the beads are broken by firmly pressing the vinyl using a small hard squeegee. Once the beads are broken the vinyl will be firmly adhered to the substrates surface. Proprietary company blends of polymer in the vinyl allowed the material to conform to compound curves, recesses, and corrugations through the use of heat guns and torches.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{discovery}} of a microtektite (<b>microscopic</b> impact <b>glass</b> particles) strewn fi eld from the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica. Microtektites were found trapped in the local detritus accumulated in weathering pits and in joints of several glacially eroded summits (~ 2600 m above sea level [asl]) distributed latitudinally for 520 km. Their physical and chemical properties defi ne a coherent population with a geochemical affi nity to Australasian microtektites and compatible Quaternary 40 Ar- 39 Ar formation age. We therefore suggest that Transantarctic Mountain microtektites (TAMM) defi ne the southern extension of the Australasian strewn fi eld. The margin of the Australasian strewn fi eld is thus shifted southward by ~ 3000 km and the maximum distance from the putative parent impact site in Indochina by ~ 2000 km. This emphasizes the paradox of the missing parent crater of the largest (> 10 % of the Earth’s surface) and youngest tektite strewn fi eld discovered on Earth. Furthermore, TAMM are depleted in volatile elements (i. e., Pb, Na, K, Rb, Sr, Rb, and Cs) rela tive to Australasian ones, suggesting a possible relationship between high-temperature–time regimes in the microtektite-forming process and high-angle trajectories in the ejecta plume...|$|R

50|$|Whispering-gallery waves {{exist for}} light waves. They have been {{produced}} in <b>microscopic</b> <b>glass</b> spheres or toruses, for example, with applications in lasing, optomechanical cooling, frequency comb generation and sensing. The light waves are almost perfectly guided round by optical total internal reflection, leading to Q factors in excess of 1010 being achieved. This is far greater than the best values, about 104, that can be similarly obtained in acoustics. Optical modes in a whispering gallery resonator are inherently lossy due to a mechanism similar to quantum tunneling. Strictly speaking, total internal reflection does not take place at a curved boundary between two distinct media, and light inside a whispering gallery resonator cannot be perfectly trapped, even in theoretically ideal conditions. Such a loss channel has been known from research on optical waveguide theory and is dubbed tunneling ray attenuation {{in the field of}} fiber optics. The Q factor is proportional to the decay time of the waves, which in turn is inversely proportional to both the surface scattering rate and the wave absorption in the medium making up the gallery. Whispering-gallery waves for light have been investigated in chaotic galleries, whose cross-sections deviate from a circle. And such waves have been used in quantum information applications.|$|E

A <b>microscopic</b> <b>glass</b> slip is also warmed on this plate with a drop of viscous natural Canada balsam on its surface.

In this paper, we investigate the fingering phenomena during immiscible displacements {{as well as the}} relationship between capillary number, oil recovery, and wave characteristics of developed fingers. An etched glass micromodel with three layers of large permeability contrasts was used in this work. The fluids used include a filtered deionized water and two field oil samples. Waterflood recovery to residual oil saturation was measured through image tool analysis techniques. The results showed that the low-permeability layer resulted in higher displacement efficiency compared to the medium- and high-permeability layers. At the microscopic level, fingering phenomena are attributed for the latter finding. An early occurrence and growth of multiple fingers were observed for high-permeable layers, whereas finger growth was delayed in layers with low permeability. Peter and Flock equation was used to draw a relation between oil recovery and finger characteristics, where the increase in capillary numbers leads to a decrease in both instability scaling index and incremental oil recovery. Moreover, the limitations of Peter and Flock equation were also highlighted for strongly water-wet systems. This paper helps field operators to gain more insight into microheterogeneity and fingering phenomena and their impact on waterflood recovery estimation.|$|R
