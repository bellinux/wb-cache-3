40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} is common and {{is determined by}} physiological (aging, physical fitness), pathological (obesity) and genetic factors. The metabolic compensatory response to insulin {{resistance is}} hyperinsulinaemia, {{the primary purpose of}} which is to maintain normal glucose tolerance. The ‘carnivore connection ’ postulates a critical role for the quantity of dietary protein and carbohydrate and the change in the glycaemic index of dietary carbohydrate in the evolution of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia. Insulin resistance offered survival and reproductive advantages during the Ice Ages which dominated human evolution, during which a high-protein low-carbohydrate diet was consumed. Following {{the end of the last}} Ice Age and the advent of agriculture, dietary carbohydrate increased. Although this resulted in a sharp increase in the quantity of carbohydrate consumed, these traditional carbohydrate foods had a low glycaemic index and produced only modest increases in plasma insulin. The industrial revolution changed the quality of dietary carbohydrate. The <b>milling</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> made starch more digestible and postprandial glycaemic and insulin responses increased 2 – 3 fold compared with coarsely ground flour or whole grains. This combination of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia is a common feature of many modern day diseases. Over the last 50 y the explosion of convenience and takeaway ‘fast foods ’ has exposed most populations to caloric intakes far in excess of daily energy requirements and the resulting obesity has been a major factor in increasing the prevalence of insulin resistance...|$|E

40|$|<b>Milling</b> or {{grinding}} <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains {{to produce}} flour is frequently accompanied by damage to starch granules, disruption of starch crystalline structure, and degradation of starch molecules. Amylopectin (AP) molecules {{are more susceptible}} to degradation than amylose (AM) molecules as AM molecules, present in amorphous conformation in native starch granules, are more flexible than the rigid double helical crystallites made of AP branches. The changes of starch structures caused by milling alter starch properties, including gelatinization, pasting, swelling, solubility, and digestibility, and thus affect flour quality. The changes in starch structures and properties, however, are different between the grinding <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains and that of isolated starch granules as the latter ignores the influences from non-starch components in grains. Hence, the grinding of isolated starch granules, commonly used to understand the effects <b>of</b> <b>milling,</b> does not represent the grinding <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains.

40|$|In {{the human}} history, the water exploitation, as {{a driving force}} in order to {{activate}} the millstones, represented an important technological innovation. This paper aims to relate the particularly hydrogeological context of the Tramutola area (Potenza) with the constructive and historical information of the old watermills still located in this zone. As {{in many areas of}} Italy, the Benedictine monks had a considerable importance because they were the first to use machinery moved by the water energy. The presence of different establishments, used for <b>milling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cereals,</b> determined a significant advancement of social and economic conditions in the Tramutola territory. The historical data have documented the presence of at least five mills that used as energy source the running water of the Rio Cavolo and some of its springs. Of these, only three buildings are still present: the Mulino Capo d’acqua, located in the urban area, the Mulino San Carlo, present in San Carlo quarter and, finally, the Mulino Caolo, located on the homonymous stream. The reconstruction of the respective devices allowed to be referred the first two to as "molini a ritrecine" mechanisms, constituted by a horizontal wheel, connected to a shaft that permitted the rotation of the movable grinding. A very important aspect is the integrated and sustainable use of the water resources in Tramutola area. In fact, the water was used for domestic purposes before it could drive the millstones, after going through the mill, it was used to agricultural fields irrigation...|$|R

40|$|Maximising {{digestible}} energy (DE) yield from cereals {{is fundamental to}} optimising efficiency in pig and poultry production systems. Given the potential interaction between grain structure and composition and DE (or AME) yields in monogastrics, consideration {{must be given to}} cost–effective interventions that may improve available energy supply from grains. Processing options such as extrusion and expansion have potential to significantly disrupt cellular arrangements within a grain and gelatinize the starch components, but the resulting increase in energy yield must be significant if the additional processing costs are to be justified. Such responses are poorly defined for specific <b>cereals.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this experiment was to assess the influence <b>of</b> extrusion <b>of</b> <b>milled</b> <b>cereal</b> grains and expansion <b>of</b> hydrated whole <b>cereal</b> grains on DE yield {{at the end of the}} small intestine and across the entire digestive tract in pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens. The results suggest that if energy yield from cereal grains for pigs, broiler chickens and laying hens is to be consistently improved, interventions other than extrusion or expansion are required, or a better understanding of the factors influencing specific responses to processing treatments is required. Results from the current experiment reveal that apparently similar cereal grains can respond differently when subjected to identical extrusion or expansion treatments...|$|R
