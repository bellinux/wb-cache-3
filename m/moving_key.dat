40|$|In {{a highly}} dynamic environment, {{knowledge}} of currently available and relevant resources {{is essential to}} the development of comprehensive situational awareness and assessment of threat level or status. We present an agent-based framework, the Active Metadata Framework, which supports the intelligent distribution of resource information among diverse assets, in a manner which supports focused awareness of resources and provides some measure of network disruption tolerance. This framework supports the concept of power to the edge by rapidly <b>moving</b> <b>key</b> data products directly to front-line warfighters. This accelerated movements of information improves war-fighter effectiveness by shortening the observeorient-decide-act (OODA) loop. This framework is demonstrated within a simulated complex military engagement in which assets are required to identify information sources (such as other similar assets, sensors, or databases), and utilize the data they provide to infer information about their situation and required actions. Inference in this framework is performed using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) with temporal extensions. Preliminary results are presented which demonstrate the successful, ad-hoc creation of networks of assets using this framework, the effective distribution of data through this dynamic network of assets, and the ability to infer information of value from the available data. ...|$|E

50|$|The {{most widely}} played purely digital wind {{controllers}} include the Yamaha WX series and the Akai EWI series. These instruments {{are capable of}} generating a standard MIDI data stream, thereby {{eliminating the need for}} dedicated synthesizers and opening up the possibility of controlling any MIDI-compatible synthesizer or other device. These instruments, while shaped something like a clarinet with a saxophone-like key layout, both offer the option to recognize fingerings for an assortment of woodwinds and brasswinds. The major distinction between the approach taken by the two companies is in the action of their keys. Yamaha WX series instruments have <b>moving</b> <b>keys</b> like a saxophone or flute that actuate small switches when pressed. Akai EWI series instruments have immovable, touch-sensitive keys that signal when the player is merely making contact with the keys. In the hands of skilled players each of these instruments has proved its ability to perform at a high level of artistry.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{and examines}} methods for the capture and reproduction of {{music on the}} piano that maintain a tight coupling between the body, the sound, and the physical instrument. For expert musicians, the body plays an indispensable role in the physical act of playing and the understanding of both musical structure and expressivity. However, many music learning technologies mistakenly assume that playing music is "playing the notes" and neglect {{the role of the}} body {{in the development of the}} musical mind. Drawing from research in telepresence, tangible interfaces, and augmented reality, I propose to bring the body back into the picture, literally and metaphorically, by augmenting a digital player piano with projection mapping. My platform synchronizes dynamic imagery with the piano's <b>moving</b> <b>keys</b> and acoustic sounds. I here focus on two main projects: MirrorFugue and Andante. Inspired by reflections on the lacquered surfaces of a grand piano, MirrorFugue simulates the presence of a virtual pianist whose reflection is actually playing the physically <b>moving</b> <b>keys.</b> It encourages anyone to take the seat left empty at the piano, to feel in his or her own body how music is expressed through the body of the performer, and to play along. Andante presents music as miniature figures that appear to walk and dance on the piano keyboard, physically striking a key with each stop. It conveys the expressivity in rhythms and phrases as well as musical structures through the bodies and movements of the figures. Both installations are designed as immersive "sandboxes" for the playful exploration of musical ideas. Beyond my projects, this thesis explores the parallels between music learning and learning and large. I discuss the connections between theories of music learning (particularly Dalcroze Eurhythmics) with theories of general mental development (Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, Seymour Papert, and Marvin Minsky), as well as how strategies from music learning could inform the art of learning in general. by Xiao Xiao.

500|$|Instead, when a cell [...] is emptied, it is {{necessary}} to search forward through the following cells of the table until finding either another empty cell or a key that can be moved to cell [...] (that is, a key whose hash value is equal to or earlier than [...] ). When an empty cell is found, then emptying cell [...] is safe and the deletion process terminates. But, when the search finds a key that can be moved to cell , it performs this move. This has the effect of speeding up later searches for the moved key, but it also empties out another cell, later in the same block of occupied cells. The search for a movable key continues for the new emptied cell, in the same way, until it terminates by reaching a cell that was already empty. In this process of <b>moving</b> <b>keys</b> to earlier cells, each key is examined only once. Therefore, the time to complete the whole process is proportional to the length of the block of occupied cells containing the deleted key, matching the running time of the other hash table operations.|$|R
