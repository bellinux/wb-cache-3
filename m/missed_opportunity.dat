40|$|<b>Missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> in {{vaccination}} {{are defined}} as the lack of proper vaccination of an eligible person who pays {{a visit to a}} health institution for various reasons. <b>Missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> in vaccination are higher in non-well child visits than in well child visits. A study carried out in two health centers in Turkey revealed proportions of 14, 4 % and 12, 7 %, which are much lower than the major research in this area in the world shows. As the limited number of studies implies, <b>missed</b> vaccination <b>opportunities</b> in Turkey mainly take place in second or third-level healthcare systems. The main reasons for <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> is the lack of knowledge and motivation of healthcare workers and insufficient and false information of families about vaccines. Although proper vaccination of children with underlying medical conditions is of great importance, there seems to be considerable neglect in this field, caused mainly by <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Rendering all vaccinations free-of-charge, regular vocational training of health personnel, avoidance of false vaccine contraindications, avoidance of unconfirmed vaccine information by mass media and organization of vaccination records will greatly minimize <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> in vaccination...|$|R

40|$|<b>Missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for {{immunization}} are {{an obstacle}} to raising immunization coverage among children and women of childbearing age. To determine their global magnitude and reasons, studies reported up to July 1991 were reviewed. A standard measure for the prevalence of <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> was calculated for each study. Seventy-nine studies were identified from 45 countries; 18 were population-based, 52 were health-service-based, and 9 were intervention trials. A median of 32 % (range, 0 - 99 %) {{of the children and}} women of childbearing age who were surveyed had <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> during visits to the health services for immunization or other reasons. <b>Missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> were mainly due to failure to administer simultaneously all vaccines for which a child was eligible; false contraindications; health workers' practices, including not opening a multidose vaccine vial for a small number of persons to avoid vaccine wastage; and logistical problems. To eliminate <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for immunization, programmes should emphasize routine supervision and periodic in-service training of health workers which would ensure simultaneous immunizations, reinforce information about true contraindications, and improve health workers' practices...|$|R

No sooner had he moved to his new headquarters at Lake Samro than {{he was told to}} send his men towards Staraya Russa to relieve the X Corps, which was in danger of being encircled. On 12 August the Red Army had launched an offensive with the 11th and 34th Armies against Army Group North, cutting off three divisions. Frustrated with the loss of the 8th Panzer and the <b>missed</b> <b>opportunity</b> to advance on Leningrad, Manstein returned to Dno. His counteroffensive led to a major Soviet defeat when his unit encircled five Soviet divisions, receiving air support {{for the first time on}} that front. They captured 12,000 prisoners and 141 tanks. His opponent, General Kuzma M. Kachanov of the 34th Army, was subsequently court martialed and executed for the defeat. Manstein tried to obtain rest days for his men, who had been constantly fighting in poor terrain and increasingly poor weather since the start of the campaign, but to no avail. They were ordered to advance to the east on Demyansk. On 12 September, when he was near the city, he was informed that he would take over 11th Army of Army Group South in Ukraine.|$|E

40|$|Background Missed opportunites for {{immunization}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} causes of low immunization coverage that should be prevented. Objective To investigate <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for immunization and related factors at urban and suburban primary health centers in Medan. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted between January- March 2004. Primary health centers in Medan were divided into urban (20 primary health centers) and suburban (19 primary health centers) groups. The sample size was 109 children who visited primary health centers for immunization. Study was done by a questionnaire taken after infants received immunization (exit interview). Results The proportion of <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> in urban and suburban area was 22. 3 % (95 % CI 16. 9 %; 27. 7 %) and 29. 9 % (95 % CI 24. 0 %; 35. 2 %) (P= 0. 191), respectively. Factors such as age of starting immunization, number of children more than 4, and low parental attitude about immunization (P= 0. 001) were related to <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for immunization. Conclusions There is no difference between proportion of <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> at primary health centers in urban and suburban area. Related factors to <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for immunization are age of starting immunization older than 3 months, number of children more than 4, and low parental attitude about immunization...|$|R

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS and {{tuberculosis}} {{are major}} public health problems. In 2010, 64 % of the 34 million of people infected with HIV {{were reported to}} be living in sub-Saharan Africa. Only 41 % of eligible HIV-positive people had access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Regarding tuberculosis, in 2010, the region had 12 % of the world's population but reported 26 % of the 8. 8 million incident cases and 254000 tuberculosis-related deaths. This paper aims to review <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for improving HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis prevention and care. We conducted a systematic review in PubMed using the terms 'missed'(Title) AND 'opportunities'(Title). We included systematic review and original research articles done in sub-Saharan Africa on <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> in HIV/AIDS and/or tuberculosis care. <b>Missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> for improving HIV/AIDS and/or tuberculosis care can be classified into five categories: i) patient and community; ii) health professional; iii) health facility; iv) local health system; and v) vertical programme (HIV/AIDS and/or tuberculosis control programmes). None of the reviewed studies identified any <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> related to health system strengthening. <b>Opportunities</b> that are <b>missed</b> hamper tuberculosis and/or HIV/AIDS care in sub-Saharan Africa where health systems remain weak. What is still missing in the analysis of health experts is the acknowledgement that <b>opportunities</b> that are <b>missed</b> to strengthen health systems also undermine tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS prevention and care.

40|$|Background The role {{of primary}} care clinicians ({{physician}}s, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) in evaluating acute cardiac ischemia is not well documented in office-based settings. Decision aids developed in the emergency department and other settings may help identify <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> to intervene in symptomatic outpatients before hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. Methods We conducted a case-control study of patients with no {{history of heart disease}} in a multisite group practice. Cases ("missed opportunities") were outpatients evaluated by primary care clinicians for chest pain or other anginal equivalents within 30 days of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction and not referred for immediate hospital care (n = 3 D 106). We identified 3 control patients matched to each case (n = 3 D 318) using initial symptom and encounter date. We assessed the ability of several coronary risk prediction tools to identify <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Results We identified 966 acute myocardial infarction hospital admissions among nearly 250 000 adults, including 261 (27. 0 %) with qualifying office visits in the preceding 30 days and 106 (11. 0 %) who were not directly referred for hospital care (cases). Chest pain (50. 0 %) and dyspnea (26. 4 %) were present in most of these cases. A Framingham risk score of 10 % or greater was associated with <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities</b> (odds ratio, 19. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 9. 3 - 40. 6). Increased scores using the Diamond and Forrester probability and the Goldman prediction tool were also associated with <b>missed</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Conclusions Primary care clinicians {{play an important role in}} the management of acute cardiac ischemia.
