Testing strategies including in vitro methods have been proposed to comply with this requirement. With the present study we aimed to develop a novel in vitro approach which mimics in vivo complexity, detects neurotoxicity comprehensively, and provides mechanistic insight.

PCA revealed concentration-dependent cluster formations for <b>methyl</b> mercury <b>chloride</b> (0. 1 - 1 muM), and treatment-dependent cluster formations for caffeine (1 - 100 muM) at sub-cytotoxic concentrations.
