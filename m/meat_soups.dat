On the other hand, some South Korean dishes such as bulgogi, bibimbap, and samgyeopsal were relatively unknown to Koryo-saram until recently.

5000|$|In his patent, Durand clearly {{mentions}} {{that the idea}} of the invention was communicated to him {{more than a year ago}} by a friend abroad. The patent itself consists of two distinct parts: first, the description of the original idea, and second, observations by Durand himself. Durand was clearly suspicious of the invention. However, having a curious mind, he performed a thorough test of it by himself, sealing <b>meat,</b> <b>soups</b> and milk, and boiling them as described. The original inventor had only experimented with small food volumes, whereas Durand envisioned future large scale production and therefore preserved up to 30 pounds (13.6 kg) of meat in one can. For unknown reasons, Durand used only tin cans rather than glass vessels. He arranged for the cans to sail with the Royal Navy for a period of four to six months. Several members of the Royal Society and the Royal Institution examined the food upon its arrival, and found that it was perfectly preserved.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} meals per day: breakfast, lunch and dinner. In all primary and {{secondary}} schools, including high school, a hot free lunch is served as part of Finland's welfare state system. Lunch, eaten around noon, is usually a warm meal, although some people may select a lighter meal such as a sandwich or a salad. Taking a lunchbox is not as common as elsewhere in Europe. Lunch typically consists of a single course with optional side salad, bread and dessert. Many workplaces have a lunch restaurant, and if not, employers often give lunch vouchers. Restaurants often have a separate lunch menu for this purpose. In the evening, the dinner is usually a hot meal, again with sides. Meals are usually single-course, commonly consisting of meat of some sort (pork, lamb, chicken, beef) and potatoes, rice or pasta with the <b>meat.</b> <b>Soups,</b> such as pea soup or fish soup, are not considered appetizers only, but may be served as lunch or dinner, and they are correspondingly heavier and come in larger portions.|$|E

5000|$|The word soup was {{not known}} in Belarus until the 18th century when the nobility {{borrowed}} it from German, but soup {{as a type of}} dish clearly existed centuries earlier. The old word for most traditional Belarusian soups was poliŭka (поліўка), except for those named after the vegetable that was the main ingredient: kapusta (cabbage soup), buraki (beet soup), gryžanka (swede soup). For a typical poliŭka the major ingredients (fish or mushrooms during fasts) were first boiled with spices; cereals such as barley or millet were boiled in the stock, and then flour blended with water, bread kvass, beet juice or buttermilk was added to the stock. Black poliŭka, made with goose or pork blood, is closely related to the Swedish [...] "black soup" [...] svartsoppa. Offering a matchmaker black poliŭka was the polite way for the bride’s parents to decline a young man’s proposal. Like the Ukrainians, Russians and Poles, Belarusians are fond of borscht, a thick and rich beet and cabbage soup made with grains, potato and <b>meat.</b> <b>Soups</b> are much more authentic, both hot (shchi, boršč, sorrel soup) and especially cold sour soups which provide cooling relief during the hot summer.|$|E

Essential oil yield and chemical components of two Iranian landraces of sweet basil including “Purple” and “Green” grown south-central of Iran (Isfahan province) were investigated. The hydro-distillated oils were analyzed by GC-MS. The oil yields {{were obtained from the}} aerial of Purple with 0. 56 ml/ 100 g dry matter and the aerial of Green with 0. 48 ml/ 100 g dry matter. Results indicated significant differences (p < 0. 01) among the aerial for the main constituents in the essential oil from two Iranian landraces of sweet basil. The major constituents of the essential oil from the aerial of Purple landrace were methyl chavicol or estragol (63. 32 %) and linalool (7. 96 %). The main compositions of the essential oil from the aerial of Green landrace were methyl chavicol (31. 82 %), geranial (24. 60 %) and neral (22. 65 %). Genarlly, a comparison of our results with the previous reports suggests differences in the essential oil compositions and oil yield of the plant material could be attributed to genetic diversity in two Iranian landraces of sweet basil...|$|E
