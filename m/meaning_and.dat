The <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> motives were coded into five categories; worker, client, agency, other institutions, <b>and</b> noninstitutional <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> motives. In addition, three theoretical concepts, operational themes, therapeutic worth of the client and operational dilemmas were developed and explored...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzed}} {{the designs of}} {{a select group of}} labyrinths set into the pavements of Gothic churches in northern France. The designs of these labyrinths <b>and</b> their possible <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> functions were examined. Existing information on the labyrinths, including oral traditions associated with them were considered. A study of earlier medieval church labyrinths and illustrations of labyrinths in medieval manuscripts was made. In addition, medieval philosophy and history were considered. The various <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> functions scholars have proposed for the labyrinths were critically reviewed. It was possible to draw some conclusions as to the labyrinths' original <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> their functions and to trace the evolution of these <b>meanings</b> <b>and</b> functions during the Middle Ages...|$|R

5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E

5|$|In recent times, {{the focus}} has been on {{creating}} an awareness of the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human overpopulation and its consequent need for biological and physical resources.

5|$|Poetic diction {{treats the}} manner in which {{language}} is used, and refers not only to the sound but also to the underlying <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> its interaction with sound and form. Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of <b>meaning,</b> <b>and</b> the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E

5|$|Some {{surviving}} stories regarding Iðunn {{focus on}} her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} 9th-century Oseberg ship burial site in Norway and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe which may have had a symbolic <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> also that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in Southwest England.|$|E
5|$|The lion is {{probably}} represented more frequently and diversely {{than any other}} animal. In most forms, the lion has no apotropaic <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> was merely decorative. However, it sometimes has an astrological or symbolic meaning. One of the popular forms of the lion is explicitly heraldic form, including in the Persian coat of arms (the lion and sun); the animal in the coat of arms of the Mamluk Baybars and perhaps also in that of the Rum Saldjukids {{of the name of}} Kilidi Arslan; and in numismatic representations.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{central theme}} {{involves}} {{the examination of}} the human desire to detect patterns or <b>meaning</b> <b>and</b> the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.|$|E
