25|$|Mechanical {{transmission}} {{involves the}} direct {{transmission of the}} same individual trypanosomes taken from an infected host into an uninfected host. The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to <b>mechanical</b> <b>injection</b> with a syringe. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as horse-flies, can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.|$|E

2500|$|Known at Cosworth Engineering as Project EA, a Cosworth racing engine {{based on}} the Vega {{aluminum}} block produced a reported [...] and powered Chevron and Lola race cars to wins in the 2-liter class in their first outings. The ZO9 Cosworth Vega engine is a de-tuned version. Bore, stroke and valve sizes are identical but it lacks the EA engine’s dry sump lubricating system (unnecessary in a street use car), has a lower compression ratio and different valve timing, and uses Bendix electronic fuel injection instead of Lucas <b>mechanical</b> <b>injection</b> {{to cope with a}} wider range of operating conditions as well as emission controls.|$|E
2500|$|Motorists {{occasionally}} pump gasoline into {{a diesel}} car by accident. [...] The converse {{is almost impossible}} because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of [...] which does not fit the [...] filler, and the nozzles are protected by a lock mechanism or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. The issue is not clear-cut as older diesels using completely <b>mechanical</b> <b>injection</b> can tolerate some gasoline — which has historically been used to [...] "thin" [...] diesel fuel in winter.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} the {{takeover}} of the Rover Group by BMW, who brought their own range of diesel engines, made the Storm engine largely redundant. Only the 5-cylinder version made it to production as the powerplant for the Defender and the new Discovery Series II as the 'Td5' in 1998. Offering more power and greater refinement than the 300Tdi the Td5 greatly improved {{the appeal of the}} Discovery but caused concern amongst many operators of the Defender due to its electronic engine management systems which were considered to be less reliable and more difficult to repair 'in the field' than the <b>mechanical</b> <b>injection</b> systems used on previous Land Rover diesel engines. In deference to these concerns (including those voiced by the British Army) Land Rover kept the 300Tdi in production for fitment to special-order vehicles (see above). It transpired that the Td5's electronics were highly reliable. Early engines suffered two isolated mechanical failures—sudden and complete failure of the oil pump drive and 'cylinder head shuffle' caused by weak retaining studs. Both these faults were fixed within 2 years of the engine starting production and the Td5 is now considered highly reliable. In 2002 the engine was improved to reach Euro 3 antipollution stage, and an EGR valve system was introduced. Electronics were also updated to improve the low-speed throttle response which had been prone to producing [...] a jerky power delivery in off-road or towing situations.|$|E
