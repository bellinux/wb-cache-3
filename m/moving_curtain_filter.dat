40|$|Background {{subtraction}} is an extensively used {{approach to}} localize the moving object {{in a video}} sequence. However, detecting an object under the spatiotemporal behavior of background such as rippling of water, <b>moving</b> <b>curtain</b> and illumination change or low resolution is not a straightforward task. To deal with the above-mentioned problem, we address a background maintenance scheme based on the updating of background pixels by estimating the current spatial variance along the temporal line. The work is focused to immune the variation of local motion in the background. Finally, the most suitable label assignment to the motion field is estimated and optimized by using iterated conditional mode (ICM) under a Markovian framework. Performance evaluation and comparisons with the other well-known background subtraction methods show that the proposed method is unaffected by the problem of aperture distortion, ghost image, and high frequency noise...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{segmenting}} and classifying domestic moving objects using a syntactic approach. The problem is to recognise moving objects {{in front of the}} camera in a domestic environment such as human beings, curtains blown by the wind and external events such as tree branches, and the aim is to distinguish moving human heads from <b>moving</b> <b>curtains</b> or tree branches. In real-world images, the situation where a human being is moving in the foreground and at the same time the curtains and/or tree branches are moving in the background, often arises. We use quadratic neurons (represented by quadratic forms) as our simple pattern primitives and extract the structural information based on the relationships between the forms. We call this the UpWrite process, and it can be applied any number of times. To achieve our aim of recognising moving heads, we require two levels of the UpWrite process. We hypothesise that the syntactic UpWrite is implemented in wetware by distinct [...] ...|$|R

60|$|Indeed at {{this moment}} the {{prospect}} she gazed abstractedly upon seemed to justify that lugubrious description. The Santa Ana Valley--a long monotonous level--was dimly visible through <b>moving</b> <b>curtains</b> of rain or veils of mist, to the black mourning edge of the horizon, and had looked like that for months. The valley--in some remote epoch {{an arm of the}} San Francisco Bay--every rainy season seemed to be trying to revert to its original condition, and, long after the early spring had laid on its liberal color in strips, bands, and patches of blue and yellow, the blossoms of mustard and lupine glistened like wet paint. Nevertheless on that rich alluvial soil Nature's tears seemed only to fatten the widow's acres and increase her crops. Her neighbors, too, were equally prosperous. Yet for {{six months of the year}} the recognized expression of Santa Ana was one of sadness, and for the other six months--of resignation.

40|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} when having fat {{reserves}} is costly {{in terms of}} predation risk, birds should decrease their levels of fat reserves in response to increased predation risk. I performed an experiment in which yellowhammers were exposed to a control treatment, where a curtain was moved several times a day, 5 days in a row, {{and then to a}} predator treatment, where a perched, stuffed sparrowhawk appeared when the curtain was moved, 5 days in a row Between the two treatments were 2 days without any experimental treatment. The birds were expected to decrease in mass, and/or to change the daily trajectory of mass increase in response to increased predation risk. Yellowhammers decreased in morning mass and evening mass in response to both che <b>moving</b> <b>curtain</b> and the sparrowhawk compared to an untreated day {{before the start of the}} experiment. However, the response to both treatments was not the same; in the sparrowhawk treatment the birds waited longer before resuming feeding and lost more weight after each exposure as compared to the curtain treatment. This loss was regained, and yellowhammers increased their intake rate. Due to that, they reduced, although not significantly, the time spent feeding under predation risk. A reduction in the time spent feeding under predation risk reduces the time exposed to predators. However, if an increase in intake rate also incurs a decrease in vigilance, this might increase predation risk. The results of this study, together with other studies, indicate that for yellowhammers a reduction in time exposed to predators might be more important for survival than a reduction in body mass...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two ways}} to convert this split. The first is to strike either pin and have it bounce out of the pit area and strike the {{remaining}} pin. This not only requires substantial ball speed but the pin must be struck in the right spot. Additionally, a pin flying out from the pit is a fairly rare occurrence. This is made more difficult by variation of the pit design according to the pinsetter system, with the Brunswick A-2 being more prone to bounce-outs than recent machines. Bouncing out on a Brunswick GS-series pinsetter is exceedingly difficult due to a <b>moving</b> <b>curtain</b> {{at the back of the}} pit which absorbs the impact, while AMF pinsetters have a higher chance of bouncing out the pin facing away from the ball return of a lane pair. The second method is to strike either pin on the inside with enough velocity to bounce it off the side wall (kickback plate) and rebound onto and across the deck into the other pin. Sliding the pin directly will not work since the ball will fall off the lane before it gets far enough aside the 7 or 10 pin to slide it directly across. Despite this fact, many television shows and movies over the years have depicted the 7-10 split being converted by directly sliding one pin into another. In each case, the [...] "conversion" [...] was rigged by either moving the sliding pin over on a deck without pin spots (giving the ball extra room to slide the pin sideways and making it look like the pin was spotted correctly) or by having some help (human or mechanical) from the pit to [...] "slide" [...] the pin over. Barring such [...] "Hollywood magic" [...] in real life, a freak bounce out of the pit or a side wall rebound are the only realistic ways to convert a 7-10 split.|$|R

50|$|Media as an {{influential}} instrument {{are one of}} the core themes of the book which is a witty cross-section of the advertising business and how it manipulates people. By means of notorious advertisements audience is made to adjust themselves to what is transmitted on TV and thus become Homo Zapiens - zapping man. The phenomenon of a zapping man can be explained in the following way: enormous amounts of advertising make us flip channels in order to avoid watching ads. As a result, television, in a way, remotely controls us, and theoretically ad patterns and blocks can be shaped {{in such a way that}} at a particular moment we will come across a certain program on a certain channel, still being unaware of being steered. Therefore, instead of searching for the needed info we run away from the unwanted one. What is more Pelevin uses an example of society whose mind and consuming habits is tabula rasa and therefore may be shaped in almost any suitable way. Post -soviet man was an ideal target for advertising attack. The Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>filtered</b> all information coming from the outside of the USSR, thus acting somehow as a biasing program. The mind of homo soveticus after the Union’s fall was a perfect target for ad-biasing. Lack of information, and at the same time enormous information thirst created unique conditions - an advertising tabula rasa. By means of ad material more or less adjusted to cultural background anything could be sold as the mentality of homo soveticus had no reference point and this way was unable to judge about the offered products. In such conditions information transmitted from the screen is perceived as the true one, especially by those who have trusted the TV for the past 50 years. Any ad is perceived as a reliable and valuable info-source. Thus the task of a copywriter is simplified to nil - any information he supplies will be perceived as eternal truth, and the product will be sold. Yet,although the obvious reason for a company owner wanting to film a TV ad is his desire to sell the product, Pelevin suggests that this is the way things are in the West, while an ex-Soviet business owner's reasons for shooting a commercial are somewhat more ambiguous. As Hanin explains to Tatarsky, - a badly made TV commercial may be even more desirable than a good one, since the idea behind it, is to show the money lenders, that this particular business owner is so wealthy and so confident, that he can easily afford to throw a few million rubles on such horrible TV ad. Thus a post-soviet businessman advertises himself and his status rather than the product he sells, a behavior which illustrates anal wow-factor in action rather well.|$|R
