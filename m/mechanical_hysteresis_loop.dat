Our experiments involve two quantitative imaging techniques: digital image correlation (DIC) and infrared thermography (IRT). Kinematics fields obtained by DIC allow the estimation of stress and energy density fields by means of a variational method. The temperature recorded by IRT is used to resolve a local form of heat equation, giving thermoelastic and dissipative sources accompanying HCF. Our first results show that around 50 % of the deformation energy associated with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> is dissipated while the rest corresponds to stored energy variation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an experimental device developed {{to detect and}} estimate dissipated energy during very high cycle fatigue tests (VHCF) at high loading frequency (20 kHz) and low stress (i. e. far below the yield stress). Intrinsic dissipation is computed using local expressions of the heat diffusion equation and thermal data fields provided by an infrared focal plane array camera. The results obtained from tests performed on pure copper specimens show that dissipated energy exists whatever the attainable stress range and show that the dissipated energy rate is not constant throughout the test. Both findings are respectively incompatible with the concepts of fatigue limit based on elastic shakedown or on stabilized cyclic state associated with the <b>mechanical</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> (viscoplastic shakedown) ...|$|E
40|$|A few {{exploratory}} {{tests were}} conducted {{to determine the effect}} of cyclic work softening on the mechanical properties of a hard commercially pure al-uminum. Cyclic work softening, or fatigue softening, is the loss of mech-anical strength and the accompanying reduction in surface hardness which 2 some materials show under cyclic loading [1]. Like hardening under cyclic loads, softening under cyclic loads is limited and usually takes place only during the first 10 - 25 % of the fatigue life. Cyclic hardening or soften-ing occurs only if there is plastic strain produced by each loading i. e. only if there is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> for the cyclic loading. Note that the material exhibits softening only in a cycle or on the reversal of load. Materials which soften cyclically do show normal stable strain harden-ing under monotonic loading [2].

This paper focuses on a new detection technique which makes use of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>hysteresis</b> seen as <b>loops</b> in the force‐displacement curves. It was observed from load test data that internal damage in honeycomb sandwiches causes the average slope of the force‐displacement curves to decrease and the area contained within the <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> to increase. To satisfy the inspection speed and one‐sided access requirements of NDE techniques, a dynamic loading approach was pursued where an accelerometer was used to tap {{the surface of the}} test sample.

40|$|Abstract. The {{thermo-mechanical fatigue}} (TMF) {{behaviour}} of the Nimonic 90 Nickel base superalloy {{has been investigated}} within two laboratories. In-phase-tests (IP) where the maximum mechanical strain occurs at the maximum temperature (850 °C), and 180 °-out-of-phase-tests (180 ° OP) where the maximum mechanical strain coincides with the minimum temperature (400 °C) have been applied. All tests were carried out at varying mechanical strain ranges with a constant strain ratio of Rε =- 1. A temperature rate of 5 K/s was used throughout the whole cycle without any additional cooling system during decreasing temperature. The fatigue life of 180 ° OP tests is longer compared to identical IP tests. The stress / <b>mechanical</b> strain <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> are completely different and some characteristic values are compared to each other. The fracture surfaces observed show that fatigue crack (or cracks) starts on the external surface and propagates inwards.

40|$|International audienceAbstract This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} of deformation in rubber, especially stress-induced crystallization, using infrared thermography. Temperature variations are measured during cyclic uniaxial mechanical tests at ambient temperature. Results show that natural rubber mainly exhibits entropic behaviour: the material produces (resp. absorbs) heat during loading (resp. unloading). The crystallization of the polymer chains under tension leads to a temperature increase {{of the order of}} several degrees Celsius. If crystallization and crystallite melting occur over one <b>mechanical</b> cycle, a <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> is observed in terms of the strain-stress relationship. Stress relaxation tests show that the thermal signatures of crystallization and of crystallite melting are different. Indeed, if the strain is maintained fixed during loading, the temperature continues to increase for a few seconds before returning to the ambient temperature. This reveals that crystallization continues during relaxation. On the contrary, if the strain is maintained fixed during unloading, the specimen returns instantaneously to the ambient temperature...|$|R

Conversely as the pressure increases (P/P 0  >  0.5), an adsorption <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> appears within all samples. The {{appearance of the}} adsorption <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> mainly depends on the capillary condensation that occurs on the solid surface. The adsorption <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> of different coal samples vary considerably, indicating different pore structure characteristic effects on gas adsorption (Jiang et al. 2011).

As shown in Fig.  1, the adsorption <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop</b> for Jurassic low-rank coal emerges under pressures of 0.5 – 0.8 and gradually disappears as the pressure increases. This phenomenon confirms that mesopores in low-rank coal samples usually have semi-open inkpot-shapes and macropores are usually slit-shaped.
