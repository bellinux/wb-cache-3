In 2011, {{the school was}} in Corrective Action II 5th Year status due to chronic lagging <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> achievement. In 2010, the school declined to Corrective Action II 4th Year status due to continuing low student <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> achievement. The attendance rate was 93% in both 2010 and 2011. In accordance with No Child Left Behind, due to low student achievement, the school was mandated to allow students to transfer to a successful school in the district. Students may transfer to either Stetser Elementary School or Chester Upland School of the Arts. The district must provide transportation. Free tutoring is offered after school to help eligible students improve in reading, mathematics and science. The school has a Title I and Parent- School Community Council which works with parents to improve student performance. In 2009–10, enrollment was 365 pupils with 40 children in preschool. There were 16.5 teachers.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{examined}} whether math fluency was {{independent from}} untimed <b>math</b> <b>and</b> from <b>reading</b> using 314 pairs of school-aged twins {{drawn from the}} Western Reserve Reading <b>and</b> <b>Math</b> Projects. Twins were assessed through a 90 -min home visit at approximately age 10 and were reassessed in their homes approximately 1 year later. Results suggested that the shared environment and genetics influenced the covariance among math fluency, untimed <b>math</b> measures, <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> measures. However, roughly {{two thirds of the}} variance in math fluency was independent from untimed <b>math</b> measures <b>and</b> <b>reading,</b> including reading fluency. The majority of this independent variance was the result of genetic factors that were longitudinally stable across two measurement occasions. These results suggest that math fluency, although related to other math measures, may also be a genetically distinct dimension of mathematics performance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{identify}} school-level variables that influence academic outcomes, {{and to determine}} the extent of their influence. Using state-level panel data, this study estimates a simple achievement function to explore the nexus between three identified factors (percentage of students eligible for reduced/free lunch program, school enrolment and per-pupil expenditure) and student achievement (percentage of satisfactory of 4 th grade <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>read)</b> in the United States. Method: Based on literature reference and rational hypotheses, the effects of the percentage of student eligible for reduced or free lunch, school enrolment and per-pupil expenditure on the percentage of 4 th grade student satisfactory in <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>read</b> were tested for a certain group of students separately. Ordinary Least Squares regression model was used to determine the validity and strength of each relationship. Result: The data set consisted of 1823 observations located in different districts. Final test result shows that: 1) Significant negative effect on student achievement is found under the factor of percentage of students eligible for reduced or free lunch. 2) Slight negative effect on student achievement is found under the factor of school enrollment. 3) Slight positive effect on student achievement is found under the factor of per-pupil expenditure. Students in school with lower percentage of students eligible for reduced or free lunch program, lower enrolment record, and more per-pupil expenditure will have better academic performance...|$|R
500|$|Zahorchak was {{a steady}} {{supporter}} of Rendell's education proposals. However, he maintained {{that he could}} still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, [...] "I happen {{to agree with the}} outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions." [...] In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, [...] "I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level." [...] However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams.|$|E

500|$|The school's {{philosophy}} {{is that students}} learn best at their own pace. The original curriculum was a cross between [...] "instruction and home life". The Albany Free School has no firm schedule and does not grade students. The day begins at 8:15a.m. and students are asked {{what they want to}} do each day. Students are grouped by age and present their own plan for each day. They pursue various projects including writing, filmmaking, and studying language or history. The school also offers structured <b>math</b> <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> classes for those who want it. Classes tend to have five to seven students per teacher and the school's teacher–student relationships are close. Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans. In 2006, the school had ten teachers, four interns, and a number of parent volunteers for 58 students between the ages of three and fourteen (pre-K to eighth grade). The school has a [...] "Living and Learning" [...] program between 10 a.m. and noon, followed by lunch, which the students make themselves as part of the program. The children play sports until their 3 p.m. class and school ends at 4 p.m.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, {{a report}} from the National Commission on Excellence in Education {{declared}} that American education standards were eroding, that young people in the United States were not learning enough.
