25|$|Some of {{the tracks}} {{controlled}} by Harris were removed, and the <b>model</b> <b>board</b> revised, when a new engine terminal was built {{in conjunction with the}} electrification of the line between Harrisburg and Philadelphia in 1938. The territory controlled by Harris Tower marked the western end of the electrification of the Pennsylvania Railroad's passenger lines. The engine terminal assisted in the switching of electric locomotives to steam or diesel locomotives for the trip west of Harrisburg. The Pennsylvania merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central. In 1971, Amtrak took over intercity passenger service from Penn Central and also took possession of many ex-Pennsylvania Railroad tracks and facilities, including Harris Tower. Penn Central was taken over by Conrail in 1976. Conrail modernized its signalling control system in 1989 and consolidated it into a centralized traffic control facility located north of Harrisburg. Consequently, Harris Tower was reduced to controlling only four Amtrak trains a day. Amtrak combined the functions of Harris Tower with the nearby State Tower located in the Harrisburg Transportation Center on November15, 1991, and closed the tower.|$|E

This, in turn, is a function of negotiations (implicit or explicit) between the existing directors and the CEO over who will fill vacancies on the board.

50|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad {{completed}} its main line across the Allegheny Mountains, connecting Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, in 1854. By the 1870s, the Pennsylvania had connected New York City to Chicago and St. Louis; consequently, all {{freight and passenger}} traffic from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., had to pass through Harrisburg before heading west. Harris Tower, then called HG Tower from its call sign when railroad communications were sent via telegraph, was built in 1929. It replaced three nearby towers that had been constructed in 1889. The consolidation reduced the manpower needed to control the 3300 ft and 15 sets of tracks north of Pennsylvania Station from 21 to 12. Harris Tower was put into service on April 26, 1930.Some of the tracks controlled by Harris were removed, and the <b>model</b> <b>board</b> revised, when a new engine terminal was built {{in conjunction with the}} electrification of the line between Harrisburg and Philadelphia in 1938.

40|$|Abstract. An optical design {{concept is}} {{presented}} {{for a wide}} field of view camera, used {{to take pictures of}} a <b>model</b> <b>board,</b> which are displayed to the pilot of a simulated aircraft in real time. The concept achieves mapping functions and perspectives in three separate images that match the dis-play system properties over 140 deg field of view. This enables fast feedback of the <b>model</b> <b>board</b> images to the pilot by avoiding the need for computer correction of optical distortion. The geometry of the lens system also ensures good uniformity of brightness over the wide field of view. The provision of three axes of angular movement and computer optical design techniques are discussed. The general design and fabrication of a prototype is described.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} developing a model to predict the yield of {{a printed circuit board}} manufactured on a given assembly line. Based on an extensive literature review as well as discussion with industrial partners, it was determined that there is no tool available for assisting engineers in determining reliable estimates of their production capabilities as they introduce new board designs onto their current production lines. Motivated by this need, a more in-depth study of manufacturing yield as well as the electronic assembly process was undertaken. The relevant literature research was divided into three main fields: process <b>modeling,</b> <b>board</b> design, and PCB testing. The model presented in this research combines elements from process <b>modeling</b> and <b>board</b> design into a single yield model.
