40|$|The Arakawa-Mintz general {{circulation}} {{model of the}} earth {{has been applied to}} Mars at the season of the Viking Lander <b>mission.</b> <b>Allowance</b> has been made for the effects of the large Martian topography. The calculated wind fields exhibit significant zonally symmetric, topographically forced, and diurnal tidal components. Average wind speeds of 20 - 25 m/sec were found at three possible landing sites, with wind speeds occasionally reaching values as much as a factor of 2 larger than these average values. If buffering by CO 2 adsorbed in the regolith can be neglected, a pressure decline of about 0. 8 mb is expected over the first two months of operation of the first lander...|$|E
40|$|Thesis is {{focusing}} on the possible personal costs and is acquainting with their accounting and tax issues. It is analyzing the tax part of costs and their interception in accounting system. First part of the thesis is focused on compact overview of legal definition of accounting in Czech Republic and its principles and purposes for business activities. Further is describing a system of remuneration via wages, salaries and employee’s amenities and is explaining the group of accounts 52 – Personal costs issues in the connection with their tax aspects. The objective of diploma thesis is also defining <b>mission</b> <b>allowances</b> with relating valide...|$|R
40|$|Wind speed, ambient {{and surface}} {{temperatures}} from both Viking Landers {{have been used}} to compute bulk Richardson numbers and Monin-Obukhov lengths during the earliest phase of the Mars missions. These parameters are used to estimate drag and heat transfer coefficients, friction velocities and surface heat fluxes at the two sites. The principal uncertainty is in the specification of the roughness length. Maximum heat fluxes occur near local noon at both sites, and are estimated to be in the range 15 - 20 W/sq m at the Viking 1 site and 10 - 15 W/sq m at the Viking 2 site. Maximum values of friction velocity occur in late morning at Viking 1 and are estimated to be 0. 4 - 0. 6 m/s. They occur shortly after dawn at the Viking 2 site where peak values are estimated to be in the range 0. 25 - 0. 35 m/s. Extension of these calculations to later times during the <b>mission</b> will require <b>allowance</b> for dust opacity effects in the estimation of surface temperature and in the correction of radiation errors of the Viking 2 temperature sensor...|$|R
