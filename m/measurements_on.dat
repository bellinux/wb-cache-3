40|$|It {{is assumed}} that an {{arbitrary}} composite bipartite pure state {{in which the two}} subsystems are entangled is given, and it is investigated how the entanglement transmits the influence of <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> only one of the subsystems to the state of the opposite subsystem. It is shown that any exact subsystem measurement has the same influence as ideal <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> the opposite subsystem. In particular, the distant effect of subsystem measurement of a twin observable, i. e., so-called 'distant measurement', is always ideal <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> the distant subsystem no matter how intricate the direct exact <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> the opposite subsystem is.

5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives. When all obvious false positives were cleared, the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity <b>measurements</b> <b>on</b> the star. Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an experiment, called the ABA experiment, designed to test a fundamental prediction of quantum probability theory when applied to human judgments and decisions. The prediction concerns the effect of one <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> another when the measurements are incompatible (i. e., the answers to the <b>measurements</b> depend <b>on</b> the order of these measurements). After an initial measurement of an opinion on an issue, A, the answer to a second <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> the same issue A immediately afterwards will certainly be the same as the first. However, according to the uncertainty principle, if a <b>measurement</b> of opinion <b>on</b> issue A is followed by an incompatible <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> another issue, B, then the answer to a second <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> issue A will become uncertain. This prediction was tested with 325 participants {{on a wide range of}} 12 different set of issues that were previously shown to be incompatible. Contrary to previous claims published in this journal, the empirical findings support the prediction of quantum probability theory applied to human judgments...|$|R

5|$|The {{offense is}} given a series of four plays, known as downs. If the offense {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{tripartite}} quantum system, {{research has}} shown how the dynamics can create correlations and entanglement especially for indirect correlation between the particles. Although, {{there is no direct}} correlation between the particles in some cases, however, after evolution or transformation they become entangled. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of one type of von Neumann measurement called the non-selective measurement. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of non-selective <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> a chain of three oscillators A, B, C with nearest neighbour coupling when we performed the photon number <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> A. We are interested to investigate the effects of quantum <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> the correlation and entanglement, that is, whether it will increase or decrease and also the effects on the whole tripartite quantum system. It was discovered that, after the <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> A, the correlation of oscillators A, B and A, C collapse to factorizable states and do not effect the entanglement of oscillator B,C...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} photons are fundamental to investigating quantum mechanical phenomena using light. In multi-photon, two-mode systems, correlations may exist between outcomes of <b>measurements</b> made <b>on</b> each mode which exhibit useful properties. Correlation {{in this sense}} {{can be thought of}} as increasing the probability of a particular outcome of a <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> one subsystem given a <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> a correlated subsystem. Here, we show a statistical property we call "discorrelation," in which the probability of a particular outcome of one subsystem is reduced to zero, given a <b>measurement</b> <b>on</b> a discorrelated subsystem. We show how such a state can be constructed using readily available building blocks of quantum optics, namely coherent states, single photons, beam splitters and projective measurement. We present a variety of discorrelated states, show that they are entangled, and study their sensitivity to loss. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, updated to published versio...|$|R
