5|$|The Great Revolt and the {{subsequent}} sacking of Jerusalem in 70 CE brought about the destruction of Herod's Temple, including the Royal Stoa, {{by members of the}} Roman X Fretensis, XII Fulminata, XV Apollinaris and V Macedonica legions under the command of emperor Vespasian's son Titus. It is likely that the stoa was modified during the initial phases of the revolt when the Temple Mount was fortified, first by Simon Bar Giora and then by John of Gischala. The main entry at Robinson's Arch was destroyed and towers built. Excavated remains of the Stoa provide evidence of its demise in a great fire. Chemical analysis of the remains has shown that some of the materials underwent transformations requiring a <b>minimum</b> <b>temperature</b> of —a result of sustained, high-temperature burning consistent with Josephus's account of destruction in a large conflagration. Some remains also contain the mineral apatite, a component of bone, though its origins, human or animal, are unknown.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Data on air {{and road}} surface {{temperatures}} not beeing available, climatological {{data from the}} site of the meteorological station have been used to determine the temperature relations needed for predicting road slipperiness. The analysis has been made for the cold period of the year (September to May) for the 10 -year period 1971 - 1980 at the Zagreb-Maksimir station, located in the Sava River valley at the foot of Mount Medvednica. The analysis involves the relations between <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperatures</b> at two levels, 2 m and 5 cm as well as between <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperatures</b> at 2 m height and soil temperatures at 5 cm depth at 7 a. m. during various weather situations, defined according to average cloudiness, wind conditions, fog and frozen ground during the night preceding the occurrence of <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In weather situations with prevailing radiation processes (clear/calm and partly cloudy/calm), the <b>minimum</b> surface air <b>temperatures</b> are always lower than at 2 m height. On the other hand, after cloudy nights, regardless of wind velocity, the <b>minimum</b> surface <b>temperatures</b> are lower than those at 2 m only above determined <b>temperature</b> levels. The <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperatures</b> at 5 cm height are lower than 0 °C when the <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> at 2 m height are lower than 3 °C during clear/calm, clear/windy and partly cloudy/calm situations. During partly cloudy/windy, cloudy/calm and cloudy/windy situations, the differences between <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> at these two levels are smaller, and consequently, negative <b>minimum</b> surface <b>temperatures</b> appear if the <b>minimum</b> <b>temperatures</b> at 2 m are about 0 °C. The relations between <b>minimum</b> air <b>temperatures</b> and soil temperatures do not differ significantly for different weather types. However, they differ considerably from month to month. According to these conclusions, soil temperatures should be predicted particularly by means of regression equations obtained for each month...|$|R
