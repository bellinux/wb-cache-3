High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry has been applied for the determination of a number of compounds in biological fluids (Zhu et al. 2011). Other assay methods for olopatadine and its metabolites in human plasma by HPLC with electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry were reported (Fujimaki et al. 2006; Fujita et al. 1999). Varghese et al. (2011) have used 0.1 % orthophosphoric acid (pH 4.5) with triethylamine/acetonitrile (75 : 25) for the determination of olopatadine hydrochloride. Triethylamine should be avoided as its addition to the mobile phase requires longer column equilibration times, which is not advisable for the routine use of the developed method.

Methods: A stability-indicating high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method {{was developed and}} {{used to determine the}} stability of ampicillin for injection in normal saline following buffering with sodium acetate and acid adjustment with HCl at pH values of 5, 5. 5, and 6. To confirm that the assay was stability-indicating, ampicillin trihydrate reference standard (1 mg/mL) was exposed to alkali, acid, and oxidative stress conditions and analyzed by HPLC for the presence of degradation products. Analysis was performed on a reverse-phase (C- 18) column with a mobile phase consisting of water, acetonitrile, 1 M <b>monobasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate, and 1 N acetic acid (909 : 80 : 10 : 1). Other HPLC parameters were: flow rate 1 mL/min; detection wavelength 254 nm; injection volume 20 µL; column temperature 30 ˚C. The method was evaluated for linearity, precision, and accuracy. The chemical stability of ampicillin for injection (18 mg/mL) in normal saline and sodium acetate (pH adjusted at values of 5, 5. 5, and 6) was assessed at baseline (t= 0), 7, 11, 17, 31, and 44 hours and compared to a control solution (no pH adjustment). Measurements at each time interval were performed in triplicate. Main Results: Ampicillin trihydrate reference standard (1 mg/mL) was adequately separated from degradation products following exposure to alkali, acid, and oxidative stress conditions. After 16 hours, a precipitate was observed in the solution at pH 6, and therefore stability is not reported.

Nodulation of subterranean clover (Trifolium, subterraneum L.) {{by two of}} the serogroups, 6 and 36, was influenced by the application of CaC 0 ₃ to the soil. The studies described in this thesis showed that liming the soil with either CaC 0 ₃, Ca(OH) ₂, MgO, or K₂C 0 ₃ increased significantly (P = 0. 05) the percentage nodule occupancy by serogroup 36 whereas the percentage nodule occupancy by serogroup 6 was decreased by liming, but only significantly (P = 0. 05) from applications of CaC 0 ₃ or Ca(OH) ₂. Application of KH₂P 0 ₄ (25 mg P kg⁻¹ soil), which did not change soil pH, nor increase P uptake by subclover plants, also increased significantly (P = 0. 05) the percentage nodule occupancy by serogroup 36. Application of KH₂P 0 ₄ in combination with Ca(OH) ₂ produced the same increase in nodule occupancy by serogroup 36 as when the two materials were applied individually. In contrast, although KH₂P 0 ₄ addition had no influence on percentage nodule occupancy by serogroup 6, a combination of Ca(0 H) ₂ and KH₂P 0 ₄ prevented the negative influence of Ca(OH) ₂ when the latter was applied alone. Soil population of serogroup 36 consistently and in the majority of cases, significantly (P= 0. 05) outnumbered serogroup 6 regardless of soil treatment or the outcome of nodulation. Soil chemical and plant analyses provided no evidence that liming was increasing the availability and subsequent uptake of soil P by the subclover plant. Liming did, however, result in significant transformation (30 to 50 mg P kg⁻¹ soil) of inorganic P from the apatite and residual P fractions into a NaOH-extractable organic P fraction.

The analysis was performed on a ODS column by spectrofluorometer detection, operated at excitation of 515 nm and emission of 535 nm. A mixture of phosphate buffer (0. 05 M, pH 6. 8), containing <b>potassium</b> <b>monobasic</b> phosphate and methanol (60 : 40, v/v) at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min, was used as the mobile phase. The retention time of MDA-TBA was 3. 2 min. Our findings showed that the MDA level increased in the opioid and methamphetamine abusers when compared to the control group (P < 0. 05); however, no significant difference was observed between the opioid and methamphetamine groups. A state of oxidative stress during biological processes leads to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, biomolecule dysfunctions, and many other diseases. Since it is impossible to eradicate the drug addiction, we should reduce the side effects of drug abuse, such as oxidative stress, by intake of proper nutrition and antioxidants. </div...|$|R

The current world energy and economic infrastructure is heavily reliant {{on fossil fuels}} such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The limited availability of fossil fuels along with environmental effects and economic uncertainties associated with their use has motivated the need to explore and develop other alternative sources of energy. Lignocellulosic biomass like fossil fuels is carbon-based and {{has the potential to}} partly supplant the energy supplied by fossil fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass is a complex mixture of polymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin along with small concentrations of inorganics and extractives. Recent research has shown that lignocellulosic biomass and biomass model compounds can be processed autothermally by catalytic partial oxidation in millisecond residence times over noble metal catalysts at high temperatures (600 - 1000 °C) to syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) [1 - 3]. The syngas stream can then be upgraded to fuels and chemicals. In Chapter 2, spatially resolved concentration and temperature profiles of methane and dimethyl ether, a model compound for biomass, are compared. Dimethyl ether can be produced renewably through syngas upgrading. Maximum temperature and concentration gradients were found within the oxidation zone. Most of the oxygen (∼ 95 %) was converted within the first 2. 2 mm and syngas formation was observed despite the presence of oxygen. The catalytic partial oxidation process has been demonstrated using compounds which, unlike most biomass sources, contain negligible quantities of inorganics. Some of these inorganics have catalytic properties themselves and some may act as poisons for the Rh-based catalyst. The effects of common biomass-inorganics (silicon, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, sulfur) on rhodium-based catalysts in autothermal reactors have been studied. To understand the effects of biomass inorganics on Rh catalysts, two sets of experiments surveying common inorganics were performed - in the first set, inorganics were directly deposited on the rhodium catalyst and tested using steam methane reforming as a model reaction (Chapter 3); whereas in the second set, inorganics were introduced to a clean catalyst in an ethanol feed to simulate actual inorganic-containing biomass (Chapter 4). In both sets of experiments, performance testing, catalyst characterization and regeneration were carried out to probe the mechanism of inorganic interaction with the rhodium-based catalyst. Large decreases in reforming activity were observed on phosphorus- and sulfur-doped catalysts. Deactivation due to calcium and magnesium was primarily due to blocking of active sites. Potassium and silicon were volatile at the high temperatures within the reactor. Potassium introduced alkaline chemistry promoting acetaldehyde formation from ethanol while phosphorus introduced acid chemistry promoting formation of ethylene from ethanol. The effects of potassium and phosphorus on catalytic partial oxidation of methane and ethanol at different concentrations and temperatures have been studied in Chapter 5. The synergistic effects of potassium and phosphorus were studied by distributing the inorganics together on the catalyst as <b>monobasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate. The effects of both potassium and phosphorus were observed in the catalytic partial oxidation of methane on a potassium phosphate-doped catalyst at low temperatures. At high temperatures, only effects due to phosphorus were observed because of potassium volatilization. The results show that biomass-sources containing low concentrations of inorganics can be processed autothermally to a high selectivity syngas stream. The distribution and interactions of the inorganics within the catalyst can be used to design better pretreatment, processing, and regeneration strategies to minimize catalyst deactivation during biomass processing. Alcohols represent an important intermediate in different biomass upgrading routes. Chapter 6 discusses the behavior of butanol isomers, 1 -butanol, isobutanol, 2 -butanol, and tert-butanol over four different catalysts; Rh, Pt, RhCe, and PtCe at different fuel to oxygen (C/O) ratios. At low C/O ratios, equilibrium species such as CO, CO 2, H 2 and H 2 O were obtained while non-equilibrium species such as carbonyls and olefins were dominant at high C/O ratios. Low reforming activity was observed on Pt and PtCe catalysts. All isomers decompose primarily by dehydrogenation through a carbonyl intermediate except tert-butanol which decomposes by dehydration to isobutene; however, the reactivity of tert-butanol was unaffected. In Chapter 7, isobutanol autothermal reforming is integrated with a water gas shift stage downstream to produce hydrogen containing low concentrations of carbon monoxide for portable fuel cell applications. A RhCe-based catalyst was selected to carry out autothermal reforming of isobutanol while a PtCe catalyst was selected for the water gas shift stage. This staged reactor produced high yields of hydrogen (> 120 % selectivity) containing low concentrations of CO (< 2 mol %) in less than 100 ms making the effluent ideal for portable high temperature PEM fuel cell applications. The water gas shift stage also reduced the concentration of non-equilibrium products formed in the autothermal reforming stage by over 50 %. Thermodynamic analysis of the system showed that staged autothermal reforming of isobutanol integrated with a fuel cell can potentially lead to 2. 5 times more efficient energy usage when compared to burning isobutanol in a conventional combustion engine. The results in this thesis give an insight into the mechanisms and processing challenges involved in converting renewable feedstocks to syngas by catalytic partial oxidation. Further experiments based on the conclusions of this thesis are discussed in Chapter 8. Spatial profile experiments to determine roles of mass transfer, steam reforming, and dry reforming during catalytic partial oxidation of oxygenates are proposed. Spatial profile studies for catalytic partial oxidation over inorganic-doped catalysts and feed are proposed to determine their concentrations and nature on the catalyst surface during reactor operation...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} work {{was conducted in}} two phases. The research work in first phase {{was carried out in}} Drug Delivery Research Laboratories of Faculty of Pharmacy, Gomal University D. I. Khan Pakistan and the second phase was carried out in the Laboratories of Centre of Pharmaceutical Engineering Science, School of Life Sciences, University of Bradford UK. The objective of the research work in first phase was to develop controlled release matrix tablets of analgesic drugs like Nimesulide and Tramadol HCl. Cellulose acetate ether derivatives were used as rate controlling agents and their effect on the drug release kinetics and mechanism was evaluated in comparison to various polymers. In this connection first preformulation studies were carried out for identification and solubility of the selected drugs and determination of any incompatibility between drugs and polymers. FTIR and DSC studies proved that there was no incompatibility between the drugs and polymer. A set of formulations were developed using EthocelÂ® polymer of various grades [EthocelÂ® Standard 7 Premium (P), Standard 7 Fine Particle (FP) Premium, Standard 10 P, Standard 10 FP Premium, Standard 100 P and Standard 100 FP Premium], Carbopols [Cabopol 974 P and 934 P] and Eudragit [Eudragit RS- 100] in various drug to polymer ratios. Some formulations of the drugs were prepared by partial replacement of the filler (lactose) with co. excipients like CMC, Starch and HPMC KM- 100 to evaluate the effect of these co. excipients on the release of drugs from the matrix tablets. The micromeritic studies of the pure drugs and physical mixtures of the formulations were carried out following official procedures which suggested that pure drugs had a poor flow properties but when different ingredients of formulations were mixed together (physical mixtures), the flow properties were enhanced which was considered to be important in tablet preparation. Matrix tablets were prepared from all formulations by following direct compression method for Nimesulide tablets and dry granulation method for Tramadol HCl. Physicochemical characterization of prepared matrix tablets was carried out by performing hardness, weight variation, dimensional, friability and content uniformity tests according to the established procedures. All these physical and quality control parameters were well within the acceptable ranges. Matrix tablets that were prepared with the fine particle (FP) premium grades of EthocelÂ® were harder and thinner as compared to those with conventional granular grades. The matrix tablets were then evaluated for in vitro drug release by performing in vitro dissolution tests. Dissolution tests were performed by USP method I (rotating basket method) using <b>Monobasic</b> <b>potassium</b> phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) as dissolution medium. Tablets that contain EthocelÂ® 7 FP premium grades extended the release of the drug more efficiently than other grades of EthocelÂ® polymer. Viscosity grades, particle size and drug to polymer ratio were the main factors that affect the drug release rates and kinetics from matrix tablets of EthocelÂ® polymers. Carbopol 974 P and 934 P both proved to be effective in controlling the release of Nimesulide upto 24 hours depending upon the quantity of polymer used, however in case of the water soluble drug (Tramadol HCl), these two polymers fails to extend the release upto 24 hours. An extended release of drugs was demonstrated from matrices prepared with Eudragit RS 100. Co. excipients like starch, CMC and HPMC enhanced the release of the selected drugs from matrix tablets and the all of the drug was released in just 3 - 5 hours from these matrix tablets. Different Kinetic models were applied on the release data of the matrix tablets. Coefficient of determination (R 2) values in the kinetic models showed a linear relation with drug release from matrix tablets containing EthocelÂ® and Carbopols without co. excipients. The diffusional exponent (n) in the Korsmeyer Peppas Kinetics showed that the release from matrix tablets without co. excipients followed anomalous non fickain release mechanism. The dissolution profiles of matrix tablets and conventional immediate release formulations were compared by determination of similarity factor (f 1) and difference factor (f 2). The results of in vitro dissolution studies and data from the kinetic models concluded in selection of an optimised test formulation for both the drugs. Nimesulide matrix tablets that contain EthocelÂ® 7 FP premium in drug to polymer ratio of 10 : 2 and in case of Tramadol HCl matrix tablets of EthocelÂ® 7 FP premium in a drug to polymer ratio of 10 : 4 were considered as the optimised test formulation for both of the drugs. A batch of each optimised test formulations was prepared with wet granulation method to determine the effect of method of preparation of matrix tablets. In case of matrix tablets of Nimesulide, Wet granulation method proved to be more effective in retarding the release rate of drug when compared with the direct compression method but while considering the release of Tramadol HCl matrix tablets, {{there was no significant difference}} in the release of drug from matrix tablets prepared by dry granulation or wet granulation. The optimised test tablets were evaluated for stability testing in short term accelerated conditions. Both the optimised formulations demonstrated good stability in accelerated conditions of temperature and humidity. Microcapsules of both the selected drugs were developed using EthocelÂ® 7 FP as carrier in different drug to polymer ratios, with the objective of explaining the effect of change in dosage form on the release of the drugs. All batches of microcapsules demonstrated good physicochemical characteristics. The release of the drugs from microcapsules was on the basis of non fickian anomalous mechanism and was affected by quantity of the polymer. In vivo studies were carried out on the optimised test formulations by comparing the effect of the optimised test formulation and conventional IR formulations on the in vivo absorption and pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs in animals (rabbits). In vivo pharmacokinetic parameters of test formulations showed more extended release rates as compared to reference IR formulations of Nimesulide and Tramadol HCl. Moreover, the test formulations showed good linear relationship between In vitro drug release and In vivo drug absorption, and prolonged MRT 0 -t and t 1 / 2 values as compared to reference formulations. In second phase, solid dispersions of a water insoluble model drug (Ibuprofen) and a carrier polymer hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMC-AS) was prepared using spray drying technique in order to enhance the solubility and ultimately the bioavailability of the drug. In this connection different batches of Ibuprofen solid dispersions were prepared by following a 32 factorial design of experiments. Effects of variables like drug to polymer ratio and inlet temperature on the percent yield and in vitro dissolution profile was studied. The physicochemical characterisation of the batches was carried out using SEM, TGA, DSC, PXRD, FTIR and RAMAN spectroscopic analysis. The results of the characterization analysis, in vitro dissolution studies and statistical application of ANOVA and response surface methodology concluded that drug to polymer ratio was the main factor responsible for the increased solubility of the model drug (Ibuprofen) ...|$|R
