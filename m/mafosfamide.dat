Colony formation by CML cells was inhibited more efficiently than by NBMC. After the incubation with 50 micrograms/ml or 100 micrograms/ml of <b>mafosfamide,</b> the growth of leukemic CFU-GM was totally abrogated in 2 / 11 or 9 / 11 cases of CML-BC and in 1 / 7 or 6 / 7 cases of CML-CP, respectively. At the same time the CFU-GM arising from normal BMC were not inhibited totally with 50 or 100 micrograms/ml of the drug in any of five experiments. CML cells were still unable to form secondary colonies, while normal BMC were capable of regrowth. The CD 34 + cells isolated form CML-BC and CML-CP patients were also more susceptible to <b>mafosfamide</b> cytotoxicity in comparison to CD 34 + cells derived from NBMC. To confirm the possibility of purging, CML-BC cells were mixed with NBMC (1 : 1) and incubated with <b>mafosfamide.</b> Finally, the growing colonies were examined for the presence of bcr/abl hybrid gene by reverse transcriptase-Taq polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and specific hybridization. The bcr/abl gene was not detected in the colonies growing after 100 micrograms/ml, and the signal was diminished after incubation with 50 micrograms/ml of <b>mafosfamide,</b> as compared to control.

40|$|Regulatory T cells (Treg) play {{a pivotal}} role in the immune system since they inhibit the T cell response. It is well known that {{cyclophosphamide}} applied at low dose is able to stimulate the immune response while high dose cyclophosphamide exerts inhibitory activity. Data obtained in mice indicate that cyclophosphamide provokes a {{reduction in the number of}} Treg and impairs their suppressive activity, resulting in immune stimulation. Here, we addressed the question of the sensitivity of human Treg to cyclophosphamide, comparing Treg with cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and T helper cells (Th). We show that Treg are more sensitive than CTL and Th to <b>mafosfamide,</b> which is an active derivative of cyclophosphamide, which does not need metabolic activation. The high sensitivity of Treg was due to the induction of apoptosis. Treg compared to CTL and Th were not more sensitive to the alkylating drugs temozolomide and nimustine and also not to mitomycin C, indicating a specific Treg response to <b>mafosfamide.</b> The high sensitivity of Treg to <b>mafosfamide</b> resulted not only in enhanced cell death, but also in impaired Treg function as demonstrated by a decline in the suppressor activity of Treg in a co-culture model with Th and Helios positive Treg. Treatment of Treg with <b>mafosfamide</b> gave rise to a high level of DNA crosslinks, which were not repaired to the same extent as observed in Th and CTL. Also, Treg showed a low level of cH 2 AX foci up to 6 h and a high level 24 h after treatment, indicating alterations in the DNA damage response. Overall, this is the first demonstration that human Treg are, in comparison with Th and CTL, hypersensitive to cyclophosphamide, which is presumably due to a DN...|$|E

Cyclophosphamide derivatives such as <b>mafosfamide</b> and 4 -hydroperoxycyclophosphamide are used at high doses for purging of Philadelphia leukemic cells from marrows but such treatment {{can be associated with}} delayed engraftment and prolonged cytopenias. To develop a more effective procedure that might optimize the killing of leukemia cells and the sparing of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, a 1 : 1 mixture of Philadelphia leukemic cells and normal bone marrow cells was exposed to a combination of a low dose of <b>mafosfamide</b> and bcr-abl antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and assayed for growth ability in clonogenic assays and in immunodeficient mice.

However, several intrinsic limitations have been uncounted during the clinical use of these oxazaphosphorines, including substantial pharmacokinetic variability, resistance and severe host toxicity. To circumvent these problems, new oxazaphosphorines derivatives have been designed and evaluated with an attempt to improve the selectivity and response with reduced host toxicity. These include <b>mafosfamide</b> (NSC 345842), glufosfamide (D 19575, β-Dglucosylisophosphoramide mustard), S-(-) -bromofosfamide (CBM- 11), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine) and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). <b>Mafosfamide</b> is an oxazaphosphorine analog that is a chemically stable 4 -thioethane sulfonic acid salt of 4 -hydroxy-CPA.

40|$|Aldehyde {{dehydrogenase}} 3 A 1 (ALDH 3 A 1) {{plays an}} important role in many cellular oxidative processes, including cancer chemoresistance, by metabolizing activated forms of oxazaphosphorine drugs such as cyclophosphamide (CP) and its analogues, such as <b>mafosfamide</b> (MF), ifosfamide (IFM), and 4 -hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4 -HPCP). Compounds that can selectively target ALDH 3 A 1 could permit delineation of its roles in these processes and could restore chemosensitivity in cancer cells that express this isoenzyme. Here we report the detailed kinetic and structural characterization of an ALDH 3 A 1 -selective inhibitor, CB 29, previously identified in a high-throughput screen. Kinetic and crystallographic studies demonstrate that CB 29 binds within the aldehyde substrate-binding site of ALDH 3 A 1. Cellular proliferation of ALDH 3 A 1 -expressing lung adenocarcinoma (A 549) and glioblastoma (SF 767) cell lines, as well as ALDH 3 A 1 non-expressing lung fibroblast (CCD- 13 Lu) cells, is unaffected by treatment with CB 29 and its analogues alone. However, sensitivity toward the anti-proliferative effects of <b>mafosfamide</b> is enhanced by treatment with CB 29 and its analogue in the tumor cells. In contrast, the sensitivity of CCD- 13 Lu cells toward <b>mafosfamide</b> was unaffected by the addition of these same compounds. CB 29 is chemically distinct from the previously reported small-molecule inhibitors of ALDH isoenzymes and does not inhibit ALDH 1 A 1, ALDH 1 A 2, ALDH 1 A 3, ALDH 1 B 1, or ALDH 2 isoenzymes at concentrations up to 250 μM. Thus, CB 29 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of ALDH 3 A 1, which might be useful as a chemical tool to delineate the role of ALDH 3 A 1 in numerous metabolic pathways, including sensitizing ALDH 3 A 1 -positive cancer cells to oxazaphosphorines...|$|E
40|$|We {{have already}} shown that IL- 10 plays an {{important}} role in immunosuppression and metastatic dissemination in the rat B-cell lymphoma L-TACB model. It was suggested that the up-regulation of IL- 10 production and IL- 10 receptor (IL- 10 R) expression would be part of the transition from primary tumor to metastatic phenotype and that IL- 10, besides its immunosuppressive activity, may act as a growth factor for metastatic L-TACB cells. The treatment of L-TACB-bearing rats with a single low-dose cyclophosphamide decreased IL- 10 production, reverted immunosuppression and induced the immunologic rejection of tumor metastasis without any effect on primary tumor growth. Our current aim was to investigate the effects of cyclophosphamide on the expression of IL- 10 and IL- 10 R on primary and metastatic L-TACB cells. Considering that cyclophosphamide is a prodrug, we used <b>mafosfamide,</b> a compound that yields in vitro the same active metabolites as cyclophosphamide does in vivo. <b>Mafosfamide</b> induced down-regulation of IL- 10 production and IL- 10 R expression on metastatic cells and, concomitantly, inhibited metastatic cell proliferation.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Philadelphia {{cells are}} human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells that contain the BCR/ABL {{oncogene}} (a fusion of the BCR and ABL genes). Selective eradication of these cells in vitro {{can be achieved}} by combined treatment with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides ([S]ODNs) specifically targeted to this oncogene (bcr/abl [S]ODNs) and a suboptimal (for use as a single agent) dose of <b>mafosfamide</b> (the in vitro active form of cyclophosphamide). PURPOSE:We evaluated the ability of bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs, alone or subsequent to treatment with a single injection of cyclophosphamide, to suppress the leukemic process induced in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by Philadelphia cells (i. e., primary CML-blast crisis [CML-BC] cells). In addition, we studied potential mechanisms that might explain the efficacy of the bcr/abl antisense [S]ODN-mafosfamide combination against Philadelphia cells in vitro. METHODS:The effects of treating leukemic mice with cyclophosphamide (25 mg/kg body weight; 25 % of the dose required to eradicate evidence of leukemia in SCID mice) and/or bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs were assessed by analysis of survival, by examination of bone marrow for the presence of leukemia cells (using a colony formation assay or using coupled reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction to screen for bcr/abl messenger RNA), and by examination of a variety of tissues for the presence of infiltrating leukemia cells. The induction of apoptosis (a cell death program) in vitro in primary CML-BC cells following treatment with bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs plus or minus prior treatment with <b>mafosfamide</b> was monitored by use of a commercial assay. Relative cellular uptake of [S]ODNs by CML-BC cells treated in vitro with or without prior treatment with <b>mafosfamide</b> was determined by use of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (for fluorescent [S]ODNs) or by use of blotting techniques that employed radioactively labeled probes (for extracted, unlabeled [S]ODNs). Levels of specific proteins in treated and untreated cells were determined by use of western blotting methods. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS:The disease process in leukemic mice was retarded substantially by combination treatment with cyclophosphamide and specific bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs (P <. 001, relative to treatment with specific antisense [S]ODNs alone, cyclophosphamide alone, or cyclophosphamide plus nonspecific [i. e., control] antisense [S]ODNs); 50 % of the mice treated with cyclophosphamide and specific antisense [S]ODNs appeared to be cured of leukemia. The combination treatment was associated with increased induction of apoptosis. In addition, cellular uptake of bcr/abl antisense [S]ODNs appeared to be increased twofold to sixfold by prior treatment with <b>mafosfamide.</b> This increased uptake of [S]ODNs was associated with enhanced suppression of p 210 bcr/abl protein levels. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:Combination therapy with antisense [S]ODNs targeted to specific oncogenes and less toxic doses of anticancer drugs may represent a rational strategy to purpose for the treatment of human leukemias...|$|E

The prognosis of patients with clinically detectable metastases at diagnosis, not responding to therapy or with disease relapse, is still very poor. Among new therapeutic approaches, bisphosphonates represent promising adjuvant molecules to chemotherapy to limit the osteolytic component of bone tumors and to protect from bone metastases. The combined effects of zoledronic acid and <b>mafosfamide</b> were investigated on cell proliferation, viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution of human ES cell lines differing in their p 53 and p 16 /ink 4 status. ES models were developed to reproduce both soft tissue and intraosseous tumor development.

ES cell lines showed different sensitivities to zoledronic acid and <b>mafosfamide</b> at the cell proliferation level, with no correlation with their molecular status. Both drugs induced cell cycle arrest, but in the S or G 2 M phase, respectively. In vivo, zoledronic acid had no effect on soft tissue tumor progression, although it dramatically inhibited ES development in bone. When combined with ifosfamide, zoledronic acid exerted synergistic effects in the soft tissue model: Its combination with one cycle of ifosfamide resulted in an inhibitory effect similar to three cycles of ifosfamide alone.

To investigate mechanisms of drug resistance we performed a systematic genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of a <b>mafosfamide</b> sensitive and resistant murine lymphoma cell line, along with a series of resistant lines derived by drug dose escalation. Our data suggest that acquired resistance could not be explained by genetic alterations. By integrating our transcriptional profiles with transcription factor binding data we hypothesize that the resistance was associated with changes in the activity of the polycomb repressive complex (Prc 2) as well as the transcription factor E 2 a. We verified that the resistant cells had distinct H 3 K 27 me 3 and DNA methylation profiles, compared to the parental lines, and differentially expressed genes were enriched for targets of E 2 a. In addition, the resistant lines appear to de-differentiate to a less mature state along the B cell maturation axis.

The median age of patients was 30 years (range, 1 to 65). The median interval between achieving CR and autografting was 5 months (range, 1 to 23). Of the 263 patients, 131 patients received cytoreductive regimens that included total body irradiation (TBI); the remainder received various combinations of cytotoxic drugs. Sixtynine patients received autologous marrow purged in vitro with <b>mafosfamide,</b> and 194 received unpurged marrow. The median follow-up was 28 months (range, 12 to 97). For patients with standard risk AML in CR 1 autografted after TBI (n = 107), the leukemia-free survival (LFS) was higher. and the probability of relapse was lower in recipients of purged than of unpurged marrow (63 % versus 34 %, P =. 05 and 23 % versus 55 %. relative risk 0. 34, P =. 005. respectively). The superior results of purging were most obvious in patients autografted within 6 months of achieving CR (probability of relapse, 20 % versus 61 %, P =. 01).

Here, we report detailed kinetics and structural characterization of a highly selective submicromolar inhibitor of ALDH 3 A 1, 1 -[(4 -fluorophenyl) sulfonyl]- 2 -methyl- 1 H-benzimidazole (CB 7, IC 50 of 0. 2 μM). CB 7 does not inhibit ALDH 1 A 1, ALDH 1 A 2, ALDH 1 A 3, ALDH 1 B 1, or ALDH 2 activity. Structural, kinetics, and mutagenesis studies show that CB 7 binds to the aldehyde binding pocket of ALDH 3 A 1. ALDH 3 A 1 -expressing lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma cell lines are sensitized toward <b>mafosfamide</b> (MF) treatment in the presence analogues of CB 7, whereas primary lung fibroblasts lacking ALDH 3 A 1 expression, are not...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A common {{sequence}} polymorphism at codon 72 of the p 53 gene encoding either arginine or proline was recently {{shown to be}} functionally relevant for apoptosis induction in vitro. In B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), p 53 gene mutations occur in a subset of patients and are associated with impaired survival and drug resistance. Here, we address the functional relevance of the codon 72 single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism for cell death sensitivity following exposure to clinically employed cytotoxic drugs and γ-irradiation. Methods 138 B-CLL samples were analysed by SSCP-PCR and sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 72 of the p 53 gene. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay (DiSC-assay) was performed with 7 drugs (chlorambucil, <b>mafosfamide,</b> fludarabine phosphate, methylprednisolone, doxorubicin, vincristine) or γ-irradiation. Results Of the 138 B-CLL samples, 9 samples were homozygous for proline (Pro/Pro), 78 samples homozygous for arginine (Arg/Arg), and 49 samples heterozygous (Arg/Pro). No differences were found for patient survival and cell death triggered by 7 cytotoxic drugs or γ-irradiation. Conclusion These data indicate that polymorphic variants of p 53 codon 72 are not clinically relevant for apoptosis induction or patient survival in B-CLL. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aerobic glycolysis, a {{metabolic}} {{characteristic of}} malignant cells, can be exploited {{to increase the}} concentration of lactic acid selectively in tumor tissues in vivo by systemic administration of glucose (E. Jähde and M. F. Rajewsky, Cancer Res., 42 : 1505 - 1512, 1982). To investigate whether a more acidic microenvironment can enhance the effectiveness of cytocidal drugs, we have analyzed the colony-forming capacity of M 1 R rat mammary carcinoma cells exposed to bis-chloroethylating agents in culture {{as a function of}} extracellular pH (pHe). At pHe 6. 2 the cytotoxicity of 4 -hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, as measured by inhibition of colony formation, was potentiated by a factor of &# 8764; 200 as compared to pHe 7. 4. Similar results were obtained with <b>mafosfamide,</b> nitrogen mustard, nornitrogen mustard, melphalan, and chlorambucil; not, however, with ifosfamide. As indicated by experiments using the ionophor nigericin for rapid equilibration of pHe and intracellular pH (pHi; measured with pH-sensitive microelectrodes), modulation of drug action by varying pHe primarily resulted from the concomitant decrease in pHi. The acidic microenvironment enhanced cytotoxicity most effectively during the phase of cellular drug uptake and monofunctional alkylation of DNA. DNA cross-link formation appeared to be less affected by pH, and lowering of pHe during the phase of cross-link removal was only marginally effective...|$|E
40|$|Radio- and {{chemotherapy}} {{for the treatment}} of malignancies are often associated with significant toxicity. One approach to reduce the toxicity is the concomitant treatment with chemoprotective agents. This article reviews two sulfhydryl compounds, namely the agent WR- 2721 (amifostine), a compound recently registered for use in human in many countries, and the natural occurring compound glutathione (GSH). GSH is not registered as a chemoprotective agent. WR- 2721 is an aminothiol prodrug and has to be converted to the active compound WR- 1065 by membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase. WR- 1065 and GSH both act as naturally occurring thiols. No protective effect on the tumour has been found when these compounds are administered intravenously. There is even in vitro evidence for an increased anti-tumour effect with <b>mafosfamide</b> after pretreatment with WR- 2721, and in vivo after treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Randomized clinical studies have shown that WR- 2721 and GSH decrease cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and that WR- 2721 reduces radiation radiotherapy-induced toxicity. Side-effects associated with WR- 2721 are nausea, vomiting and hypotension, GSH has no side-effects. An exact role of WR- 2721 and GSH as chemoprotectors is not yet completely clear. Future studies should examine the protective effect of these drugs on mucositis, cardiac toxicity, neuro- and ototoxicity, the development of secondary neoplasms and their effect on quality of life...|$|E
40|$|In vitro drug {{sensitivity}} of leukaemic cells might {{be influenced by}} the contamination of such a sample with non-malignant cells and the sample source. To study this, {{sensitivity of}} normal peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes to a number of cytostatic drugs was assessed with the MTT assay. We compared this sensitivity with the drug sensitivity of leukaemic cells of 38 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We also studied a possible differential sensitivity of leukaemic cells from bone marrow (BM) and PB. The following drugs were used: Prednisolone, dexamethasone, 6 -mercaptopurine, 6 -thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, vindesine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, <b>mafosfamide</b> (Maf), 4 -hydroperoxy-ifosfamide, teniposide, mitoxantrone, L-asparaginase, methotrexate and mustine. Normal PB lymphocytes were significantly more resistant to all drugs tested, except to Maf. Leukaemic BM and PB cells from 38 patients (unpaired samples) showed no significant differences in sensitivity to any of the drugs. Moreover, in 11 of 12 children with acute leukaemia of whom we investigated simultaneously obtained BM and PB (paired samples), their leukaemic BM and PB cells showed comparable drug sensitivity profiles. In one patient the BM cells were more sensitive to most drugs than those from the PB, but the actual differences in sensitivity were small. We conclude that the contamination of a leukaemic sample with normal PB lymphocytes will influence the results of the MTT assay. The source of the leukaemic sample, BM or PB, does not significantly influence the assay results...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the anti-tumor {{response}} to cyclophosphamide (CTX) in DBA/ 2 mice transplanted s. c. with 4 tumors exhibiting different responses to IL- 2 : ESb lymphoma and Friend leukemia cells (non-responsive or poorly responsive, respectively), pII-R-Eb and Eb lymphoma cells (both highly responsive to IL- 2). CTX injections on days 7, 14 and 21 resulted in a significant anti-tumor response in mice transplanted s. c. with Friend leukemia cells or ESb cells, whereas no anti-tumor effect was observed in mice injected with Eb or pII-R-Eb cells. All 4 tumor cell lines were equally sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of <b>mafosfamide,</b> an in vitro active analogue of CTX. To define the host mechanisms responsible {{for the lack of}} an anti-tumor effect of CTX in mice transplanted with IL- 2 -responsive tumors, we studied several aspects of the spontaneous or IL- 2 -induced anti-tumor response in mice transplanted with pII-R-Eb cells. Injection of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to IFN-gamma completely abolished the anti-tumor effects of IL- 2. Using a Winn assay, clear-cut anti-tumor activity was found in spleen cells from mice transplanted with the IL- 2 -responsive tumors. This activity was abolished by CTX, which also abrogated the anti-tumor response to IL- 2 in mice injected with pll-R-Eb cells. Our results indicate an inverse correlation between sensitivity to IL- 2 and response to CTX and emphasize the importance of initial host-tumor interaction in determining the type of response to IL- 2 or CTX.

40|$|Purpose: Despite {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the disease remains incurable with standard therapies and relapse is inevitable. A growing body of evidence indicates that alterations in the adhesion properties of neoplastic cells play a pivotal role in the development and progression of CLL. Experimental Design: The expression of 71 cell surface molecules was examined on CLL peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over 3 weeks in culture. The most highly upregulated marker, CD 62 L, was examined further for expression on CD 5 +/CD 19 + CLL cells in vitro and in lymph node and bone marrow biopsies. The prosurvival role of CD 62 L was examined using a functional blocking antibody and therapeutic potential evaluated by comparison with current chemotherapy agents. Results: Blocking CD 62 L resulted in apoptosis of CLL cells but not PBMCs from healthy donors suggesting a novel role for CD 62 L in CLL cell survival. The beneficial effect of coculturing CLL cells with bone marrow stromal cells or endothelial cells does not protect CLL cells from anti-CD 62 L-related toxicity. Moreover, combining fludarabine or <b>mafosfamide</b> with the anti-CD 62 L in vitro produced an additive effect both with and without stromal cells. Conclusion: This is the first reported data showing that blocking the activation and homing marker, CD 62 L, regulates CLL cell survival in vitro. These data also suggest that therapeutic antibodies against CD 62 L may provide additional clinical benefit to patients with CLL receiving current standard chemotherapy protocols. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Although {{cellular}} {{drug resistance}} {{is considered to}} be an important cause of the poor prognosis of children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the knowledge of drug resistance in these patients is very limited. Different aspects of drug resistance were studied in 17 children with relapsed ALL. The in vitro sensitivity profile was determined using the MTT assay. Cells from relapsed children were significantly more resistant to 6 -thioguanine, prednisolone, cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin (DNR), mustine-HCl and <b>mafosfamide</b> but not to L-asparaginase and vincristine (VCR) than cells from 41 children with ALL at initial diagnosis. Some relapsed patients showed a general drug resistance while others were resistant to only 1 - 3 drugs. The relevance of the multidrug resistance (MDR) model was analysed: In all DNR- and VCR resistant cases a co-resistance to drugs not involved in the MDR model was found. P-glycoprotein was not detected in any of 28 untreated and 14 relapsed samples tested. VCR- and DNR accumulation in the most resistant cells were not lower than in sensitive cells. Resistance modifiers did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of VCR and DNR. We conclude that resistance to anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids in childhood relapsed ALL is not due to P-glycoprotein mediated MDR. Different types of drug resistance varying from a resistance to only one drug to a general chemoresistance, can be detected in children with relapsed ALL. VCR and L-asparaginase seemed to be only infrequently involved in drug resistance. Knowledge of drug resistance might lead to more effective and less toxic therapies for children with relapsed ALL...|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{specimens}} from 15 medulloblastoma {{patients were}} used to establish early passage cultures. In vitro sensitivity to a battery of cytotoxic agents, including some in current medulloblastoma treatment protocols, was measured. Drug sensitivity was assessed at clinically relevant drug concentrations using the 3 H-thymidine uptake method. Tumours were predicted to be sensitive if greater than 37 % were killed by exposure to drugs at clinically achievable levels. A poor response to vincristine (Vcr), cis-platin (CDDP), hydroxyurea (HU) or diaziquone (AZQ) (no responders), and cytosine arabinoside (AraC) (1 / 12), was seen. Nine of ten tumours tested were sensitive to <b>mafosfamide</b> (Mfs); seven out of 12 were sensitive to carmustine (BCNU), 12 of 13 to teniposide (VM- 26) and seven of 13 to etoposide (VP 16 - 213). VM- 26 {{was the best of}} the agents tested with most tumours responding to very low concentrations of drug, suggesting that the role of epipodophyllotoxins in treatment of brain tumours be further investigated. Despite the marked sensitivity of the medulloblastomas to the epipodophyllotoxins, three early passage cultures were much more resistant to these drugs than the average for the group. The basis of this resistance was investigated. Deficient cellular uptake of drug was excluded as a cause of resistance. One resistant early passage culture displayed low cellular activity of topoisomerase II and decreased levels of drug induced enzyme-DNA strand break activity. This was not the case for the other resistant early passage cultures: the basis of resistance in these cells {{does not appear to be}} due to any previously reported mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) remains incurable; therefore searching for new therapeutic strategies in this disease is necessary. An important mechanism of tumor development is neoangiogenesis. A potent antiangiogenic factor, bevacizumab (Avastin, AVA), has been poorly explored in CLL so far. In {{the current study}} we assessed cytotoxic activity of AVA alone or in combinations with drugs routinely used in this disease. Matherials and Methods: Cells isolated from 60 CLL patients were treated with AVA alone or in combination with anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), rituximab (RIT), anti-CD 52 MoAb, alemtuzumab (ALT), 2 -CdA (2 -chlorodeoxyadenosine), FA (fludarabine), MAF (<b>mafosfamide)</b> or RAPA (rapamycin). Cytotoxicity was assessed by propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was evaluated using annexin-V and TUNEL assays. Additionally, a drop of mitochondrial potential (DYm) as well as expression of apoptosis-regulating proteins Bax, Bak, Bid, Bad, Bcl- 2, Mcl- 2, XIAP, FLIP, Akt and Bcl- 2 -A 1 were determined by flow cytometry. Results: At the dose of 40 μg/ml, after 48 hours of incubation, AVA induced significant cytotoxicity against CLL cells. The drug triggered apoptosis, with activation of caspase- 3 and - 9, but not caspase- 8, along with a drop of DYm. Incubation with AVA induced significant overexpression of proapoptotic Bak and Bad as well as downregulation of antiapoptotic Mcl- 2 and Akt proteins. Combination of AVA with RIT, ALT or RAPA significantly increased cytotoxicity {{when compared with the}} effects of single drugs. Discussion: In conclusion, this is the first report showing proapoptotic activity of AVA against CLL cells. Combination of AVA with RIT, ALT or RAPA may be a promising therapeutic strategy, which requires confirmation in further studies...|$|E
40|$|Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) /stress-activated protein kinases is {{an early}} {{response}} of cells upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents. JNK-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun is currently understood to stimulate the transactivating potency of AP- 1 (e. g., c-Jun/c-Fos; c-Jun/ATF- 2), thereby increasing the expression of AP- 1 target genes. Here we show that stimulation of JNK 1 activity is not a general early response of cells exposed to genotoxic agents. Treatment of NIH 3 T 3 cells with UV light (UV-C) {{as well as with}} methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) caused activation of JNK 1 and an increase in c-Jun protein and AP- 1 binding activity, whereas antineoplastic drugs such as <b>mafosfamide,</b> mitomycin C, N-hydroxyethyl-N-chloroethylnitrosourea, and treosulfan did not elicit this response. The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase inhibitor wortmannin specifically blocked the UV-stimulated activation of JNK 1 but did not affect UV-driven activation of extracellular regulated kinase 2 (ERK 2). To investigate the significance of JNK 1 for transactivation of c-jun, we analyzed the effect of UV irradiation on c-jun expression under conditions of wortmannin-mediated inhibition of UV-induced stimulation of JNK 1. Neither the UV-induced increase in c-jun mRNA, c-Jun protein, and AP- 1 binding nor the activation of the collagenase and c-jun promoters was affected by wortmannin. In contrast, the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor PD 98056, which blocked ERK 2 but not JNK 1 activation by UV irradiation, impaired UV-driven c-Jun protein induction and AP- 1 binding. Based on the data, we suggest that JNK 1 stimulation is not essential for transactivation of c-jun after UV exposure, whereas activation of ERK 2 is required for UV-induced signaling leading to elevated c-jun expression...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) is a heterogenous disease with an imbalance between apoptosis and cell proliferation. Therefore, {{the main goal}} in CLL therapy is to induce apoptosis and effectively support this process in transformed B lymphocytes. In the current study, we have compared differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles of nuclei isolated from CLL cells and normal mononuclear cells exposed to cladribine or fludarabine combined with <b>mafosfamide</b> (CM; FM), and additionally to CM combined with monoclonal antibody—rituximab (RCM) for 48 h, {{as well as in}} culture medium only (controls). Under current study, the mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMCs) of healthy individuals have been included. The obtained results have shown the presence of thermal transition at 95 ± 5 °C in most of nuclear preparations (92. 2 %) isolated from blood of CLL patients. This thermal characteristic parameter was changed after drug exposure, however, to a different extent. These thermal changes were accompanied by the decrease of cell viability, an elevation of apoptosis rate and the changes in expression/proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 —main marker of apoptosis. Importantly, in DSC profiles of nuclear preparations of PBMCs from blood of healthy donors exposed to investigated drug combinations and control CLL cells, the lack of such changes was observed. Our results confirmed that DSC technique complemented with other biological approaches could be helpful in tailoring therapy for CLL patients.
