2500|$|Although it is {{generally}} known as a [...] "sporting" [...] quarry, some anglers release pike they have caught because the flesh is considered bony, especially due to the substantial (epipleural) [...] "Y-bones". The white and mild-tasting flesh of pikes nonetheless has a long and distinguished history in cuisine and is popular fare in Europe. Larger fish are more easily filleted, while smaller ones are often processed as forcemeat to eliminate their many small bones, and then used in preparations such as quenelles and fish <b>mousses.</b> Historical references to cooking pike go {{as far back as}} the Romans. Fishing for pike is said to be very exciting with their aggressive hits and aerial acrobatics. Pike are among the largest North American freshwater game fish.|$|E

2500|$|... 1508 – On August 4, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira and Duarte de Lemos of Portugal, sent {{to analyze}} the trade {{potential}} of Madagascar (looking for both gold and silver), dropped anchor in Ranofotsy bay where they found 2 crew from the ship Santa Maria da Luz, companions of João Gomes de Abreu. They also met the only 2 survivors of a Gujarati shipwreck which had happened 30 years earlier. He proceeded on to a bay he was told was named Touroubaya, named after a captain of another shipwrecked Gujarati ship who'd settled there (Pearson, 2007). Those living there said they were the descendants of shipwrecked sailors. Antonio, another Portuguese <b>mousses</b> and companion of de Gomes de Abreu who was living there, knew Malagasy, so he became the translator for Captain Sequeira when he met with King Andriamony (also named [...] "Diamom" [...] by some), one of the Raondriana in this area.

6000|$|While our {{imported}} wines are, as a whole, so good, we do {{not always}} show the same discrimination in choosing. There is very little good champagne, for instance, drunk in America.

No wine <b>mousses,</b> as the French term it, that has body enough to pass a certain period without fermentation. My friend de V---- is a proprietor of vines at Aï, and he tells me that the English take most of their good wines, which are the [...] "still champagnes," [...] and the Russians and the Americans the poor, or the sparkling. A great deal of the sparkling, however, is consumed in France, the price better suiting French economy. But the wine-growers of Champagne themselves speak of us as consumers of their second-class liquors.|$|E
