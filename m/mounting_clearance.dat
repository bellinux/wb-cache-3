40|$|Abstract. The powder {{particles}} {{using the}} tool grinder {{is composed of}} two types. One is mounted on the rotating shaft of the machine tool. This tool is generally single cutting edge. The installation tool is a bolt shank fixed to the rotary shaft of the positioning groove. When you need to replace the tool mechanical enclosure open, loosen all bolts to remove the tool to replace the new tool. With no cutting edge tools can extend tool life. Reduce the number of replacement tools. The second tool is mounted on the housing of the machine tool. Single cutting edge of the tool <b>mounting</b> <b>clearance</b> is small, difficult to adjust the gap. Multi-blade cutter working gap can be formed when using the wedge mounting the inlet and outlet ports of the difference. Move the material in the resulting gap wedge and promote the formation of shear extrusion processing. Quick change fixed tool so that the tool sharp edge retention, reduce heat generation. Quick tool change involves cooling structure, the tool fixed way, {{the position of the}} discharge port design and rapid tool change...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{simulating}} model of a journal porous metal bearing under elastohydrodynamic conditions and combined (radial, friction and thermal) load distribution and to carry out structural optimization. Design/methodology/approach - The structure analysis is carried out for each kind of load separately and for the combined load distribution of the bearing, where a dynamically loaded porous metal bearing is simulated. This simulating model is developed by finite elements method using the structure analysis module of the CATIA V 5 software. Further, a parameter optimization of a porous metal bearing is presented considering the elastic deformations of the bearing shell. Findings - It is revealed that the bearing, even at points with maximum displacements, could not reach the <b>mounting</b> <b>clearance</b> value during its operational life. Relatively small bearing dimensions produce very high values of eigenfrequency response (over 150 kHz) and common dynamic loads met {{in all sorts of}} sliding bearing are not dangerous for bearing damage compared with static loads. In the stage of structural optimization based on the correlation between stress and geometric bearing parameters like wall thickness and outer diameter, the influence of finite element dimension on calculated results can be also analyzed and a proper choice of the latter is achieved. Research limitations/implications - The present porous bearing optimization model with the aid of CATIA V 5 module for optimum design uses only single objective optimization. For a complete optimum design a multi-objective optimization has to be carried out. Practical implications - The analysis under dynamic load conditions proved that relatively small dimensions of bearing commonly used in micro technique and precision mechanics result in extended safe and reliable operation. Originality/value - This paper provides a methodology for bearing stress and deformation analysis in the elastic range and {{on the basis of this}} analysis it is possible {{to develop a}}n optimization model for porous bearings offering help to designers for the selection of optimal bearing dimensions considering the bearing load caused by dynamic radial force, friction and temperature variation...|$|E

50|$|The United States Army Air Corps ordered four prototypes as the XCOA-1, {{powered by}} a 400-hp Liberty V-1650-1 engine <b>mounted</b> {{inverted}} for <b>clearance</b> of the three-bladed variable-pitch steel propeller. The engine came with a fire suppression sprinkler system and was encased in a streamlined cowling {{to protect it from}} sea spray. Oil from a tank in the fuselage was cooled by passing through a spiral copper tube exposed to the slipstream on top of the cowling. The fuel tanks were mounted inside the hull, with a 140-gallon (530-liter) gasoline tank under the wings, and a reserve 60-gallon (230-liter) gasoline-benzol tank between the cockpits. Total fuel capacity provided for roughly ten hours of flight.|$|R
5|$|The Victor B.1 was {{powered by}} an {{arrangement}} of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft's wing root; {{because of the high}} mounted position of the wing, the tail had to adopt a high <b>mounting</b> to maintain <b>clearance</b> of the jet turbulence, however the airbrakes were ideally situated {{to take advantage of this}} phenomenon. Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments; several engines were destroyed by the turbine blades striking the outer engine casing. The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union, and were significantly more powerful than the preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fixed gear}} frame, with a cream color known as [...] "Kustard" [...] and the {{signature}} {{color of the}} mark, with 120mm rear dropout spacing. The G typified the eclectic nature of Koswell frames: steel frame and fork, with lugged joints, but a TIG-welded bottom bracket and threadless fork, melding both traditional styles (see Rivendell) and contemporary innovations. [...] The frame was built with road geometry, but used track dropouts and a narrow dropout spacing, which precluded installation of a derailleur or multi-speed hub. Fender and rack <b>mounts,</b> and generous <b>clearances</b> that allowed for wide tires and fenders both, signalled clearly that this bike {{was meant to be}} used on the road. But its unwillingness to slavishly imitate traditional designs and geometries, or outdated and inferior manufacturing techniques, set it apart from a retro style of other boutique manufacturers.|$|R
