At {{the time of his}} marriage in 1739, most unusually, the marriage contract was witnessed by two grand personages, Sister Marie-Gabrielle-Eléanor de Bourbon-Condé, abbess of the Abbaye Royale de Saint-Antoine, a princesse du Sang, and another abbess of a distinguished family, Jeanne de Rohan. Henry Hawley has suggested that such contacts would have provided a useful entrée at court.|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} {{studies on the}} light-shift in caesium <b>miniature</b> atomic <b>clocks</b> based on {{coherent}} population trapping (CPT) using a micro-fabricated buffer-gas cell (MEMS cell). The CPT signal is observed on the Cs D 1 -line by coupling the two hyperfine ground-state Zeeman sublevels involved in the clock transition to a common excited state, using two coherent electromagnetic fields. These light fields are created with a distributed feedback laser and an electro-optical modulator. We study the light-shift phenomena at different cell temperatures and laser wavelengths around 894. 6 nm. By adjusting the cell temperature, conditions are identified where a <b>miniature</b> CPT atomic <b>clock</b> can be operated with simultaneously low temperature coefficient and suppressed light-shift. The impact of the light-shift on the clock frequency stability is evaluated. These results are relevant for improving the long-term frequency stability of CPT-based Cs vapour-cell clocks...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, a {{pendulum}} bob is a round flat disk, lens-shaped in section, but bobs in older clocks often have decorative carving and shapes {{characteristic of the}} type of clock. They are usually made of a dense metal such as iron or brass. Lead is denser, but is usually avoided because of its softness, which would result in the bob being dented during its inevitable collisions with the inside of the <b>clock</b> <b>case</b> when the <b>clock</b> is moved.|$|R
