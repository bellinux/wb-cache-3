2500|$|In 1890, W.D. Miller, {{considered}} {{the father of}} oral microbiology, {{was the first to}} associate pulpal disease with the presence of bacteria. [...] This was confirmed by Kakehashi, who, in 1965, proved that bacteria were the cause of pulpal and periradicular disease in studies using animal models; pulpal exposures were initiated in both normal and germ-free rats, and while no pathologic changes were exhibited in the mouths of the germ-free rats, introduction of the normal oral <b>microbial</b> <b>flora</b> produced pulpal necrosis and led to periradicular lesion formation in the normal rats. [...] The germ-free rats healed regardless of the severity of pulpal exposure, demonstrating that {{the presence or absence of}} bacteria was the determinant for pulpal and periapical disease.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of turkeys are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings {{of which there are}} many types. [...] Some types have slatted walls to allow ventilation, but many have solid walls and no windows to allow artificial lighting manipulations to optimise production. [...] The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a <b>microbial</b> <b>flora</b> requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between 18 and 21°C. High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities. [...] Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth. [...] Light intensity is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather pecking.|$|E

40|$|The {{undefined}} <b>microbial</b> <b>floras</b> {{derived from}} the surface of ripe cheese which are used for the ripening of commercial red smear cheeses have a strong impact on the growth of Listeria spp. In some cases, these microbial consortia inhibit Listeria almost completely. From such undefined industrial cheese-ripening floras, linocin M 18 -producing (lin+) (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994) and -nonproducing Brevibacterium linens strains were isolated and used as single-strain starter cultures on model red smear cheeses to evaluate their potential inhibitory effects on Listeria strains in situ. On cheeses ripened with lin+ strains, a growth reduction of L. ivanovii and L. monocytogenes of 1 to 2 log units was observed compared to cheeses ripened with lin strains. Linocin M 18 activity was detected in cheeses ripened with lin+ strains but was not found in those ripened with lin strains. We suggest that production of linocin M 18 contributes to the growth reduction of Listeria observed on model red smear cheeses but is unsufficient to explain the almost complete inhibition of Listeria caused by some undefined <b>microbial</b> <b>floras</b> {{derived from the}} surface of ripe cheeses...|$|R

40|$|Summary: While reductionism {{has greatly}} {{advanced}} microbiology {{in the past}} 400 years, assembly of smaller pieces just could not explain the whole! Modern microbiologists are learning “system thinking” and “holism. ” Such an approach is changing our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to diagnose/treat microbial infections. This review uses oral microbial communities as a focal point to describe this new trend. With the common name “dental plaque,” oral microbial communities {{are some of the}} most complex <b>microbial</b> <b>floras</b> in the human body, consisting of more than 700 different bacterial species. For a very long time, oral microbiologists endeavored to use reductionism to identify the key genes or key pathogens responsible for oral microbial pathogenesis. The limitations of reductionism forced scientists to begin adopting new strategies using emerging concepts such as interspecies interaction, microbial community, biofilms, polymicrobial disease, etc. These new research directions indicate that the whole is much more than the simple sum of its parts, since the interactions between different parts resulted in many new physiological functions which cannot be observed with individual components. This review describes some of these interesting interspecies-interaction scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>microbial</b> <b>florae</b> {{in adult}} {{periodontitis}} lesions are comprised of anaerobic rods with Porphyromonas gingivalis {{as one of}} the major components (Slots 1976; Slots 1979; and Tanner et al., 1979). P. gingivalis is a black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rod and a secondary colonizer of dental plaque requiring antecedent organisms. The presence of this organism either alone or as a mixed infection with other bacteria and with the absence of beneficial species appears to be essential for disease activity. It is a predominant member of the subgingival microbiota in disease. It possesses and "excretes" numerous potentially toxic virulence factors. Aim {{of this study is to}} perform a systematic review of studies on P. gingivalis and its virulence factors with a special focus on its vaccine. Materials and Methods: An electronic and manual search based on agreed search phrases between the primary investigator and a secondary investigator was performed for the literature review till January 2014. The articles that were identified by this systematic review (total of 190) were analyzed in detail, which included the study of inference and conclusion.

For fungi, there is significant difference between lake center (LC), typical steppe (TS) & lake bed (LB), lake side (LS) for diversity and richness; and there is significant difference between LC and TS & LB and LS for dominance. For actinomycetes, there is significant difference between LC & LS, and LB & TS for diversity; and there is significant difference between LC&TS for richness; and there is significant difference between LC&LS for evenness. At LC, the most dominant floras is Mucor, accounting for 100 %. At LB, Mucor accounts for 26. 25 % and Penicillium accounts for 45 %. At LS, the dominant floras are Mucor, accounting for 48 %, and Penicillium, accounting for 34. 48 %. At TS, Penicillium has become the dominant flora to account for 92. 23 %.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of certain levels of old forest represents {{a cornerstone of}} the EU’s biodiversity management strategy. A consensus on a single general ecological definition of old-growth is particularly difficult in Mediterranean Europe. The present paper deals with old-growth forests and persistent woodlands in the Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park (PNCVD) to give an ecological understanding of forest complexity and dynamics under a multiscale and multidisciplinary perspective. The multiscale approach ranged from the identification and mapping of potential old-growth stands at landscape scale to a two-level field review of forest stand features. Field sampling involved a multidisciplinary team of researchers in forest structure, pedologic environment, soil <b>microbial</b> activity, <b>flora</b> and vegetation and deadwood components. The research provided sound knowledge about old-growthness features in the PNCVD that constitutes a unique case study in the whole Mediterranean basin.

Although the onset and early {{development of the}} primary cutaneous lesions appeared similar in both groups, the T. mentagrophytes monoassociated guinea pigs exhibited more severe skin ulcerations and took twice as long to heal as their conventionally-reared counterparts. Cutaneous reinfection of T. mentagrophytes monoassociated guinea pigs was also protracted; however, these lesions healed in {{about the same time}} as a primary infection on conventionally-reared guinea pigs. Germfree guinea pigs, sensitized by cutaneous infection with T. mentagrophytes, manifested 3 correlates of systemic cell-mediated immunity: (1) delayed-type hypersensitivity to intracutaneous injection of trichophytin antigen, (ii) in vitro blastogenesis of spleen and lymph node cells to polyclonal mitogens and Trichophyton antigens, and (iii) allergic contact dermatitis 48 hr following cutaneous reinfection. In an additional experiment, we observed that the time course and severity of a primary T. mentagrophytes infection of germfree guinea pigs was reduced by prior feedings with heat-killed T. mentagrophytes culture. These experiments confirm that the normal <b>microbial</b> skin <b>flora</b> is not required for initiation, development or clearance of T. mentagrophytes dermatophytosis.
