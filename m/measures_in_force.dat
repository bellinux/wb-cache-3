40|$|Overfishing of large-bodied benthic fishes {{and their}} {{subsequent}} population collapses on the Scotian Shelf of Canada’s east coast 1, 2 and elsewhere 3, 4 resulted in restructuring of entire food webs now dominated by planktivorous, forage fish species and macroinvertebrates. Despite {{the imposition of}} strict management <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> <b>force</b> since the early 1990 s, the Scotian Shelf ecosystem has not reverted back to its former structure. Here we provide evidence of the transient nature of this ecosystem and its current return path towards benthic fish species domination. The prolonged duration of the altered food web, and its current recovery, was and is being governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex. These erupting forage species, which reached biomass levels 900 % greater than those prevalent during the pre-collapse years of large benthic predators, are now in decline, having outstripped their zooplankton food supply. This dampening, and the associated reduction in the intensity of predation, was accompanied by lagged increases in species abundances at both lower and higher trophic levels, first witnessed in zooplankton and then in large-bodied predators, all consistent with a return towards the earlier ecosystem structure. We conclude that the reversibility of perturbed ecosystems can occur and that this bodes well for other collapsed fisheries...|$|E

The identification of bacterial strains as well as the relative antibiogram are achieved by automated method and the resistance phenotypes are determined by the methods of agar diffusion as recommended by the antibiogram committee of the French Society of Microbiology. Results and discussion: Over a period of 03 years, 84 clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated from 414 pathological specimens from the ICU of the hospital. The multi-resistant bacterial strains (BMR) (n = 84) are largely predominated by Acinetobacter sp (n = 40) followed by Enterobacteria producing extended spectrum betalactamases (n = 26), Enterobacteria secreting hyperproduced céphalosporinases (n= 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to the ceftazidime (n= 6), and finally Staphylococcus aureus resistant to meticilline SARM (n= 4). No enterocoque resistant to the glycopeptides was insulated. The evolution of multidrug resistance to antibiotics over the past 3 years, was marked by the emergence of Acinetobacter.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{history of}} biotic {{exploitation}} for the continental margin (shelf and slope) of the Antarctic Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is reviewed, {{with emphasis on}} the period from 1970 to 2010. In the Antarctic Peninsula portion, marine mammals were decimated by the 1970 s and groundfish by the early 1980 s. Fishing for Antarctic krill Euphausia superba began upon the demise of groundfish and now is the only fishing that remains in this region. Surveys show that cetacean and most groundfish stocks remain severely depressed, harvest of which is now prohibited by the International Whaling Commission and the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). On the other hand, krill fishing in this region is underway {{and in recent years}} has contributed up to 72 % of the Southern Ocean catch, depending on fishing conditions and the CCAMLR conservation <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> <b>force.</b> Elsewhere along the Antarctic continental margin, marine mammals were also severely depleted by the 1970 s, followed directly by relatively low-level fisheries for krill that continued until the early 1990 s. Recently in these areas, where fin-fishing is still allowed, fisheries for Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni have been initiated, with one of this fish’s main prey, grenadiers Macrourus spp., being taken significantly as by-catch. Continental margin fishing currently accounts for ∼ 25 % of the total toothfish catch of the Southern Ocean. Fishing along the Antarctic continental margin, especially the Antarctic Peninsula region, is a clear case of both the tragedy of the commons and ‘fishing down the food web’...|$|E

40|$|The study investigates and {{interprets the}} factors {{that contributed to the}} recent decline in {{fertility}} in Sri Lanka, despite its low economic standing. It seeks to elucidate the social transformation that has taken place and looks at the socio-cultural determinants that have brought about the process of fertility transition. In this regard, the significant effects of the welfare <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> <b>force</b> in the country in respect of health, education, nutrition and housing have been brought to light. Hence the study tends to fall outside the scope of the conventional wisdom laid down in the demographic transition theory outlined by Notestein, which emphasised the contribution that economic development plays in lowering fertility. The approach to the study hinges on selected variables like education, age at marriage, gender roles per se and female employment. The cardinal role played by free education in contributing to the transition is given particular coverage. Education is treated more as a cultural asset which determines and shapes values, preferences and aspirations in respect of marriage, fertility, family formation and other aspects such as career development which enables women to play roles away from home. Unfortunately, inferences about women's position do not always gain statistical support, as they are intricately woven into the fabric of societal gender settings and traditions. In respect of age at marriage, the socio-cultural factors of society like the caste system, a dowry and horoscope matching with details of Karmic determinants have been examined in some detail. The study also uncovers the social deprivation aspects which for long led women in the plantation sector to experience fertility performance lower than the national level. Going by normal demographic rationale, their high degree of labour force participation should account for it. But it was social deprivation and the resultant low nutritional levels that reduced their reproductive ability to low levels. With a better life ushered in by a programme of social uplift during the early 'eighties, this ethnic group showed signs of first a rise in fertility, and on having reached the threshold it has now begun showing signs of a decline attributable to healthier lives. Similarly, a relatively invisible agent, the prevalent “urban outlook," is shown to contribute to the transition process, and has recently become even more significant due to the intensive rural amelioration efforts of the government. This outlook is all pervasive and permeates the society in general in effecting the transition under review...|$|E

40|$|Rationing <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> <b>force</b> in the United Kingdom {{from the}} {{beginning}} of the Second World War in December of 1939 until July of 1954 ostensibly ensured an egalitarian access to food and resulted in a general levelling-up of standards of nutrition in the general populace. The restrictions and shortages that plagued larders and plates, however, meant that variety and stability became preoccupations for the British public on the home front. Against the backdrop of socially levelling austerity measures, popular writers used the public’s food consciousness to explore anxieties surrounding the demarcation and performance of identities challenged by the threats to Britain’s physical and ideological borders. Food is an invaluable lens through which to examine the shaping of identity during a period that challenged food and ideological security in Britain, particularly with respect to the performance of socioeconomic class differences, national identity and gender binaries. Largely structured by Pierre Bourdieu’s examination of consumption habits as an articulation of class and gender in Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste (1979), this thesis will examine the ways in which food representation serves as a fulcrum on which social and economic class identities pivot in Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited (1948) and George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), and the acute awareness of the post-war custodianship of a damaged Britain. Secondly, it will demonstrate the ways in which austerity cookery literature not only upsets and recodifies national identity as constructed by quotidian consumption habits, but also the problematic configuration of duty to ahedonistic rationing as the housewife’s moral obligation to the nation. Expanding on this, it will consider the reconfiguration of Britain’s post-Empire relationship to the world and the enduring legacy of culinary creolisation as demonstrated in Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume’s recipe for Poulet Reign Elizabeth as served at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and the claim to the sensual rewards of gastronomy in Elizabeth David’s A Book of Mediterranean Food (1950). Finally, it will examine the ways in which Virginia Woolf’s Between the Acts (1941) and Barbara Pym’s Jane and Prudence (1953) critique and subvert ways in which a mind-body duality structures the notions of gendered appetites, and the authors’ appetites for a transcendence of the fascism of the patriarchy undergirding the twentieth century. While the austerity years are often perceived as representing a dearth of culinary culture in Britain, it is better appreciated as a period of rich innovation and adaptation, where the yearning for security and identity forged complex texts ambivalent about Britain’s past, present and future...|$|E
