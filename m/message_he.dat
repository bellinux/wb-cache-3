He traveled to Universities held press conferences and filmed an eight-minute television advertisement, to be shown in small states and on cable television, to help spread his <b>message.</b> <b>He</b> focused on gaining enough support to win {{a place in the}} League of Women Voters-sponsored presidential debates.|$|E
5|$|Although {{strongly}} {{urged by}} moderates in Congress {{to sign the}} bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto <b>message,</b> <b>he</b> objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen {{at a time when}} 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E

5|$|Armin {{was once}} a troubled young man from Capital City, and finds himself in the Army. There, he met and befriended the real Sergeant Seymour Skinner, who became his mentor and helped him find meaning in his troubled life. Seymour told Armin that his dream was to become an {{elementary}} school principal after the war. Later, Seymour was declared missing and presumed dead. Armin took {{the news of the}} apparent death to Seymour's mother, Agnes. Upon meeting him, however, Agnes mistook him for her son, and Armin could not bear to deliver the <b>message.</b> <b>He</b> instead allowed Agnes to call him Seymour, and took over Seymour's life. Meanwhile, the real Seymour Skinner spent five years in a POW camp, then worked in a Chinese sweatshop for two decades until it was shut down by the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|Curtin {{replied to}} Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again {{stressed}} the need to return the 9th Division to Australia {{as soon as possible}} to make good the Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In his <b>message</b> <b>he</b> agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the events}} of the first tournament, Raiden sees visions of the future due to the <b>message</b> <b>he</b> received. Raiden concludes that Liu Kang must win the tournament to save Earthrealm. During the tournament, Liu Kang becomes the only {{remaining}} Earthrealm contender, due in part to Scorpion's murder of Bi-Han, in retaliation for the latter's murder of the Shirai Ryu clan some years earlier. Liu Kang is successful in defeating the Shokan Prince Goro, as well as Shang Tsung. Raiden's amulet, however, cracks, a sign that future events are unchanged. Disappointed with the sorcerer's failure, emperor Shao Kahn orders Shang Tsung's execution, but is convinced otherwise when the sorcerer suggests holding the second tournament in Outworld. Though initially refusing, Raiden relents when tarkatans invade Earth and Shang Tsung threatens to unleash all of Outworld's armies upon Earthrealm.|$|E

5|$|Finding {{an account}} of a World War II-era Japanese {{military}} and Nazi scientific expedition to the island that sought a way to harness the storms as a weapon, Lara decides to explore a coastal tomb, where she finds {{the remains of a}} samurai general who committed seppuku. It is revealed in a <b>message</b> <b>he</b> left that he led the Queen's Stormguard, the Oni that defend the monastery, and that the Queen's successor took her own life rather than receive the Sun Queen's power. Lara realizes that the Ascension is not a ceremony to crown a new queen, but rather a ritual that transfers the original Sun Queen's soul into a new body; the Sun Queen had learned to become effectively immortal by transferring her soul into a young girl's body each time she grew old. The last priestess' suicide had interrupted the ritual, and left the Queen's soul trapped in her old decaying body, and Himiko's spirit has wanted to escape that corpse ever since. Her rage is what's causing the storms on the island. As a descendant of Yamatai, Sam is a viable candidate, and Mathias plans to offer Sam as a new host in exchange for his freedom. Once the Sun Queen awakens in Sam's body, the storms will subside.|$|E
5|$|Following Ohayō, Kon {{began work}} on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend {{the remainder of his}} life in his home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the <b>message,</b> <b>he</b> chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness at relatively recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal state {{in a matter of months}} after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010 at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the Fond Farewells in TIME's people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court. Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto <b>message,</b> <b>he</b> objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. This {{was the first time in}} American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary to override a presidential veto. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.|$|E

5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text <b>message</b> <b>he</b> sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that {{the cause of death was}} drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E
