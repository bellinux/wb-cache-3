The proposed model is integrated in an object-oriented based decision support platform for competitive power <b>markets.</b> <b>Validation</b> of the method and practical applications to real longitudinal systems are discussed, where FACTS location and a UPFC-based interconnection are described.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of new chemical sensors for the direct detection of nitrogen trichloride, NCl 3, a toxic pollutant present in the atmosphere of indoor swimming pools, is described. These innovative chemical and colorimetric sensors {{are based on the}} use of nanoporous matrices doped with probe-molecules, which act as sponges to trap the targeted pollutant and turn from transparent to pink-violet. These sensors can detect NCl 3 at ppb level within 15 min in humid atmosphere. Due to the fast change of color, visible with naked eyes, these sensors can be used to detect peaks of pollution and to monitor the air quality of indoor pools in public or private area. The technology was transferred from Francis Perrin Laboratory (LFP) to ETHERA, a CEA-CNRS 4 spin-off, which optimizes both the sensor synthesis for mass production and the quality control procedures needed for <b>marketing.</b> <b>Validation</b> of analytical procedures and sensor response in real environment is accomplished via a campaign of NCl 3 measurements in a Parisian swimming pool...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompanies {{are facing}} {{increasingly}} tough {{competition in the}} global economy. Previously sustainable competitive advantage strategies are insufficient in the changed market conditions. The only sustainable advantage is continuous innovation at a faster pace than rival organizations. This requires a systematic approach to innovation and engaging staff on all levels to effectively {{take part in the}} innovation efforts. Toyota Kata is a proven and highly successful method for continuous improvement at the whole organization level. Toyota Kata was discovered by Mike Rother while he researched Toyota's quality improvement methods. It is a holistic system method for improvement efforts which contains processes and behavioral patterns for strategically aligned goal setting, problem solving, coaching, management and training. It is a simple and teachable approach which also covers the management of improvement efforts. The downside of the approach is its focus on incremental improvement instead of breakthrough innovation. The approach can be improved by adding TRIZ techniques like contradiction analyses, FAA, inventive principles and trends of evolution to various parts of the method. This approach will allow to keep the benefits of the Toyota Kata approach while changing the focus from incremental improvement to true innovation. The combined approach is also better suited for the more complex problems of today's knowledge workers. Toyota Kata can also be used as method for introducing and training TRIZ to the organization in an effective and incremental way. The combined method for continuous innovation can be further improved with the Lean Startup methods to validate the solutions.

40|$|Market risk {{management}} {{is one of}} the key factors to success in managing financial institutions. Underestimated risk can have desastrous consequences for individual companies and even whole economies, not least as could be seen during the recent crises. Overestimated risk, on the other side, may have negative effects on a company's capital requirements. Companies as well as national authorities thus have a strong interest in developing market risk models that correctly quantify certain key figures such as Value at Risk or Expected Shortfall. This paper presents several state of the art methods to evaluate the adequacy of almost any given market risk model. Existing models are enhanced by in-depth analysis and simulations of statistical properties revealing some previously unknown effects, most notably inconsistent behaviour of alpha and beta errors.

40|$|Abstract—Some {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} vulnerability—discovery, dissemination, and disclosure—have {{received}} some attention recently. However, the role of interaction among the vulnerability discoverers and vulnerability acquirers {{has not yet been}} adequately addressed. Our study suggests that a major percentage of discoverers, a majority in some cases, are unaffiliated with the software developers and thus are free to disseminate the vulnerabilities they discover in any way they like. As a result, multiple vulnerability markets have emerged. In some of these markets, the exchange is regulated, but in others, {{there is little or no}} regulation. In recent vulnerability discovery literature, the vulnerability discoverers have remained anonymous individuals. Although there has been an attempt to model the level of their efforts, information regarding their identities, modes of operation, and what they are doing with the discovered vulnerabilities has not been explored. Reports of buying and selling of the vulnerabilities are now appearing in the press; however, the existence of such <b>markets</b> requires <b>validation,</b> and the natures of the markets need to be analyzed. To address this need, we have attempted to collect detailed information. We have identified the most prolific vulnerability discoverers throughout the past decade and examined their motivation and methods. A large percentage of these discoverers are located in Eastern and Western Europe and in the Far East. We have contacted several of them in order to collect firsthand information regarding their techniques, motivations, and involvement in the vulnerability markets. We examine why many of the discoverers appear to retire after a highly successful vulnerability-finding career. The paper identifies the actual vulnerability markets, rather than the hypothetical ideal markets that are often examined. The emergence of worldwide government agencies as vulnerability buyers has significant implications. We discuss potential factors that can impact the risk to society and the need for detailed exploration. Keywords—Risk management, software security, vulnerability discoverers, vulnerability markets.
