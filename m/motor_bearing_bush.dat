The bearing consists of a Leaded bronze material (Bronze grade LTB 2, 3 or 4 of IS 318 or Nitrile / cutless rubber) which is the softer part out these two. The failures of the <b>bearing</b> <b>bush</b> accounts for 90 % of the failures in a submersible motor. The implication of this failure is the complete breakdown of the Motor i. e. the windings will get damaged and expensive repairs would be required to be carried out.
