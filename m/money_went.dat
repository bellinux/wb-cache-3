5|$|As a senator, Nixon {{received}} an annual salary of $12,500 (about $150,000 in 2009 dollars). While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that <b>money</b> <b>went</b> to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 2012 a 30,000 euro funding {{campaign}} was started to finance additional development projects. On {{the end of}} the year approximately 50% of the funding goal was achieved and it was decided to continue the funding campaign without deadlines. The <b>money</b> <b>went</b> to ReactOS Deutschland e.V.. As the tax law in Germany for this form of a registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein) makes it problematic to pay developers directly, indirect possibilities like stipends were evaluated.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the search for}} the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the <b>money</b> <b>went</b> unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of 1922, Forbes had met Elias Mortimer, agent for the Thompson-Black Construction Company of St. Louis, which wanted to construct the hospitals. The two men became close, and Mortimer paid for Forbes' travels through the West, looking at potential hospital sites for the wounded World War I veterans. Forbes was also friendly with Charles F. Hurley, owner of the Hurley-Mason Construction Company of Washington state. Harding had ordered that all contracts be pursuant to public notice, but the three worked out a deal whereby the two companies would get the contracts with the profits divided three ways. Some of the <b>money</b> <b>went</b> to the bureau's chief counsel, Charles F. Cramer. Forbes defrauded the government in this hospital construction, increasing construction costs from $3,000 to $4,000 per bed. A tenth of the inflated construction billings was {{set aside for the}} conspirators, with Forbes receiving a third of the take. The graft then spread to land acquisition, with Forbes authorizing the purchase of a San Francisco tract – that was worth less than $20,000 – for $105,000. At least $25,000 of the resulting financial excess was divided between Forbes and Cramer.|$|E
5|$|York were {{relegated to}} the Conference National for 2004–05, which brought an end to 72 years of Football League {{football}} at Bootham Crescent. In January 2005 the ground was renamed KitKat Crescent, {{as part of a}} sponsorship deal under which Nestlé donated £100,000 to the club. This <b>money</b> <b>went</b> towards covering the shortfall the club faced paying BCH directors, Persimmon and stamp duty when buying the ground. The ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. The deal expired in January 2010, when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. York returned to the Football League for 2012–13, and their first League Two match at Bootham Crescent was a 3–1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012, before a 4,591 crowd. The club was {{relegated to the}} National League for 2016–17, ending a four-year spell back in the Football League. The ground has not been subject to any major investment since the 1990s, and has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Lao Government {{had close}} {{relations}} with the United States, which gave the country aid and assisted it in the campaign against the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese Communist movement. During 1957, the United States spent more per capita on foreign aid for Laos than it had on any other nation. That worked out as US$150 per Laotian, twice the average person's annual income. Some of the <b>money</b> <b>went</b> to support pro-American candidates in an election, while other <b>money</b> <b>went</b> to a program to support the local currency, the kip.|$|E
