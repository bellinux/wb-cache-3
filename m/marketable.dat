5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of <b>marketable</b> skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and <b>marketable</b> skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} numerous subplots which largely {{serve as}} {{means for the}} player to earn money. For example, the player can choose to locate and retrieve a stolen icon {{on behalf of a}} religious leader in exchange for a reward. Other methods to earn money include stripping the corpses of slain opponents for <b>marketable</b> items, killing wanted criminals to earn a reward, and attacking other vessels in space to pirate their cargo. Gameplay {{in the early stages of}} the game primarily involves activities of this nature so that the player can accumulate enough money to outfit the party with better weapons and armor and purchase a jump drive capable of propelling the party's spacecraft to other worlds crucial to obtaining the means to stop Kiefer.|$|E
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more <b>marketable</b> crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The tax on whiskey was bitterly and {{fiercely}} opposed on {{the frontier}} from {{the day it was}} passed. Western farmers considered it to be both unfair and discriminatory. As the Lower Mississippi River had been closed to American shipping for nearly a decade, farmers in western Pennsylvania were forced to turn their grain into whiskey. The substantial reduction in volume resulting from the distillation of grain into whiskey greatly reduced the cost to transport their crops to the populous east coast, which was the only place where there were markets for their crops. By the third quarter of 1794, tensions reached a fevered pitch all along the western frontier as the settlers' primary <b>marketable</b> commodity was threatened by the federal taxation measures.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Parker {{worked closely}} with Obsidian on the project, {{sometimes}} having two-to-three hour meetings over four consecutive days. They worked with Obsidian until {{two weeks before the}} game was shipped. Their involvement extended beyond creative input; their company initially financed the game, believing that a game based on the controversial television show would struggle to receive financial support from publishers without them placing restrictions on the content to make it more <b>marketable.</b> The initial funding was intended to allow Obsidian to develop enough of the game to show a more complete concept to potential publishers. In December 2011, THQ announced that they would work with Obsidian on South Park: The Game, as it was then known. This partnership developed into a publishing arrangement after South Park owner Viacom, having grown wary of video games, cut its funding. Obsidian was aware when it signed with THQ that the latter was experiencing financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|The storyline of {{the game}} {{was based on the}} final novel in Nishitani's trilogy, Tensei no Shuuen, {{although}} taking its title from the first novel, Megami Tensei. Nishitani was deeply involved in planning the game, contributing suggestions and advice for the project. According to Okada, a major issue during development was faithfully following the novel's plot due to the limited hardware space on the Famicom cartridge, together with the necessity of creating a compelling gameplay experience. With this in mind, the team picked out key parts the novel's plot to include in the game while cutting out non-essential elements. One element that was not included was the questionable morality of the main protagonist, which was a prominent feature in the novels. Suzuki later commented that it was only because they were working with Namco, which included mature character designs and the heavy use of religion in its narrative, that the game was ever released. The Cerberus demon, which would become a recurring feature in later Megami Tensei games, was a homage to the narrative of Nishitani's trilogy, at the same time emulating the trend for games to have a <b>marketable</b> mascot or character.|$|E
5|$|According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer {{for five}} years out of six between 2009 and 2014; {{he was the first}} player to exceed the €40million benchmark, with {{earnings}} of €41million in 2013, and the €50–€60million points, with income of €65million in 2014. In 2016, Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. Since 2008, he has been Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8million to €13million over the next five years. His current salary of €20million net (€36million before taxes), established in 2014, is the highest ever in the sport. In addition to his salary and multimillion-euro bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most <b>marketable</b> athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barça's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of boots, the Adidas Messi.|$|E

25|$|Forbes {{has twice}} ranked Ronaldo first {{on their list}} of the world's highest-paid {{football}} players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and non-football earnings was $73million in 2013–14 and $79million in 2014–15. The latter earnings saw him listed behind only boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr. on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes. In 2016, {{he became the first}} footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93million in 2016–17. Ronaldo is one of the world's most <b>marketable</b> athletes: SportsPro rated him the fifth most <b>marketable</b> athlete in 2012, and eighth most <b>marketable</b> athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists. Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most <b>marketable</b> and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.
