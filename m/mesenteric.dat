5|$|Superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery {{syndrome}} (SMA) is {{an extremely}} rare life-threatening condition that can either be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} {{muscle is}} derived from mesoderm and {{plays a role in}} the embryological rotation of the gut, by offering a point of fixation for the rotating gut. It is also thought to help digestion by widening the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure. Superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery syndrome is a rare abnormality caused by a congenitally-short suspensory muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of duodenum {{is a thin}} muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery and coeliac artery. It {{is also known as}} the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), <b>mesenteric</b> vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also {{increases the risk}} of arterial thrombosis (which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may {{be divided into two}} sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{enters the}} body through the mouth, infecting the first cells {{with which it}} comes in contact — the pharynx and {{intestinal}} mucosa. It gains entry by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, known as the poliovirus receptor or CD155, on the cell membrane. The virus then hijacks the host cell's own machinery, and begins to replicate. Poliovirus divides within gastrointestinal cells for about a week, from where it spreads to the tonsils (specifically the follicular dendritic cells residing within the tonsilar germinal centers), the intestinal lymphoid tissue including the M cells of Peyer's patches, and the deep cervical and <b>mesenteric</b> lymph nodes, where it multiplies abundantly. The virus is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|Flexural anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a <b>mesenteric</b> contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises {{at the point where}} the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal <b>mesenteric</b> flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the <b>mesenteric</b> confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this <b>mesenteric</b> confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the <b>mesenteric</b> confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the <b>mesenteric</b> confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|Thrombosis of the {{superior}} <b>mesenteric</b> vein can cause <b>mesenteric</b> ischemia also known as ischemic bowel. <b>Mesenteric</b> ischemia can also result from {{the formation of a}} volvulus, a twisted loop of the small intestine that when it wraps around itself and also encloses the mesentery too tightly can cause ischemia.|$|E
25|$|Clarifications of the <b>mesenteric</b> anatomy have {{facilitated}} {{a clearer}} understanding of diseases involving the mesentery, examples of which include malrotation and Crohn's disease (CD). In CD, the mesentery is frequently thickened, rendering haemostasis challenging. In addition, fat wrapping—creeping fat—involves extension of <b>mesenteric</b> fat over {{the circumference of}} contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between <b>mesenteric</b> derangements and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a <b>mesenteric</b> disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.|$|E
25|$|Venous {{drainage}} usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, {{with the}} inferior <b>mesenteric</b> vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior <b>mesenteric</b> vein joining the splenic vein {{to form the}} hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} <b>mesenteric</b> artery passes down {{in front}} of the left half across the uncinate process; the superior <b>mesenteric</b> vein runs upward on the right side of the artery and, behind the neck, joins with the lienal vein to form the portal vein.|$|E

25|$|Recent radiologic appraisals of the <b>mesenteric</b> organ {{have been}} {{conducted}} {{in the context of}} the contemporary understanding of <b>mesenteric</b> organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and flexural regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer conceptualization of <b>mesenteric</b> derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.|$|E

25|$|Descriptions of the {{mesocolon}} by Toldt, Congdon, and Dodds {{have largely}} been ignored in mainstream literature until recently. A formal appraisal of the <b>mesenteric</b> organ anatomy was conducted in 2012; it echoed the findings of Toldt, Congdon, and Dodds. The single greatest advance in this regard was {{the identification of the}} <b>mesenteric</b> organ as being contiguous, as it spans the gastrointestinal tract from duodenojejunal flexure to mesorectal level.|$|E
25|$|The {{body and}} {{neck of the}} {{pancreas}} drain into the splenic vein; the head drains into the superior <b>mesenteric</b> and portal veins.|$|E
25|$|The sigmoid {{mesocolon}} is {{that region}} of the mesentery to which the sigmoid colon is attached at the gastrointestinal <b>mesenteric</b> margin.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for pancreatitis includes {{but is not}} limited to cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, perforated peptic ulcer, bowel infarction, small bowel obstruction, hepatitis and <b>mesenteric</b> ischemia.|$|E
25|$|In hemodynamically {{unstable}} patients (i.e. shock) the <b>mesenteric</b> perfusion may be compromised. This {{condition is}} commonly asymptomatic, and usually only apparent through a systemic inflammatory response.|$|E
25|$|The rectum {{receives}} {{blood from}} both the inferior <b>mesenteric</b> artery and the internal iliac artery; the rectum is rarely involved by colonic ischemia due to this dual blood supply.|$|E
25|$|In Meckel's diverticulum, the {{proximal}} part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as {{a remnant of}} variable length and location. The solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum (opposite to the <b>mesenteric</b> attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo. The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta, and travel with the vitelline duct. The right becomes the superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum, while the left involutes. Having its own blood supply, Meckel's diverticulum is susceptible to obstruction or infection.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} ascending colon and proximal {{two-thirds of the}} transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior <b>mesenteric</b> lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior <b>mesenteric</b> and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain to the internal iliac nodes. The anal canal below the pectinate line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The pectinate line only roughly marks this transition.|$|E
25|$|Production of sIgA against {{specific}} antigens {{depends on}} sampling of M cells and underlying dendritic cells, T cell activation, and B cell class switching in GALT, <b>mesenteric</b> lymph nodes, and isolated lymphoid follicles {{in the small}} intestine.|$|E
25|$|Forty {{percent of}} people with PNH develop {{thrombosis}} (a blood clot) {{at some point in}} their illness. This is the main cause of severe complications and death in PNH. These may develop in common sites (deep vein thrombosis of the leg and resultant pulmonary embolism when these clots break off and enter the lungs), but in PNH blood clots may also form in more unusual sites: the hepatic vein (causing Budd-Chiari syndrome), the portal vein of the liver (causing portal vein thrombosis), the superior or inferior <b>mesenteric</b> vein (causing <b>mesenteric</b> ischemia) and veins of the skin. Cerebral venous thrombosis, an uncommon form of stroke, is more common in those with PNH.|$|E
25|$|In early human embryogenesis, the ventral part of {{the embryo}} abuts the yolk sac. During {{the second week of}} development, as the embryo grows, it begins to {{surround}} parts of the sac. The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract. The sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline arteries. Over time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery, superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery, and inferior <b>mesenteric</b> artery. The areas supplied by these arteries are used to define the midgut, hindgut and foregut. The surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and stomach form from the foregut.|$|E
25|$|Retroperitoneal fat and lymphatic tissue {{normally}} {{serve as}} a cushion for the duodenum, protecting it from compression by the SMA. SMA syndrome is thus triggered by any condition involving an insubstantial cushion and narrow <b>mesenteric</b> angle. SMA syndrome can present in two forms: chronic/congenital or acute/induced.|$|E
25|$|Ischemic colitis must be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} many other causes of abdominal pain and rectal bleeding (for example, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, or colon cancer). It {{is also important to}} differentiate ischemic colitis, which often resolves on its own, from the more immediately life-threatening condition of acute <b>mesenteric</b> ischemia of the small bowel.|$|E
25|$|Locoregional {{complications}} include {{pancreatic pseudocyst}} (Most common, occurring {{in up to}} 25% of all cases) and phlegmon / abscess formation, splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, hemorrhage from erosions into splenic artery and vein, thrombosis of the splenic vein, superior <b>mesenteric</b> vein and portal veins (in descending order of frequency), duodenal obstruction, common bile duct obstruction, progression to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic ascites, pleural effusion, pancreatic abscess, sterile/infected pancreatic necrosis.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{conditions}} {{affecting the}} bowels include infectious diarrhoea and <b>mesenteric</b> ischaemia. Causes of constipation may include faecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn {{be caused by}} ileus, intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing enterocolitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesentery}} becomes {{attached to}} the colon at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several mesenteries of the mesocolon, sometimes collectively called the <b>mesenteric</b> organ. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from {{the part of the}} colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.|$|E
25|$|The {{pancreas}} receives {{blood from}} branches {{of both the}} coeliac artery and superior <b>mesenteric</b> artery. The splenic artery runs along the top margin of the pancreas, and supplies the neck, body and {{tail of the pancreas}} through its pancreatic branches, the largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery. The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the anterior and posterior surfaces of the head of the pancreas at its border with the duodenum. These supply the head of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|There are devices which {{test the}} {{sufficiency}} of oxygen delivery to the colon. The first device {{approved by the}} U.S. FDA in 2004 uses visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, Specificity has been 90% or higher for acute colonic ischemia, and 83% for chronic <b>mesenteric</b> ischemia, with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however.|$|E
25|$|All colon surgery {{involves}} {{only three}} maneuvers that may vary in complexity {{depending on the}} region of the bowel {{and the nature of the}} disease. The maneuvers are the retraction of the colon, the division of the attachments to the colon and the dissection of the mesentery. After the resection of the colon, the surgeon normally divides the attachments to the liver and the small intestine. After the <b>mesenteric</b> vessels are dissected, the colon is divided with special surgical staplers that close off the bowel while cutting between the staple lines.|$|E
25|$|Determination of the {{macroscopic}} {{structure of}} the <b>mesenteric</b> organ allowed a recent characterisation of the histological and electron microscopic properties. The microscopic {{structure of the}} mesocolon and associated fascia is consistent from ileocecal to mesorectal levels. A surface mesothelium and underlying connective tissue is universally apparent. Adipocytes lobules within {{the body of the}} mesocolon are separated by fibrous septae arising from submesothelial connective tissue. Where apposed to the retroperitoneum, two mesothelial layers separate the mesocolon and underlying retroperitoneum. Between these is Toldt's fascia, a discrete layer of connective tissue. Lymphatic channels are evident in mesocolic connective tissue and in Toldt's fascia.|$|E
25|$|The {{mesentery}} of {{the small}} intestine arises from {{the root of the}} mesentery (or <b>mesenteric</b> root) and is the part connected with the structures in front of the vertebral column. The root is narrow, about 15cm long, 20cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the duodenojejunal flexure at {{the left side of the}} second lumbar vertebra to the right sacroiliac articulation. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction. This section {{of the small}} intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the greater omentum.|$|E
