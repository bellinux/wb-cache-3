5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation <b>measurement</b> <b>range</b> was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Upper wind data is {{the basic}} data for {{meteorological}} services and military supporting missions, and balloon-tracing method is {{the most commonly used}} method in meteorological operation. In this paper a balloon-tracing and wind measuring method bases on inertial navigation systems (INS) is proposed accounting to the limitation in conventional methods.
