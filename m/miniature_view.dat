40|$|Workspace {{awareness}} is knowledge about others' interaction with a shared workspace. Groupware systems provide only limited information about other participants, often compromising workspace awareness. This paper describes a usability study of several widgets {{designed to help}} maintain awareness in a groupware workspace. These widgets include a <b>miniature</b> <b>view,</b> a radar view, a multiuser scrollbar, a glance function, and a "what {{you see is what}} I do" view. The study examined the widgets' information content, how easily people could interpret them, and whether they were useful or distracting. Observations, questionnaires, and interviews indicate that the miniature and radar displays are useful and valuable for tasks involving spatial manipulation of artifacts. Keywords Workspace awareness, shared workspaces, usability study.

25|$|From the beginning, Żak {{expressed}} his artistic temperament through a sophisticated application of line, referring in his sanguine portraits to works by Leonardo, Botticelli, Holbein and Dürer. In the {{early stage of}} his career, he approached {{the style of the}} Nabis, through the manipulation of flat areas, enclosed within distinct contours and faded, slightly matte colors. For a brief period, he succumbed – like so many of his Parisian colleagues – to the exoticism and folk atmosphere of Brittany. He also borrowed certain motifs from Chinese porcelain and Persian <b>miniatures.</b> He painted <b>views</b> of Parisian back streets and boulevards on the Seine and, sporadically, took up New Testament themes.|$|R

Set designers were also using a scenic technique called camera angle projection to create perspective drawings from a plan and elevation blueprint.

The {{aim of the}} instrument is to map the temporal and spatial variation of trace gases such as ozone and dust/cloud aerosols in the atmosphere of Mars. The instrument consists {{of a set of}} two <b>miniature</b> telescope <b>viewing</b> optics which allow for selective input onto the optical bench, where an e 2 v technologies CCD 30 - 11 will be used as the detector. A Geometry Description Markup Language model of the spacecraft and instrument box was created and through the use of ESA's SPace ENVironment Information System (SPENVIS) an estimate of the 10 MeV equivalent proton fluence was made at a number of radiation sensitive regions within NOMAD, including that of the CCD 30 - 11 which is the focus of this paper. The end of life 10 MeV equivalent proton fluence at the charge coupled device was estimated to be 4. 7 × 10 9 protons. cm − 2; three devices were irradiated at different levels up a 10 MeV equivalent fluence of 9. 4 × 10 9 protons. cm − 2.

40|$|Many {{bioinformatics}} applications construct classifiers {{that are}} validated in experiments that compare their results to known ground truth over a corpus. In this paper, we introduce an approach {{for exploring the}} results of such classifier validation experiments, focusing on classifiers for regions of molecular surfaces. We provide a tool that allows for examining classification performance patterns over a test corpus. The approach combines a summary view that provides information about an entire corpus of molecules with a detail view that visualizes classifier results directly on protein surfaces. Rather than displaying <b>miniature</b> 3 D <b>views</b> of each molecule, the summary provides 2 D glyphs of each protein surface arranged in a reorderable, small-multiples grid. Each summary is specifically designed to support visual aggregation to allow the viewer to both {{get a sense of}} aggregate properties as well as the details that form them. The detail view provides a 3 D visualization of each protein surface coupled with interaction techniques designed to support key tasks, including spatial aggregation and automated camera touring. A prototype implementation of our approach is demonstrated on protein surface classifier experiments...|$|R
40|$|Stauroglanis gouldingi is {{described}} as new genus and species of the Trichomycteridae. Characters traditionally used to delimit subgroups of tricho-mycterids would include Stauroglanis in the subfamily Trichomycterinae. Nevertheless, simi-larities between Stauroglanis and trichomycter-ines cannot be considered as derived characters for the two taxa. Instead, {{a number of other}} newly proposed characters constitute unequivocal syn-apomorphies supporting monophyly ofStaurogla-nis plus the Sarcoglanidinae. Further analysis in-dicates that Sarcoglanis and Malacoglanis (the two previously known sarcoglanidines) form a mono-phyletic group, with Stauroglanis as its sister group. All characters used until the present to define the Trichomycterinae are either synapomorphies for the whole family (i. e., symplesiomorphies for the subfamily) or features of uncertain polarity. Scleronema and two species of Trichomycterus, T. boylei and T. santaeritae, are tentatively proposed to be more closely related to the Sarcoglanidinae than to the Trichomycterinae. In addition, it is suggested that T. hasemani and T. johnsoni are more closely related to the Tridentinae than to any Trichomycterinae. These cases are given as posi-tive evidence that the Trichomycterinae is non-monophyletic as presently constituted. By current criteria, Stauroglanis can be consid-ered as one more <b>miniature</b> trichomycterid. In <b>view</b> ofnew data, three miniaturization events are pro-posed within the family: at the base of Glanap-teryginae/Sarcoglanidinae clade (including Trichomycterus santaeritae), at the base of Tri-dentinae clade (including Trichomycterus hase...|$|R
40|$|Giving robots {{the ability}} to move around {{autonomously}} in various real-world environments has long been a major challenge for Artificial Intelligence. New approaches to the design and control of autonomous robots have shown the value of drawing inspiration from the natural world. Animals navigate, perceive and interact with various uncontrolled environments with seemingly little effort. Flying insects, in particular, are quite adept at manoeuvring in complex, unpredictable and possibly hostile environments. Inspired by the <b>miniature</b> machine <b>view</b> of insects, this thesis contributes to the autonomous control of mobile robots through the application of insect-based visual cues and behaviours. The parsimonious, yet robust, solutions offered by insects are directly applicable to the computationally restrictive world of autonomous mobile robots. To this end, two main navigational domains are focussed on: corridor guidance and visual homing. Within a corridor environment, safe navigation is achieved through the application of simple and intuitive behaviours observed in insect, visual navigation. By observing and responding to observed apparent motions in a reactive, yet intelligent way, the robot is able to exhibit useful corridor guidance behaviours at modest expense. Through a combination of both simulation and real-world robot experiments, the feasibility of equipping a mobile robot with {{the ability to}} safely navigate in various environments, is demonstrated. It is further shown that the reactive nature of the robot can be augmented to incorporate a map building method that allows previously encountered corridors to be recognised, through the observation of landmarks en route. This allows for a more globally-directed navigational goal. Many animals, including insects such as bees and ants, successfully engage in visual homing. This is achieved through the association of ++visual landmarks with a specific location. In this way, the insect is able to 'home in' on a previously visited site by simply moving {{in such a way as}} to maximise the match between the currently observed environment and the memorised 'snapshot' of the panorama as seen from the goal. A mobile robot can exploit the very same strategy to simply and reliably return to a previously visited location. This thesis describes a system that allows a mobile robot to home successfully. Specifically, a simple, yet robust, homing scheme that relies only upon the observation of the bearings of visible landmarks, is proposed. It is also shown that this strategy can easily be extended to incorporate other visual cues which may improve overall performance. The homing algorithm described, allows a mobile robot to home incrementally by moving in such a way as to gradually reduce the discrepancy between the current view and the view obtained from the home position. Both simulation and mobile robot experiments are again used to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach...|$|R
