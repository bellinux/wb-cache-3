On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how <b>much</b> <b>could</b> be funded by the government.|$|E

In September and October the general plans were approved by the St John's Council and the University Senate. During the period from October 1859 to April 1860 relations between Wardell and the Council deteriorated for various reasons, ultimately ending with Wardell's resignation in June 1860.|$|E

This would have facilitated his renewed access to the Imperial Court. As already indicated, Timesitheus was much admired for his culture and learning - for which <b>much</b> <b>could</b> be forgiven in Roman Society - and his rhetorical prowess no doubt did much to restore his reputation and influence with senior courtiers and senators who were dominant in Imperial politics {{in the early years of}} the reign of Gordian III.|$|E

Simon & Garfunkel took advantage of this indulgence, hiring viola and brass players, as well as percussionists.

He spent two years working on a script, and found this task difficult for several reasons. First, he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel. Second, his protagonist barely spoke for the first half, and [...] "therefore can't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does". Adapting Austen's wit was another challenge; <b>much</b> <b>could</b> not be used [...] "because it's almost all in the author's voice telling us about characters, with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves.

Although <b>much</b> <b>could</b> be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings. Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist I Ching in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through [...] "crude traces", which he likens to mathematical astronomy. Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to [...] "make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them," [...] which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of Heraclitus, Plato, and Democritus as well. Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them. Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained. When describing an event where lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and lacquerwares inside were fine, yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|An oboe triplet figure then {{reveals the}} warm theme in G major of the Adagio non troppo section, a {{contrast}} to the prior cold landscape. The texture expands contrapuntally for the first time, culminates {{to a point where}} the tonality brightens to B major and, after a climax, wanes to G major again. The full strings are soon disturbed by an [...] "evil" [...] motif on woodwinds, playing the shivering element in Tempo giusto; tension between wind and strings intensifies as tonality shifts within instrumental groups in their respective directions. With a further clash, the music is menaced by the snare drum at a tempo (quarter note ♩=116) faster than that of the orchestra, and at its climax comes the instruction to the snare drummer by the composer to improvise [...] "as if at all costs he wants to stop the progress of the orchestra". (This instruction is not included in the 1950 edition of the score, being replaced by a written rhythmic line and instruction [...] "cad. ad lib." [...] after a few bars.) The warm theme eventually triumphs in a sustaining grandeur, as is affirmed by the snare drum actually joining the orchestral fanfare. When all subsides, echoes in woodwinds are heard and a solitary clarinet is left to mourn in a tragic atmosphere, recapturing ideas from the whole movements: [...] "Who would have thought that so <b>much</b> <b>could</b> have come out of a gently waving viola line in empty space?" ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1959, Kubrick {{received}} a phone call from Kirk Douglas asking him to direct Spartacus (1960), based on the true life story of the historical figure Spartacus and the events of the Third Servile War. Douglas had acquired the rights to the novel by Howard Fast and blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo began penning the script. It was produced by Douglas, who also starred as rebellious slave Spartacus, and cast Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. Douglas hired Kubrick for a reported fee of $150,000 to take over direction soon after he fired director Anthony Mann. [...] Kubrick had, at 31, already directed four feature films, and this became his largest by far, with a cast of over 10,000 and a large budget of $6 million. At the time, this was the most expensive film ever made in America, and Kubrick became the youngest director in Hollywood history to helm an epic. It was the first time that Kubrick filmed using the anamorphic 35mm horizontal Super Technirama process to achieve ultra-high definition, which allowed him to capture large panoramic scenes, including one with 8,000 trained soldiers from Spain representing the Roman army. [...] Disputes broke out during the filming. Kubrick complained about not having full creative control over the artistic aspects, insisting on improvising extensively during the production. Kubrick and Douglas were also at odds over the script, with Kubrick angering Douglas when he cut all but two of his lines from the opening 30 minutes. Despite the on-set troubles, Spartacus was a critical and commercial success, earning $14.6 million at the box office in its first run. The film established Kubrick as a major director, receiving six Academy Award nominations and winning four; it ultimately convinced him that if so <b>much</b> <b>could</b> be made of such a problematic production, he could achieve anything. Spartacus also marked, however, the end of the working relationship between Kubrick and Douglas.|$|E

2500|$|Patronage of {{the arch}} has been {{attributed}} to either the Athenian state or to the Panhellenes, a newly formed association of all the Greek cities, based in Athens.

2500|$|Fruela {{was one of}} the magnates who {{witnessed}} the first recorded act of Queen Urraca, on 22 July 1109, and implicitly acknowledged her claim to have been granted [...] "the whole kingdom" [...] (regnum totum) by her father, Alfonso VI, shortly before his death. This important document Fruela signs as legionensium comes (count of León), a high-sounding title that was probably honorific and had long been associated with the Flagínez. On 17 November 1110 he signed a document as comes in terra de legione et in gralare (count in the land of León and in Grajal), perhaps a special authority associated with the breakdown of relations between Urraca and the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Battler, who was also her husband. In 1112 Fruela received a royal [...] "gift" [...] of estates at Ulvayo from the queen [...] "for loyal service", and he repaid her generosity with the gift of a horse worth a magnificent 5,000 solidi, equivalent at the time to 5,000 sheep. A horse worth so <b>much</b> <b>could</b> only be destined for the royal stables and royal rider, the queen herself, and it illustrates Fruela's enormous personal wealth. In 1115, when Urraca and Alfonso were fighting for control of the important monastic site of Sahagún, Fruela was acting as count in Ceia (Ceón) just to the north. On 9 December 1117 Fruela witnessed the second charter issued by Urraca's son Alfonso Raimúndez, whom the Galicians had made co-ruler against her will in 1111. Although the language {{and the name of the}} notary may suggest that it has been interpolated, the document, made at Sahagún, refers to Alfonso with the title imperator (emperor).|$|E
2500|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by MMA were allowed (not [...] "permitted", see below) by regulators in Canada (Transport Canada) and the United States (Federal Railroad Administration) to have Single Person Train Operation (SPTO, alternately OPTO) status (1 operator). The [...] "permit" [...] process, which requires public input, was not followed. The Canadian regulator and the MMA {{entered into a}} negotiation process at the culmination of which, sometime before {{the second week of}} July 2012, the government allowed MMA to reduce their manpower to SPTO. An average of 80 tankcars per train was carried on this route under the supervision of one person only. The Maine regulator had already allowed SPTO status before the first week of April 2012. The use of SPTO for MMA freight trains was a cost-cutting move for which the railway company has received much criticism. In May 2010, former MMA engineer Jarod Briggs of Millinocket, Maine explained to the Bangor Daily News that “so <b>much</b> <b>could</b> happen in a 12-hour shift on one of these trains, such as a washed-out track, downed trees or mechanical failure. What if the engineer onboard were to encounter a medical problem? Who is going to know about it? If there is a fire engine or an ambulance needing to get by a train or a crossing when that happens, it could take hours.” Briggs left MMA to work for another railway in 2007; while he described the lone crew member involved in the Lac-Mégantic derailment as [...] "a very good engineer, one of the better on the property", he has long expressed safety concerns about the company's overall train operations because “if you have two people watching you can catch a mistake.
