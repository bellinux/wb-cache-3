5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} that time on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E
5|$|Corals are <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> in {{the class}} Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They {{typically}} live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.|$|E

5|$|The Rosenstiel School's {{research}} invertebrate museum houses {{one of the}} world's {{most extensive}} collections of invertebrate tropical marine life with 400,000 specimens. It includes Atlantic tropical <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> The collection consists of 60,000 specimen lots, out of which 38,900 are cataloged and identified species.|$|E
5|$|Those {{critics who}} looked beyond the {{narrative}} portion {{were impressed by}} Ricketts' catalogue. Marine biologist Joel W. Hedgpeth, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, predicted it would be indispensable for students of the <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> of the Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns are {{long-lived}} birds, {{with many}} reaching fifteen to {{thirty years of}} age. They eat mainly fish and small <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend {{in the number of}} individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.|$|E
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> animals also harbor {{chemical}} defenses {{that protect}} them from predators, particularly tropical marine sponges, gorgonian corals, nudibranch molluscs, and tunicates.|$|R
50|$|Bougainvillia crassa is a <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate,</b> {{a species}} of hydroid in the {{suborder}} Anthomedusae. It was first described by Frassa in 1938.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|Plant life {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic peaty soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although {{there are more than}} 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 lichen species. Kelp thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b>|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E

5|$|The book's general {{method is}} to present {{a wide range of}} {{examples}} from across the animal kingdom of each type of coloration, including <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and fishes as well as terrestrial insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, but to some extent follows (and criticises) Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> which {{includes}} the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
50|$|Echinus gilchristi, {{common name}} Gilchrist's sea urchin, is {{a species of}} <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> in the Echinidae family that usually grows to a {{diameter}} of 10 cm.|$|R
50|$|Bohadschia argus, {{the leopard}} sea cucumber, is {{a species of}} <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> in the family Holothuriidae. It is the type species of the genus Bohadschia; Jaeger, 1833.|$|R
50|$|Antedon petasus is a <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate,</b> {{a species}} of crinoid or feather star in the family Antedonidae. It is found around the coasts of north west Europe.|$|R
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Many {{substances}} {{enter the}} sea {{as a result}} of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited through precipitation. Agricultural, industrial, and sewage outflows contribute heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, disinfectants, cleaning products, and other synthetic chemicals. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and zinc which may be accumulated by <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> They are then passed up the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} inhabits {{offshore}} environments, where it dives {{to the sea}} floor to forage. It preys mostly on <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> such as sea urchins, various molluscs and crustaceans, and some species of fish. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its use of rocks to dislodge prey and to open shells makes {{it one of the}} few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a keystone species, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to kelp forest ecosystems. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.|$|E
50|$|Sclerodactyla briareus, {{commonly}} known as the hairy sea cucumber, is a species of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> in the family Sclerodactylidae. It is found in shallow waters in the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|Sycon raphanus is {{a species}} of <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate,</b> a {{calcareous}} sponge belonging to the family Sycettidae. The name derives from the Greek, [...] "raphanus", meaning radish, and presumably refers to the sponge's shape.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was known}} to have diverse interests, {{including}} [...] "art and art history, archeology and anthropology, agronomy and horticulture, history of science, geography and cartography, cytology, and protozoology, as well as <b>marine</b> <b>invertebrate</b> zoology" ...|$|R
