Upon discovering the scandal, Singh was dismissed from office and later resigned his Congress membership. Gandhi was later personally implicated in the scandal when the investigation was continued by Narasimhan Ram and Chitra Subramaniam of The Hindu newspaper, damaging his image as an honest politician.

25|$|With {{construction}} costs often {{reaching into the}} <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars, the dachas of the country's elite bear no resemblance to the small dachas of the Soviet era. Comparable in size and décor to mansions and palaces, they become an elaborate display of social status, wealth and power. Most dachas of the elite are constructed with brick and concrete, unlike the middle-class dachas that are mostly constructed with wood. These new symbols of prosperity are designed by professional architects, usually in eclectic style—that older dachniks look down upon as reflecting the nouveau-riche tastes of their owners—and feature ostentatious items such as marble statues, fountains and exotic plants. Some have state-of-the-art sporting facilities such as an indoor swimming pool, multiple tennis courts and stables for race horses. A few privately owned estates even have small forests and lakes.|$|E
25|$|For well {{established}} games, total prize money can amount to <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars a year. As of 10 September 2016, Dota 2 has awarded approximately US$86 million {{in prize money}} within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million. League of Legends awarded approximately $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, {{but in addition to}} the prize money, Riot Games provides salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series. Nonetheless, there has been criticism to how these salaries are distributed, since most players earn a fairly low wage but a few top players have a significantly higher salary, skewing the average earning per player. In August 2017, The International 2017, Valve's premier Dota 2 tournament, was held and broke records by having the largest prize pool to date for an eSports tournament, amounting to over US$24 million.|$|E

25|$|While {{relief efforts}} have been {{concentrated}} elsewhere in India, {{the plight of the}} traditional region of Bengal (the flood plains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river delta and its tributaries) has been less reported. The Damodar and Kangsabati rivers overflowed their banks in late June, but levels finally began to fall as of 6 August. The Durgapur Barrage and Kangsabati Dam (near Bankura) may be partly responsible. In North Bengal, the floods have caused economic damage also estimated in the <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars (at least Rs. 500million); and in Siliguri, flash floods have wiped away at least 100 houses on a single night (28 July 2007). The state government of West Bengal has set up facilities to house 50,000 refugees. As the flood has affected parts of the East Midnapore (Purba Medinipur) district, long-standing political divisions and conflicts have flared {{in the wake of the}} floods.|$|E
500|$|The {{creators of}} the Myst {{franchise}} gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired Jack Wall [...] to develop a musical style different from earlier composer Robyn Miller but still recognizable as a Myst game. The project required <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars and {{more than two years}} to complete.|$|E
500|$|Cyan Worlds and Mattel (then {{the owner}} of the Myst and Riven franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} the sequel to several development companies; according to Game Developer, interested parties developed proposals including story concepts, analysis of the first two games, technology discussion, and technology demonstration. A core team from Presto Studios held discussions which analyzed Myst and Riven, then set out specific goals for the third game. According to Presto founder and producer Greg Uhler, these goals included visual variety in the Ages, a satisfying ending, and a way for players to gauge their progress during the game. The progress goal was very important for Uhler, who stated: [...] "Players who had failed to complete Myst or Riven did so because they were unsure of how much remained of the game and what their goals were." [...] Initially, Presto prepared three possible storylines for the game to follow; a meeting between Cyan, Presto, and Mattel yielded a completely different plot, which explored some of the loose ends hinted at in Myst. Presto spent <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars developing the game, using the studio's entire staff to complete the project. Development took two and a half years, of which nine months were spent on design and pre-production.|$|E

500|$|Spoilt Rotten {{was chosen}} by Jasper Fforde on the Penguin Books website {{as one of the}} books he would most like to get for Christmas. Fforde wrote that the book, [...] "makes uneasy reading for huggy liberals, and asks harsh {{questions}} over the bizarre sense of sentimentality that seems to have befuddled us Brits ever since <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> queued up to sign a book of condolences for a princess we didn't know. Dalrymple looks at the downside of an overblown sense of sentiment, which resulted this year with a murderous thug who saw himself as a victim and found 32,000 people agreeing with him, and even opening a tribute Facebook page in his posthumous honor". Spoilt Rotten also made Thomas Sowell's list of Christmas books for 2010. A positive review in The Scotsman stated, [...] "Dalrymple tackles sentimentality on every front. He is frequently witty, always punchy and sometimes rapier-like, as he analyses the 'bunk' of his opponents to within an inch of its cant". In the Daily Express, Neil Hamilton reviewed the book positively, writing, [...] "Theodore Dalrymple's excellent Spoilt Rotten offers some thought-provoking insights and explains how emotional constipation in our national psyche has become emotional diarrhoea".|$|E
500|$|Within Guatemala, Castillo Armas {{worried that}} he lacked popular support, and thus tried to {{eliminate}} all opposition. He promptly arrested several thousand opposition leaders, branding them communists, repealed the constitution of 1945, and granted himself virtually unbridled power. Concentration camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails overflowed. Acting {{on the advice of}} Allen Dulles, Castillo Armas detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created the National Committee of Defense Against Communism, with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. Many were imprisoned, executed, or [...] "disappeared", frequently without trial. He outlawed all labor unions, peasant organizations, and political parties, except for his own, the National Liberation Movement (Movimiento de Liberación Nacional, MLN), which was the ruling party until 1957, and remained influential for decades after. Castillo Armas' dependence on the officer corps and the mercenaries who had put him in power led to widespread corruption, and the Eisenhower administration was soon subsidizing the Guatemalan government with many <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> dollars. Castillo Armas also reversed the agrarian reforms of Árbenz, leading the U.S. embassy to comment that it was a [...] "long step backwards" [...] from the previous policy. The UFC did not profit from the coup; although it regained most of its privileges, its profits continued to decline, and it was eventually merged with another company to save itself from bankruptcy. Despite the influence which some of the local Catholic Church leaders had in the coup, anti-Catholic restrictions which had been enforced under previous governments in Guatemala would resume by the 1960s, as many anti-communist governments felt the Church had too much sympathy towards socialist parties.|$|E
