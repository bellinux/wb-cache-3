40|$|Both <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and {{sideslip}} angle are important states for vehicle handling and stability control. Instead of directly measuring these angles, indirect estimation {{of these states}} will provide a cost-effective way {{for the implementation of}} vehicle control systems. In the past, model-based methods have been proposed to estimate the {{sideslip angle}} with the measured <b>steering</b> <b>angle.</b> In this paper, a novel observer design is presented for simultaneous estimation of vehicle <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and sideslip angle so that the estimation of sideslip angle does not require the measurement of <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and the estimate of <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> can also be used for other purposes, such as automatic steering control, steering system fault diagnosis, and driving performance monitoring. To enable this observer design, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy modeling technique is applied to represent the vehicle lateral dynamics model with nonlinear Dugoff tyre model and time-varying vehicle speed. A T-S observer is then designed to simultaneously estimate the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and sideslip angle with the measurements of yaw rate and vehicle speed, and is designed to be robust against parameter uncertainties and unknown inputs. The conditions for designing such an observer are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Experimental results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the designed observer can effectively estimate <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and sideslip angle despite the variation of vehicle longitudinal speed...|$|R

Public datasets can possibly be used to build networks capable of predicting <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> and detect objects for self-driving vehicles. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether <b>steering</b> <b>angles</b> and object bounding boxes can be predicted from a single image input. A novel architecture combining both models into a <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> predictor with incorporated object detection is also explored. An object detection model was created based on modern bounding box regression networks. It was trained to detect cars, trucks, traffic lights, pedestrians, bikers, and traffic signs with data from the German Traffic Sign Detection Challenge and Udacity. A <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> prediction network, which was trained using driving data provided by Udacity, was created. Both models shared pre-trained layers from VGG 16 for feature extraction. The models were also combined into a single model that aimed to make the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> predictor more robust by providing explicit object detections as additional inputs. The detector achieved a mean average precision of 44. 02 on the validation dataset, which was a combination of images from both the German Traffic Sign Detection Challenge and Udacity datasets. Training the detector on multiple datasets with similar input data, but different annotations reduced the models performance. The <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> predictor achieved a root mean squared error of 0. 0645. By incorporating object detection into the predictor model, the error rose to 0. 0653.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the steering system implemented on the tractor IceMaker I. No direct position feedback {{is used for the}} <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> of the front wheels. Instead, the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> is estimated by a motion model of the vehicle using gyro and odometer information. This estimated angle is used as feedback to a regulator that controls the steering system. The operator sets the requested <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> and the regulator controls the hydraulic steering system to maintain the requested <b>steering</b> <b>angle.</b> Within certain limits, the tractor can be expected to behave according to the motion model irrespective of the surface conditions. The tractor can be teleoperated from a remote computer through a wireless network, WLAN. To enable teleoperation, the tractor has been equipped with a computer, some sensors, and other necessary equipment. During teleoperation, the operator controls the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> of the front wheels and the speed of the tractor using a joystick. The steering system has been tested both during winter conditions on a low friction surface and also on dry asphalt. The results indicates good performance when teleoperating the tractor.

40|$|The task of {{steering}} {{a vehicle}} {{is an exercise}} which is usually considered hierarchically {{in terms of the}} two subtasks path planning and path following. With the driver in the loop some essential man dependent tasks such as sensing, information processing, and motor function affect the steering quality. In case of sim-ulations, the same applies correspondingly for driver models. In this paper the aim is to investigate vehicle steering dynamics independent of any driver-related properties. The path is therefore assumed given by a reference trajectory together with a speed profile. The <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> which is necessary for exact or at least approximate path following is sought after. This al-lows for plausible comparative assessment of different vehicle’s steering dynamics in terms of the demanded <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> for a certain maneuver. On the other hand, this approach requires dynamic inversion of ve-hicle steering dynamics which represents the main fo-cus of this paper. Two vehicle models, the common single track model and a detailed model from the Mod-elica vehicle dynamics library are investigated. Since exact inversion of the detailed vehicle model turns out not to be feasible, approximate inversion is accom-plished by means of a novel control structure called inverse disturbance observer. Simulations of a double lane change maneuver are conducted for illustration. Finally, wavelet power spectra of the <b>steering</b> <b>angle</b> signal are used for <b>steering</b> <b>effort</b> assessment. ...|$|R
