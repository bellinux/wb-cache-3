50|$|The complex {{essential}} oil is distilled from {{the leaves and}} used for flavouring, perfumery and aromatherapy. It has a fruity-lemon fragrance with rosemary-like back tones. E. staigeriana fresh weight leaves yield 2.9-3.4% {{essential oil}}. It contains a range of essential oil components, including geranial, <b>methyl</b> <b>geranate,</b> geranyl acetate, limonene, phellandrene, neral, terpinolene and geraniol.|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils of branches and leaves of Endlicheria citiodora {{were obtained by}} hydrodistillation and analysed using GC-FID, GC-MS and both NMR 13 C and ¹H, resulting {{in the identification of}} <b>methyl</b> <b>geranate</b> as major constituent (93 %) in both oils. Cytotoxicity, tyrosinase-inhibition and antioxidant activities were studied and characterized. High antioxidant potential (15. 52 and 13. 53 µg/mL), low cytotoxicity and tyrosinase inhibition (53. 85 %) were observed. This is the first paper reporting the biological activities and composition of the {{essential oils}} of this species...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{stability}} during storage of several compounds previously described for distinguishing hop varieties. Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and six bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Target, and Challenger), stored at different temperatures, were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. Only compounds remaining stable through aging were kept to build an identification flowchart. Although very typical of fresh aromatic hops, farnesene proved much too unstable to be selected for distinguishing aged samples. 3 -Methylbutylisobutyrate, which authenticates all fresh European bitter hops, is also partially destroyed upon storage. On the other hand, bergamotene, alpha- and beta -selinene, <b>methyl</b> <b>geranate,</b> humulene epoxide II, alpha -amorphene, 2 -undecanone, and an unknown compound can be used to distinguish all cultivars whatever the storage temperature. Both the ratios of humulene to humulene + humulene epoxides (I, II, and III) and of bergamotene to farnesene proved good indicators of the freshness status of hop samples...|$|E
40|$|Tomahawk hop (Humulus lupulus) is a {{recently}} developed Super Alpha cultivar (14 - 18 % α-acids w/w), already widely used by brewers to impart bitterness and a citrus-like aroma to beer. By comparison with two bitter varieties (Nelson Sauvin and Nugget) and two aromatic ones (Cascade and Saaz), the Tomahawk cultivar showed a very particular terpenoid profile, rich in both α- and β-selinenes (> 600 mg/kg IST equiv in total), <b>methyl</b> <b>geranate</b> (> 40 mg/kg IST equiv), and geraniol (> 200 mg/kg). Tomahawk also proved {{to contain a}} wide variety of odorant polyfunctional thiols. The major β-sulfanyl acetate, 3 -sulfanyl- 2 -ethylpropyl acetate, newly identified here, was found at similar levels in the famous Sauvignon-like Nelson Sauvin and Tomahawk varieties (15 - 44 μg/kg IST equiv). On the other hand, lower levels of total β-sulfanyl alcohols were measured in Tomahawk, although 3 -sulfanylhexan- 1 -ol was found at a similar level and the 3 -sulfanyl- 4 -methylpentan- 1 -ol previously claimed to be specific to the Nelson Sauvin variety was also evidenced in the Super Alpha cultivar (9 - 13 μg/kg IST equiv). As revealed by boiling and fermentation, Tomahawk hop also contains very interesting bound polyfunctional thiols that should be investigated for better use by brewers...|$|E
40|$|Following recent NSW Government restructuring, the Department of Agriculture {{now exists}} in a {{composite}} form along with Forestry, Fisheries and Minerals in the new NSW Department of Primary Industries. This paper outlines some {{of the highlights of}} secondary metabolite R&D accomplished in the 25 years since the essential oil research unit was transferred from the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Sydney to NSW AgricultureÃ¢Â€Â™s Wollongbar Agricultural Institute on the NSW north coast. The essential oil survey was continued, typing the Australian flora as a suitable source of isolates such as myrtenal (Astartea), myrtenol (Agonis), methyl chavicol (Ochrosperma), ÃŽÂ±-phellandren- 8 -ol (Prostanthera), methyl myrtenate (Darwinia), <b>methyl</b> <b>geranate</b> (Darwinia), kessane (Acacia), cis-dihydroagarofuran (Prosthanthera), protoanemonin (Clematis), isoamyl isovalerate (Micromyrtus), methyl cinnamate (Eucalyptus) and bornyl acetate (Boronia). Many of these components are used, or have potential use in the fragrance, flavour, medicinal plant or insect attraction fields. Two weeds toxic to livestock in the Central West of the State are also harvested commercially as medicinal plants. Measurement of hypericin concentrations in the various plant parts of St JohnÃ¢Â€Â™s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) over two seasons has shown that the weed can be effectively managed by grazing sheep during the winter months when toxin levels are low. Syntheses of ÃŽÂ²-carbolines tribulusterine and perlolyrine have shown that the former alkaloid was misidentified in the literature and hence not the toxic principle responsible for Tribulus staggers in sheep. Poor quality (high 1, 8 -cineole Ã¢Â€Â“ low terpinen- 4 -ol) oil bearing tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) plantations have been established to the detriment of many a tea tree farmer. Analytical methods developed to check leaf quality at an early age indicated precursor sabinene constituents that convert to the active terpinen- 4 -ol both as the leaf matures or as the precursors are distilled for oil production. Tea treeÃ¢Â€Â™s major insect pest, pyrgo beetle (Paropsisterna tigrina), was seen to selectively metabolize only 1, 8 -cineole from itÃ¢Â€Â™s monoterpenoid-rich diet. Characterization of these and other metabolites from myrtaceous herbivores showed a species specific production of predominately ring hydroxylated products, some of which were attractive when bioassayed against adult beetles...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{photochemistry}} of some analogs {{of insect}} growth regulators (IGR's) was studied. <b>Methyl</b> <b>geranate,</b> TY, was synthesized and {{the mechanisms of}} its photochemical reaction pathways were studied {{by a variety of}} techniques. Direct irradiation of 71 in ether leads to the formation of five new products: 98, the product of a [1, 3] sigmatropic shift; 72, a bicyclo[2. 1. 1]hexane derivative; 73, a cylclopentane derivative; 100, the product of in-chain deconjugation to the Z isomer; and 97, the product of isomerization about the C- 2 bond. Irradiation in the presence of propiophenone as a triplet sensitizer lead to the formation of only 72, 73 and 97, identifying them as arising from the triplet excited state. Irradiation of 71 in ether with varying amounts of base lead to the formation of (in addition to products already mentioned) 99 and 100, the other two possible deconjugation products. Examination of Scheme 29 leads to the derivation of the kinetic rate expressions in Scheme 31, and plotting the ratios of 99 / 73, 100 / 73 and 101 / 73 yields values for the relative rate of [1, 5] sigmatropic shift of hydrogen from a photodienol species (119, 121, 123) to regenerate starting esters (71, 97) rather than going on to deconjugation products (99, 100, 101). It was found that the relative rates of sigmatropic shift for 119 and 123 were nearly identical but 121 was about 75 times slower. This decrease in the relative rate for 121 is ascribed to the extra steric repulsion in 121, causing it to adopt the unreactive s-trans conformation and thus slowing the reaction. Insect juvenile hormone, 74, was synthesized and irradiated in ether and was found to undergo photochemical processes similar to that of 71. The primary photoprocess is isomerizatrion about the C- 2 and C- 6 double bonds. Isomerization about the C- 6 bond was unexpected and indicated the intermediacy of an exciplex. To study the role of exciplexes in the E/Z isomerizartion of isolated double bonds in the juvenile hormone, 74, the unsymmetrically terminated analog 92 and the dihydro analog 93 were synthesized. Irradiation of 92 and 93 in solvents of varying polarity (ET) lead to an increase of the quantum yield of E/Z isomerization for both 92 and 93, indicating the intermediacy of an intermolecular exciplex. to study the role of intramolecular exciplexes 92 and 93 were irradiated in ether at increasing dilution (0. 1 M - 0. 0008 M). It was found that the intermolecular exciplex is the major contributor in the concentration range studied without any evidence for an intramolecular exciplex...|$|E
