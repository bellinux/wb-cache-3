5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E

25|$|Unlike women, men overall have {{a higher}} {{expectation}} for sexual goals. They are typically {{more concerned with the}} sexual aspect of a woman and a relationship. Studies done by Antonia Abbey of the Liberal Arts and Science department at Wayne State University and other colleagues indicate that <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> perceive people and relationships in more of a sexualized manner than women do.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} paper by Bickel et al. concluded that women <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> apply to competitive departments with {{low rates of}} admission even among qualified applicants (such as in the English Department), whereas <b>men</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> apply to less-competitive departments with high rates of admission among the qualified applicants (such as in engineering and chemistry).|$|R
25|$|Salary {{disparities between}} men and women may {{partially}} be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women tend to view salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall level of confidence in a negotiation may also be a determinant of why <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity {{between men and}} women that contributes to the overall wage gap observed in many nations.|$|E
25|$|Summarizing the {{findings}} from these studies, heterosexual men {{seem to be more}} distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men (Leeker, 2014). These latter three groups seem more responsible for this difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men (Leeker, 2014). However, as previously noted, within-sex analyses reveal that heterosexual <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity (Vitelli, 2014).|$|E
25|$|Human capital {{explanations}} also posit that <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> rise {{to higher}} positions than women {{because of a}} disparity in work experience between the genders. Indeed, the gap between men and women's tenure rises with age, and female college graduates {{are more likely than}} males to interrupt their careers to raise children. Such choices may also be attributed to the gendered division of labor which holds women primarily responsible for domestic duties.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{males have}} greater {{strength}} in the power than women, but multiple female channelers can combine their strength by forming 'circles', with one channeler controlling and directing the weaves. Circles consisting of only females are limited to thirteen members, while inclusion of male channelers allows the circle to grow to up to seventy-two members. Circles must always hold {{at least one more}} female than male, with a minimum of 1 man for every 12 women. As <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be much stronger in the power than women, the strongest circles consist of a near equal balance between the genders.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect is}} the lack of {{concordance}} between subjective sexual arousal and genital arousal. Research by Meredith L. Chivers and J. Michael Bailey indicates that <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> show category-specific arousal; that is, they are sexually aroused by their preferred gender. However, women show category non-specificity: Their genitals show arousal to both preferred and non-preferred genders. Even though women reported being subjectively aroused to, for example, a man and woman engaging in sexual activity, their genitals also show sexual arousal to two men engaging in sexual activity, two women doing so, and even non-human animals having sex.|$|E
25|$|Emigration {{policies}} tend {{to differ}} within countries depending on if the occupation is mainly dominated by men or women. Occupations dominated by <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{be driven by}} economic incentives whereas emigration policies aimed at women traditional tend to be value driven, adhering to traditional family roles that favors men's wage work. As women regularly are seen as symbols of national pride and dignity governments {{tend to have more}} protective policies in sectors dominated by women. These policies risk to increase gender inequality in the Philippines and thereby this public policy work against women joining the workforce.|$|E

25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no sex differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex differences were found, one qualitative difference was found between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{women as}} a whole {{tend to be less}} {{assertive}} and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys {{are more likely to be}} pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.|$|E
25|$|Perceptions of wage {{entitlement}} differ {{between women}} and men such that men are more likely to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> initiate negotiations more than women.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} a slight {{discrepancy}} in males' and females' use of the self-serving bias. In self-report surveys investigating partner interactions of romantic couples, <b>men</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> attribute negative interactions to their partners more than women did. This is evidence that men may exhibit the self-serving bias more than women, although {{the study did not}} look at positive interaction attributions.|$|R
40|$|The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development is a {{prospective}} longitudinal survey of 411 South London males from age 8 to age 48. In this survey, it was previously {{found that men}} who marry relatively early reduce their offending behaviour after marriage, unlike those who marry relatively late. Further analyses confirmed that the original findings were not caused by regression to the mean. Comparisons between those who married at age 25 or older and those who married at age 18 – 24 on risk factors at age 8 – 32 suggest that the later-married <b>men</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be more nervous, {{more likely to have}} experienced a broken home, to be drug users and binge-drinkers, to maintain aggressive atti-tudes from age 18 to 32, and to continue to go out with their male friends after marriage.

25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find {{significant}} effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. <b>Men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think {{that this can be}} because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E
500|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} the psychoanalyst Arno Karlen in the Journal of Sex Research, and the psychoanalyst Charles W.

Karlen wrote that Tripp made numerous unjustified claims, {{such as that}} homosexual <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have a larger than average penis size {{and that there are}} no confirmed cases of homosexuals being converted to heterosexuality through therapy. He accused Tripp of trying to normalize or exalt homosexuality, and denigrate heterosexuality and women, and those who endorsed his work of politicizing sex research. Socarides criticized Tripp for arguing that homosexuality is not pathological and presenting it as preferable to heterosexuality, for incorrectly claiming that homosexual <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> undergo puberty early and to have a larger than average penis size, and for making [...] "slurs" [...] against therapists who attempted to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, and for encouraging homosexuals not to undergo treatment.|$|E

'Relative Size: According to Goffman, {{relative}} size can {{be defined}} as “one way in which social weight–power, authority, rank, office, renown- is echoed expressively in social situations through relative size, especially height”. With relative size, women are generally shown smaller or lower than men in terms of girth and height. Although <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be biologically taller or larger than females, Goffman suggests that this size difference is manipulated in man-made advertisements to convey difference in status or power in certain social situations. The concept that relative size conveys social status remains relevant even when women are portrayed as the taller or larger individual on screen or in print. Goffman states that on the few occasions when women are pictured taller than men, the men seem almost always to be subordinated in social class status and/or depicted as inferior.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> believe in the principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually {{live up to that}} belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment. The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.|$|E
500|$|Early puberty {{and early}} {{masturbation}} are seen by Tripp as {{important factors in}} the development of male homosexuality, albeit not direct causes. He maintains that homosexual <b>men</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> start masturbating earlier than heterosexual men, continue to masturbate more extensively {{for the rest of their}} lives, and also tend to have a larger than average penis size. Tripp sees early sexual experiences with persons of the same sex as having only a limited role {{in the development of}} male homosexuality. While he observes that homosexual men vary in their sexual attitudes, Tripp writes that, [...] "when two men are excited and unrestrained in their sexual interaction, the fire that is fed from both sides often does whip up levels of eroticism that are rarely reached elsewhere." [...] Tripp considers promiscuity [...] "relatively prevalent" [...] among homosexual men as a group, though he noted that not all homosexual men are promiscuous. Tripp maintains that heterosexual men would be as promiscuous as homosexual men if they had the same level of opportunity. He criticizes psychotherapeutic attempts to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality, writing that Kinsey and his associates found no evidence of their effectiveness. Tripp writes that a [...] "New York psychiatrist who for a number of years has headed a large psychoanalytic research program on homosexuality" [...] admitted to Pomeroy that he knew of only one patient he had helped to become heterosexual but was on such poor terms with him that he did not feel free to contact him so that he could verify his claim to have changed his sexual orientation.|$|E
