40|$|For {{broadband}} active {{noise control}} applications with rapidly changing transfer paths, it is desirable to find algorithms with rapid convergence, fast tracking performance, and low computational cost. Recently, a numerically stable algorithm has been presented: a convex mixing fast-array RLS filter. The algorithm exhibits the fast convergence, tracking properties and the linear calculation complexity of the fast-array RLS sliding window filter with numerical stability. The algorithm assumes that deviations of the secondary path from the nominal value are small. If these deviations become significant then {{the model of the}} secondary path has to be updated in accordance with the real physical situation.

40|$|International audienceIncorporating prior {{knowledge}} about the sources and/or the mixture {{is a way to}} improve under-determined audio source separation performance. A great number of informed source separation techniques concentrate on taking priors on the sources into account, but fewer works have focused on constraining the mixing model. In this paper we address the problem of under-determined multichannel audio source separation in reverberant conditions. We target a semi-informed scenario where some room parameters are known. Two probabilistic priors on the frequency response of the <b>mixing</b> <b>filters</b> are proposed. Early reverberation is characterized by an autoregressive model while according to statistical room acoustics results, late reverberation is represented by an autoregressive moving average model. Both reverberation models are defined in the frequency domain. They aim to transcribe the temporal characteristics of the <b>mixing</b> <b>filters</b> into frequency-domain correlations.

30|$|There exist several {{classes of}} {{algorithms}} giving {{a solution for}} the permutation problem. Approaches presented in [3 – 6] try to find permutations by considering the cross statistics (such as cross correlation or cross cumulants etc.) of the spectral envelopes of adjacent frequency bins. In [7] algorithms were proposed, that {{make use of the}} spectral distance between neighboring bins and try to make the impulse response of the mixing filters short, which corresponds to smooth transfer functions of the mixing system in the frequency domain. The algorithm proposed by Kamata et al. [8] solves the problem using the continuity in power between adjacent frequency components of the same source. A similar method was presented by Pham et al. [9]. Baumann et al. [10] proposed a solution by comparing the directivity patterns resulting from the estimated demixing matrix in each frequency bin. Similar algorithms were presented in [11 – 13]. In [14] it was suggested to use the direction of arrival (DOA) of source signals, determined from the estimated mixing matrices, for the problem solution. The approach in [15] is to exploit the continuity of the frequency response of the <b>mixing</b> <b>filter.</b> A similar approach was presented in [16] using the minimum of the L 1 -norm of the resulting <b>mixing</b> <b>filter</b> and in [17] using the minimum distance between the adjacent filter coefficients. In [18] the authors suggest to use the cosine between the demixing coefficients of different frequencies as a cost function for the problem solution. Sawada et al. [19] proposed an approach based on basis vector clustering of the normalized estimated mixing matrices. In [20] a hybrid approach combines spectral continuity, temporal envelope and beamforming alignment with a psychoacoustic post-filter, and in [21] the permutation problem was solved using a maximum-likelihood-ratio between the adjacent frequency bins.|$|E

The corresponding approximation operators yield an exponentially decreasing rate of approximation in the vicinity of points of analyticity and a near best approximation on the whole interval. Unlike previously known results on {{the construction of}} localized polynomial kernels, we suggest a very simple idea to obtain exponentially localized kernels based on a general system of orthogonal polynomials, for which the Cesàro means of some order are uniformly bounded.

Air filters consisting of nanofibers have attracted great interests since {{they may have a}} low pressure drop because of slip flow effect and high collection efficiency due to interception. Although various nanofiber filters are available on the market, their collection performance is not as high as expected by the conventional filtration theory because non-uniform packing of fibers plays a significant role. In the present work, the collection performance of nanofiber (780 nm) and microfiber (11. 2 µm) <b>mixed</b> <b>filters</b> with various <b>mixing</b> fractions was studied in order to maximize the quality factor of filter, qF, as a function of mixing fraction of nanofibers.

Identification results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is applicable to analyze the dynamic displacement monitoring data of real bridge structures under ambient excitation and could identify the first five orders of the inherent frequencies of the structural system accurately. The identification error of the inherent frequency was smaller than 6 %, indicating the high identification accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
