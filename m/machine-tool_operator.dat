50|$|Before the 1939 {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Stefania Podgórska (born 1925 in Lipa) {{worked in a}} grocery store owned by the Diamants, a Jewish family. Her father had died in 1938 after an illness. Soon after the arrival of the Nazis, her mother and brother were taken to Germany for forced labor, while the Diamants were forced into a ghetto. The two Podgórski sisters lived in Przemyśl alone in an apartment rented by Stefania, who was 16 at that time. She got a job in town as a <b>machine-tool</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mikoyan {{was born}} in Sanahin, Armenia on 5 August 1905. His older brother, Anastas Mikoyan, would become a senior Soviet politician. He {{completed}} his basic education and {{took a job as}} a <b>machine-tool</b> <b>operator</b> in Rostov, then worked in the [...] "Dynamo" [...] factory in Moscow before being conscripted into the military. After military service he joined the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy, where he created his first plane, graduating in 1936. He worked with Polikarpov before being named head of a new aircraft design bureau in Moscow in December 1939. Together with Mikhail Gurevich, Mikoyan formed the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau, producing a series of fighter aircraft. In March 1942, the bureau was renamed OKB MiG (Osoboye Konstruktorskoye Büro), ANPK MiG (Aviatsionnyy nauchno-proizvodstvennyy kompleks) and OKO MiG. The MiG-1 proved to be a poor start, the MiG-3 went into production but only occasionally could it fight in its intended high-level interceptor role. Further MiG-5, MiG-7 and MiG-8 Utka did not progress beyond research prototypes.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{despite the}} {{large volume of}} {{worldwide}} academic research on various aspects of metal cutting the control of workpiece precision still relies on <b>machine-tool</b> <b>operator's</b> experience and trial and error runs. In order {{to increase the efficiency}} of machining systems, many empirical models based on artificial intelligent (AI) approaches have been proposed in the past, where important process improvements were reported. This paper overviews the AI approaches applied in machining operations to predict part accuracy in terms of dimensional deviations and surface roughness. Successful techniques applied in this field such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference systems and Bayesian networks are briefly reviewed and compared to facilitate its use. For each AI approach, the most relevant research works are described and based on those works some guidelines are proposed for its implementation. In addition, advantages and drawbacks of each approach are summarised and a generic guideline for AI approaches selection is proposed...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association between}} occupational factors and risk of bone sarcoma, a rare tumor with a largely unknown aetiology. A multicentric case-control {{study was conducted in}} 7 European countries in 1995 - 97. Ninety-six cases aged 35 - 69 years with a centrally reviewed diagnosis of bone sarcoma (68 chondrosarcomas and 28 osteosarcomas) were compared to 2, 632 population (68 %) or colon cancer (32 %) controls. Subjects were interviewed to obtain information on occupational, medical and reproductive history, smoking and alcohol consumption and selected exposures including use of pesticides. Response proportions were 90 % among cases and 66 % among controls. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for selected categories of job titles and branches of industry and for use of pesticides. We found an increased OR for bone sarcoma among blacksmiths, toolmakers, <b>machine-tool</b> <b>operators</b> (OR = 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 4. 26), woodworkers (OR = 2. 68, 95 % CI 1. 36 - 5. 29) and construction workers (OR = 1. 62, 95 % CI 0. 92 - 2. 87). Ever users of pesticide had an OR of 2. 33 (95 % CI 1. 31 - 4. 13), with similar risks for exposure to insecticides and exposure to herbicides. Neither duration of employment in any of the analyzed occupational categories nor duration of use of pesticides showed an increasing trend in the risk of bone sarcoma. ORs of bone sarcoma were 1. 03 (95 % CI 0. 23 - 4. 57), 3. 13 (95 % CI 1. 26 - 7. 76) and 1. 44 (95 % CI 0. 43 - 4. 85) for the first, second and third fertile of days of use of pesticides. Our study suggests that novel and previously reported (woodworking) occupational factors {{play a role in the}} aetiology of bone sarcomas. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Sarcomas {{account for}} over 20 % of all {{pediatric}} solid malignant cancers {{and less than}} 1 % of all adult solid malignant cancers. The vast majority of diagnosed sarcomas will be soft tissue sarcomas, while malignant bone tumors make up just over 10 % of sarcomas. The risks for sarcoma are not well-understood. We evaluated the existing literature on the epidemiology and etiology of sarcoma. Risks for sarcoma development {{can be divided into}} environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, and an interaction between the two. HIV-positive individuals are at an increased risk for Kaposi’s sarcoma, even though HHV 8 is the causative virus. Radiation exposure from radiotherapy has been strongly associated with secondary sarcoma development in certain cancer patients. In fact, the risk of malignant bone tumors increases as the cumulative dose of radiation to the bone increases (p for trend < 0. 001). A recent meta-analysis reported that children with a history of hernias have a greater risk of developing Ewing’s sarcoma (adjusted OR 3. 2, 95 % CI 1. 9, 5. 7). Bone development during pubertal growth spurts has been associated with osteosarcoma development. Occupational factors such as job type, industry, and exposures to chemicals such as herbicides and chlorophenols have been suggested as risk factors for sarcomas. A case-control study found a significant increase in soft tissue sarcoma risk among gardeners (adjusted OR 4. 1, 95 % CI 1. 00, 14. 00), but not among those strictly involved in farming. A European-based study reported an increased risk in bone tumors among blacksmiths, toolmakers, or <b>machine-tool</b> <b>operators</b> (adjusted OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 08, 4. 26). Maternal and paternal characteristics such as occupation, age, smoking status, and health conditions experienced during pregnancy also have been suggested as sarcoma risk factors and would be important to assess in future studies. The limited studies we identified demonstrate significant relationships with sarcoma risk, but many of these results now require further validation on larger populations. Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} biologic mechanisms behind each epidemiologic association assessed in the literature. Future molecular epidemiology studies may increase our understanding of the genetic versus environmental contributions to tumorigenesis in this often deadly cancer in children and adults. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, the United States, Canada, and Western Europe have been moving toward service and {{information}} economies and away from an agricultural and manufacturing economies (Euromonitor, 1990; Machlup, 1962; Rubin and Huber, 1986; Porat, 1977). The fraction of workers using information to produce economic value has been rising, and the fraction working with their hands in factories or on farms has been declining. In the United States, the percentage of jobs in manufacturing fell from 27 percent in 1920 to 17 percent in 1990. In the European Community, the value-added by manufacturing grew at an average annual rate of 6. 2 percent from 1960 to 1970, but this growth rate was only 0. 7 percent from 1980 to 1985. Among white-collar workers, the fastest growing occupations have been clerical, professional, and technical workers, and managers and administrators (Wolff and Baumol, 1987). Six factors have been involved in this shift. First, third-world and developing societies have become centers of manufacturing, while the so-called advanced societies have shifted toward services. In Europe, the telecommunications sector has been growing about 9 to 11 percent annually, and the software and computing services sector has been growing 15 to 20 percent annually (Sema Group, 1991). Second, knowledge-intense and information-intense products and services have grown rapidly, and the production of traditional products has also been using knowledge more intensively. Third, business has invested heavily in equipment to support information work. In the United States, information-related equipment accounted for 20 percent of capital investment in 1979; this figure had become 40 percent of capital investment by 1986. Fourth, knowledge workers and information workers have replaced manual production workers within the manufacturing sectors. <b>Machine-tool</b> <b>operators,</b> for instance, have often been replaced by technicians who monitor computer-controlled machine tools. Fifth, workers have increased education and information-processing skills (Howell and Wolff 1991). Sixth, new kinds of knowledge-intense and information-intense organizations have emerged that are devoted entirely to the production, processing, and distribution of information. These new kinds of organizations employ millions of people (Office of Technology Assessment, 1988). As early as 1976, the value of information-sector products and services had already exceeded that of the manufacturing sector in the U. S. By 1990, the information sector (including services) accounted for $ 3 out of every $ 4 of GNP, and over half of the U. S. workers were doing some type of information work (Howell and Wolff, 1993; Roach, 1988). The U. S., however, represents an extreme case. For instance, in the software and computing services sector, the United States has about 55 percent of the world market, the European Community has about 25 percent, and Japan has about 8 percent (Sema Group, 199 1). This article surveys information work, information workers, and the computer systems that support such work. It then examines the organizations that are most dependent on knowledge and information work [...] knowledge-intensive firms. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reliability-based analysis for calculating critical tool life in machining processes. It {{is possible to}} determine the running time for each tool {{involved in the process}} by obtaining the operations sequence for the machining procedure. Usually, the reliability of an operation depends on three independent factors: <b>operator,</b> <b>machine-tool</b> and cutting tool. The reliability of a part manufacturing process is mainly determined by the cutting time for each job and by the sequence of operations, defined by the series configuration. An algorithm is presented to define when the cutting tool must be changed. The proposed algorithm is used to evaluate the reliability of a manufacturing process composed of turning and drilling operations. The reliability of the turning operation is modeled based on data presented in the literature, and from experimental results, a statistical distribution of drilling tool wear was defined, and the reliability of the drilling process was modeled.
