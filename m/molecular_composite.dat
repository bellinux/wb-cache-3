40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} in the spectrum of two-dimensional (2 D) materials has driven the efforts {{of research on the}} fabrication of 2 D composites and heterostructures. Highly ordered structure of 2 D materials provides an excellent platform for controlling the ultimate structure and properties of the composite material with precision. However, limited control over the structure of the adherent material and its interactions with highly ordered 2 D materials results in defective composites with inferior performance. Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis, integration, and characterization of hybrid 2 D material systems consisting of tandem repeat (TR) proteins inspired by squid ring teeth and graphene oxide (GO). The TR protein layer acts as a unique programmable molecular spacer between GO layers. As an application, we further demonstrate thermal actuation using bimorph <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> films. Bimorph actuators made of <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> films (GO/TR) can lead to energy efficiencies 18 times higher than regular bimorph actuators consisting of a GO layer and a TR protein layer (i. e., conventional bulk composite of GO and TR). Additionally, <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> bimorph actuators can reach curvature values as high as 1. 2 cm- 1 by using TR proteins with higher molecular weight, which is 3 times higher than conventional GO and TR composites.

Here we report complementary spectroscopic, electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical investigations {{of both the}} functionalized poly(thiophene) and its composite with the nanocrystals, the latter being fabricated using the layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. UV-Vis-NIR and Raman spectroelectrochemical investigations unequivocally show that {{the onset of the}} first anodic peak in the cyclic voltammogram of the copolymer {{can be attributed to the}} oxidation of the pi-conjugated backbone in the polymer chains. For this reason, it is possible to determine the width and the position of its band gap (corresponding to the pi-pi* transition) by UV-Vis spectroscopy combined with cyclic voltammetry. These studies show that the polymer exhibits a slightly larger band gap with the HOMO level insignificantly lower in energy (by 0. 03 eV) as compared to the case of regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) of comparable degree of polymerization. Hydrogen bond interactions of the polymer with CdSe(MHT) in the <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> result in a hypsochromic shift of the band corresponding to the pi-pi* transition from 504 nm to 488 nm. This can be taken as a spectroscopic manifestation of the conformational changes induced by shortening of the conjugation length. The observed spectral modifications are consistent with electrochemically determined lowering of the polymer HOMO level (from - 4. 91 eV in the pure polymer to - 4. 99 eV in the composite). Cyclic voltammetry studies supported by spectroelectrochemistry also show that the redox stability of CdSe(MHT) in the <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> with P 3 HT-co-P 3 (ODAP) HT is lower than that determined for stearate-capped nanocrystals.

40|$|Giant bilayer vesicles were reconstituted {{from several}} lipids and lipid/cholesterol (CHOL) mixtures: stearolyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (SOPC), bovine {{sphingomyelin}} (BSM), diarachidonylphosphatidylcholine (DAPC), SOPC/CHOL, BSM/CHOL, DAPC/CHOL, and extracted {{red blood cell}} (RBC) lipids with native cholesterol. Single-walled vesicles were manipulated by micropipette suction and several membrane material properties were determined. The properties measured were the elastic area compressibility modulus K, the critical areal strain alpha c, and the tensile strength tau lys, from which the failure energy or membrane toughness Tf was calculated. The elastic area expansion moduli for these lipid and lipid/cholesterol bilayers ranged from 57 dyn/cm for DAPC to 1, 734 dyn/cm for BSM/CHOL. The SOPC/CHOL series and RBC lipids had intermediate values. The {{results indicated that the}} presence of cholesterol is the single most influential factor in increasing bilayer cohesion, but only for lipids where both chains are saturated, or mono- or diunsaturated. Multiple unsaturation in both lipid chains inhibits the condensing effect of cholesterol in bilayers. The SOPC/CHOL system was studied in more detail. The area expansion modulus showed a nonlinear increase with increasing cholesterol concentration up to a constant plateau, indicating a saturation limit for cholesterol in the bilayer phase of approximately 55 mol% CHOL. The membrane compressibility was modeled by a property-averaging composite theory involving two bilayer components, namely, uncomplexed lipid and a lipid/cholesterol complex of stoichiometry 1 / 1. 22. The area expansion modulus of this <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> membrane was evaluated by a combination of the expansion moduli of each component scaled by their area fractions in the bilayer.

40|$|Layer-by-Layer (LbL) {{assembly}} of polyelectrolytes {{is a widely}} investigated approach for building substrate-supported macromolecular architectures. This dissertation examines several aspects of multilayered structure deposition via polycation/polyanion directed-assembly. Utilizing novel techniques such as polyelectrolyte spin-assembly (PSA), sequential adsorption within microfluidic channels, and hydrogel contact deposition, we have elaborated localized multilayer growth, which can eventually be an invaluable asset to numerous technological fields including microelectronics, biosensors, power generation, and chemical analysis. ^ Employing PSA, sequential adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes from dilute solutions of different ionic strength undergoing radial flow was achieved. Growth was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). At low salt concentrations, electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged chains determine chain adsorption, while, at high salt concentrations, chain deformation due to external flow controls the layer structure and, thus, the PSA growth rate. A foray into microfluidics helped further our understanding of localized multilayer deposition under continuous flow. Customized “stamp” defined a microfluidic network that guided sequential adsorption while potentially allowing polymer chain extension. AFM confirmed the preparation of well-defined LbL coatings on a silicon substrate. This first demonstration of locally grown self-assembled films using microfluidics shows similar trends in growth rate with ionic strength to PSA, suggesting similar adsorption mechanisms. ^ Hydrogel contact deposition afforded rapid processing of discrete polymeric multilayer islands by combining aspects of both ESA and contact stamping. Swollen hydrogels consisting of poly(sodium- 4 -styrene sulfonate) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) solutions, respectively, were alternatively brought in contact with a substrate {{in order to build}} multilayered structures. The growth rate of adsorbing polyelectrolytes was observed to be a function of applied force during contact. ^ Nafion™ is the exchange membrane of choice for direct methanol fuel cells due to its high proton conductivity. Unfortunately, it is a poor methanol barrier. LbL processing was investigated as a means to develop coatings with enhanced barrier properties. Multilayered coatings of sulfonated poly(benzo bisimidazole) complexed with poly(2 -vinyl pyridine) were prepared on a Nafion™ membrane serving as LbL substrate. Polyelectrolyte absorption into the Nafion™ membrane was found to precede the expected sequential adsorption.

40|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>composite</b> can {{be defined}} as a system where one polymer {{reinforces}} another at a molecular level to give enhanced properties. This concept could be applied to the enhancement of mechanical properties of flexible coil polymers like PET. Molecular level reinforcement of PET with rigid polymers could be achieved by increasing the flexibility of the latter in an effort to increase the entropic mixing and by selection of the rod-like and coil molecule, with specific interactions to increase enthalpy of mixing. Thermotropic liquid crystalline polyesters (LCP) were chosen for the rigid counterpart in our research as these materials exhibit orientation in the direction of draw resulting in unusually high strengths and moduli of the fibers in the draw direction. Also they exhibit lower melt-viscosity values at higher temperatures consequently lowering the processing temperatures of their blends compared to PET. Thus they function as processing-aids in addition to being reinforcing agents. ^ This dissertation work has involved the synthesis of thermotropic liquid crystalline polyesters containing various oxyethylene substituted hydroquinones. The hydroquinone monomers were synthesized, which were then polymerized with terephthaloyl chloride by a solution state polycondensation method. Random and block copolymers containing the mesogenic segments and flexible PET/PBT segments were also synthesized and studied as these LCPs are expected to be miscible with PET by the interaction of the isotropic segments in the melt state. The systems investigated include poly (2 -butoxyethoxy- 1, 4 -phenylene terephthalate) (PBEHT), poly (2 -ethoxy- 1, 4 -phenylene terephthalate) (PEHT) and the random and block copolymers containing PEHT and PET/PBT segments. Some copolymers containing poly (1, 4 -phenylene terephthalate) and PET/PBT segments were also investigated. ^ The polymers were mainly characterized by viscometry, thermogravimetry, DSC, NMR and optical microscopy. Especially {{in the case of the}} copolymer systems, extensive NMR analysis was done to get both the composition and sequence distribution. Structure-property relationships were drawn from copolymers with varying ratios of the rigid and flexible block sizes. Optimization of reaction conditions like solvent, acid-acceptor, temperature and time, to get high molecular weight polymers formed an important aspect of the research work. Rheological studies were done to study the role of the LCPs as processing-aids in the blends. ^ The presence of the flexible pendant group brings down the transition temperatures of the LCP to the processing temperature range of PET. The PBEHT system was found to be a good processing-aid for PET. The high molecular weight PEHT/BT copolymers obtained by conducting polymerization at high temperatures yielded thin films of good strength and mechanical integrity. The processing parameters of the blends of these polyesters with PET have to be optimized to draw conclusions about the reinforcing ability of the LCPs. ...|$|E

For such films the conductivity versus temperature data fit to a 2 D variable range hopping model. In contrast, films using SO 42 - as the dopant show an isotropic highly disordered molecular organisation and a temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity which fits a 3 D variable range hopping model. Although such models present a rather simple picture of conductivity in these complex <b>molecular</b> <b>composites,</b> they do demonstrate the strong and direct influence of the molecular organisation on their electrical transport properties...|$|R
40|$|Research {{of several}} {{medicine}} matrixes had been done. Matrixes {{used in the}} research are montmorillonite, Na/montmorillonite, chitosan (medium molecular weight), chitosan (low <b>molecular</b> weight), <b>composite</b> of montmorillonite-chitosan chitosan (medium <b>molecular</b> weight), and <b>composite</b> of montmorillonite-chitosan chitosan (low molecular weight). Those matrixes are tested for sustain release of theophylline. HPMC was used for positive control. And conventional tablet of theophylline was used for negative control. Characteristics investigated are physical properties of granule (flow time, tapping index, and compressibility) and physical properties of tablet (uniformity of weight, hardness, brittleness, and degradation time). Tablet qualified was test by dissolution test. The physical properties of granule (flow time) is qualify i. e. under 10 s. Tapping index was qualify i. e. under 20...|$|R
40|$|Broadband {{dielectric}} relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) and thermally stimulated depolarisation currents (TSDC) {{techniques were}} employed to investigate and molecular mobility in relation to phase morphology in novel nanocomposites based on polyimide (PI). In addition to dielectric techniques, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and creep rate spectroscopy (CRS) provided information on phase transitions and relaxation behaviour of the composites. The systems investigated include nanophase-separated polyimide-silica (PI-SiO 2) hybrid materials with covalent bonds between the components and rod-like polyimide (PIR) / flexible chain polyimide (PIF) <b>molecular</b> <b>composites.</b> The combination of several complementary techniques allowed to investigate the dynamic behaviour of PI in these systems in wide ranges of frequency and temperature. All the experiments indicated pronounced deviations from additivity in {{the dynamics of the}} composites. The results are discussed in terms of enhancement of small-scale motion due to loosened molecular packing of PI chains confined in nanovolumes and of reduction of large-scale chain mobility due to constraining effects and due to chemical bonds between the components...|$|R

The thermal, hydrothermal, acidic, and basic stabilities of the Y/MCM- 48 composite were investigated. The results show that Y/MCM- 48 <b>composite</b> <b>molecular</b> sieve with meso- and microporous structures was synthesized successfully at 120  °C for 36  h. The Y/MCM- 48 composite has the surface area of 864  m 2 /g and the average pore size is ca. 2. 48  nm. The bi-porous structure in <b>composite</b> <b>molecular</b> sieve still maintains its stability even after thermal treatment at 800  °C for 4  h or hydrothermal treatment at 100  °C for 48  h. After treatment in 1  mol/L hydrochloric acid solution or 1  mol/L sodium hydroxide solution for 48  h, the Y/MCM- 48 composite exhibits good acidic stability. The acidic stability is superior to the basic stability at the same treatment time...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} our {{attention}} on the morphological and optical characterisation of self-assembled Zn-porphyrin-based/fullerene systems. Diethynyl-Zn-porphyrin (ZnDEP) and bimetallic sigma-bonded arrays of diethynyl-Zn-porphyrin with Pd(II) and Pt(II) square planar complexes, namely, ZnDEP, Pd-ZnDEP and Pt-ZnDEP, have been synthesised, and these compounds were studied in the self-assembly behaviour with fullerene, giving rise to the <b>molecular</b> <b>composites</b> ZnDEP/C- 60, Pd-ZnDEP/C- 60 and Pt-ZnDEP/C- 60. Thick films of the materials were deposited by slow evaporation on glass substrates, {{in order to be}} morphologically characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The surface analysis showed a peculiar nanometric structure of the composites. The optical (UV-Vis absorption and emission) characterisation of toluene solutions and a preliminary study on the molecular oxygen luminescence quenching of diethynyl-Zn-porphyrin, diethynyl-Zn-porphyrin/fullerene and platinum or palladium-containing homologues have been performed and will be here discussed. A luminescence response towards molecular oxygen was observed in the case of ZnDEP and ZnDEP/C- 60 samples with a lowering of the intensity of the emission, suggesting promising applications in optical sensors.

40|$|In this review, {{we discuss}} {{currently}} available {{studies on the}} synthesis and properties of MQ copolymers. The data on methods of producing hydrolytic and heterofunctional polycondensation of functional organosilanes {{as well as the}} obtaining MQ copolymers based on silicic acids and nature silicates are considered. The ratio of M and Q monomers and the production method determine the structure of MQ copolymers and, accordingly, their physicochemical characteristics. It is shown that the most successful synthetic approach is a polycondensation of organoalkoxysilanes in the medium of anhydrous acetic acid, which reduces the differences in reactivity of M and Q monomers and leads to obtaining a product with uniform composition in all fractions, with full absence of residual alkoxy-groups. The current concept of MQ copolymers is that of organo-inorganic hybrid systems with nanosized crosslinked inorganic regions limited by triorganosilyl groups and containing residual hydroxyl groups. The systems can be considered as a peculiar <b>molecular</b> <b>composites</b> consisting of separate parts that play the role of a polymer matrix, a plasticizer, and a nanosized filler...|$|R
40|$|Poly (organophosphazene) (POP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} inorganic polymers along with polysiloxane. The versatile phosphazene chemistry enables a wealth of functional inorganic-organic hybrid polymers with −P = N structures ranging from covalently crosslinked cyclomatrix phosphazene to linear POP copolymers. Cyclomatrix phosphazene framework materials (Cyclo-POPs) represent a novel type of <b>molecular</b> <b>composites,</b> and can be facilely formed via a rapid one-step polycondenzation and simultaneous self-assembly process under ambient conditions, and the stereoscopic morphologies are tuneable from zero-dimension (0 D) to 3 D depending on the compositions and reaction conditions. The novel cyclo-POPs have shown distinctive advantages over boron-containing covalent organic framework (COFs) materials in terms of the facile and rapid synthesis and integrated functionalities. Moreover, the highly crosslinked −P = N- backbone structures are readily to be transformed into porous carbon nanomaterials with intrinsically doped heteroatoms (P, N, S, O, B, depending on the framework skeletons), which are desirable for catalysis, sensors and energy storage applications. In this article, we critically overview the rational design, synthesis and functionalisation of the cyclo-POPs materials, and their emerging applications in optoelectronics, catalysis and energy storage devices, along with the technical challenges and development perspectives. ...|$|R
