25|$|In some contexts, {{dimensional}} quantities {{are expressed}} as dimensionless quantities or percentages by omitting some dimensions. For example, debt-to-GDP ratios are generally expressed as percentages: total debt outstanding (dimension of currency) divided by annual GDP (dimension of currency) – but one <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that in comparing a stock to a flow, annual GDP should have dimensions of currency/time (dollars/year, for instance), and thus Debt-to-GDP should have units of years, {{which indicates that}} Debt-to-GDP {{is the number of}} years needed for a constant GDP to pay the debt, if all GDP is spent on the debt and the debt is otherwise unchanged.|$|E
25|$|People with OCD can use rationalizations {{to explain}} their {{behavior}}; however, these rationalizations {{do not apply to}} the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is still not sure and deems it is still better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.|$|E

Second, {{even though there were}} a diverse group of civil society actors, the real influence on the treaty came from the ones in the 'global north'.

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{is that the}} BRIC projections {{are based on the}} assumptions that resources are limitless and endlessly available when needed. In reality, many important resources currently necessary to sustain economic growth, such as oil, natural gas, coal, other fossil fuels, and uranium might soon experience a peak in production before enough renewable energy can be developed and commercialized, which might result in slower economic growth than anticipated, thus throwing off the projections and their dates. The economic emergence of the BRICs will have unpredictable consequences for the global environment. Indeed, proponents of a set carrying capacity for the Earth <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that, given current technology, there is a finite limit to how much the BRICs can develop before exceeding the ability of the global economy to supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of these roles have culminated in assisting {{the creation of}} a society where NGOs serve as important players in the global arena in regards to maintaining human security. Due to this increasing influence and the emergence of growing natural and man-made disasters, NGOs now are contracted by governments in order to adequately respond to crises, as well as assist individual or collectivised groups of citizens in lobbying their interests; thus culminating in the ability to enact, influence and change government agendas. However, NGOs are still largely dependent on certain levels of government funding, hence critics <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that NGOs pose the ability to potentially damage issues of human security due to this financial dependence. Despite these critiqes, the focus, expertise and infrastructure developed by NGOs through their activities linked with human development and human rights allow them to make unique contributions to human security provision.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, as {{expected}} Janus {{is present in}} region I of Martianus Capella's division of Heaven and in region XVI, the last one, {{are to be found}} the Ianitores terrestres (along with Nocturnus), perhaps to be identified in Forculus, Limentinus and Cardea, deities strictly related to Janus as his auxiliaries (or perhaps even no more than concrete subdivisions of his functions) as the meaning of their names implies: Forculus is the god of the forca, a iugum, low passage, Limentinus the guardian of the limes, boundary, Cardea the goddess of hinges, here of the gates separating Earth and Heaven. The problem posed by the qualifying adjective terrestres earthly, can be addressed in two different ways. One hypothesis is that Martianus's depiction implies a descent from Heaven onto Earth. However Martianus's depiction does not look to be confined to a division Heaven-Earth as it includes the Underworld and other obscure regions or remote recesses of Heaven. Thence one <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the theologem of the Gates of Heaven (the Synplegades) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.|$|E

25|$|Despite the flair of Stange's reign, {{it would}} take the more {{tactical}} approach of Mich d'Avray to finally win the NSL Championship. While less flamboyant than his predecessor, d'Avray successfully transformed the team with a different strategy to the previous coaches. The attacking 5–3–2, which saw almost as many goals conceded as scored, was replaced with a 4–4–2. Some <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that the team began to play a less attractive form of the game, but nobody could argue with the results. In 2001/2, the team nearly went the entire season undefeated with a side that only had former Adelaide City midfielder Brad Hassell as a major addition. After scraping through in the second leg of the major semi final against Newcastle, Glory faced Sydney Olympic in the grand final at a sold-out Subiaco Oval. While the 2000 Final {{was one of the great}} games of domestic Australian association football, the 2002 final was a tight and tense affair with Glory hardly getting a shot on target due to the fact that they lacked any bite in the midfield and had their two strikers marked out of the game. Ante Miličić was on target for Olympic though and his goal early in the second half was enough for Olympic to win 1–0 and break the hearts of Glory fans once again. It was also to be former Socceroo Alistair Edwards final match before retirement.|$|E

500|$|The {{effects of}} Lat's works were not {{confined}} to the artistic sector. [...] In the period before his debut, Malaysian cartoonists supported calls for national unity. [...] The characters in a cartoon were often of one race, and negative focus on the foibles of particular races or cultures worked its way into the mainstream. [...] Such cartoons did not help to soothe racial tensions that were simmering then. [...] The situation erupted with the racial riots of 1969, and for several years after these incidents relationships among the races were raw and fragile. [...] According to Redza, Lat soothed the nation's racial woes with his works. [...] Drawing members of various races in his crowd scenes and showing their interactions with one another, Lat portrayed Malaysians in a gentle and unbiased comic manner. [...] Redza pointed out although one <b>may</b> <b>argue</b> that Lat was forced into the role of racial and cultural mediator (because of his employment with his country's [...] "leading English-language newspaper serving a multi-racial readership"), he possessed the necessary qualities—intimate knowledge of various races and culture—to succeed in the job. [...] Lat's fans recognised the trademark of his oeuvre as [...] "a safe and nice humour that made everyone feel good and nostalgic by appealing to their benevolent sides rather than by poking at their bad sides". [...] It proved to be a successful formula; more than 850,000copies of his books were sold in the twelve years after the first compilation of his editorial cartoons went on sale in 1977. [...] The comfort that readers sought from his works was such that when in September 2008 Lat deviated from his usual style, to draw a cartoon about racially charged politicking in his country, it shocked journalist Kalimullah Hassan. [...] She found the illustration of a group of Malaysians huddled under an umbrella, taking shelter from a rain of xenophobic phrases, full of profound sadness.|$|E
