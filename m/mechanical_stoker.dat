25|$|Features {{such as the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> smooth riding {{characteristics}} and large, comfortable cab also made them popular with crews.|$|E
25|$|As built, {{however, the}} class was lacking {{much in the way}} of modern {{appliances}} due to the PRR's conservatism; features missing included a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> power reverse, and a feedwater heater, although most of the class were later given a stoker and all received power reverse.|$|E
25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, power-operated reversing gear, American-style bar frame construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|E
50|$|When the Class 23 was withdrawn, {{many of the}} Class 15F {{locomotives}} {{that were}} equipped with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> inherited their huge twelve-wheel Type EW tenders which, apart from increasing their range with its larger fuel and water capacity, also greatly enhanced their appearance. In later years when the Class 15F was relegated to heavy shunting and local work, many of the locomotives had their <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> removed.|$|R
50|$|Their type H.T-1 <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> {{were capable}} of {{delivering}} 15000 lb of coal per hour, which ensured a high firing rate when required. The stoker was driven by a totally enclosed double-acting two-cylinder variable-speed reversing steam engine, located on the hind pivot casting and operated from the cab. The coal bunker on the rear engine unit's frame was designed with sloping sides to allow the coal to gravitate to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker's</b> conveyor screw trough, which extended {{the full length of}} the bunker.|$|R
50|$|Since it was {{arranged}} for manual stoking, the Type JV tender was {{not suitable for}} use with those Class 15F locomotives which were fitted with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Garratt was, obviously, {{not alone}} {{in the field of}} {{articulated}} locomotives. Aside from the well-known Fairlie and Meyer types, the Garratt had contemporary and similarly-designed competition {{in the form of the}} Union-Garratt, Modified Fairlie and Golwé. Of these, the closest was the Union-Garratt, a type originally conceived owing to the perceived necessity for a rigid connection between a bunker or tender and a firebox fed by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker.</b> Though it could be argued that the NZR G class locomotives were Union-Garratts (having their bunkers mounted on the boiler frames, rather than on the hind engine unit), a more concrete example can be seen in the two South African Railways Union Garratts of classes GH and U.|$|E
500|$|During {{the brief}} time they {{operated}} under the Southern Railway, further modifications {{were applied to}} the class, such as the reduction in boiler pressure to [...] and the redesign of the footplate spectacle plates. These are the small windows on the front face of the cab, which were redesigned to a wedge-shaped profile, a feature to be seen on all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. [...] They had been introduced in Britain in 1934 with the Gresley-designed Cock o' the North. Originally, the spectacle plates of the Bulleid Pacifics were at the conventional right-angle to {{the direction of the}} locomotive, and offered limited vision ahead along the air-smoothed casing. The Southern-built batches also had variations in the material used for the air-smoothed casing with a change from sheet steel to an asbestos compound, forced upon the manufacturer by wartime expediency. [...] This resulted in several class members having a horizontal strengthening rib running {{down the length of the}} casing. The final Southern Railway-initiated experiment involved equipping 21C5 Canadian Pacific with a Berkeley <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> imported from Canada. [...] Little improvement in performance was seen when trialled under British Railways auspices in 1948 and the locomotive was re-converted to hand-firing.|$|E
2500|$|Locomotive numbers 92165-92167 {{were built}} with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> {{which was a}} helical screw that {{conveyed}} coal from the tender to the firebox, {{where it would be}} directed to the required part of the [...] by high-pressure steam jets controlled by the fireman. The stoker made higher steaming rates possible, and it was hoped that mechanical stoking might enable the burning of low-grade coal. It was relatively inefficient, and the locomotives used in this trial were rebuilt to the normal configuration. Simply supplying more low grade coal than a fireman could do by hand did not provide efficient burning. Trials found that the maximum coal delivery rate of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> was slightly faster than firing by hand, and it could maintain that maximum {{for hours at a time}} when a fireman would tire. However this was of little practical benefit in actual service as even a long-distance freight train would frequently stop to allow faster trains to pass or would be held at signals. For the short periods when maximum firing rate was needed a skilled fireman was more than sufficient. The success of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> on North American railroads was mainly because the locomotives were significantly larger (with a suitably greater demand for coal) and many routes required hours of supplying coal at a rate beyond the physical limit of a single fireman.|$|E
50|$|The 20th {{class was}} the first and only class of Rhodesia Railways {{locomotives}} to be fitted with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b> Other technical features included bar frames and thermic syphons.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear. They {{were the}} only post-war Garratts on the SAR to be without <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> and {{also one of the}} largest designs of Garratt to be manually stoked.|$|R
50|$|The Class GH were {{massive and}} {{powerful}} locomotives and, having {{been designed for}} passenger service, were built for speed with their large 60 in diameter coupled wheels. With their 60 sq ft firegrates, they were equipped with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> of the duplex type. One reason which was put forward {{for the construction of}} the rear end of the Union Garratts on the Modified Fairlie principle was to enable their coal bunkers to be rigidly in line with their boiler frames to ensure a satisfactory arrangement for the installation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b> The subsequent designs of the Classes GL and GM Garratts showed that this precaution was unnecessary.|$|R
2500|$|The {{decision}} to install MB Type 1 <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> equipment (capable of feeding up to [...] of coal per hour) [...] on a locomotive {{with only a}} [...] grate reflected improved postwar working conditions for locomotive firemen, the varying quality of postwar coal [...] and the expectation of sustained high speed operation of the locomotive. The manually fired prewar VR S class Pacific, although capable of 2,300 drawbar horsepower (1,700kW), was limited by the physical ability of the fireman to feed its [...] grate and as such was reliant on coal with a high calorific value.|$|E
2500|$|By 1943 {{however, the}} {{situation}} had changed. There was a massive increase in traffic brought by the advent of World War II, and the A2s were by this point well past their prime. The VR Locomotive Design Section once again {{turned their attention to}} the proposed Pacific replacement. The addition of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> the enlarging of the grate from [...] for increased performance and the use of heavy bar-frame construction for increased durability significantly increased the projected weight of the locomotive. To keep the axle load to 19.5 tons, the design by 1944 had changed from a 4-6-2 'Pacific' to a 4-6-4 'Hudson' wheel arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|The boiler was of {{exceptional}} size with an inside diameter of , double the track gauge. It used a top feed and contained 263 small tubes of [...] outside diameter and 50 large tubes of [...] outside diameter, while the superheater elements were of [...] diameter. The round-topped firebox with its [...] grate area {{was fired by}} a duplex <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> the only class on the SAR which had this feature. The firebox contained two Nicholson thermic syphons and two arch tubes. Clyde Superior soot blowers were fitted {{on each side of}} the firebox. Beyer, Peacock estimated the Class GL locomotive's economical coal consumption rate at [...] per hour.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, the SAR placed two Class GH {{passenger}} train versions of its Class U Union Garratt in service, {{designed and built}} by Maffei, to work the named fast {{passenger train}}s of the era, the Union Express and Union Limited, forerunners of the Blue Train. They were superheated and had Walschaerts valve gear, bar frames and <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b> They made several trips working the two Union trains out of Cape Town, {{but they were not}} as successful as had been hoped and they were soon taken off that duty. Their <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> also proved to be troublesome and were eventually removed. Both remained in service until 1958.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> {{for feeding}} coal to {{locomotives}} were {{in use in}} the 1920s. A completely mechanized and automated coal handling and stoking system was first used to feed pulverized coal to an electric utility boiler in 1921.|$|R
50|$|Sixty-nine L2 {{locomotives}} received <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> {{and were}} reclassified as class L2-r. At the Milwaukee Road’s 1938 renumbering, the remaining 62 L2-r locomotives were renumbered 600-661, {{with the remaining}} 77 non-stoker fitted L2 locomotives receiving numbers 662-738.|$|R

50|$|Four vacuum {{cylinders}} operated clasp {{brakes on}} all tender wheels and a hand brake was included. Since experience {{showed that a}} firegrate of 63 sq ft cannot be served effectively under all conditions by manual stoking, particularly on long runs, a type H.T-1 <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> was fitted, supplied by the Standard Stoker Company of America. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> engine was mounted on the tender.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{they were}} hand-fired, but the coal {{consumption}} {{was such that}} in 1934, 10 locomotives of the class were fitted with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b> The results were so successful, that {{the remainder of the}} class was later equipped as well.|$|R
50|$|Both Class 18 {{locomotives}} were withdrawn by 1951. After their locomotives were {{withdrawn from}} service, the two Type HT tenders had their <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> removed and their drawgear modified {{for use with}} Class 15CA locomotives. They were then redesignated Type KT.|$|R
50|$|Features {{such as the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> smooth riding {{characteristics}} and large, comfortable cab also made them popular with crews.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> {{was removed}} and the {{locomotive}} was converted to hand firing soon after {{being placed in}} service.|$|E
50|$|It {{needs to}} be borne in mind, however, that the Type MR was not {{equipped}} with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker,</b> an item which reduced the Type FT's water capacity. On the Type ET tender, for example, {{the inclusion of a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> reduced its water capacity by 380 imp gal compared to the virtually identical manually stoked Type JT tender, while its empty weight was 1232 lb more due to the mechanical stoking equipment.|$|E
50|$|After their {{locomotives}} were {{withdrawn from}} service, the Type HT tenders {{of the two}} Class 18 2-10-2 Henschel Giants had their <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> removed and their drawgear modified for use with Class 15CA locomotives. These two tenders were then redesignated Type KT as well.|$|R
50|$|Coal was {{delivered}} to the station by rail and ship. Once delivered to the station it was fed automatically onto a gravity bucket conveyor system which supplied 500 tonne capacity bunkers. These discharged onto <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> and into the boiler furnace. Ash was removed automatically.|$|R
50|$|They {{were the}} first American-built {{locomotives}} ordered by TCDD, though they had acquired ex-USATC S200 Class (TCDD 46201 Class) and ex-USATC S160 Class (TCDD 45171 Class). This class had the largest boiler and firebox of any Turkish locomotive and {{were the only ones}} fitted with <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tender rode on four-wheeled bogies and was {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} earlier Type JT tender, but equipped with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker.</b> Like the Type JT, it also had a 14 lt t coal capacity and a maximum axle load of 17 lt 15 lcwt kg, but a 380 imp gal smaller water capacity of 5620 imp gal to accommodate the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> mechanism, while its empty weight was 1232 lb more due to the additional stoking equipment. These {{appear to have been}} the only differences between the Types JT and ET tenders.|$|E
50|$|Many camelbacks were {{converted}} into end-cab locomotives. The {{advent of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>stoker</b> and its associated underfloor machinery placed cab floors and tender decks higher, and from that vantage point the engineer could see ahead.|$|E

5000|$|Competition from diesel spurred a {{round of}} {{development}} in steam locomotive technology. High style, high speed [...] "steamliners" [...] produced {{during the second half}} of the 1930s became the speed kings of passenger service. [...] Duplex locomotive and articulated steam locomotives built in the early 1940s were the most powerful locomotives ever built. But the limits of steam technology were rapidly being reached. The new locomotives were mechanically complex and extremely specialized. Locomotive size became an issue, as steam engines became so big in the 1940s that the cylinder and boiler dimensions were pushing the limits that the loading gauge would allow. Fireboxes became so big that firing a steam locomotive became an extremely difficult job without the aid of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers.</b> [...] <b>Mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> for feeding coal to locomotives were in use in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|On the Witwatersrand {{they were}} used mainly for pick-up work and local {{workings}} as haulers. Since {{they were no longer}} required to drag freights for hours on end up 1 in 50 (2%) gradients, their <b>mechanical</b> <b>stokers</b> were removed. Two locomotives remained in Natal to be employed on the coal line between Vryheid and Hlobane.|$|R
