5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward their horses. The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to {{distract}} them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
5|$|Laevinus {{had begun}} {{exploring}} {{the possibility of}} an alliance with the Aetolian League, as early as 212 BC. The Aetolians, war weary, had <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Philip at Naupactus in 217 BC. However five years later the pendulum had swung in the other direction, the war faction was on the ascendency, and the Aetolians were once again ready to consider taking up arms against their traditional enemy, Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Stephen IV {{attempted}} {{to regain his}} throne with Emperor Manuel I's support, but the latter <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Stephen III. He agreed to send his younger brother, Béla, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize Béla's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. In an attempt to recapture these territories, Stephen III waged wars against the Byzantine Empire between 1164 and 1167, but could not defeat the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after Portuguese traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the Portuguese in their attempts at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia {{over the issue of}} whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the archbishop, but by 809 they seem to have been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> China when {{it opened}} border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
50|$|Greggs {{approaches}} Carver {{to ask how}} he felt bringing {{charges against}} Colicchio for brutality against a citizen. He indicates he has <b>made</b> his <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> it. Greggs visits Daniels' office, looking grim.|$|R

5|$|Beaujeu, having {{fulfilled}} {{his mission}} in escorting the colonists across the ocean, returned to France aboard the Joly in mid-March 1685. Many of the colonists chose {{to return to}} France with him, leaving approximately 180. Although Beaujeu delivered a message from La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, Roosevelt, on Howe's advice, had <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Tammany boss Charles Murphy, {{and again}} sought New York state office. In July, however, {{he was drafted}} by the Democratic National Convention as the vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Ohio {{governor}} James M. Cox. Roosevelt selected Howe as his campaign manager. The CoxRoosevelt ticket lost overwhelmingly to Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, but both Roosevelt and Howe saw themselves as having successfully built Roosevelt a national reputation; {{not long after the}} election, Howe boasted to several friends that Roosevelt would soon occupy the White House, taking Howe with him.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{completed}} {{construction of}} the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077. In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. For defense against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle {{at the center of}} the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> King Béla II of Hungary, which was followed by a long period of stability in the border region.|$|E

5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments had not <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the Unitarians were {{challenged}} by Federalist forces. After {{the resignation of}} Rivadavia, Manuel Dorrego was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general Juan Lavalle, who took Dorrego's place. However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed largely of gauchos led by Rosas and Estanislao López. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was back in place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Portuguese colonial power to the island of Sri Lanka in 1505, and its {{strategic}} location in the Palk Strait connecting all interior Sinhalese kingdoms to South India, created political problems. Many of its kings confronted and ultimately <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Portuguese colonials. In 1617, Cankili II, a usurper to the throne, confronted the Portuguese but was defeated, thus bringing the kingdom’s independent existence {{to an end in}} 1619. Although rebels like Migapulle Arachchi with help of Thanjavur Nayak kingdom tried to recover the kingdom, they were eventually defeated. Nallur, a suburb of Jaffna town, served as its capital.|$|E
50|$|Some {{contemporary}} historians {{say that}} Henry <b>made</b> a <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Bulgarians {{after the death}} of Kaloyan, and a marriage was arranged in 1213 between Henry and Maria of Bulgaria, daughter of Kaloyan and stepdaughter of Boril, Tsar of Bulgaria.|$|R

5|$|As discussed, the Chalkidian League had <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Athens in 352 BC, {{in clear}} breach of their {{alliance}} with Philip, {{due to their}} growing fear of Macedonian power. Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed. However, {{the next few years}} of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC. Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos. According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.|$|E
5|$|As the Seven Years' War entered its {{later stages}} through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from British armies. In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, the British took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada {{to fall into}} British hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. Fort Frontenac fell to the British in the same month, costing the French {{supplies}} for the Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian supporters of the French <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the British, France was forced to draw its troops back. French leadership, specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm, were unsettled by the British successes. However, Quebec {{was still able to}} protect itself as the British prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Imad ad-Din Zengi II, the Zengid {{ruler of}} Aleppo, in May 1182. However, Imad ad-Din {{was forced to}} {{surrender}} Aleppo to Saladin on 11June 1183. Fearing an attack on Antioch, Bohemond sold Tarsus to Roupen III, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, to raise funds. BaldwinIV of Jerusalem promised to send 300 knights to Antioch. Saladin did not invade the principality and signed a peace treaty with Bohemond. Bohemond attended the assembly that BaldwinIV had summoned to discuss {{the administration of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem in autumn 1183. At the meeting, Guy of Lusignan was dismissed as regent, and his five-year-old stepson, Baldwin, was proclaimed co-ruler. A charter shows that Bohemond was in Acre in April 1185, suggesting that he was present when the leper BaldwinIV died around that time.|$|E

5|$|Bureaucratic affairs were {{completed}} during Diocletian's stay: a census took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, {{lost the ability}} to mint independently. Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of Septimius Severus, brought Egyptian administrative practices much closer to Roman standards. Diocletian travelled south along the Nile the following summer, where he visited Oxyrhynchus and Elephantine. In Nubia, he <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Nobatae and Blemmyes tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to Philae and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa quickly after the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met with Galerius in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|During the Nanboku-chō period {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, Nanbu Motoyuki accompanied Kitabatake Akiie north when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North, and Shugo of Mutsu Province. Nanbu Motoyuki established Ne Castle, which was intended to be a center for the imperial government administration in the area. This marked the official transfer of the seat of the Nanbu clan from Kai Province to Mutsu. Nanbu Motoyuki was under allegiance to the Southern Court; however, at the same time, another branch of the same Nanbu family ruled the nearby Sannohe and Morioka areas under allegiance to the rival Northern Court. The two branches of the clan <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> each other in 1393.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} in which the populares party {{controlled}} the city, they flouted convention by re-electing Marius consul several times without observing the customary ten-year interval between offices. They also transgressed the established oligarchy by advancing unelected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon <b>made</b> <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Mithridates. In 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and recaptured the city. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters. Sulla, having observed the violent results of radical popular reforms, was naturally conservative. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and by extension the senate. Sulla made himself dictator, passed a series of constitutional reforms, resigned the dictatorship, and served one last term as consul. He died in 78 BC.|$|E
50|$|Breteuil {{was allowed}} to return to France in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte, having <b>made</b> his <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the First French Empire. He tried to urge other Royalists to join him, but he was largely unsuccessful. Most {{preferred}} to stay loyal to the exiled Bourbons.|$|R
50|$|William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam (c.1610-1670) was an Irish nobleman of the Stuart era. He {{fought on}} the Royalist side during the English Civil War, but later <b>made</b> his <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> the Cromwellian regime. In {{his later years}} he openly professed the Roman Catholic faith.|$|R
