5|$|Mary {{had always}} {{rejected}} the break with Rome instituted {{by her father}} {{and the establishment of}} Protestantism by her brother's regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to repeal Henry's religious laws, thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and Pope Julius III had to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> concession: the monastery lands confiscated under Henry were not returned to the church but remained in the hands of their influential new owners. By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contribution (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E
5|$|Selfe left Mort's in 1877 to {{practise}} as {{a consulting}} engineer at 141 Pitt Street, gaining {{a reputation for}} versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884–85, where he visited engineering works and technical education facilities in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe {{set up a new}} office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street. He would later move to No. 279 where he operated the consultancy until his death in 1911. In the late 1890s he employed William Dixson as an engineer, who would later <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> donation of Australiana to the State Library of New South Wales. The collection of Selfe's own papers and drawings have since been donated to the same library that his former employee greatly augmented.|$|E

5|$|By December 1942, Bladin's {{strength}} in NWA consisted of seven RAAF squadrons operating mainly Bristol Beaufighter and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, Lockheed Hudson light bombers, and A-31 Vengeance dive bombers. These were soon augmented by one squadron each of Dutch East Indies B-25 Mitchell medium bombers and USAAF B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. As Japanese air raids continued into 1943, Bladin placed his bombers inland, and his fighters {{close to the}} coast where they could intercept the raiders. Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1January 1943, he stepped up offensive strikes against island bases and shipping in the Timor and Arafura Seas as the Allies took the fight to the Japanese. He often employed his own judgement {{in the selection of}} targets, as detailed directives from superior headquarters were not always forthcoming. On 27February, acting on intercepted radio transmissions, he launched a pre-emptive raid on Penfui airfield, near Koepang on Timor, that destroyed or damaged twenty-two enemy bombers that had been destined to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> raid on Darwin.|$|E

The executionist movement (an attempt to prevent domination by the magnate families of Poland and Lithuania) peaked at the Sejm in Piotrków in 1562–63. On the religious front, the Polish Brethren split from the Calvinists, and the Protestant Brest Bible was published in 1563. The Jesuits, who arrived in 1564, were destined to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact on Poland's history.|$|E

25|$|Bharuch {{has always}} been prosperous because of its {{location}} on the Narmada River. Although water tends to be scarce in Gujarat, one never finds difficulty in getting water in Bharuch.

People from these small villages come to Bharuch {{when they want to}} shop for new clothes, or <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> purchase. Lately a lot of retiring expatriates have been returning to Bharuch and building new houses giving the economy a boost.|$|E
25|$|Written by two Americans with {{a strong}} country-western lyrical theme, the song was first {{released}} in Europe, where it {{has become much more}} popular than in the composers' native country, with a big-band/orchestral pop arrangement sung by Tony Christie. Christie's version was a major hit in Europe and a modest success in his native United Kingdom upon its release, then became even more popular in the mid-2000s when the song was reissued. As Christie's version failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact in the U.S., Sedaka released his own recording of the song in 1977, which narrowly missed the top 40 but was an easy listening hit in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E

Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds with another 20–10 season, but the new acquisitions failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact, and they finished with the worst record in team history and the league's worst for the season at 15–67.|$|E

At Bound for Glory IV, he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on Impact!, Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.|$|E
25|$|Mismanagement and {{corruption}} resulted in major economic problems. By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and a decision to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jesús María de Galíndez, a Basque exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In August 1960, the Organization of American States (OAS) imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President Rómulo Betancourt of Venezuela.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Bandai never {{intended}} to develop a system with Internet connectivity in mind. However, Apple and Bandai received feedback from customers, indicating {{that they were looking}} for a system that could connect to the Internet. To make Internet connectivity possible, Apple had to incorporate a modem into the Pippin design. Two years earlier (1992), Apple had already moved away from the older serial interface with an external Hayes-compatible modem on its Macintosh systems, and switched to a serial interface which included GeoPort – a serial data technology that allowed software to emulate a modem. Implementing GeoPort into the Pippin platform required Apple to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> change in its design – moving away from the 68030 footprint and to a PowerPC footprint. Apple chose the PowerPC 603 32-bit processor, as it was designed to be a low-cost, low-end processor for embedded use.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire {{finished}} third in the County Championship, twenty points adrift of the joint winners Lancashire and Surrey. For the most part, Yorkshire selected from 15 players in 1950 although a few others made occasional appearances. Yardley captained the team in which Hutton and Lowson were the established openers although, with Hutton's Test calls, there were more opportunities for Halliday and Geoffrey Keighley. Lester, Watson, Wilson and Billy Sutcliffe were the other batsmen and Brennan was the wicket-keeper. The main bowlers were Wardle, Coxon and Eddie Leadbeater. Brian Close was doing his national service and could only make a single appearance, Ellis Robinson had departed and Ron Aspinall's career had been wrecked by his injury. So Trueman and Whitehead, who made 13 appearances, contested the fourth bowling place but one of the bit players was Bob Appleyard, who would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact in 1951.|$|E
25|$|In the Test {{series against}} South Africa, Cook made a duck {{in the first}} innings of the first Test, but England {{recovered}} to post 303. England {{went on to win}} the game by 241 runs thanks to a strong bowling performance. In the second Test Cook again failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impression, scoring just 35 runs in the entire match in what proved to be a high scoring draw. Cook started to show some form in the third Test. He scored 43 in England’s second innings total of 74–3, as England won the game by seven wickets after dismissing South Africa for just 83 in their second innings. In the final Test of the series, which England had already won, Cook made 76 in the first innings. However, England collapsed in the second innings and only made 101, with Cook being dismissed for five. Despite this, England won the series 2–1 with Cook captaining England to the historic victory.|$|E

25|$|Another example {{cited by}} Biskind was Phillip Noyce's The Quiet American (2002), whose release Weinstein delayed {{following}} the September 11 attacks owing to audience reaction in test screenings to the film's critical tone towards United States past foreign policy. After being told the film would {{go straight to}} video, Noyce planned to screen the film in Toronto International Film Festival in order to mobilize critics to pressure Miramax to release it theatrically. Weinstein decided to screen the film at the Festival only after he was lobbied by star Michael Caine, who threatened to boycott publicity for another film he had made for Miramax. The Quiet American received mostly positive reviews at the festival, and Miramax eventually released the film theatrically, but it was alleged that Miramax did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> effort to promote the film for Academy Award consideration, though Caine was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
25|$|Wolverhampton Wanderers {{were another}} highly {{successful}} English club side during the postwar years. Under {{the management of}} Stan Cullis, they were league champions three times and FA Cup winners twice between 1949 and 1960. Although they failed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> impact in either of their European Cup campaigns, they did beat some of European football's most respected club sides {{in a series of}} friendlies at Molineux Stadium during the 1950s. Arsenal continued their run of success for several years after the resumption of league football, winning two league titles and an FA Cup between 1948 and 1953. Their North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur won the league title {{for the first time in}} 1951, and by the end of the decade were challenging for honours once again under new manager Bill Nicholson and captain Danny Blanchflower. Another London club, Chelsea, won the league title in 1955. Newcastle United were FA Cup winners three times in the 1950s, while Portsmouth won back-to-back league titles in the early postwar years.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs {{was eager}} to tour Australia in 1928–29; his wife again {{accompanied}} him and he wished to renew acquaintance with the many good friends he had previously made there. In addition, improvements {{in the design of}} ocean liners reduced his sea-sickness. Hobbs was part of the selection committee for the tour and critics recognised the MCC team as a strong one, particularly in batting. He began the tour with some substantial scores, although some critics noted that he did not bat well, but did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> contribution to England's large victory in the first Test. In the second Test, Hobbs scored 40 runs and was given a presentation to mark his 46th birthday which fell during the game. He was involved in controversy over the dismissal of Australian batsman Alan Kippax; the batsman had been initially given not out, but Hobbs let a prolonged appeal to the umpire and accused Kippax of cheating. Kippax was then ruled to be out, but there was some ill-feeling between the teams for a time, particularly towards Hobbs, who later apologised to Kippax for his language.|$|E
