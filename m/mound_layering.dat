GriffinHeat {{and drought}} {{tolerance}} make shantung maple (Acer truncatum) and caddo sugar maple (A. saccharum) good candidates for midwestern landscapes. Improving cutting propagation or <b>mound</b> <b>layering</b> techniques {{could increase the}} availability of these species. The influence of time of year, cutting position, and auxin concentration, formulation, and solvent on rooting of stem cuttings of shantung maple was investigated. Semi-hardwood cuttings rooted best (55 %). Generally, rooting percentage decreased as indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) concentration increased. Cutting position, auxin formulation, and solvent did not affect rooting. Mean root number and mean root length were unaffected by treatments. Results suggest semi-hardwood cuttings and low IBA concentrations [< 2500 ppm (0. 25 %) ] promote rooting. Auxin concentration influenced rooting of caddo and shantung maple mound layered shoots. Rooting peaked at 15, 000 ppm (1. 5 %) IBA for both caddo (71 %) and shantung maples (34 %). Mean root number for caddo, but not shantung, increased as IBA concentration increased. Differences in mean root length were not significant. Growers may now propagate caddo maple by <b>mound</b> <b>layering.</b> For shantung maple propagation, stem cuttings are recommended. Propagation substrates can strongly influence rooting success of stem cuttings. Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) chips (ERC) have been suggested as a propagation substrate component. This report investigated ERC as a perlite substitute in a 3 perlite: 1 sphagnum peat moss (v/v) rooting substrate. Stem cuttings of spreading euonymus (Euonymus kiautschovicus), forsythia (Forsythia x intermedia), English ivy (Hedera helix), lantana (Lantana camara), and coleus (Solenostemon scutellarioides) were rooted in substrates containing increasing concentrations of ERC hammer milled to pass a 4. 8 mm (0. 19 in) screen. All species rooted well (≥ 95 %) in all substrates except forsythia which rooted poorly in all substrates (8 % to 36 %). ERC did not affect mean root number or mean root length in any species except spreading euonymus where mean root number peaked at 0 % and 100 % ERC content and mean root length decreased with increasing ERC content. Bulk density, container capacity, and total porosity increased as ERC replaced perlite. Physical properties of all substrates were suitable for cutting propagation.

40|$|Given that nursery is a {{peculiar}} environment, {{the amount of}} nutrients removed by nursery trees represents a fundamental acquisition to optimise fertilisation strategies, with economic and environmental implications. In this context, we determined nutrient removal by apple, pear and cherry nursery trees {{at the end of}} the nursery growing cycle. We randomly removed 5 leafless apple (Golden Delicious/EMLA M 9; density of 30, 000 trees ha – 1), pear (Santa Maria/Adams; density of 30, 000 trees ha – 1) and cherry (Alex TM /Gisela 6 ®; density of 40, 000 trees ha – 1) trees from a commercial nursery. Trees were divided into roots (below the root collar), rootstock (above-ground wood between root collar and grafting point) and variety (1 -year-old wood above the grafting point). For each organ we determined biomass, macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S,) and micro- (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B) nutrient concentration. Pear trees were the most developed (650 g (dw) tree – 1, equal to 1. 75 and 2. 78 folds than apple and cherry trees, respectively) whereas, independently of the species, variety mostly contributed (> 50 %) to the total tree biomass, followed by roots and then above-ground rootstock. However, the dry biomass and nutrient amount measured in rootstocks (including roots) represent the cumulative amount of 2 and 3 seasons, for Gisela ® 6 (tissue culture) and pome fruit species (generated by <b>mound</b> <b>layering),</b> respectively. Macro and micronutrients were mostly concentrated in roots, followed by variety and rootstock, irrespective of the species. Independently of the tissue, macronutrients concentration hierarchy was N>Ca>K> P>Mg>S. Removed N by whole tree accounted for 6. 58, 3. 53 and 2. 49 g tree – 1 for pear, apple and cherry, respectively, corresponding to almost 200, 107 and 100 kg N ha – 1, respectively. High amounts of K and Ca were used by pear (130 - 140 kg ha – 1) and apple trees (~ 50 and 130 kg ha – 1 of K and Ca, respectively), while ~ 25 kg K ha – 1 and 55 kg Ca ha – 1 were calculated for cherry nursery trees. Among micronutrients, Fe was the most required (~ 3 kg ha – 1) independently of the species. B removal ranged between 1. 2 and 2. 4 kg ha – 1 (80, 40 and 30 mg tree – 1 for pear, apple and cherry, respectively), whereas Mn, Cu and Zn accounted for few hundred g ha – 1, irrespective of the species. Given that nutrient concentration among tissues resulted within the same order of magnitude, irrespective of the species, differences in removal were mainly driven by the tree biomass as proved by the significant correlations between plant dry biomass with most of the nutrients we observed...|$|E

Gale is a 155 km, late Noachian / early Hesperian impact crater {{located near the}} dichotomy boundary separating the southern highlands from the northern plains. The central mound is composed of layered sedimentary rock, with upper and lower mound units separated by a prominent erosional unconformity (Milliken et al., 2010). The lower mound is of particular interest, as it contains secondary minerals indicative of a striking shift from water-rich to water-poor conditions on early Mars. A key unknown {{in the history of}} Gale is the relationship between the sedimentary units in the mound and sedimentary sequences in the surrounding region. We employed orbital remote sensing data to determine if areas within a 1, 000 km radius of Gale match the characteristics of sedimentary units in Mt. Sharp. Regions of interest were defined based on: the mound s inferred age (late Noachian to early Hesperian), altitude range (- 4, 600 m to + 400 m), and THEMIS nighttime brightness (a proxy for thermal inertia). This combination of characteristics is matched by two extensive units, the late Noachian subdued cratered unit Npl 2 and Noachian / Hesperian undivided material HNu (Greeley and Guest, 1987), located along the dichotomy. Geomorphic units have been mapped within the Gale mound by Thomson et al. (2011) based on albedo, layering and erosional characteristics.

In this work we constrain the origin of the ILDs by considering mass balance equations. One model involving formation of the ILDs by groundwater upwelling requires that a significant fraction of the global Martian sulfur budget was concentrated in the Valles Marineris at the time when the ILDs formed. It also necessitates high deposition and erosion rates in the Hesperian. We favor an alternative model in which the ILDs formed in a configuration similar to what is observed today through atmospherically driven deposition of ice, dust, and volcanogenic sulfuric acid. Such a model is easily compatible with the global sulfur budget, and does not require significant erosion rates or large volumes of liquid water. We propose that formation of sulfate-rich layered sediments on Mars was governed through time by volcanogenic SO 2 and H 2 O emission rates and dust production against a backdrop of obliquity variation in a largely cold and dry climate. © 2012 Geological Society of America.

50|$|Unlike {{the other}} mounds at Pineland, which were shell middens, the Smith Mound is a sand <b>mound</b> with thin <b>layers</b> of shell, {{and was used}} for burials. The Smith Mound was {{originally}} about 300 ft long and 30 ft high. (Cushing gave dimensions for this mound of 375 ft long, 150 ft wide and 58 ft high.) It {{was surrounded by a}} pond fed by a canal which branched from the Pine Island Canal. A path wound around the mound to the summit, which was narrow but flat. Cushing observed potsherds, broken shell ladles, and human bones on the mound. The Smith Mound was constructed around 1000 years ago. Part of the mound was destroyed more than a century ago, and the adjacent pond and canal filled in. Half of the mound and the pond were preserved by its owner, Captain Smith.|$|R
