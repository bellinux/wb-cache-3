Many Finnhorses have <b>multiple</b> <b>uses,</b> such as starting their career in harness racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy. They are also popular as pleasure horses.|$|E

40|$|Forested {{watersheds}} are classical {{examples of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> natural resource areas which simultaneously supply timber, water, range, fisheries and wildlife, {{and a variety}} of recreational and esthetic experiences. A change in the forest ecosystem to benefit one forest <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resource brings about concomitant changes which affect other <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources. Forest <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources, while abundant by many standards, are in fact limited. As a result, choices have to be made regarding the combination and levels of forest <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources to be provided. The complexity of <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> management requires the need to approximate complex and dynamic <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources production relationships and to consider, simultaneously, a large number of different management strategies for a heterogeneous set of resources for alternative planning horizons. Redacted for privacy The objectives of this study are to define an analytical framework which facilitates decision-making regarding <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resource allocations and to empirically test this methodology. Economic theory of joint production and the information provided by TREES (Timber Resource Economic Estimation System (Tedder, Schmidt and Gourley, 1980)) was used to construct the analytical framework. The analytical approach was tested utilizing physical data from the upper middle portion of the Drift Creek Watershed of the Hebo Banger District of the Siuslaw National Forest. This study also examines the projected physical and economic impacts on the allocation of timber, deer, elk, cattle grazing, anadromous fisheries, spotted owl and bald eagle <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> resources within the study area of seven Forest Service management strategies...|$|R

5|$|The {{partition}} of Bengal (1905) {{resulted in the}} introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The Vande Mataram flag, part of the Swadeshi movement against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the annual session of the Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the <b>multiple</b> <b>uses</b> of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.|$|E
5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for <b>multiple</b> <b>uses</b> and this {{is evident from the}} plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E

Some researchers believe that these compounds are used to form male leks, while others believe that the compounds may be changed into sex hormones. Still others believe that these aromatic compounds may be a courtship gift or an anti-predator ward. In 2005, Thomas Eltz and his research group discovered that male Eufriesea will release different aromatic compounds using complex leg maneuvers, giving credence to the hypothesis that these compounds {{play a role in}} mating, though they may have <b>multiple</b> <b>uses.</b>|$|E

There is mounting documentation that California oak species are experiencing a lack of recruitment and declines in populations. Agencies have responded with restoration projects for oaks; some projects, such as those implemented by the U. S. Forest Service, have <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> management goals, such as timber harvesting, fire fuel reduction, and oak restoration. However, the effectiveness of such <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> projects, in which restoration {{is one of the}} goals, has not been well studied. I evaluated the response of black oaks at two US Forest Service <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> projects in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in Northern California.

While acknowledging {{the weakness of the}} data, the authors found that CI in people with UHL improves sound localization compared with other treatments in people who lost hearing after they learned to speak; in the one study that examined this, CI did improve sound localization in people with UHL who lost hearing before learning to speak. It appeared to improve speech perception and to reduce tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Just like natural gas, the stored ammonia {{can be used}} as {{a thermal}} fuel for {{transportation}} and electricity generation or used in a fuel cell. A standard 60,000 m3 tank of liquid ammonia contains about 211 GWh of energy, equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines. Ammonia can be burned cleanly: water and nitrogen are released, but no CO2 and little or no nitrogen oxides. Ammonia has <b>multiple</b> <b>uses</b> besides being an energy carrier, it is the basis for the production of many chemicals, the most common use is for fertilizer. Given this flexibility of usage, and given that the infrastructure for the safe transport, distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place, it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale, non-carbon, energy carrier of the future.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{constraints}} and restrictions on medicines {{have forced the}} Cuban health system to incorporate alternative and herbal solutions to healthcare issues, which can be more accessible and affordable to a broader population In the 1990s, the Cuban Ministry of Public Health officially recognized natural and traditional medicine and began its integration into the already well established Western medicine model. Examples of alternative techniques used by the clinics and hospitals include: flower essence, neural and hydromineral therapies, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine (i.e. acupunctural anesthesia for surgery), natural dietary supplements, yoga, electromagnetic and laser devices. Children begin studying the <b>multiple</b> <b>uses</b> of medicinal plants in primary school, learning to grow and tend their own plots of aloe, chamomile, and mint, and later they conduct scientific studies about their uses. Radio and Television programs instruct people on how to relieve common stomach upset and headaches by pressing key points. Acupuncture is offered at all three levels of health care. Cuban biochemists have produced {{a number of new}} alternative medicines, including PPG (policosanol), a natural product derived from sugarcane wax that is effective at reducing total cholesterol and LDL levels, and Vimang, a natural product derived from the bark of mango trees.|$|E

40|$|Institutional {{arrangements}} have {{a profound}} impact on the use and management of <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> commons. The emergent question is whether existing institutional arrangements governing <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> commons are meeting sustainability needs and delivering desirable outcomes for stakeholders and communities. Sustainability has posed particular challenges to the rationality of bureaucratic organization and decision making. The emerging paradigm for sustainability governance emphasizes systems approaches, adaptive management, incentives, collaborative governance, decentralization, communicative planning, and conflict resolution. However, in many cases, the delivery of these approaches in practice requires substantial institutional change and this must be based on {{a deeper understanding of the}} relationships between institutions and behavior. Using Australia’s Outback Environments as the context for study, this paper will outline a general approach for understanding institutions in <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> contexts and evaluating institutional efficacy in <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> commons.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{cross contamination}} of blood cultures associated with <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices, which {{are widely used}} in clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce labour costs. METHODS: Systematic analysis of 13, 880 blood culture results in a large teaching hospital where <b>multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices were employed. RESULTS: Nine series of potential cross contamination were identified in a 12 month period. Four series involved coagulase negative staphylococci and were unlikely to represent true cross contamination. Five series involved blood cultures which had significant bacterial growth {{at the time of}} venting. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Multiple</b> <b>use</b> venting devices can be associated with cross contamination of blood cultures. This may result from contamination of the internal lumen of the venting device which is not exposed to the biocide. Medical microbiologists should consider the possibility of cross contamination associated with venting procedures when interpreting blood culture results.
