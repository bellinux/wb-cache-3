5|$|Bloody Fun Day is {{a puzzle}} Flash game {{developed}} by Urban Squall {{and published by}} Kongregate on March 12, 2009. Players control one {{of a family of}} three grim reapers and are tasked with moving around an island of hexagonal tiles, killing creatures called Cuties in order to replenish their own life force. Cuties come in four colors. Only the red ones restore life; the others charge special abilities that give the player <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> kill further Cuties.|$|E

The day before a home game, the UNC ticket office will put {{returned}} tickets on sale, and UNC also has a partnership with StubHub, expanding the available market for ticket resales. In the past, almost all tickets were allocated to students and season ticket sales, with almost no conference games available for public sale.|$|E
500|$|In her Street Fighter V incarnation, Ibuki's playstyle is {{different}} than in Street Fighter IV, becoming a [...] "resource-heavy" [...] character. She has gained new special moves such as to dodge-teleport, glide, and throw bombs with different fuses, making her even more distracting and unpredicatble. According to Capcom, [...] "Ibuki {{has always been a}} very mobile character with various target combos, but she now has even <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> mix-up the opponent with the ability to glide through the air and toss out ninja bombs, making it very difficult to predict where she will land and where her next attack will come from. Kunais have also been a cornerstone of her playstyle, but now players will have to be much more strategic in their use as she can only stock five at a time before she has to quickly obtain another set." ...|$|E

His strength gives him <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> go against Batman. Bane has shown {{to be capable of}} lifting 15 tons.

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.6 out of 10, writing [...] "it {{might be a}} little too {{straightforward}} in spots, but it does make for a solid action game."

[...] more monsters, <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> do them in, and perhaps some slightly more-involving puzzles would have probably made the game feel more in-depth. But even taking this into consideration, The Suffering is a fun action game." ...|$|E

[...] According to Gardner, there are <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. [...] Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling [...] "should be to develop intelligences and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences.

2500|$|In 1985, Louisiana {{journalist}} John Maginnis awarded Gunter {{the designation}} [...] "Best Bill Killer": Gunter [...] "knows <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{kill a bill}} than the lobbyists know how to introduce them. The rhetorical leader to Earl Long, Gunter has the plain talk and pea-patchisms to puncture opponents' slick and sloppy arguments.

A labor representative, Gunter is totally unintimidated by any form of arm-twisting, from gubernatorial on down. When not disposing of legislative garbage, he takes care of mundane local bills for his police jury and school board—unglamorous chores that he takes very seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Postmodern {{designers}} were in {{the beginning}} stages of what we now refer to as [...] "graphic design". They created works beginning in the 1970s without any set adherence to rational order and formal organization. They also seemed to entirely {{pay no attention to}} traditional conventions such as legibility. Another characteristic of postmodern graphic design is that [...] "retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and pastiche were all conspicuous trends. Each had its own sites and venues, detractors and advocates". Yet, while postmodern design did not consist of one unified graphic style, the movement was an expressive and playful time for designers who searched for more and <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> go against the system. Key influential postmodern graphic designers include Wolfgang Weingart, April Greiman, Tibor Kalman, and Jamie Reid.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{the text}} of most pages, there are usually {{a large number of}} {{hypertext}} links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more [...] "native" [...] to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain [...] "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an ad hoc, unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically [...] "tag" [...] pages with categories or keywords, {{to make it easier for}} other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on cold weather cycling might [...] "tag" [...] this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.|$|E
2500|$|Pitchfork stated [...] "T.I. {{has always}} been a great rapper, warm and fluid and confident, his loose elastic voice winding under tracks with force and finesse. Before every other {{mainstream}} rapper was talking about drugs, he was doing it with a weary lived-in authority, proudly defiant and sheepishly defensive at the same time, bragging about getting money but lamenting the fact that he only had one way to do it. But great rappers don't always make great albums, and every one of T.I.'s previous full-lengths had a fatal flaw: desperate grabs at radio love, grossly insincere sex-jams, cobbled-together non-cohesion, or all three. Last summer, I thought Young Jeezy's [...] (2005) was the album T.I. should've made. Young Jeezy isn't half the rapper that T.I. is, but his album-- stunning in its focus and monolithic swagger and deeply nihilistic in worldview-- had more cinematic sweep than anything his progenitor had ever done." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters described the album as a stunning classic saying that [...] "Clifford “T.I.” Harris is one of America’s greatest songwriters. I’m not just talking about hip-hop, either—even if you add in all the other genres that people go all gaga over, T.I. strides this narrow world like a colossus. No one is smarter, no one constructs tighter songs, and no one has <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> score. This is proven over and over again on King. T.I. is the whole package: gritty, smooth, smart, dangerous, introspective, and wise. And while it’s pretty early in 2006 to talk about albums of the year, this record says it’s time to start talking." [...] Stylus Magazine noted [...] "T.I.’s path to a self-made mythology hinges not just on his ability to trumpet himself, but to make his locale and history vital. King, T.I.’s latest, proves, among other things, that his legacy is tied into his town, and his town, Atlanta, is the true Southern metropolis: primal, spiritual, refined, and delicate at the same time. New Orleans may have the painful religious symbolism, Memphis the working-class spirit, and Houston the expansive, halting sound, but Atlanta is the melting pot of bourgeoisie, aristocracy, and neighborhood hustlers. Lil Wayne may be the chaperone of this coast, but T.I. is the CFO. Song to song production is generally top-shelf. From barn-burning “Top Back” to the slyly tender “Gone,” every chime chimes when it’s supposed to, every snare clacks right into place. Individually, Grand Hustle in-house rising star Toomp gobbles up the lion’s share of the praise: the cataclysmic “What You Know” and ostentatious “Bankhead” both soar. Mannie Fresh and Just Blaze inlay T.I.’s lines with velveteen strings and swirling drums respectively. King isn’t complacent enough to act like all the wars are fought and all the gods are dead; T.I. sees his legacy and city very much up for grabs. A city, a scene and his legacy are unfinished, and while King won’t be T.I.’s last, or, hopefully, best section of his mosaic, it’s the perfection of his aesthetic thus far." ...|$|E
