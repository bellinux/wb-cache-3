40|$|Abstract: Countries {{strive to}} attract foreign direct {{investment}} hoping that knowledge brought by <b>multinationals</b> will spill over to domestic producers. While the literature has {{cast doubt on the}} existence of spillovers within industries, it has found evidence of spillovers from <b>multinationals</b> to the supplying sectors. However, the existing studies rely on industry-level proxies rather than information on actual relationships between suppliers and <b>multinationals.</b> This study goes one step further by employing a unique dataset from the Czech Republic where such relationships can be identified. It finds evidence consistent with both high productivity firms having a higher probability of supplying <b>multinationals</b> as well as suppliers learning from their relationships with <b>multinationals...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how <b>multinationals</b> affect {{underdeveloped}} regions through {{the generation of}} linkages. It is shown that the linkage effect of <b>multinationals</b> on the host country {{is more likely to}} be favorable when the good that <b>multinationals</b> produce uses intermediate goods intensively, when there are large costs of communication between the headquarters and the production plant, and when the home and host countries are not too different in terms of the variety of intermediate goods produced. If these conditions are reversed, then <b>multinationals</b> could even hurt the developing economy, formalizing the idea that <b>multinationals</b> may create enclave economies within developing countries.

40|$|US {{productivity}} growth accelerated after 1995 (unlike Europe's), particularly in sectors that intensively use information technologies (IT). Using two new micro panel datasets {{we show that}} US <b>multinationals</b> operating in Europe also experienced a "productivity miracle.

Furthermore, establishments taken over by US <b>multinationals</b> (but not by non-US <b>multinationals)</b> increased the productivity of their IT. Combining pan-European firm-level IT data with our management practices survey, {{we find that the}} US IT related productivity advantage is primarily due to its tougher "people management" practices.

5|$|A {{majority}} of <b>multinational</b> corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, <b>multinational</b> corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of research to}} date investigating optimal tariffs {{in the presence of}} <b>multinationals</b> finds a knife-edge result where, in equilibrium, all foreign firms are either <b>multinationals</b> or exporters. By utilizing a model of heterogenous firms, I am able to dull the knife edge, resulting in equilibria in which both pure exporters and <b>multinationals</b> coexist. I utilize this model to study the case of endogenously chosen tariffs (which, in some cases results in a subsidy). I find that, if <b>multinationals</b> are present in equilibrium, the optimal tariff is lower than in the case where <b>multinationals</b> are excluded as a choice of firm structure. Moreover, I show that the socially optimal tariff is a subsidy, contrary to the standard optimum of free trade. This results in no <b>multinationals</b> in the socially efficient outcome. Finally, I find the typical result that tariff competition results in inefficiently high tariffs (or inefficiently low subsidies). ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{attractiveness}} of European Union regions for location of <b>multinationals</b> in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. Using data on 8, 543 foreign subsidiaries established in 229 regions of the European Union over the period 1998 - 2008 we find that on average, the location probability increases with regional demand, agglomeration economies, technological development, flexibility of labour markets, and information technology infrastructure. The determinants of the location choice of ICT <b>multinationals</b> are different for regions in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe. While in Western Europe, regions with higher GDP per capita are preferred for both ICT <b>multinationals</b> in manufacturing and service sectors, in Central and Eastern Europe, regions with lower GDP per capita attract the bulk of ICT <b>multinationals</b> in the service sector. Unemployment rates appear negatively correlated with the probability of location in the whole European Union and Western Europe, while they increase attractiveness for regions in Central and Eastern Europe. Some determinants are also found to have heterogeneous effects on <b>multinationals</b> from different countries. In particular, US <b>multinationals</b> are not sensitive to labour costs while EU <b>multinationals</b> respond to this facto...|$|R

40|$|This study compares {{knowledge}} spillovers from <b>multinationals</b> to local firms in China between the automobile and electronics industries. In {{the automobile industry}} we find that <b>multinationals</b> in the assembly industry affect vertical spillovers to domestic parts supply firms, and horizontal spillovers also exist between domestic parts suppliers. In contrast, we cannot find vertical spillover effects of <b>multinationals</b> in the assembly industry to domestic suppliers in the electronics industry, only horizontal spillover effects from <b>multinationals</b> to domestic supply firms can be found. A different pattern of technology spillover suggests the importance of customization of FDI policy by industry. ...|$|R

The empirical results suggest that the determinants associated with horizontal and vertical <b>multinationals</b> have become increasingly relevant between 1974 and 1994. Horizontal <b>multinationals</b> are increasingly associated with low plant-level economies of scale, large trade costs, and relative factor endowment similarities, while vertical <b>multinationals</b> are increasingly associated with relative factor endowment differences. Hence, integration has resulted in increased competitive pressures to increase efficiency in exploiting economies of scale, and specialisation according to comparative advantages...|$|R
