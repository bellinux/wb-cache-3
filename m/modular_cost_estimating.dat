40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a {{discretization}} reformulation technique {{in the context}} of a facility location problem with <b>modular</b> link <b>costs.</b> We present a so-called 'traditional' model and a straightforward discretized model with a general objective function whose variable coefficients are computed by solving a simple knapsack problem. We show that the linear programming relaxation of the discretized model dominates the linear programming relaxation of the original model. The discretized model suggests quite intuitive valid inequalities that considerably improve the linear programming relaxation of the original model. Computational results based on randomly generated data show that {{in the context of}} problems with <b>modular</b> <b>costs,</b> the proposed discretized models perform significantly better than the 'traditional' models.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the internal costing practices employed by commercial and engineering disciplines of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for generating estimates at the conceptual design stage of complex hardware products. It examines {{whether there is a}} formal structure in the interaction between the two groups that can be represented within a model. The aim is to develop a framework that will formalise and improve the communication of commercial and engineering disciplines in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating.</b> A literature review examines the role of different costing techniques and the information requirements for generating <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The review identifies that {{there is a lack of}} research in the information requirements for <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> of specific manufacturing industries, and that the interaction of commercial and engineering disciplines of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> at conceptual design stage is hindered by the different focuses of these groups. By conducting a survey study the author identifies the internal practice in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for the automotive industry. The survey establishes that in order to improve the internal practice it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that formalises and enables the reuse of the <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and improves the interaction between the two groups. The author identifies a common <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process for the automotive industry. This study establishes the required data and information elements and information sources that need to be collected in order to have reliable data infrastructure. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functions in such a way that will enable the development of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model at the conceptual design stage, which will improve interaction between the commercial and engineering groups. The function-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process becomes the focus of detailed studies using experts from the automotive industry. This results in a generic framework that provides a formalised structure to represent functional requirements in the form of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model. The thesis concludes that product functions need to be captured and analysed during the conceptual development of a product and be associated to <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The developed results provide both groups of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> a structured, consistent approach to developing <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> at the conceptual design stage.

40|$|Understanding how the {{building}} design influences construction costs is a challenging task for estimators. Estimators {{must recognize the}} design conditions that affect construction costs and customize the <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> accordingly. Estimators have different preferences for {{how and when to}} adjust a project’s activities, resources, and resource productivity rates that form the basis of a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate.</b> Current tools and methodologies lack ways to help estimators customize construction cost information according to their preferences and maintain <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> as the design changes based on those preferences. This paper describes the activity-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process we formalized to help estimators customize a project’s activities, resources, and resource productivity rates based on their preferences and the particular features in a given product model. We implemented and tested the process in a prototype called Activity-based <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> (ACE).

40|$|The {{results are}} {{documented}} {{of an investigation}} into current <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> practices of contractors for construction projects. A questionnaire survey of contractors was undertaken, in which the respondents are classified into four groups based on their turnover namely: very small, small, medium and large firms. The survey indicates that contractors, irrespective of size, continue to undertake <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> predominantly for construction planning purposes, including the preparation of tenders and cost control of projects during the execution stage and, to a lesser extent, for construction project evaluation. Recent developments in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> methods and tools that consider risks and variability in <b>cost</b> <b>estimates,</b> {{such as the use of}} range estimating and parametric estimating techniques, have not been adopted by contractors.

40|$|Escalation of {{right-of-way}} (ROW) {{costs have}} been shown to be a prime contributor to project cost escalation in the highway industry. Two problems contribute to ROW cost escalation: 1) the ROW cost estimation and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process generally lacks structure and definition as compared to other areas of cost estimation; and 2) there is a lack of integration and communication between those responsible for ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> and those responsible for general project <b>cost</b> <b>estimating.</b> The research for this thesis was preceded by a literature review to establish the basis for the study. Data collection was completed through interviews of seven state highway agencies (SHAs) and two local public agencies (LPAs). The findings of the research are presented in a set of ROW flowcharts which document the steps, inputs, and outputs of the ROW cost estimation and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process. Three ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and a <b>cost</b> management process take place throughout project development. An effort was made from the onset of the research to relate the ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process to the first four project development phases (planning, programming. preliminary design, and final design). There are five flowcharts produced as a result of this research: 1) an agency-level flowchart showing all <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and the interaction of ROW with the project development process; 2) a conceptual ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during planning; 3) a baseline ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during programming; 4) an update ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during preliminary design to include a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management loop; and 5) a ROW cost management flowchart which depicts the required steps during final design. Although selected SHA contacts provided input following the development of the flowcharts, the flowcharts were only validated to a limited extent due to time and budget constraints. These flowcharts attempt to address the two contributing problems to ROW cost escalation by providing structure to the ROW cost estimation process and by developing the ROW process flowcharts linked to the project development process. Based on the input provided by SHA contacts, the flowcharts appear to have the potential to provide guidance to SHAs in improving the accuracy of ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> through addressing these two problems...|$|R

The aim is to develop a framework that will structure, formalise and improve the ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> process. Literature review examines current situation regarding ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> and the information requirements for generating <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The review identifies that research concentrates on Embedded Systems manufacturing cost estimation, {{there is a lack of}} research regarding D&D cost estimation, as well as on the information requirements for generating D&D <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> By conducting an industrial survey, the author identifies the internal practice on ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> for the automotive and aerospace industries and identifies trends, commonalties and differences within and between them. The survey establishes that in order to improve the ES D&D <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimating</b> process, it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that will avoid issues with shortage of information imposed by suppliers and will link the Embedded System’s specifications with the system’s actual implementation and expected functionality. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functionality in such a way that will enable the development of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> framework at the specification’s design stage. The framework is developed in three parts for hardware, software and integration and reuse. The ES hardware design and development effort is predicted using a complexity based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> approach. The research has demonstrated that Use Case Points can be used to predict software development effort for ES software development when the specification is expressed as use cases.

25|$|Barker et al. (2007, p.79) {{assessed}} {{the literature on}} <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for the Kyoto Protocol. Due to non-US participation in the Kyoto treaty, <b>costs</b> <b>estimates</b> {{were found to be}} much lower than those estimated in the previous IPCC Third Assessment Report. Without US participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, <b>costs</b> were <b>estimated</b> at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1–1.1%. Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs without US participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2–2%. These <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.|$|R
