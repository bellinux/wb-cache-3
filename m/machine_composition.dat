5000|$|The term [...] "process" [...] {{as defined}} in 35 U.S.C. 100, means process, art or method, and {{includes}} a new use of a known process, <b>machine,</b> manufacture, <b>composition</b> of matter, or material.|$|R

50|$|CAL, and the {{associated}} tools and APIs forming the Quark Framework, was conceived in 1998 within Seagate Software (later Crystal Decisions, now Business Objects) {{as a way to}} enable a common framework for sharing business logic across business intelligence products. A framework was desired that would allow data behaviour to be captured, at all levels of abstraction, and for these components to be composable into the actual data flows that individual products required. In general terms, such a system had to provide a way to express data behaviour declaratively, with universal composition and typing laws. In essence, this places the problem firmly in the domain of functional languages, and the desire to allow <b>machine</b> <b>compositions</b> of functions without incurring increasing efficiency penalties strongly suggested a non-strict evaluation semantic.|$|R

40|$|We outline a {{framework}} within which <b>machine</b> <b>compositions</b> may be evaluated objectively. In particular, the framework allows statements about those compositions to be refuted {{on the basis of}} empirical experimentation. We consider this to be fundamental if we wish to evaluate the degree to which our programs achieve their compositional aims. Furthermore, {{a review of the literature}} reveals that this is a largely ignored aspect of research into algorithmic composition. Our framework involves four components: specifying the compositional aims; inducing a critic from a set of example musical phrases; composing music that satisfies the critic; and evaluating specific claims about the compositions in experiments using human subjects. We describe a system which exemplifies these four stages and which demonstrates the practicality of the framework. Finally, the application of the framework to the evaluation of musical creativity is discussed and directions for future research are suggested...|$|R

First, it must fall within {{one of the four}} statutory categories of acceptable subject matter: process, <b>machine,</b> manufacture, or <b>composition</b> of matter. Second, it must not be directed to subject matter encompassing a judicially recognized exception: laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.|$|R

[...] Since Bilski's method failed that test, it is patent-ineligible.|$|R

40|$|The main {{characteristic}} of machine tool system, providing {{the most efficient}} multi-axis processing, is machine volumetric accuracy, which may be demonstrated in the machine working space. The development of methods and means of controlling volumetric accuracy {{is a very important}} engineering and process task. Solving this issue may ensure competitive ability of the domestic fixtures and tools for multi-axis form making during the treatment with the help of power tools. Early project stage is the most important one, as the success of the machine project itself highly depends on the right choice of arrangement. In this research, we presented design scheme of machine-tool unit, stated its initial and boundary conditions, and also there was developed a model of comparative assessment of elastic displacement in the working space. Volumetric accuracy is formed by means of inaccuracy space field of the processing system, which occur in the formation zone under the influence of agitation, which may be determined by simulation and analytical modeling of machine tool system. Within the framework of this research, there was developed the method of comparative assessment of volumetric accuracy of multi-axis <b>machine</b> <b>compositions</b> with not less than 5 interpolate axis...|$|R

50|$|Throughout its history, Intertype {{machines}} were typically better built and engineered than Mergenthaler's, with simpler, more effective mechanisms. However, while both Mergenthaler and Lanston Monotype were known for producing new and innovative type designs, {{virtually all of}} Intertype's typefaces were derivatives of, or supplied to them, by the Bauer Type Foundry. The only type designer of note associated with Intertype was Edwin W. Shaar, who pioneered in adapting script faces for <b>machine</b> <b>composition.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Originally Dante was cut {{for use on}} {{the private}} handpress, but Monotype had already {{expressed}} interest in issuing Dante for <b>machine</b> <b>composition</b> before 1955.

Matthew Carter, in his twenties at the time, was recruited to cut some of the initial punches of the semibold. Monotype issued its Dante in 1957.|$|E
50|$|Century Catalogue (as spelled in ATF {{specimen}} books) {{had a lower}} x-height than Century Expanded but, despite longer ascenders, {{adheres to}} the same general design. Century Catalogue Italic is basically a re-working of Baskerville Italic, only the A, V and W being different. Both were designed by M.F. Benton and released by A.T.F. in 1917. As far as is known, Century Catalogue was never copied by other foundries, for <b>machine</b> <b>composition,</b> or as cold type. Digital versions may exist.|$|E
5000|$|Monticello is a typeface, a transitional, {{based upon}} the Roman Pica no. 1 foundry type made by the American type foundry Binny & Ronaldson in the 1790s.

In 1949, Linotype Corporation issued a Monticello typeface for hot metal <b>machine</b> <b>composition</b> for the published edition of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson. A digital version, also named Monticello, was issued in 2003 by Matthew Carter for the Jefferson Papers. Jefferson knew and corresponded with James Ronaldson.|$|E
