One of the songs, [...] "When You Told Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul.

All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's <b>my</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E

[...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E

[...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born."

500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on <b>my</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E
