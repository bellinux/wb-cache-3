A study realized by the ICT-BeFemto project [3] shows that a financial benefit is always obtained whatever the business model is: one-off fee (the customer pays for the equipment and pays a <b>monthly</b> <b>fee),</b> decreased <b>monthly</b> <b>fee,</b> increased <b>monthly</b> <b>fee,</b> or free.

40|$|Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index (HOX) is a hedonic {{price index}} that {{illustrates}} the price development of condominiums in Sweden, {{and that is}} obtained by using regression technique. Concerns have been raised regarding {{the influence of the}} <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> on the index. Low fee condominiums could be more popular because of the low <b>monthly</b> cost, high <b>fee</b> condominiums tend to sell for a lower price due to the high monthly cost. As the price of a condominium rises the importance of the <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> decreases. Because of this the <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> might affect the regression that produces the index. Furthermore,housing cooperatives are usually indebted. These loans are paid off by the <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> which can be considered to finance a debt that few are aware of. This issue has been investigated by iteratively estimating the importance of the level of debt in order to find a model that better takes into account the possible impact of the <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> on the price development. Due to a somewhat simplified model that produces index values with many cases of high standard deviation, no conclusive evidence has been found that confirms the initial hypothesis. Nevertheless, converting part of the <b>monthly</b> <b>fee</b> into debt has shown a general improvement of fitting a regression equation to the data. It is therefore recommended that real data on debt in housing cooperatives be tested in Valuegu...|$|R
