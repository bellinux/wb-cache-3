5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for <b>moral</b> <b>development,</b> and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to <b>moral</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

40|$|With {{the rise}} of {{genomics}} promises and concerns have emerged about future possibilities for screening of genetic susceptibilities to common diseases in the population. In this article we start from the assumption that for {{a better understanding of}} the future ethical implications of genetic susceptibility screening we need to address the interaction between technological and <b>moral</b> <b>developments</b> in society. We introduce a techno-ethical scenario approach and show how it may help us to explore more systematically potential future interactions between technological and <b>moral</b> <b>developments</b> in the field of genetic susceptibility screening. The first step is a historical account of population screening, focussing on the ways in which emerging practices of (genetic) screening have been mediated by an evolving moral landscape in our society. Based on this history we present a techno-ethical scenario of the future, showing how technological developments may shape conditions in our society in which the introduction and use of genetic susceptibility tests more and more become a matter of private decisions, reinforcing claims to individual self-determination as a deeply rooted value in the moral landscape of our society...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{participant}} observation {{case study of}} an elementary school in Japan. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate how Japanese elementary schools emphasize <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> as well as academic achievement. For this purpose, the Japanese educational history and cultural aspects of <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> were studied. In addition, one particular elementary school was observed and seven teachers were interviewed. In a typical elementary school, <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> promote respect for society and the established order; diligence; self-criticism; and valuing group goals above individual interests. In this research, the time allocation and contents for <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> were studied as to how these are actually integrated into the school curriculum. The interviewed teachers were two each in the first, fourth, and sixth grades and one administrator. A questionnaire was designed to analyze eight variables: 1. Teacher characteristics 2. Activities designed to enhance academic achievement 3. Activities designed to enhance <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> 4. Grade integrated activities 5. The general organization of the curriculum 6. Principles used to organize the elements of the subjects taught 7. The development of flexible plans or source units 8. The process of curriculum development. Variables 5 through 8 are based on Tyler's "Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction" (1949). The results of the observations demonstrated that there was strong emphasis on <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> as well as academic achievement. The objectives of <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> were exercised throughout pupils' school lives. This case study offers not only much valuable information and many practical ideas for <b>moral</b> and social <b>development</b> but also insight into the pupil-teacher relationship, curriculum development, and a possible teacher-support system for American elementary schools...|$|R
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially {{the sales of}} Max and Moritz were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> of young people.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of <b>moral</b> <b>development.</b> Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} whether ethnic membership was a core construct in the <b>moral</b> identity <b>development</b> {{of adolescents}} in Zulu child-headed households. A {{convenience sample of}} 60 participants (31 male and 29 female) were recruited for the study from a mixed urban and rural neighbourhood of a South African municipality. Data on the lived experience {{of the participants in}} relation to their ethnic identity were collected using semi-structured questionnaires, face to face interviews and field notes. The qualitative data were thematically analyzed and incorporated with quantitative data. In the analysis of the quantitative data, the participants’ responses were analyzed in relation to traditional and modern Zulu norms using frequency tables. Results suggest that participants carried a blended identity combining traditional and modern self-images and that neither presented as a core construct for <b>moral</b> identity <b>development,</b> but that spirituality and a attitude of giving are identified aspects to be utilized in <b>moral</b> identity <b>development.</b> [URL]...|$|R

5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind <b>moral</b> <b>development,</b> as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to <b>moral</b> <b>development.</b> French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E
5|$|Education in Malta is {{compulsory}} through age {{sixteen and}} is offered through three different providers: the state, the church, {{and the private}} sector. The state is responsible for promoting education and instruction and ensuring universal access to education for all Maltese citizens {{the existence of a}} system of schools and institutions accessible to all Maltese citizens. The objectives of education in Malta include intellectual and <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> and the preparation of every citizen to contribute productively to the national economy. Although Maltese citizens had access to education during the Arab occupation of 870 to 1090, the arrival of a number of religious orders in the following four centuries brought religious-based education to the island for wealthy families. The arrival of the Knights Hospitaller saw the establishment of the University of Malta, around which a number of primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions were established. Education in Malta has been universally available at the primary level since the ejection of the Knights Hospitaller by the French in 1798, when state-funded elementary schooling was established. In 1878, English replaced Italian as the primary language of instruction, and education was made compulsory in 1946 in response to a number of children not attending school due to poverty between World Wars One and Two. The age at which education became compulsory was lowered to five years in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose over {{authority}} {{to control the}} upbringing of his heir-presumptive. As head of the Coburg family, Ernest would normally {{have been able to}} arrange Alfred's education and general upbringing unchallenged. This however was not the case. Alfred was torn between his British birth and his German inheritance. This was partly because Alfred was second-in-line to the United Kingdom until the birth of his nephew Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1864. One example of the many problems of his education concerned the language he would speak. Although he grew up learning German, his native language was decided to be English. In addition, a naval career was chosen for Alfred, a common profession for a British prince but almost unheard of for a German prince. Ernest also wanted Alfred to be educated in Coburg, but his brother refused. Albert's refusal most likely stemmed from the negative British reaction that would have inevitably occurred and the fact that Albert was fearful of Alfred's <b>moral</b> <b>development.</b> Thus despite Ernest's protests, he went unheeded in Albert's lifetime. In 1863, Ernest told Victoria {{that it was time for}} Alfred to leave the navy and enter a German university. By March of the following year, it was decided that Alfred would attend Bonn University but be left to consider his future, as he was having reservations over permanently residing outside England. The matter was eventually resolved; Alfred came to accept his inheritance, and Victoria understood and accepted that Ernest needed to be involved in the upbringing of his heir-presumptive, with a strong German element added to his education and (carefully chaperoned) visits to Coburg.|$|E

5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of <b>moral</b> <b>development</b> there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E

40|$|Calls for the {{expansion}} of ethics education in the business and accounting curricula have resulted in a variety of interventions including additional material on ethical cases, the code of conduct, and the development of new courses devoted to ethical development [Lampe, J. : 1996]. The issue of whether ethics should be taught has been addressed by many authors [see for example: Hanson, K. O. : 1987; Huss, H. F. and D. M. Patterson: 1993; Jones, T. M. : 1988 – 1989; Kerr, D. S. and L. M. Smith: 1995; Loeb, S. E. : 1988; McDonald, G. M. and G. D. Donleavy: 1995]. The question addressed in this paper is not whether ethics should be taught but whether accounting students can reason more ethically after an intervention based on a discrete and dedicated course on accounting ethics. The findings in this paper indicate that a discrete intervention emphasising dilemma discussion has a positive and significant effect on students’ <b>moral</b> reasoning and <b>development.</b> The data collected from interviews suggest that the salient influences on <b>moral</b> judgement <b>development</b> include: learning theories of ethics particularly Kohlberg’s theory of cognitive moral reasoning and development; peer learning; and moral discourse. The implications from the findings in this study suggest that moral reasoning is responsive to particular types of ethics intervention and educators should carefully plan their attempts to foster <b>moral</b> judgement <b>development.</b> Copyright Springer 2006 accounting students, ethics education, ethics interventions, moral discourse, <b>moral</b> reasoning and <b>development,</b> Kohlberg, DIT,...|$|R
