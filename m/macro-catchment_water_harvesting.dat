40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of a meta-analysis of the peer reviewed literature on <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technologies, with a focus on the crop yield impacts of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in semi-arid Africa and Asia. Main aim of the analysis is to assess whether <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> significantly improves crop yields, and whether the type of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technology {{and the quality of the}} rainy season correlate with the change in yield. We find that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> improves crop yields significantly, and that the relative impact of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> on crop yields is largest in low rainfall years. Smallholder farmers may still be reluctant to invest in <b>water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> however, as in regions with low agricultural productivity the returns to investment are limited.

The role of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in achieving sustainable agricultural intensification and specified resilience was explored. Suitable areas for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the Upper Blue Nile basin were identified. The usefulness of the Curve Number method for surface runoff estimation was evaluated, and was found to perform satisfactorily. The impact of climate change in the Lake Tana sub-basin was studied. A decision support system was developed for locating and sizing of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds in the SWAT model. Methodological developments enabled analysis {{of the implications of}} <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensification in a meso-scale watershed in the Lake Tana sub-basin.

There is considerable potential for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> in the Upper Blue Nile Basin. Rainfall may increase in the Lake Tana sub-basin due to climate change. Supplementary irrigation from <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds and better nutrient application increased staple crop production by up to three-fold. Moreover, a substantial amount of cash crop was produced using dry seasonal irrigation. <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> altered the streamflow regime, and reduced sediment loss from the watershed.        <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> can {{play an important role in}} food security.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{systems have}} {{improved}} productivity in various regions in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, {{they can help}} retain water in landscapes, build resilience against droughts and dry spells, and thereby contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification. However, there is no strong empirical evidence that shows the effects of intensification of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> on upstream–downstream social–ecological systems at a landscape scale. In this paper we develop a decision support system (DSS) for locating and sizing <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> ponds in a hydrological model, which enables assessments of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> intensification on upstream–downstream ecosystem services in meso-scale watersheds. The DSS was used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case-study area located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. We found that supplementary irrigation in combination with nutrient application increased simulated teff (Eragrostis tef, staple crop in Ethiopia) production up to three times, compared to the current practice. Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7. 66 t/ha (median). <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting,</b> therefore, {{can play an important}} role in increasing local- to regional-scale food security through increased and more stable food production and generation of extra income from the sale of cash crops. The annual total irrigation water consumption was ~ 4 %– 30 % of the annual water yield from the entire watershed. In general, <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> resulted in a reduction in peak flows and an increase in low flows. <b>Water</b> <b>harvesting</b> substantially reduced sediment yield leaving the watershed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} spatial-scale {{variations}} on <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> has been evaluated at micro-catchment, hillside/farm, and watershed (=catchment) scales in three relatively dry environments in Syria, Pakistan and Egypt. Micro-catchment <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> captures localized runoff only through independent micro-catchment systems {{and is not}} influenced by hill slope runoff and stream flows. In Syria, {{it was found that}} only a fraction of total runoff from a catchment is collected, with no significant effect on water supply downstream. Therefore, it is less sensitive to spatial-scale variations (rainfall, topography, soils) and it is less likely to create upstream-downstream water-use conflicts. Micro-catchment <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> established fodder shrubs, with 3 - 7 fold growth improvement and 27 to 90 % survival rate. In contrast, spatial rainfall and geo-hydrological variations greatly influenced the potential of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> at the watershed scale in north-west Egypt. The study revealed the importance of scientific data and appropriate assessment methods. Due to potential socio-economic disputes, the institutional arrangements for water allocation and conflict resolution are critical at this scale. At the farm scale, the low-cost farm runoff structures (US$ 48 per structure), effectively regulated the runoff, reduced terrace damage and improved field soil moisture, and were shown to be suitable for <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> on terraces in Barani, Pakistan.

40|$|Rainfall {{shortage}} and variability constrain {{crop production}} of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia {{and climate change}} may even aggravate this problem. An attractive method to mitigate this is <b>water</b> <b>harvesting.</b> This thesis examines the economic aspects of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> by exploring optimal water use {{and the impact of}} <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> using micro-econometric analyses of cross-section and panel data collected from Ethiopian farmers in 2005 and 2010. In the first empirical chapter, the study estimates marginal values and elasticitiesof <b>harvested</b> <b>water</b> in the production of three vegetables to determine whether water allocation is economically optimal. The results are mixed, although the estimated marginal product values between onions and tomatoes show that farmers on average allocate water economically across these two crops. The descriptive data show that the share of irrigated land is lower at larger farms. Because farm size may increase in the future, it is interesting to investigate what determines the share of irrigated land in relation to farm size. A random-effects tobit model is appropriate to estimate this relationship. The result shows that access to both credit and markets, farm-size, region, aridity, and plot distance to water source all affect the share. Encouraging <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> requires flexible and effective variables that will work also for larger farms. Despite its weather-risk reducing advantage, the average disadoption rate of <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technology between 2005 and 2010 was as high as 42 %. To find out why farmers disadopt, binary choice models are estimated to investigate the factors that cause disadoption. Based on the estimation results, it is concluded that increasing availability of plastic sheets and labour-saving equipment (water pumps), easier market and credit access, and the cultivation of perennials can reduce disadoption. The last empirical chapter focuses on the relation between <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> and fertilizer use. Due to weather risk, farmers may limit the use of purchased fertilizer, thereby continuing to grow a high share of low-risk and low-yield crops. To establish whether <b>harvested</b> <b>water</b> encourages fertilizer use, two variants of random-effect models are estimated. The results strongly support the idea that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> technology induces fertilizer use, indicating that <b>water</b> <b>harvesting</b> can increase fertilizer use- and hence crop yields- in Ethiopia.
