5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{experience with}} MCA, the Clarks moved forward. The band released their first live album, recorded at Nick's Fat City night club on Pittsburgh's South Side and aptly-titled Live, in 1998. Scott Blasey, in turn, released his second solo album, Shine, in 1999. The group continued {{to perform at}} packed shows throughout the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, but did not immediately record a follow-up to Someday <b>Maybe.</b> However, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> experience a new chance at broader success {{with the arrival of}} the New Millennium. In late 1999, the band teamed with producer Justin Niebank, who had previously worked with Blues Traveler, Eric Clapton and John Hiatt, to begin work on a fifth studio album.|$|R
60|$|But {{you know}} a young person can't wait very well when he is {{impatient}} to find a thing out. We talked it over, and by and by Jim said {{it was such a}} black night, now, that it wouldn't be no risk to swim down to the big raft and crawl aboard and listen--they would talk about Cairo, because <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be calculating to go ashore there for a spree, <b>maybe,</b> or anyway <b>they</b> <b>would</b> send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or something. Jim had a wonderful level head, for a nigger: he could most always start a good plan when you wanted one.|$|R
60|$|Somewhat {{against his}} will, Nat {{walked toward the}} end of the garden. He wished to escape from Mrs. Wadsworth and the others, but he was afraid Dave and Phil {{contemplated}} doing something disagreeable to him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> give him a sound thrashing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary {{and some}} of the others want to go over to Bluebell Island," [...] said Fred. [...] "They say there are some very fine ferns to be had there, and they thought <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have a chance {{to take some of the}} ferns home." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{did it all}} mean? What was the Professor's plan? <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never know. Maybe {{the ship}} was gone for good; the Old Man had left forever, {{shooting}} into outer space. They might never find out why he had done it, what purpose--if any--had been in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring him in, sir," [...] {{the woman}} said hospitably. [...] "I had four or five niggers till the Yanks came, but they all ran away 'cause <b>they</b> knew <b>they</b> <b>would</b> either be set to work or made to fight; so they went. <b>They</b> said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> come back again when the trouble is over; <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> will and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> won't. At first the niggers about here used {{to look for the}} Yanks coming, but as the news got about of what {{happened}} to those they took from their masters, they concluded they were better off where they were. Call your boy in, sir; call him in!" ...|$|R
60|$|We set {{and talked}} {{a long time}} about his chances, and Tom said he was all right if the pals struck up the river instead of down, but it wasn't likely, because <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> knowed where he was from; more likely <b>they</b> <b>would</b> go right, and dog him all day, him not suspecting, and kill him when it come dark, and take the boots. So we was pretty sorrowful.|$|R
5000|$|Love Lottery â€” Becca {{is really}} worried {{when her parents}} start fighting, and wonders if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> split up. Her {{troubles}} only get worse when her friends meet some new girls from London (Mates,Dates cross-over) and she thinks she's been replaced. Can Becca's parents sort out their problems before it's too late? And can Becca {{face up to the}} girls from London and learn that <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> are not as bad as they might seem? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} {{any more of}} the soldiers, and knew that, for the present, I was safe, though <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> send some dragoons to scour the country when the news came in. I went on at a jog trot till it was quite dark; then I sat down to think what I should do next.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} didn't say {{anything}} to Martha and Mary. I know it would upset them a good deal, and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> think they'd have to write to their mothers about it. Just keep it to yourself. And please don't destroy that letter; it might come in useful some time. Maybe we can trace the handwriting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And with Stirling {{for your}} portion, the modest fellow,' added James. 'Ay, and that's not all. There's the MacAlpin threats me {{with all his}} clan if I dinna give you to him; and Mackay is not behindhand, but will come down with pibroch and braidsword and five hundred caterans to pay his court to you, and make short work of all others. My certie, sisters seem but a cause for threats from reivers, though <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be so uncivil if once they had you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are bad men," [...] she replied. [...] "Some of {{my people}} {{do not believe that}} there are such creatures. But we have a legend--a very old, old legend, that once the men from there came across to Grabritin. They came upon the water, and under the water, and even in the air. They came in great numbers, so that they rolled across the land like a great gray fog. They brought with them thunder and {{lightning}} and smoke that killed, and they fell upon us and slew our people by the thousands and the hundreds of thousands. But at last we drove them back to the water's edge, back into the sea, where many were drowned. Some escaped, and these our people followed--men, women, and even children, we followed them back. That is all. The legend says our people never returned. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> were all killed. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> are still there. But this, also, is in the legend, that as we drove the men back across the water they swore that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> return, and that when they left our shores <b>they</b> <b>would</b> leave no human being alive behind them. I was afraid that you were from there." ...|$|R

6000|$|They were {{beginning}} to get old; the city was almost too much for them. They would pick out some pretty, rustic spot and invest their savings in a tea-room. At five-hundred per cent. they would make enough during three months of summer to keep them {{the rest of the}} year. If they were located on Cape Cod, perhaps they could spend the winter with the Tubbses. They would have a garden; they would keep chickens, dogs, pussies, yes, a cow; they would buy land, acre by acre; they would have a farm to sustain them when they were too old for work; <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> open a whole chain of tea-rooms and ride about supervising them in a motor-car big as a house; they would-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Bulangi {{was a safe}} man. In {{the network}} of crooked {{channels}} no white man could find his way. White men were strong, but very foolish. It was undesirable to fight them, but deception was easy. They were like silly women--they {{did not know the}} use of reason, and he was a match for any of them--went on Babalatchi, with all the confidence of deficient experience. Probably the Dutch would seek Almayer. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> take away their countryman if they were suspicious of him. That would be good. After the Dutch went away Lakamba and Dain would get the treasure without any trouble, and there would be one person less to share it. Did he not speak wisdom? Will Tuan Dain go to Bulangi's house till the danger is over, go at once? ...|$|E
60|$|Now, Jim Leonard said, Pony {{must run}} off right away, and {{not wait for}} the river to rise, or anything. As soon as the river rose, Jim would follow him on the raft; but Pony must start first, and he must take the pike for the city, and sleep in fence corners. They must {{provision}} him, and not eat {{any of the things}} before he started. He must not take a bundle or anything, because if he did people would know he was running off, or <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> think he was a runaway slave from Kentucky, he was so dark-complexioned. At first Pony did not like it, because {{it seemed to him that}} Jim Leonard was backing out; but Jim Leonard said that if two of them started off at the same time, people would just know they were running off, and the constable would take them up before they could get across the corporation line. He said that very likely it would rain in less than a week, and then he could start after Pony on the raft, and be at the Ohio River almost as soon as Pony was.|$|E

50|$|Ackerley's PhD (University of Birmingham) {{covered the}} subject of {{consumer}} awareness of food poisoning and food hygiene. She examined {{the factors that influence}} behaviour change - for example people will not change their behaviour unless they see there is a value in change - if they think that they are unlikely to get food poisoning, or cause it, then <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> can't be bothered to change. Equally if they think that food poisoning {{is not likely to be}} anything more than an upset tummy, then perhaps <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not think it is worth the effort to follow food hygiene practices.|$|R

60|$|One of them {{stayed with}} Pony {{and the little}} boys, and comforted him for the way the rest had left him. He was a fellow who was always telling about Indians, {{and he said that}} if Pony could get to the Indians, anywhere, and they took a fancy to him, they would adopt him into their tribe, if it was just after some old chief had lost a son in battle. <b>Maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> offer to kill him first, and they would have to hold a council, but if they did adopt him, it would be the best thing, because then he would soon turn into an Indian himself, and forget how to speak English; and if ever the Indians had to give up their prisoners, and he was brought back, and his father and mother came to pick him out, they might know him by some mark or other, but he would not know them, and they would have to let him go back to the Indians again. He said that was the very best way, and the only way, but the trouble would be to get to the Indians in the first place. He said he knew of one {{reservation}} in the north part of the State, and he promised to find out if there were any other Indians living nearer; the reservation was about a hundred miles off, and it would take Pony a good while to go to them.|$|E
6000|$|Now, as {{they passed}} into the room where their suppers were prepared, Mr. Hoopdriver caught a glimpse through a door ajar and {{floating}} in a reek of smoke, of {{three and a half}} faces--for the edge of the door cut one down--and an American cloth-covered table with several glasses and a tankard. And he also heard a remark. In the second before he heard that remark, Mr. Hoopdriver had been a proud and happy man, to particularize, a baronet's heir incognito. He had surrendered their bicycles to the odd man of the place with infinite easy dignity, and had bowingly opened the door for Jessie. [...] "Who's that, then?" [...] he imagined people saying; and then, [...] "Some'n pretty well orf--judge by the bicycles." [...] Then the imaginary spectators would fall a-talking of the fashionableness of bicycling,--how judges And stockbrokers and actresses and, in fact, all the best people rode, and how that it was often the fancy of such great folk to shun the big hotels, the adulation of urban crowds, and seek, incognito, the cosy quaintnesses of village life. Then, <b>maybe,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> think of a certain nameless air of distinction about the lady who had stepped across the doorway, and about the handsome, flaxen-moustached, blue-eyed Cavalier who had followed her in, and they would look one to another. [...] "Tell you what it is," [...] one of the village elders would say--just as they do in novels--voicing the thought of all, in a low, impressive tone: [...] "There's such a thin' as entertaining barranets unawares--not to mention no higher things--" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was an old}} Martin Roland, {{who lived}} near a bog {{a little out of}} Gort, who saw them often from his young days, and always towards the end of his life, though I would hardly call him their friend. He told me a few months before his death that [...] "they" [...] would not let him sleep at night with crying things at him in Irish, and with playing their pipes. He had asked a friend of his what he should do, and the friend had told him to buy a flute, and play on it when they began to shout or to play on their pipes, and <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> give up {{annoying}} him; and he did, and they always went out into the field when he began to play. He showed me the pipe, and blew through it, and made a noise, but {{he did not know how}} to play; and then he showed me where he had pulled his chimney down, because one of them used to sit up on it and play on the pipes. A friend of his and mine went to see him a little time ago, for she heard that [...] "three of them" [...] had told him he was to die. He said they had gone away after warning him, and that the children (children they had [...] "taken," [...] I suppose) who used to come with them, and play about the house with them, had [...] "gone to some other place," [...] because [...] "they found the house too cold for them, maybe"; and he died a week after he had said these things.|$|E

"They {{are having}} a talk over it," [...] Dave said; [...] "they know if we held on down the valley <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have {{overtaken}} us by this time, and they know we have taken to the wood {{one side or the}} other. I recken they won't think it any use searching for us to-night, but <b>maybe</b> <b>they</b> will go straight on for a bit.
