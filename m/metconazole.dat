50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, Fenarimol, Propiconazole, Myclobutanil, and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, Fenarimol and Myclobutanil were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, Fenarimol was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. Myclobutanil also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). Myclobutanil is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and fenarimol is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including Propiconazole, Tebuconazole, <b>Metconazole</b> and others. Pyraclostrobin and Fluoxastrobin have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E

Metocnazole was more efficient in comparison with carbendazim and tebuconazole. EC 50 values of all isolates on prochloraz were lower than 0. 1 mg l- 1, while on flutirafol they ranged between 1. 66 and 8. 51 mg l- 1 for 18 isolates, or were higher than 10 mg l- 1 for 7 isolates. EC 50 values on carbendazim were 0. 39 - 1. 41 mg l- 1 for F. graminearum isolates, 0. 91 - 1. 35 mg l- 1 forF. avenaceum, and 0. 47 - 0. 6 mg l- 1 for F. verticillioides. EC 50 values on tebuconazole were 0. 85 - 2. 57 mg l- 1 for F. graminearum, 0. 85 - 1. 58 mg l- 1 for F. avenaceum and 0. 22 - 0. 85 mg l- 1 for F. verticillioides,while on <b>metconazole</b> EC 50 values ranged between less than 0. 1 mg l- 1 to 1. 66, 0. 56,and 0. 17 mg l- 1 for F. graminearum, F. avenaceum and F. verticillioides, respectively. Average growth inhibitions of different Fusarium species and all Fusarium isolates together on different concentrations of fungicides tested were significantly different.

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{has been conducted}} in North West Italy {{over a period of}} 3 years to evaluate the effect of fungicide applications on common wheat yield and safety, combined with different agronomic conditions (high: a susceptible variety to FHB planted in an untilled field; low: a medium tolerant variety to FHB planted in a ploughed field) for Fusarium head blight (FHB) infection risk. A azole mixture (prochloraz + epoxiconazole), applied at heading, was compared in each year and for each agronomic condition with a triazole with high activity against F. graminearum and F. culmorum (<b>metconazole),</b> a strobilurin-azole mixture with elevated action to control leaf diseases and delay leaf senescence (azoxystrobin + prochloraz) and an untreated control. The following parameters were analyzed: flag leaf greenness, grain yield, test weight, thousand kernel weight (TKW), FHB incidence and severity and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination. The results of this research, conducted over three years with different meteorological conditions, underline the important link between fungicide efficacy and environmental and agronomic conditions that can influence fungal disease pressure. The fungicide effect on the control of FHB and the increase in flag leaf longevity and grain yield were greater with an increase in the disease pressure. On the other hand, the DON contamination was reduced by the fungicide to a greater extent in the low risk agronomic and environmental conditions compared to the high risk ones. Prochloraz + epoxiconazole showed a lower efficacy in reducing DON contamination compared to <b>metconazole,</b> particularly in the higher FHB pressure conditions. No significant differences were observed between the azole mixture and the strobilurin-azole mixture for flag leaf greenness, grain yield, test weight or TKW.

40|$|We {{reported}} {{the emergence of}} resistance to medical triazoles of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from patients with invasive aspergillosis. A dominant resistance mechanism was found, and we hypothesized that azole resistance might develop through azole exposure in the environment rather than in azole-treated patients. We investigated if A. fumigatus isolates resistant to medical triazoles are present in our environment by sampling the hospital indoor environment and soil from the outdoor environment. Antifungal susceptibility, resistance mechanisms, and genetic relatedness were {{compared with those of}} azole-resistant clinical isolates collected in a previous study. Itraconazole-resistant A. fumigatus (five isolates) was cultured from the indoor hospital environment as well as from soil obtained from flower beds in proximity to the hospital (six isolates) but never from natural soil. Additional samples of commercial compost, leaves, and seeds obtained from a garden center and a plant nursery were also positive (four isolates). Cross-resistance was observed for voriconazole, posaconazole, and the azole fungicides <b>metconazole</b> and tebuconazole. Molecular analysis showed the presence of the dominant resistance mechanism, which was identical to that found in clinical isolates, in 13 of 15 environmental isolates, and it showed that environmental and clinical isolates were genetically clustered apart from nonresistant isolates.

Fungicides used for the control belong to QoI (strobilurins) and SBI (azole) compounds. A weaker efficacy of straight azole was observed at some regions in the end of the crop season 2006 / 2007. To determine whether the problem observed was due to the resistance, a sensitivity monitoring test was carried out in 2008 / 2009 to detect possible changes in the EC 50 values of the fungus population. The test was done according to FRAC methodology. Leaves samples infected with Phakopsora pachyrhizi were sent from nine Brazilian states, in a total of 36 populations, and the spores collected were inoculated in detached leaves treated with fungicides.

Six treatments, from the combination of one (flowering = F) or two applications (F + 10 days) of <b>metconazole</b> sprayed alone or in mixture with pyraclostrobin were tested. Fusarium head blight incidence (INC) and severity (SEV) were assessed at the pre-harvest period and Fusarium-damaged kernel (FDK), kernel infection (KI) and deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) trichothecenes were quantified on harvested kernels. Disease incidence ranged from 43. 8 % to 90 % and from 7. 3 % to 31 % respectively in the unsprayed check. Both INC and SEV were reduced in all fungicide treatments compared to the check across trials. Levels of FDK and KI were not affected by fungicides where susceptible and moderately resistant cultivars were used, respectively. The fungicide x cultivar susceptibility interaction was significant with the highest severity reduction (> 70 %) susceptible cultivars.

During 2010 and 2011, six different field experiments were conducted. Each {{consisted of a}} single fungicide application followed by periodic (0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 days after application) turf sampling, inoculation of samples with an isolate of Rhizoctonia solani, and incubation in a controlled environment chamber for 48 h. For each sample date, fungicide protection was determined by measuring the extent of symptom expansion on fungicide treated and non-treated samples. Efficacy half-life values, based on a two-parameter Weibull function, for the fungicides in question ranged from 3. 1 to 14. 0 days. Fungicide depletion was further examined in 2011 by analyzing residues from creeping bentgrass verdure using liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS). Quantitative analysis from LC/TOF-MS revealed fungicide residues are depleted rapidly following application to turfgrass and reinforces results determined by bioassay. Less than 1 % of fungicide remained within the creeping bentgrass verdure 17 days after application for all tested treatments.
