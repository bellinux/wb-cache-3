5|$|John of Bohemia's heir, Charles, Margrave of Moravia, visited Charles in Visegrád {{in early}} 1338. The margrave {{acknowledged}} {{the right of}} Charles's son, Louis, to inherit Poland if CasimirIII died without a son in exchange for Charles's promise to persuade CasimirIII not to invade Silesia. Two leading Polish lords, Zbigniew, chancellor of Cracow, and Spycimir Leliwita, also supported this plan and persuaded CasimirIII, who lost his first wife on 26May 1339, to start negotiations with Charles. In July, Casimir came to Hungary and designated his sister (Charles's wife), Elizabeth, and her sons as his heirs. On his sons' behalf, Charles promised that they would <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to reconquer all lands that Poland had lost {{and that they would}} refrain from employing foreigners in Poland.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was {{declared}} and a provisional government {{was formed to}} support the state's objectives. Christakis-Zografos himself {{became president of the}} provisional government. In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations had been ignored, that the Great Powers had even denied them self-government within the Albanian state, as well as guarantees for the protection of life, property, religious freedom and of their national existence. The proclamation also called upon the Epirotes to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> sacrifice defending the integrity of Northern Epirus and its liberties from any attack whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. Another word for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> woman who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E
25|$|The NFL and New Orleans {{officials}} worked diligently to {{put together}} a deal to reschedule the game. The league considered a number of options, including shortening the regular season, shortening the playoffs, condensing the three playoff rounds in two weeks, and moving the game to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It was eventually decided to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to maintain a full regular season and playoff, and push the Super Bowl back to February 3. Also, due to the Super Bowl being sent back a week, the first week of New Orleans Mardi Gras parades rolled one week earlier than normal.|$|E
25|$|Kempe's {{argument}} goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not triangulated, i.e. {{do not have}} exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices in order to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this triangulated graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and {{without loss of generality}} we assume the graph is triangulated.|$|E

The prince soon aids Elika in her quest to contain the dark god Ahriman in the Tree of Life {{at the center of}} the valley. They ultimately fail, but <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to lock Ahriman back into the tree. They succeed at this, but Elika dies. The prince, mirroring the actions of Elika's father which originally released Ahriman, decides to bring Elika back to life, freeing Ahriman once again. Ahriman chases them to an underground palace, where Elika ultimately abandons the prince in search of her people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, World War I erupted in Europe. European socialists were {{singularly}} unable to stop the march of their various national governments to a particularly bloody conflagration. Algie Simons made the effort to write to both Ramsay MacDonald and Keir Hardie, leaders of the British Independent Labour Party, urging them to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to keep the Second International alive, thereby preserving lines of communication with the socialists of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Though both parties agreed in the desirability of the policy which Simons advocated, they proved incapable of its implementation, as the belligerent national governments of both sides shut down all means of contact.|$|E
25|$|This impasse {{resulted}} in the Yaoundé Declaration of November 9, 2016 through which African Photography Initiatives and other subscribers intended to generate {{a greater understanding of}} the value of photographs and films and analogue as well as digital archives for the studies in historic, human and social sciences. The declaration calls on the government and other stakeholders in Cameroon to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort in order to protect and make accessible for public use the country’s photographic and cinematographic heritage. As a first step, the Yaoundé Declaration recommends the recognition of the CPPA-B and the National Photo Library Yaoundé as cultural property as intended in the law on Cultural Heritage in Cameroon from 18 April 2013.|$|E

25|$|As {{the chief}} {{advantage}} of the Collins Line over its competitor the Cunard Line was speed, it was considered imperative to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to ensure this advantage was maintained regardless of cost. This policy frequently resulted in costly repairs as the ships' engines were continually pushed to the limit. By 1852 {{it was clear to}} the owners that the existing government mail subsidy of $19,250 per voyage was insufficient, and the Line returned to Congress to request an increase in the subsidy to $33,000 per voyage. The government granted this request, and it was additionally decided {{to increase the number of}} voyages from 20 to 26 per annum, resulting in a total increase of the annual subsidy from $385,000 to $858,000. Competition between the two Lines had reduced freight rates considerably however, and even this new subsidy was not sufficient to prevent the company from continuing to lose money.|$|E
25|$|Divisions {{organised}} attacks {{according to}} SS 135 (Instructions {{for the training}} of Platoons for Offensive Action) of December 1916. The pamphlet {{was derived from the}} experience of the Somme in 1916 for divisions to organise according to a common pattern and prescribed the siege warfare methods necessary for trench-to-trench attacks, the semi-open fighting, when defensive positions had been captured and open warfare techniques, for when the defence collapsed. All the sections of SS 135 addressed the problem of command when no voice communication existed by prescribing that a commander's intention must be communicated and that the infantry should <b>make</b> <b>every</b> effort to send back information by any means available, primarily by visual methods which needed specialist parties to advance with the infantry to set up relay stations, carrier pigeons, experimental wireless sets, power buzzers, signal lamps and runners, who were trained to use the terrain and know the trench systems for maximum protection.|$|E
25|$|Other {{measures}} allowed certain {{reports on}} intelligence and intelligence-related matters to be deferred until either February 1, 2002 or a date after February 1, 2002 if the official involved certified that preparation and submission on February 1, 2002, would impede {{the work of}} officers or employees engaged in counterterrorism activities. Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized. The Attorney General was charged with training officials in identifying and utilizing foreign intelligence information properly {{in the course of}} their duties. The government officials include those in the Federal Government who do not normally encounter or disseminate foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties, and State and local government officials who encounter, or potentially may encounter in the course of a terrorist event, foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties.
