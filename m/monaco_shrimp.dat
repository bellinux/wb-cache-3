40|$|The <b>Monaco</b> <b>shrimp</b> Lysmata seticaudata (Risso, 1816) is {{a marine}} {{ornamental}} species whose ecology and biology, {{as well as}} its larval culture has previously been addressed. The objective {{of the study was to}} predict and improve productivity of this species rearing protocol through modelling. The models developed intend to help aquaculturists to maximize survival to postlarva, decrease larval duration and increase synchronism of metamorphosis and newly metamorphosed postlarvae size by manipulating temperature, diet, first feeding period and stocking density. The models developed allow us to conclude that the L. seticaudata rearing protocol productivity can be improved by raising larvae at a density of 40 larvae L− 1 and fed newly hatched Artemia nauplii since hatching to zoea V, and with Algamac 2000 ™ enriched Artemia metanauplii from zoea V to metamorphosis to postlarvae. By providing more productive protocols to aquaculturists, destructive practices and wild collection may be reduced...|$|E
