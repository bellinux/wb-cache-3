The <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> is dependent on the operational environment and therefore cannot be mitigated by differ- encing techniques. The effect of multipath is accentuated when observables based on linear combinations of mea- surements from two or more frequencies are formulated. We develop a new carrier-phase <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> observable that isolates the inter-frequency carrier-phase <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> for linear combinations of observables, such as wide- lane (WL).

In this work, we consider <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> estimation as a regression problem and propose a unified framework for both code and carrier-phase multipath mitigation for ground fixed GPS stations. We use the kernel support vector machine to predict multipath errors, since it is known to potentially offer better-performance traditional models, such as neural networks.

The theoretical foundations of multipath are presented and several multipath mitigation techniques are reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on signal diffraction methods. Reflections enter peaks and nulls in the distorted antenna pattern in a random manner. This, coupled with the oscillations in relative phase (with respect to the direct signal), results in a <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> signature which is noise-like. Since it is noise-like, it may be significantly reduced by averaging the code phase measurements against the more stable carrier-phase measurements.

This paper presents observations of SNR data from a continuously operating GPS receiver (CASA), which show strong evidence of ground and monument multipath. The SNR data at CASA demonstrate daily repeatability and sea-sonal trends that indicate a strong dependence of <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> on changes in the antenna environment. When the SNR data show vari-ability due to multipath, SNR observations are consistent with positioning post¯t phase residu-als.

Low-complexity high-resolution channel delay estimation is crucial for position estimation in the receivers to mitigate the <b>multipath</b> <b>errors.</b> The main drawback of maximum likelihood (ML) channel delay estimation is the high computational complexity.

To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a choke ring antenna) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|R
30|$|This section {{deals with}} <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> and signal {{attenuation}} due to foliage and its seasonal variation. To analyze <b>multipath</b> <b>error,</b> we used multipath indices computed by TEQC. The TEQC multipath indices MP 1 and MP 2 reflect the <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> on pseudorange observables on L 1 and L 2, respectively (Estey and Meertens, 1999). Among the currently available GPS carriers, the signal strength of L 2 is weaker than L 1 and, therefore, L 2 signals {{are more susceptible}} to signal attenuation and to multipath. This makes MP 2 a better indicator of the foliage effect; as such, we utilized MP 2 instead of MP 1 in this study. Earlier studies indicated that MP 1 and MP 2 values are dependent not only on the site environment, but also on the GPS receiver type and firmware version (Park et al., 1998). Thus, for an objective evaluation of the site-specific multipath effect, MP 2 values from the same kind of receiver with the same firmware version have to be compared. Of the five stations analyzed in this study, SEOS, INCH, and PAJU {{have the same kind of}} receiver (Trimble 4000 SSi) with exactly the same firmware version. ICNW and SUWN were excluded from this analysis because both stations are equipped with a unique receiver: an Ashtech iCGRS receiver at ICNW and a Trimble NetRS at SUWN. The MP 2 values can be calculated at selected measurement intervals, but to simplify the analysis we took daily averages from MP 2 values sampled at 30 -s intervals. The daily average MP 2 values at each site were computed for more than 4 years to detect seasonal trends, if any.|$|E
40|$|Constellations of {{regional}} satellite navigation systems are usually constituted of geostationary satellites (GEO) and inclined geostationary satellites (IGSO) for better service availability. Analysis of real data {{shows that the}} pseudorange measurements of {{these two types of}} satellites contain significant multipath errors and code noise, and the multipath for GEO is extremely serious, which is harmful to system services. In contrast, <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> of carrier phase measurements is less than 3 cm, which is smaller than the multipath of pseudorange measurements by two orders of magnitude. Using a particular combination of pseudorange and dual-frequency carrier phase measurements, the pseudorange multipath errors are detected, and their time varying features are analyzed. A real-time multipath correction algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is called CNMC (Code Noise and Multipath Correction). The algorithm decreases the influence of the <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> and therefore ensures the performance of the system. Data processing experiments show that the <b>multipath</b> <b>error</b> level may be reduced from 0. 5 m to 0. 15 m by using this algorithm, and 60 % of GEO multipath errors and 42 % of IGSO multipath errors are successfully corrected with CNMC. Positioning experiments are performed with a constellation of 3 GEO plus 3 IGSO satellites. For dual-frequency users the East-West position accuracy is improved from 1. 31 m to 0. 94 m by using the CNMC algorithm, the South-North position accuracy is improved from 2. 62 m to 2. 29 m, and the vertical position accuracy is improved from 4. 25 m to 3. 05 m.

A new sidereal filtering algorithm based on single differences is developed to mitigate multipath effects for short-baseline high-rate GPS applications such as structural deformation monitoring. This method differs from traditional sidereal filtering in that our method operates on the single differences rather than the coordinates or double differences. A multipath model for the single differences on the reference day is established for each satellite and is used to remove <b>multipath</b> <b>errors</b> from observations of subsequent days by taking advantage of the sidereal repeatability of multipath signals. Using both simulated and real GPS observations, we demonstrate that this method is insensitive to different weighting strategies used in computing single differences from double differences. Applying the proposed method can reduce the root mean square (RMS) of positioning noises by 82 % on average. Compared to sidereal filtering (in either coordinate or double differences domain) and aspect repeat time adjustment, this method can further reduce the RMS values by 13 and 7 %, respectively.
