50|$|Twenty {{two percent}} of the {{catchment}} basin of Lake Wabamun has been disturbed by two coal mines, the Highvale, covering 12,600 hectares, the largest coal mine in Canada and the Whitewood <b>mine.</b> <b>Strip</b> mining involves remove overburden to expose the coal seam that is then mined in distinct strips. By 2004, these two mines had disturbed 5,593 ha of the Lake Wabamun catch basin.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} reasons behind failed vegetation growth {{along the path}} of <b>mine</b> <b>strip</b> in previously afforested areas, a pseudo slash shape (Ŧ) line transect was placed through areas with successful pine growth and failed pine growth. Thousand grams (g) of soil samples {{were taken from the}} topsoil layer at a depth of 0 - 10  cm (AG soil 1994). The samples were collected during the vegetation period at 0.50  m interval along the two horizontal and one vertical arms of the Ŧ transect for soil acidity analyses (pH). This helped to study the influence of soil pH on vegetation growth and nutrient availability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The ground {{movement}} laws due to wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams {{has been}} studied with the experiment of similar material model, {{and the results of}} experiment could analysis qualitatively that it is feasible for wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams. Taking 25 mining area of Hemei 9 th mine as geologic background, the model of wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep seams has been made, which was used to study on the deformation of overburden and the ground movement laws. The results of experiment show that the properties and thickness of strata play a control role on the deformation, and the key strata play a core role; the deformation was dispersed with wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining.</b> When the width of <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> and protective coal pillar are scientific and reasonable, the purpose of increasing the width of <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under the condition of controlling deformation could be achieved, and the entire mining area would be formed a flat subsidence basin. These achievements provide a scientific basis for solving the problem for the ground buildings protection in the conditions of wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams, and that also provide some references for further studying on the method of wide <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> under deep-lying seams...|$|R

5000|$|In <b>mining,</b> <b>stripping</b> ratio or {{strip ratio}} {{refers to the}} ratio of the volume of {{overburden}} (or waste material) required to be handled in order to extract some tonnage of ore. For example, a 3:1 stripping ratio means that mining one tonne of ore will require mining three tonnes of waste rock. [...] Stripping ratios are typically reduced to show the volume of waste removal required to extract one unit ton of ore, for example, 1.5:1 as opposed to 3:2.|$|R
