5|$|Arboreal carton nests of {{mangrove}} swamp-dwelling Nasutitermes are {{enriched in}} lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change {{is caused by}} bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account {{for as much as}} 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These Nasutitermes nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, Rhizophora <b>mangle</b> (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemose (white mangrove).|$|E
5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora <b>mangle),</b> black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Drummond {{continued}} to collect for <b>Mangles,</b> {{putting together a}} large collection of living plants for him. [...] He also {{made a number of}} collections of pressed plants and seeds for <b>Mangles</b> to sell on Drummond's behalf, of which one was to be given to <b>Mangles.</b> He dispatched these collection on the Joshua Carroll in September 1838. Meanwhile, <b>Mangles</b> had tired of Drummond's [...] "commercial attitude towards botany" [...] (Hasluck, 1955), and had begun to receive the outstanding collections of Georgiana Molloy. [...] Shortly after the Joshua Carroll sailed, Drummond received a letter from <b>Mangles</b> in which <b>Mangles</b> declined to dispose of his specimens. On receiving Drummond's collections, <b>Mangles</b> passed them on to Lindley, who had offered to dispose of them for Drummond. The collections were divided into sets and sold by George Bentham, but it was many years before Drummond eventually received payment.|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} species of trees that are {{considered}} mangroves: red (Rhizophora <b>mangle),</b> black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All grow in oxygen-poor soil, can survive drastic water level changes, and are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water. All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves have the farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms. All three types of trees absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for crustaceans and fish, and rookeries for birds. The region supports Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) and stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industries; between 80 and 90 percent of commercially harvested crustacean species in Florida's salt waters are born or spend time near the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{mangrove}} trees {{exist in the}} region: red (Rhizophora <b>mangle),</b> black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will <b>mangle</b> her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1835, James <b>Mangles</b> {{wrote to}} George Fletcher Moore {{to ask him}} to help <b>Mangles</b> obtain seeds and plants of Western Australian flora. Moore responded by {{purchasing}} a hundred packets of different kinds of seeds from Drummond's son Johnston, who had developed a taste for botanical collecting from his father. Moore sent the seeds to <b>Mangles,</b> and later that year [...] <b>Mangles</b> sent Moore two cases of rare and useful plants, asking Moore to return the cases filled with Western Australian plants. As Moore doubted his ability to rear the plants given to him, and did not have time to collect plants to return to <b>Mangles,</b> he passed both tasks on to James Drummond, writing to <b>Mangles</b> to introduce Drummond and recommend him as a botanist and collector. Aware of Drummond's financial difficulties, he agreed to bear the cost of sending the boxes to <b>Mangles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the region}} is mostly tropical but differences in topography, soil and climatic conditions increase species diversity. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are endemic. For example, guaiac wood (Guaiacum officinale), the flower {{of which is the}} national flower of Jamaica and the Bayahibe rose (Pereskia quisqueyana) which is the national flower of the Dominican Republic and the ceiba which is the national tree of both Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The mahogany is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and Belize. The caimito (Chrysophyllum cainito) grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are coconut palms and in lagoons and estuaries are found thick areas of black mangrove and red mangrove (Rhizophora <b>mangle).</b>|$|E

25|$|Besses o' th' Barn Band, and {{subsequently}} its associated boys' band, has {{existed in the}} area since at least 1818, at which time it had converted from a string band to a reed band. Its founders were John, James and Joseph Clegg – three brothers who were manufacturers of cotton products at Besses o' th' Barn – {{and for this reason}} it was for a time known as Clegg's Reed Band. Originally using a room called the <b>mangle</b> room, attached to the old barn at Besses which was pulled down in the 1880s, it has had its headquarters on Moss Lane since 1884. At the peak of its fame in the early 1900s this band, by now using brass instruments, undertook numerous prestigious engagements, including world tours lasting well in excess of 12 months at a time.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic <b>mangle</b> (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|E
25|$|Nouns used attributively {{to qualify}} other nouns are {{generally}} in the singular, even though for example, a dog catcher catches {{more than one}} dog, and a department store {{has more than one}} department. This is true even for some binary nouns where the singular form is not found in isolation, such as a trouser <b>mangle</b> or the scissor kick. This is also true where the attribute noun is itself qualified with a number, such as a twenty-dollar bill, a ten-foot pole or a two-man tent. The plural is used for pluralia tantum nouns: a glasses case is for eyeglasses, while a glass case is made of glass (but compare eyeglass case); also an arms race versus arm wrestling. The plural may be used to emphasise the plurality of the attribute, especially in British English but very rarely in American English: a careers advisor, a languages expert. The plural is also more common with irregular plurals for various attributions: women killers are women who kill, whereas woman killers are those who kill women.|$|E

50|$|Though {{it would}} seem that {{standardised}} name <b>mangling</b> in the C++ language would lead to greater interoperability between compiler implementations, such a standardization by itself would not suffice to guarantee C++ compiler interoperability and it might even create a false impression that interoperability is possible and safe when it isn't. Name <b>mangling</b> is only one of several application binary interface (ABI) details that need to be decided and observed by a C++ implementation. Other ABI aspects like exception handling, virtual table layout, structure and stack frame padding, etc. also cause differing C++ implementations to be incompatible. Further, requiring a particular form of <b>mangling</b> would cause issues for systems where implementation limits (e.g., length of symbols) dictate a particular <b>mangling</b> scheme. A standardised requirement for name <b>mangling</b> would also prevent an implementation where <b>mangling</b> was not required at all — for example, a linker which understood the C++ language.|$|R

500|$|Despite being a prequel, {{the second}} game {{introduces}} upgraded versions of the original characters called Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and <b>Mangle,</b> along with old, ripped, and worn out versions of the original animatronics. <b>Mangle</b> {{is meant to be}} a [...] "toy" [...] version of Foxy, but was ripped apart so much by children that the staff got tired of reassembling it and left it as a [...] "take apart, put back together" [...] attraction, according to Phone Guy. He also mentions that the employees nicknamed it [...] "the Mangle". [...] Two new characters are also introduced: BB (known as Balloon Boy), who has no jumpscare and can only disable the players' lights, and The Puppet (also known as The Marionette), who must be quelled by constantly winding up a music box.The only true animatronic in the third game is Springtrap, who looks like a decayed golden version of Bonnie. Additionally, Freddy, Chica, Foxy, Balloon Boy, <b>Mangle,</b> and The Puppet return as hallucinations (or [...] "phantoms"), and although their jumpscares don't kill the player, they can disable certain features that are essential for the player to complete the night easily.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} game, {{nightmare}} {{versions of the}} original four animatronics- Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica, Nightmare Foxy, and Nightmare Freddy – appear, haunting a small boy. A nightmare version of Golden Freddy is also featured, identified as Nightmare Fredbear, who replaces all animatronics on the fifth night. Two new animatronics also make their debut: Plushtrap, a finger trap toy version of Springtrap, and Nightmare, a version of Nightmare Fredbear whose jumpscare causes the game to reset. The [...] "Halloween Edition" [...] of the game also features Nightmare Balloon Boy (who replaces Plushtrap), Nightmare <b>Mangle</b> (who replaces Nightmare Foxy), and Nightmarionne, a nightmare version of the Puppet, who replaces Nightmare.

500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me.

500|$|In Venezuela, it {{was found}} on El Caimito, a small (...) islet {{just east of the}} outlet of Lake Maracaibo in the state of Zulia, where the only other native non-flying mammal is the opossum Marmosa robinsoni. El Caimito is {{separated}} from the mainland by a narrow, brackish channel and contains sand banks with xerophytic vegetation surrounded by marshy lagoons with Rhizospora <b>mangle</b> mangroves. Oryzomys gorgasi was caught in all habitats on the islet, but has not been found in other similar sites in northwestern Venezuela, where the introduced black rat is the only rodent collected. Analysis of stomach contents of El Caimito specimens indicates that the species is an omnivore, with a diet including crustaceans, insects, plant seeds, and other plant material. The crustaceans may include fiddler crabs (Uca) and a mangrove tree crab of the genus Aratus; the insects include flies (Diptera); and the plants include grass seeds. Two parasitic nematodes, Litomosoides sigmodontis (family Onchocercidae) and an undetermined species of Pterygodermatites (family Rictulariidae), are known to infect O.gorgasi. The 2009 IUCN Red List tersely indicates that the species has been found in second Venezuelan locality.|$|E
