500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger when they walk and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for <b>my</b> <b>ego...</b> <b>My</b> <b>ego</b> is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let <b>my</b> <b>ego</b> get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E
500|$|Used in {{the opening}} sequence, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was played 13minutes into the film, where Bond is shown imprisoned and being {{tortured}} {{for over a year}} in a prison camp in Korea. Being a departure from the normal title sequence of the previous Bond films, Madonna faced difficulty in making the song blend with the theme of Die Another Day. Nevertheless, she understood the idea behind the opening scenes and tweaked the song accordingly. Some of the lyrics like [...] "I'm gonna destroy <b>my</b> <b>ego</b> ... Sigmund Freud ... Analyze this" [...] were derived from Madonna's interpretation of the film's storyline. She told an interviewer from Genre magazine that the lyrics were about [...] "destroying your ego, and it's juxtaposing the metaphor of, you know, the fight against good and bad, and it's set inside the whole universe of Bond". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was never adapted into the main score of the film. The song was later added to the track list of American Life and was also featured on her third greatest hits album, Celebration (2009).|$|E
5000|$|In a 1986 {{interview}} {{while in}} residence at American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Hanayagi commented: “When I do classical dance, I don’t {{want to change the}} movement. I don’t want to put my own expression, <b>my</b> own <b>ego,</b> into the classical dance tradition. When I studied with my teacher one-on-one, I felt something very much like Zen meditation; I felt very pure, I didn’t feel anything about <b>my</b> own <b>ego</b> or expression." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing about all the things I could have had, but <b>my</b> <b>ego</b> got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{suggestions}} that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest {{is not in}} giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: [...] "Some people think that it's because I want <b>my</b> <b>ego</b> to be fed. Of course, I'm {{not asking you to}} call it 'Stallmanix'." [...] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing [...] "an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done," [...] concluding [...] "If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade." ...|$|E
2500|$|The work of Abramović and Ulay {{tested the}} {{physical}} {{limits of the}} body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramović herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramović/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: [...] "The main problem in this relationship was {{what to do with the}} two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put <b>my</b> <b>ego</b> down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} make my life and {{therefore}} my art more exciting I often imagine being someone else. While working on art projects, usually for several months, I have lived double lives as art historians and political scientists, but mostly as artists {{who should have been}} famous. To trick my audience into believing the fantasy figures I fabricate are real, I use circumstantial evidence. But with the help of that same audience, the double lives I live become far more interesting. It is their imaginative power that really brings <b>my</b> alter <b>egos</b> to life...|$|R

6000|$|So I {{can present}} myself. I {{seem to be}} a consciousness, vague and insecure, placed between two worlds. One of these worlds seems clearly [...] "not me," [...] the other is more closely {{identified}} with me and yet is still imperfectly me. The first I call the exterior world, and it presents itself to me as existing in Time and Space. In a certain way I seem able to interfere with it and control it. The second is the interior world, having no forms in space and only a vague evasive reference to time, from which motives arise and storms of emotion, which acts and reacts constantly and in untraceable way with my conscious mind. And that consciousness itself hangs and drifts about the region where the inner world and the outer world meet, much as a patch of limelight drifts about the stage, illuminating, affecting, following no manifest law except that usually it centres upon the hero, <b>my</b> <b>Ego.</b>|$|E
500|$|Around this time, I {{would say}} {{something}} into a microphone onstage, and afterward [...] pull me aside and say, [...] "Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again."

50|$|When {{asked to}} {{describe}} his style in a 2012 interview with IndieWire, Clark stated, Stylistically my number one goal at all stages of production is for the narrative to always maintain {{the highest level of}} reality possible. My hope would be that the camera, the lighting, the sound, the performances, and <b>my</b> own <b>ego</b> will go as unnoticed as possible, and that you may feel, if just for a moment, that you are watching your own family interact. That view may come as a surprise, as the films' characters are highly vapid and their worlds’ greatly stylized. My answer would be that in being truly honest, we have to admit that we are all vapid, and our own little world is forever increasing in style and conformity.|$|R

Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man".

In a 2003 interview concerning the series, Love stated: [...] "I have {{always loved the}} Japanese culture and people.

[...] It {{should be noted that}} the word [...] "Ai" [...] means [...] "love" [...] in Japanese; thus, the name is a reference to both Love and Ai Yazawa, who drew the initial Princess Ai character design. It is also generally believed that Kent, the sensitive, blonde guitar player who becomes Ai's love interest, is based on Courtney Love's late husband, Kurt Cobain. Another connection to the real-life Love is Princess Ai's heart-shaped box, which figures prominently in the story. [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] was a hit song by Nirvana, and was inspired by a heart-shaped box which Love gave Cobain as a present.|$|R
