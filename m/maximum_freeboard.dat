For this class, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the Bureau of Construction and Repair, used a relatively new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow. The result of a series of towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent, supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull. At speeds of more than 25 knots, test results were highly favorable. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the outer plating of the forecastle at higher speeds. However, this tendency could be reduced to some degree by careful design of the frames.

50|$|Critical to {{the design}} of the Type 12 was the {{capability}} to steam {{for long periods of time}} in heavy seas, economically and at high speed. For this reason a novel hull form was devised, which despite appearance, was totally unrelated to that of the earlier Type 41 / Type 61 design. The hull showed the fine lines more typical of a destroyer, but had a raised forecastle with considerable flare. The fo'c'sle deck was level to maintain <b>maximum</b> <b>freeboard</b> aft of the stem where it is most likely that waves will break across the deck. These two features meant that the hull not only cut through the water, but that spray was thrown upwards and outwards, away from the bridge and gun turret. This was especially important in high latitudes where war experience had shown that spray could cause rapid and undesirable ice build-up on the forecastle. The deck edges and hull also met at a curve rather than an angle, the anchors were recessed, and protrusions were kept to a minimum to limit the potential sources of ice build-up and spray generation. The Mark 6 gunhouse was large and heavy, so had to be carried low to maintain stability and give a good view over it from the bridge. The forecastle therefore had a very distinctive kink, allowing the position of the guns to be lowered. This had the added benefit of moving the bridge aft, where there was considerably less motion, improving the lot of the watchkeeper. The hull form, coupled with a twin-shaft double-reduction geared steam turbine plant (the Y-100) that operated at high temperature and pressure (for efficiency) and low revolutions, with new five-bladed low-cavitation propellers (for efficiency and quietness) lent themselves to the perfect hull for a high-speed, all-weather anti-submarine vessel.|$|E
40|$|State-of-the-art Arctic Ocean mean {{sea surface}} (MSS) models and global geoid models (GGMs) {{are used to}} support sea ice {{freeboard}} estimation from satellite altimeters, {{as well as in}} oceanographic studies such as mapping sea level anomalies and mean dynamic ocean topography. However, errors in a given model in the high frequency domain, primarily due to unresolved gravity features, can result in errors in the estimated along-track freeboard. These errors are exacerbated in areas with a sparse lead distribution in consolidated ice pack conditions. Additionally model errors can impact ocean geostrophic currents, derived from satellite altimeter data, while remaining biases in these models may impact longer-term, multi-sensor oceanographic time-series of sea level change in the Arctic. This study focuses on an assessment of five state-of-the-art Arctic MSS models (UCL 13 / 04, DTU 15 / 13 / 10) and a commonly used GGM (EGM 2008). We describe errors due to unresolved gravity features, inter-satellite biases, and remaining satellite orbit errors, and their impact on the derivation of sea ice freeboard. The latest MSS models, incorporating CryoSat- 2 sea surface height measurements, show improved definition of gravity features, such as the Gakkel Ridge. The standard deviation between models ranges 0. 03 - 0. 25 m. The impact of remaining MSS/GGM errors on freeboard retrieval can reach several decimeters in parts of the Arctic. While the <b>maximum</b> observed <b>freeboard</b> difference found in the central Arctic was 0. 59 m (UCL 13 MSS minus EGM 2008 GGM), the standard deviation in freeboard differences is 0. 03 - 0. 06 m...|$|R
40|$|In {{a warming}} climate, the {{magnitude}} and/or frequency of precipitation {{is expected to}} change in some regions, leading to higher local flood risk. This issue has raised much needed attention in the engineering design and flood management communities, and has motivated discussion on guidelines for improving infrastructure design in a changing climate. The existing infrastructure design concept assumes a stationary climate indicating no significant change in statistics of extremes over time. In a changing climate, however, frequency and severity of extreme events might change - a notion known as non-stationarity. Typically, a freeboard is included in hydrologic design as safety factor to improve infrastructure resilience, which might fail to deliver the intended level of reliability in a changing climate. This study considers 5 locations in the Northeastern United States that have shown a non-stationary behavior over time in the annual streamflow <b>maxima.</b> First, a <b>freeboard</b> is estimated based on the stationary assumption, commonly used for engineering design. The freeboard assuming a non-stationary climate is then evaluated against the commonly used stationary assumption. The Non-stationary Extreme Value Analysis (NEVA) software, which utilizes Extreme Value Theory (EVT) framework and Bayesian inference for parameter estimation, is used to obtain Return Level-Return Period curves under both stationary and non-stationary assumptions. The 100 -year streamflow estimates under both stationary and non-stationary assumptions are used as input into HEC-RAS software to simulate the flow and compare the change in freeboard. Results show an expected increase in the magnitude of streamflow for 100 -year events {{when there is a}} positive trend in observations. Under a non-stationary assumption, the freeboard decreases approximately 16 % on average in our 5 case studies. This indicates that for a bridge design case study, there will be a higher chance of overtopping because the freeboard is less than the initial design under a stationary assumption. Potential changes in freeboard and, hence, failure risk in a warming climate calls for improved design concepts that consider potential changes in extremes over time. However, incorporating non-stationarity in design concepts is a challenging task, and requires not only model development but also an adaptation strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of criteria and a generalized procedure {{for the design}} of an abrupt transition from a circular pipe to a rectangular open channel are presented. The rectangular channel must be 1. 0 pipe diameters wide. Wider channels cause high waves which reflect from the channel sidewalls, may overtop the sidewalls, and produce severe disturbances in the channel. To permit the pipe to expand, the channel may be widened for a distance not exceeding 0. 5 pipe diameters downstream from the pipe exit, and the floor of the channel may be lowered. The equations developed describe the locations of the water surface elements to within an average of 0. 11 pipe diameters of their correct locations. The maximum anticipated location error is +/- 1. 4 pipe diameters. The equations for the envelope curves covering the crests of the sidewall waves, which determine the channel sidewall height, provide an average freeboard of 0. 08 pipe diameters and a <b>maximum</b> <b>freeboard</b> of 0. 31 pipe diameters. When the envelope equations are used only 2 percent of the wall waves will overtop the sidewalls, the maximum overtopping being 0. 04 pipe diameters. The average depth of flow-the depth at the wave nodes-is predicted by the equations to within a maximum deviation of + 0. 13 and - 0. 06 pipe diameters of the observed depths. The average depth at the nodes is predicted by the equations within 0. 01 pipe diameters of the observed average depth.

40|$|Green {{water has}} a {{significant}} effect on safety and on structural strength of an FPSO. Green water mostly occurs at the bow of an FPSO because of the weathervaning capability. When the waves, current and wind are not co-directional, it can occur that waves are coming in {{on the side of the}} FPSO. When designing an FPSO for a benign environment, classification society rules are available to determine the measures which have to be considered against green water along the side. When the probability of green water and the freeboard exceedance along the side are actually known, no potentially unnecessary measures, implied by classification society regulations, have to be implemented on the FPSO. This study dealt with the probability of green water occurrence and most probable <b>maximum</b> <b>freeboard</b> exceedance along the side of the Petrojarl 1. Specifically, the effect of the various ship motions and the free surface elevation on the probability of green water are researched. The probability of green water occurring along the side of the Petrojarl 1 is analysed with linear 3 D diffraction theory. The analysis is performed for the conditions in which the vessel will be operating. The probability is based both on the second order Forristall distributionand the linear Rayleigh distribution to determine the effect of the distribution on the probability of green water occurrence, because the Forristall distribution accounts for the second order wave effects in the incoming wave. The free surface elevation along the side of the FPSO under a certain relative wave angle proved to be of great importance. Therefore the free surface elevation is validated with measurements performed at MARIN for the free surface elevation along a plate. Finally, the relative wave angle also affects the probability of green water. This study dealt with the influence of the relative wave angle for the green water probability along the side of the Petrojarl 1.
