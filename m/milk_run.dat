25|$|The tree {{maintained}} its {{connection with the}} dairy industry through the mid-20th century, serving as a collection point for dairy farmers bringing cans of cream to be loaded and transported by road to Gladstone when the first motorised truck began carting cream from Miriam Vale to the Port Curtis Dairy Factory in 1952. By this year a ramp, facing Blomfield Street, had been built alongside {{the trunk of the}} Big Fig for the loading of cream and later milk cans onto the back of delivery vehicles. The place served as an easily accessible and shady location for farmers to assemble and wait for their produce to be loaded. During the 1960s, the original loading ramp was replaced with a new ramp, and an early fence and gates, reputedly constructed around the tree and cream/milk collection area by Queensland Railways, was demolished. The new ramp was built facing Station Street, and remained until at least 1977 when the last contract for the <b>milk</b> <b>run</b> to Gladstone was cancelled. Several small earth mounds {{to the north of the}} trunk of the Fig Tree are all that remain of the second ramp.|$|E

Then comes the water-bailiff, and catches the poachers.

60|$|Now, {{when the}} coco-nut has {{actually}} reached {{the ground at}} last, and proceeds to sprout in the spot where chance (perhaps in the bodily shape of a disappointed monkey) has chosen to cast it, these numerous safeguards and solid envelopes naturally begin to prove decided nuisances to the embryo within. It starts under the great disadvantage of being hermetically sealed within a solid wooden shell, so that no water can possibly get at it to aid it as most other seeds are aided {{in the process of}} germination. Fancy yourself a seed-pea, anxious to sprout, but coated all round with a hard covering of impermeable sealing-wax, and you will be in a position faintly to appreciate the unfortunate predicament of a grower coco-nut. Natural selection, however--that deus ex machinâ of modern science, which can perform such endless wonders, if only you give it time enough to work in and variations enough to work upon--natural selection has come to the rescue of the unhappy plant by leaving it a little hole {{at the top of the}} shell, out of which it can push its feathery green head without difficulty. Everybody knows that if you look at the sharp end of a coco-nut you will see three little brown pits or depressions on its surface. Most people also know that two of these are firmly stopped up (for a reason to which I shall presently recur), but that the third one is only closed by a slight film or very thin shell, which can be easily bored through with a pocket knife, so as to let the <b>milk</b> <b>run</b> off before cracking the shell. So much we have all learnt during our ardent pursuit of natural knowledge on half-holidays in early life. But we probably then failed to observe that just opposite this soft hole lies a small roundish knob, imbedded in the pulp or eatable portion, which knob is in fact the embryo palm or seedling, for whose ultimate benefit the whole arrangement (in brown and green) has been invented. That is very much the way with man: he notices what concerns his own appetite, and omits all the really important parts of the whole subject. We think the use of the hole is to let out the milk; but the nut knows that its real object is to let out the seedling. The knob grows out at last into the young plantlet, and it is by means of the soft hole that it makes its escape through the shell to the air and the sunshine which it seeks without. This brings us really down at last to the true raison d'être for the milk in the coco-nut. As the seed or kernel cannot easily get at much water from outside, it has a good supply of water laid up for it ready beforehand within its own encircling shell. The mother liquid from which the pulp or nutty part has been deposited remains in the centre, as the milk, till the tiny embryo begins to sprout. As soon as it does so, the little knob which was at first so very small enlarges rapidly and absorbs the water, till it grows out into a big spongy cellular mass, which at last almost fills up the entire shell. At the same time, its other end pushes its way out through the soft hole, and then gives birth to a growing bud at the top--the future stem and leaves--and to a number of long threads beneath--the future roots. Meanwhile, the spongy mass inside begins gradually to absorb all the nutty part, using up its oils and starches for the purpose of feeding the young plant above, until it is of an age to expand its leaves to the open tropical sunlight and shift for itself in the struggle for life. It seems at first sight very hard to understand how any tissue so solid as the pulp of coco-nut can be thus softened and absorbed without any visible cause; but in the subtle chemistry of living vegetation such a transformation is comparatively simple and easy to perform. Nature sometimes works much greater miracles than this in the same way: for example, what is called vegetable ivory, a substance so solid that it can be carved or turned only with great difficulty, is really the kernel of another palm-nut, allied to the coco-palm, and its very stony particles are all similarly absorbed during germination by the dissolving power of the young seedling.|$|E

Although both trains were only scheduled to travel once a day in either direction, the 70000000 imp gal that they shipped annually still represented 25% of the UK's total milk shipment.|$|R

50|$|The main {{benefit of}} <b>milk</b> <b>runs</b> is, {{according}} to common opinion in literature, {{in the higher}} utilization of trucks and the resulting reduction of transport costs by up to 30%. In addition, the reduction of stock, both at the supplier side and at the customer side, avoidance in delays at the loading ramp, due to the consolidation of several suppliers and the specified time windows, high security planning and integration of reusable container recycling. The literature completely ignores the reduction of pollution of the environment, both by consolidation and the resulting higher utilization of trucks, and by the reduction of transportation vehicles, compared to JIT or groupage traffic.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an internal logistic system that uses <b>Milk</b> <b>Runs</b> (MR) also called Logistic Trains (LT) to transport parts in an electronic industry (production of car radios and GPS navigators). The MR design and process analysis are performed using computer simulation {{as part of}} a developed tool (IDS) that integrates simulation, database and CAD system together. By using simulation models for research and experimentation, we improve our knowledge about the system, prior to implementation or even changing the real system. The project outcomes, based on the simulation optimization, lead to the reduction of logistic costs and improvement in the availability of material in production lines. These in turn, reduce work in process material (by reducing stock levels and buffers in the production lines) and setting the minimum number of MR and kanban units...|$|R
