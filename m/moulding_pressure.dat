40|$|<b>Moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> and {{thickness}} are pre-fixed {{variables in}} the porcelain stoneware tile industry. This paper examines the effect of both parameters on technological and microstructure properties of unfired and fired porcelain stoneware bodies. The <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> in unfired tiles has a noticeable effect on bending strength and load borne. Common technological properties such as water absorption, porosity, bulk density and bending strength {{were obtained from the}} fired tiles. The results indicate that the variation in properties is independent of the thicknesses of the tiles. <b>Moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> affects at lower values, whereas higher <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> produces tiles with similar technological properties. The microstructure exhibits a constant amount of mullite and quartz in all pieces after the firing process. Observations from scanning electron microscopy show that mullite crystals enlarge as <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> increases, but the shape of the crystals are unaffected by the individual thicknesses. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the mullite needles increases with the <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure,</b> which is invariable to the thicknesses of the tiles. Although the total porosity remains constant, the number of pores is influenced by the thickness. The <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> also influences pore size. The results show a strong relationship between the number of closed pores and the thickness of the ceramic tile. JAEDoc_ 08 _ 00362 Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} {{of green and}} fired porcelain stoneware bodies have been studied in samples moulded at different pressures (10, 20, 30 and 40 MPa). In green tiles, higher differences in properties have been found at lower <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure.</b> After the fast-firing process, the tiles have been tested to obtain the technological properties such us lineal shrinkage, water absorption, porosity and bending strength. Results show that higher moulding pressures (30 and 40 MPa) give rise to tiles with similar technological properties. The amount of mullite and quartz remains constant in all pieces after firing process. SEM observations show that mullite crystals are longer as <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> increases, that means that initial <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> has a marked effect on mullite development, which is the main responsible of final properties.

The effect of <b>mould</b> <b>pressure</b> (MP) and substitution of quartz by RHA on bulk density and compressive strength of porcelain body is investigated.

The <b>moulding</b> <b>pressure</b> of 31 bar to 44 bar was set with different weight of granulate of BP from 110 gm to 160 gm.
