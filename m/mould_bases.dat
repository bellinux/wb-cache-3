50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1964 in Dornbirn by Georg Meusburger. In 1978 the {{production}} of standard <b>mould</b> <b>bases</b> began and the first catalogue was produced. In 1980 the company moved to the newly built company building in Wolfurt with a total floor space of 3,200 m². It employed 35 employees at the time. In 2007, Guntram Meusburger took over the management. At that time the company employed 260 employees and generated a turnover of 73 million Euros. The area of business Standard parts for die making was introduced in 2010. The turnover then amounted to 98 million Euros, which was generated by 380 employees. In 2013 Meusburger Georg became the market leader {{in the area of}} standard parts with 700 employees and a turnover of 160 million Euros.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new feature-based {{assembly}} {{library for}} injection <b>mould</b> <b>bases</b> is presented. Assembly design feature-object modeling and configuration management {{are the key}} technologies developed. This library is an important functional module of QuickMould, which is a productivity software tool for plastic injection mould design. Interactions between the library and mould design processes are realized. This paper also covers the details about {{the design of the}} system and the realization of some major functions, with which, the process of traditional mould design is simplified and standardized. Consequently, the lead-time for plastic injection mould can be significantly shortened...|$|E

50|$|The nave {{measures}} 55 ft by 19 ft. The {{north and}} south arcades have four bays; the north has round piers with <b>moulded</b> <b>bases</b> and capitals and the south has octagonal columns, also with <b>moulded</b> <b>bases</b> and capitals. There is an inner and an outer aisle to the north, separated from each other by an arcade of four pointed arches and octagonal piers. The font is octagonal with concave sides, each featuring a shield. The shields contain symbols of the Passion and the initials of Lawrence Towneley. The pulpit is constructed of oak on a stone base.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} artificial intelligence in the process planning of plastic injection <b>mould</b> <b>bases.</b> The com-puter-aided process-planning system, developed for IMOLD will extract and identify the operations required for machining. These operations are considered together with their precedence constraints and the available machines before the process plan for the mould base plate is generated. The process plan is optimised by a branch and bound based algorithm. Overall machining time has been proposed as the objective function for optimisation. The ability of this algorithm to search intelli-gently for a feasible optimised solution is illustrated by an industrial case study. A brief comparison with a genetic algor-ithm based process planning system is also made. The result of this development will allow users to optimise process plans easily for any given mould base, with options to suit dynamic changes on the manufacturing shop floor...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the time}} to market for metal casting {{products}} is becoming shorter, thus the lead time available for making the wax injection mould is decreasing. There is potential for timesaving in the mould design stage. This paper presents {{the basic structure of}} an interactive knowledge <b>based</b> wax injection <b>mould</b> design system. The basic of this system arises from an analysis of the wax injection mould design process for mould design companies. This wax injection mould design system covers both the mould design process and <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> standardization. In this system, the graphic module and the knowledge based module for generating mould features are integrated within an interactive Mold Wizard platform, Unigraphics system. This ensures that both speeds up the wax injection mould design process, without the need to redesign the <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> layout. With this capability, metal casting product could be designed quickly, cheaply with quality and competitively...|$|R

5000|$|The north arcade {{of three}} bays {{is a good}} {{specimen}} of early 13th-century work. It has two-centred arches springing from octagonal piers with stiff-leaved capitals and <b>moulded</b> <b>bases.</b> The present windows were inserted in the south wall in the 15th century. The mid-13th-century arch of the south doorway was reset from the old wall. Beside it is a stoup which was found in rebuilding the bridge over the brook in the village in 1925. The clearstory, with its three windows on each side, was apparently added about 1400 when the south wall was built. The west doorway with the walls on either side also formed {{a part of the}} early 12th-century church. The arch is of three orders, the two outer of which have roll mouldings resting on jamb shafts with <b>moulded</b> <b>bases</b> and carved capitals. The doorway has a tympanum formed of square stones set diamondwise. The early 14thcentury lectern at the east end of the nave is a rare example of its kind. It is of oak, carved in the front with five trefoiled arches, at one side with a trefoiled ogee-headed opening and on the other with oak leaves. The desk has a design of foliage. The pulpit is modern. There is a considerable number of plain oak seats of early 16th-century date. There is an early 17th-century oak chest in the church ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} possibilities of simulat-ing {{behavior of the}} group of trematode larvaе (miracidiae and cercariae) by the abstract slime <b>mould</b> <b>based</b> computer that is programmed by attractants and repellents. For describing this simulation, we appeal to the language which is a kind of π-cal-culus called Physarum spatial logic. This language contains la-bels for attractants and repellents. Taking into account the fact that the behavior of miracidiae and cercariae can be pro-grammed only by attractants (repellents for miracidiae and cercariae are not known still), we can claim that the behavior of miracidiae and cercariae is a restricted (poorer) form of Physarum spatial logic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a new type}} of feature, associative assembly design feature. Its concept, imple-mentation, and application are introduced. This new feature allows the following associations: (1) between parts that have not been defined geometrically; (2) between geo-metric entities defining interfaces between parts; and (3) between part geometry and intermediate geometry used to define a part. The associations can be geometric or non-geometric. Our extension to traditional assembly feature properties allows product architectures to be defined using features. These architectures, in turn, can be used to constrain the modular design of assembly geometry. The application is a <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> library for injection mould design...|$|R

40|$|Plasmodium of slime mould Physarum polycephalum {{is a large}} single celled {{organism}} visible unaided by the eye. This slime mould {{is capable}} of optimising the shape of its protoplasmic networks in spatial configurations of attractants and repellents. Such adaptive behaviour can interpreted as computation. When exposed to attractants and repellents, Physarum changes patterns of its electrical activity. We experimentally derived a unique one-to-one mapping between a range of selected bioactive chemicals and patterns of oscillations of the slime mould's extracellular electrical potential.
