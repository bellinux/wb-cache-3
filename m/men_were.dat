50|$|The law {{holds for}} the A and E {{proposition}}s of the Aristotelian square of opposition. For example, the A proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' and the E proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since {{no one can be}} honest and not honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, and some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not. For if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, the proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false. And if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest, the proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false also.|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' and {{a universal}} negative proposition {{having the same}} subject and predicate, such as, 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not white") are called contradictories. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true (for example, both, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' and 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest,' and, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest,' are both true.|$|R

On 10 November reinforcements increased the regiment's total to nine officers and 363 other ranks, and they returned to Gallipoli, reaching the front line at Hill 60 on 27 November.

50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that the particular is implied by the other. The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true, its contrary 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is false. Therefore the contradictory 'some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' implies the particular 'not every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'.|$|R
