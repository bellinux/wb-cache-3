50|$|Measuring {{instruments}} use {{a frequency}} discriminator {{to translate the}} pitch variations of a recorded tone into a flutter waveform, which is then passed through the weighting filter, before being full-wave rectified to produce a slowly varying signal which drives a meter or recording device. The <b>maximum</b> <b>meter</b> indication should be read as the flutter value.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{terms such as}} 'line-up level' and 'operating level' exist, and their meaning may vary from place to place. In an attempt bring clarity to level {{definitions}} {{in the context of}} programme transmission from one country to another, where different technical practices may apply, ITU-R Rec. BS.645 defined three reference levels: Measurement Level (ML), Alignment Level (AL) and Permitted Maximum Level (PML). This document shows the reading corresponding to these levels for several types of meter. Alignment Level is the level of a steady sine-wave alignment tone. Permitted Maximum Level refers to the permitted <b>maximum</b> <b>meter</b> indication that operators should aim for on speech, music etc., not tone.|$|E
5000|$|Optical power meters usually display time {{averaged}} power. So for pulse measurements, {{the signal}} duty cycle must be known {{to calculate the}} peak power value. However, the instantaneous peak power must be less than the <b>maximum</b> <b>meter</b> reading, or the detector may saturate, resulting in a wrong average readings. Also, at low pulse repetition rates, some meters with data or tone detection may produce improper or no readings.A class of [...] "high power" [...] meters has some type of optical attenuating element {{in front of the}} detector, typically allowing about a 20 dB increase in maximum power reading. Above this level, an entirely different class of [...] "laser power meter" [...] instrument is used, usually based on thermal detection.|$|E
5000|$|Maximum 6 rounds can be used, {{starting}} from the standing position with the rifle loaded and the safety catch applied. The shooting position is freestyle, but generally the prone position is used. At the command [...] "Fire" [...] the shooter disengages the safety catch and assumes firing position. The targets used are two «Småen» at <b>maximum</b> 150 <b>meters,</b> and either a 1/3 target at <b>maximum</b> 275 <b>meters</b> or a 1/4 target at <b>maximum</b> 225 <b>meters.</b> The two nearest targets must be shot {{before moving to the}} farthest.|$|R
