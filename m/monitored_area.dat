They remained the dominant pair till 2007 when Aragorn died. After the death of Aragorn, his son Ketamine established natal dominance beside his mother. Then five Whiskers males emigrated and all natal adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole it from him. Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by Whiskers male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the <b>monitored</b> <b>area</b> and could no longer be tracked. A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister. The Geckos and Sequioa were formed by Zorilla and Aragorn's daughters. Benzedrine is the last known surviving Commandos meerkat today.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, a joint Turkish-Hong Kong {{expedition}} including {{members of}} Noah's Ark Ministries International (NAMI) claimed to have found an unusual cave with fossilized wooden walls on Mount Ararat, well above the vegetation line. In 2010, NAMI released videos of their discovery of the wood structures. Members of Noah's Ark Ministries International reported carbon dating suggests the wood is approximately 4,800 years old. It is unlikely {{that there was any}} human settlement at the site at altitude of 4,000 meters. Randall Price, a partner with Noah's Ark Ministries International from early 2008 to the summer of 2008, stated that the discovery was probably the result of a hoax, perpetrated by ten Kurdish workers hired by the Turkish guide used by the Chinese, who planted large wood beams taken from an old structure near the Black Sea at the cave site. In a response to Price, Noah’s Ark Ministries International stated that they had terminated co-operation with Price in early October 2008, and that he had never been in the location of the wooden structure they identified, and regretted his absence in their find. On their website they say they asked for the opinion of Mr. Muhsin Bulut, the Director of Cultural Ministries, Agri Province. The web site says that his response was that secretly transporting such an amount of timber to the strictly <b>monitored</b> <b>area</b> and planting a large wood structure at an altitude of 4,000 meters would have been impossible. At the end of April 2010, it was reported that Turkey's culture minister ordered a probe into how NAMI brought its pieces of wood samples from Turkey to China. A Scottish explorer investigating the NAMI claim was reported missing, on 14 October 2010, from an expedition on Ararat. His last camp site and personal effects were subsequently located but the circumstances remain unresolved.|$|E

Primarily designed for monitoring purposes, many sensor applications require continuous collection and processing of sensed data. Due to the limited power supply for sensor nodes, energy efficiency is a major performance concern in query processing. In this paper, we focus on continuous kNN query processing in object tracking sensor networks. We propose a localized scheme to monitor nearest neighbors to a query point. The key idea is to establish a <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> for each query so that only the updates relevant to the query are collected. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> is set up when the kNN query is initially evaluated and is expanded and shrunk on the fly upon object movement. We analyze the optimal maintenance of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> and develop an adaptive algorithm to dynamically decide when to shrink the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area.</b> Experimental results show that establishing a <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> for continuous kNN query processing greatly reduces energy consumption and prolongs network lifetime...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} the p-percent coverage {{problem in this}} paper and propose two algorithms to prolong network lifetime {{based on the fact}} that for some applications full coverage is not necessary and different subareas of the <b>monitored</b> <b>area</b> may have different coverage requirements. The first algorithm, CPCA, is a centralized algorithm which selects the least number of nodes to monitor p-percent of the <b>monitored</b> <b>area.</b> The second algorithm, DPCP, is a distributed algorithm which can determine a set of nodes in a distributed manner to cover p-percent of the <b>monitored</b> <b>area.</b> Both of the algorithms guarantee network connectivity. The simulation results show that our algorithms can remarkably prolong network lifetime, have less than 5 % unrequired coverage for large networks and employ nodes fairly for most cases. I...|$|E

The response was {{the amount of}} n(6 Li, T) reactions occurring in a TLD 600 located {{at the center of}} a cylindrical polyethylene moderator. Fluence, (n, a) and H*(10) responses were calculated for 47 monoenergetic neutron sources. The H*(10) relative response was compared with responses of commercially available neutron monitors being alike. Due to 6 Li cross section (n,) reactions are mainly produced by thermal neutrons, however TLD 600 is sensitive to gamma-rays; to eliminate the signal due to photons <b>monitor</b> <b>area</b> was built to hold 2 pairs of TLD 600 and 2 pairs of TLD 700, thus from the difference between TLD 600 and TLD 700 readouts the net signal due to neutrons is obtained.

On the other hand, it updates through the node's own state scheduling mechanism and converts neighbor nodes dynamically about matching scheduling, which can balance the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> sensor node residual energy and node energy consumption. Therefore it can achieve the purpose of prolonging network lifetime. Finally, the simulation results show that the algorithm not only can use fewer nodes to effectively cover the <b>monitoring</b> <b>area</b> completely and improve the coverage of the network but also can optimize resource allocation and prolong the network lifetime.   </p...|$|R
