40|$|Nutritive Value Of Chestnut Fruit (Anacardium Occidentale) Silage In Combination With Various Levels Of Cassava Mill Addition and Length Of Fermentation Time As Feed. The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to evaluate nutritive value of chestnut fruit silage in combination with various levels of casava mill addition and length of fermentation time. This research was conducted in 2 treatment factors with 3 replication. The I factor are : Various level of casava mill e. i. L 1 : 0 %, L 2 : 3 %, L 3 : 6 % and L 4 : 9 %, and the II factor are length of fermentation time e. i W 1 : 20 days, W 2 : 40 days and W 3 : 60 days. The result showed that silage technonogy manifestly (P< 0, 05) <b>with</b> various casava <b>mill</b> level and fermentation time can increase nutritive value chestnut fruit. Higher organic mater percen at 0 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 20 days (97, 94 %). Higher ash percen at 0 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 40 days (97, 94 %), and at 3 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 60 days (3, 67 %). Higher crude fiber at 9 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 60 days (7, 19 %) and low at 0 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 20 days (6, 29 %). Higher extract ether at 3 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 40 days (3, 73 %) and at 6 % casava <b>mill</b> <b>with</b> fermentation time of 40 days (3, 38 %). It could be concluded that silage technonogy can be aplication at chestnut fruit. This technology can increase benefit of chestnut fruit as feed because increase its nutritive value...|$|R
