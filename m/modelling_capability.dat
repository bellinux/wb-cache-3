First released in 1984, it has been under continuous development in response to user feedback. A new major version with network <b>modelling</b> <b>capability</b> and new vehicle movement classes was released in April 2013. The latest Version 7 includes new timing analysis methods for Common Control Groups (multiple intersections operating under one signal controller) and Network Cycle Time and Signal Offset calculations for signal coordination. Sidra Intersection is a micro-analytical traffic evaluation tool that employs lane-by-lane and vehicle drive cycle models. It {{can be used to}} compare alternative treatments of individual intersections and networks of intersections involving signalised intersections (fixed-time/pretimed and actuated), roundabouts (unsignalised), roundabouts with metering signals, fully signalised roundabouts, two-way stop and give-way (yield) sign control, all-way (4-way and 3-way) stop sign control, merging, single-point urban interchanges, traditional diamond and diverging diamond interchanges, basic freeway segments, signalised and unsignalised midblock crossings for pedestrians, merging analysis and network modelling of these intersection and interchange types.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) {{has some}} {{attractive}} features: fast learning capability {{and the possibility}} of efficient digital hardware implementation. Although CMAC was proposed many years ago, several open questions have been left even for today. Among them the most important ones are about its modelling and generalization capabilities. The limits of its <b>modelling</b> <b>capability</b> were addressed in the literature and recently a detailed analysis of its generalization property was given. The results show that there are differences between the one-dimensional and the multidimensional versions of CMAC. The <b>modelling</b> <b>capability</b> of a multidimensional network is inferior to that of the one-dimensional one. This paper discusses the reasons of this difference and suggests a new kernel-based interpretation of CMAC. It shows that a one-dimensional binary CMAC can be considered as an SVM with second order B-spline kernel function. Applying this approach the paper shows that one-dimensional and multidimensional CMACs can be constructed with similar <b>modelling</b> <b>capability.</b> Copyright © 2003 IFA...|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{focussed}} {{on the research}} and development of an intelligent driver warning system (IDWS) as a means to improve road safety and driving comfort. Two independent IDWS case studies are presented. The first study examines the methodology and implementation for attentive visual tracking and trajectory estimation for dynamic scene segmentation problems. In the second case study, the concept of driver modelling is evaluated which can be used to provide useful feedback to drivers. In both case studies, the quality of IDWS is largely determined by the <b>modelling</b> <b>capability</b> for estimating multiple vehicle trajectories and modelling driving behaviour. A class of modelling techniques based on neural-fuzzy systems, which exhibits provable learning and <b>modelling</b> <b>capability,</b> is proposed.

40|$|Service {{oriented}} architectures {{have become}} very popular the last few years. The abstraction of computer systems into a service paradigm bring many new solutions, both for cross business processes to aid interoperability and the reuse of existing legacy systems in a new network centric world. In the wake of this, service modelling has {{become a part of}} OMGs Model Driven Architecture and new modelling languages that are based on past experience for the new paradigm are emerging. BPMN 2. 0 and SoaML are the newest modelling standards from OMG that focus on service modelling. They provide different approaches to the service domain where BPMN 2. 0 emphasise process modelling and SoaML emphasise service architecture modelling. BPMN 4 SOA is a language that extends the use of BPMN 2. 0, and bring more emphasis on the service <b>modelling</b> <b>capability</b> of BPMN 2. 0. It does this by means of role modelling to abstract the participants and service choreographies into reusable objects. BPMN 4 SOA also provide <b>modelling</b> <b>capability</b> for information data for messages through implementation of UML at L 0 compliance.

Inductively heated melters are those in which heat is generated using coils around, rather than electrodes within, the material to be heated. Cold crucible or skull melters are those in which the melted material is confined within unmelted material of the same composition. This phase of the report complements and supplements Phase A by Loren Eyler, specifically by giving additional information on <b>modeling</b> <b>capabilities</b> for the inductively heated melter concept. Eyler discussed electrically heated melter <b>modeling</b> <b>capabilities,</b> emphasizing heating by electrodes within the melt or on crucible walls.
