It {{is needed to}} be continuously monitor the trains approaching from neighboring stations, for safe train movement due to high density of trains on a track. Conventionally, station <b>master</b> <b>monitor</b> approaching /departing trains by using Route Relay Interlocking (RRI) system which can monitor trains between station blocks. In this paper a GIS augmented automatic train monitoring (GAATM) system is proposed for station master to monitor approaching/departing trains to/from station.

50|$|Every <b>master</b> <b>monitors</b> the bus {{for start}} and stop bits and does not start a message while another master is keeping the bus busy. However, two masters may start {{transmission}} {{at about the same}} time; in this case, arbitration occurs. Slave transmit mode can also be arbitrated, when a master addresses multiple slaves, but this is less common. In contrast to protocols (such as Ethernet) that use random back-off delays before issuing a retry, I²C has a deterministic arbitration policy. Each transmitter checks the level of the data line (SDA) and compares it with the levels it expects; if they do not match, that transmitter has lost arbitration and drops out of this protocol interaction.|$|R

People willing to learn any kind of arts, but have no time would look for a tutor who would be available at his/her ease. An attempt to satisfy the same is the project that I’ve implemented. My focus is mainly on Kung fu an ancient form of Chinese Martial arts. Learning Kung fu needs a lot of practice and therefore demands having a professional kung fu <b>master</b> <b>monitoring</b> all the time, which is very expensive. Therefore, I have developed a new way of learning experience by creating a virtual Kung fu master normally called as Sifu. In this application, players can learn and perfect different styles and techniques with the help of virtual Sifu. All these styles have be pre recorded by a professional Sifu using a motion sensing input device called Kinect. This Virtual Trainer is designed to help users learn and improve their martial arts by comparing the user’s movements against those of a pre-recorded motion profile of Sifu by giving an immediate feedback to the user. Although many comparision algorithms exist I have chosen Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, which uses the Euclidean Distance formula. One of the main advantages of Dynamic Time Warping algorithm is, it overcomes the problems of motion analysis in speed and time...|$|R

The authors have previously identified a potential correlation between inter-band dynamics and the subjective quality of produced music excerpts. This paper describes the previously presented Inter-Band Relationship (IBR) descriptor and extends this work by conducting more thorough testing with real-world music excerpts and a greater number of listening subjects. A high degree of correlation is observed between the Mean Subject Scores (MSS) and the objective IBR descriptor suggesting it could be used as an additional model output variable (MOV) to describe produced music quality. The method lends itself to real-time implementation and therefore can be exploited within mixing, <b>mastering</b> and <b>monitoring</b> tools...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to OSU communityA {{series of experiments}} were conducted to test whether students without observational learning will acquire observational learning by teaching them to <b>master</b> <b>monitoring</b> the correct and incorrect responses of their peers. The procedure was tested across 5 participants. The participants were five to six year old students with developmental disabilities who did not demonstrate observational learning in the preexperimental probes. The dependent variables for the first experiment were textual responses to probes for common words and tacts immediately following each session in which they observed their peers receive learn units. A counterbalanced delayed multiple baseline and multiple probe design across participants for a) tacts and b) words was implemented. The treatment consisted of the target students completing {{a series of steps}} in which they learned to monitor their assigned peer's correct and incorrect responses to learn unit presentations of words to a predetermined criterion. The results demonstrated a higher level of responding to words and tacts from pre-experimental levels, thereby demonstrating that the students had acquired observational learning. In addition, the results demonstrated that the participants' performance was not localized to the peers they had been paired with in the training sessions. Experiment 2 was primarily conducted as a replication of Experiment 1. The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the effects of the monitoring intervention on observational learning repertoires after observing a peer receive learn units on vocal spelling programs. The results showed similar findings where students who did not have observational learning repertoires in the first experiment demonstrated observational learning after learning to monitor correct and incorrect responses emitted by their peers...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) camera {{networks}} {{have an important}} role in surveillance systems. They have the ability to direct the attention to interesting events that occur in the scene. In order to achieve such behavior the cameras in the network use a process known as sensor slaving: one (or more) <b>master</b> camera <b>monitors</b> a wide area and tracks moving targets so as to provide the positional information to one (or more) slave camera. The slave camera foveates at the targets in high resolution. In this paper, we propose a simple method to solve two typical problems that are the basic building blocks to create high level functionality in PTZ camera networks: the computation of the world to image homographies and the computation of camera to camera homographies. The first one is used for computing the image sensor observation model in sequential target tracking, the second one is used for camera slaving. Finally a cooperative tracking approach exploiting the use of both homographies is presented...|$|R
