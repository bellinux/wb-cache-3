25|$|From November 1886 to 1890, he was Director of Naval Ordnance, {{responsible}} for weapons and munitions. He was {{responsible for}} the development of quick-firing guns to be used against the growing threat from torpedo boats, and particularly claimed responsibility for removing wooden boarding pikes from navy ships. The Navy did not have responsibility for <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> of weapons and ammunition, which was {{in the hands of the}} War Office. Fisher began a long campaign to return this responsibility to the Admiralty, but did not finally succeed until he later became First Sea Lord. He was appointed Aide-de-Camp to the Queen in 1887, and promoted Rear-Admiral in August 1890.|$|E
500|$|About this time, {{the amount}} of trade handled by the Port of Lancaster was declining, largely owing to silting up of the River Lune. [...] In May 1842 Sharpe had been elected a Port Commissioner, and later {{proposed}} what became the Morecambe Bay Harbour Project. [...] This planned {{to build a new}} port at Poulton-le-Sands (soon to become part of Morecambe), and link it to Lancaster by means of a ship canal. [...] After prolonged discussion this proved to be too expensive, and it was agreed to link Lancaster and Morecambe by railway rather than by canal. [...] An Act for the creation of the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH) received Royal assent in July 1846, the revised plan being to link this line to the [...] "L"NWR at Green Ayre, {{in the northern part of}} Lancaster next to the River Lune. [...] A clause in the Act allowed the MH to be sold to the [...] "L"NWR, which took place in October. The parts played by Sharpe in all of this financial manoeuvring were conflicting and complex: he was simultaneously a Port Commissioner, a Town Councillor, a member of the board of the Morecambe Bay Harbour Company, and Secretary to the [...] "L"NWR. In 1847, near the Morecambe terminus of the railway, Sharpe laid the first stone of the North Western Hotel (later the Midland), which he (or more probably Paley) had designed. In April that year Sharpe had resigned as Secretary to the [...] "L"NWR to enable him to tender for building the line from Morecambe to Wennington, a village north-east of Lancaster near to the Yorkshire border. His tender of £100,000 (equivalent to £ as of [...] ) for the line (excluding the bridge over the River Lune at Green Ayre) was accepted. [...] He also gained the contract for building the harbour. In June 1848 the section of line from Lancaster to Morecambe was opened, and by October 1849 the ten-mile section from Lancaster to Wennington was completed. In September Sharpe had also resigned as a director of the [...] "L"NWR to become its traffic manager, and was then contracted to <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> rolling stock for the railway, something for which he had neither expertise nor previous experience. [...] By February 1851 the line was experiencing difficulties, its traffic being less than expected and its costs rising; and in December Sharpe was given notice that his contract with the company would be curtailed the following month.|$|E

2500|$|Indian Railways {{announced}} {{contracts to}} manufacture electric locomotives in Bihar. [...] The electric locomotives will be manufactured at {{a factory in}} Madhepura and the diesel ones at Marora. Five multinational companies have been shortlisted for two separate contracts, jointly worth an estimated $8 billion (Rs37,600 crore), to <b>manufacture</b> <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> locomotives for the Indian Railways. In the past, Indian Railways manufactured locomotives at the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in West Bengal or from state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, and diesel locomotives from Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi. These factories now have developed capacity issues. Germany’s Siemens AG, Bombardier Transportation India Ltd, a unit of Canada’s Bombardier Inc., and France’s Alstom SA is attempting to secure an order to build and supply at least 660 electric locomotives for the railways. General Electric Co. (GE) and Electro Motive Diesel Inc. (EMD) will compete for the second contract—to build and supply 1,000 diesel train engines for the national transporter.|$|E
