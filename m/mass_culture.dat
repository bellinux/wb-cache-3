40|$|Protein {{synthetic}} error frequency, {{determined in}} cell-free extracts as delta leu/delta phe incorporation following poly(U) stimulation, {{has been found}} to decrease progressively in several strains of human diploid fibroblasts during their limited replicative lifespan. To explore the basis of this phenomenon, we followed a <b>mass</b> (uncloned) <b>culture</b> of one normal strain at 13 stages of its replicative lifespan. We found a progressive tenfold decline in error frequency that was inversely correlated with passage level (r = -. 93, p less than. 001). This could not be ascribed to the slow rates of replication associated with fibroblast senescence because slowing of growth by serum deprivation did not change error frequency. Additionally, terminal <b>mass</b> <b>cultures</b> maintained for 16 wk at saturation density to minimize cell selection did not change error frequency over this time. Error frequencies in 12 individual clones purified from the parental culture did not decline on repeated passage, either remaining constant or, in two clones, rising abruptly three- to five-fold after initial assays. Error frequencies of clones showed a weak inverse correlation with growth vigor but not with the maximum doubling number. We conclude that selective pressures favor more vigorously dividing clones with low protein synthetic error frequencies leading to their predominance in <b>mass</b> <b>cultures...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>culturing</b> of {{suitable}} live {{foods for}} mariculture purposes is slowed {{down by the}} lack of fundamental knowledge on interesting food species with high nutritional value. Research at the laboratory level has shown that in this regard Fabrea salina, a pelagic heterotrichous marine ciliate, seems to be a promising species for the following reasons. a) It can easily be fed with inert foods such as dry yeast as well as with live algae. b) With Dunaliella viridis as sole food source, densities of several hundreds of ciliates per ml can be obtained quite easily. c) Fabrea salina is a very euryhaline organism: the tolerance range extends from normal seawater to over 100 promille salinity. d) The ciliate reproduces very well at high temperatures (> 30 °C). To determine the optimal temperature-salinity combination several experiments were carried out.

40|$|One {{question}} {{central to}} the study of developmental biology is: How does phenotypic diversity arise? The neural crest provides an excellent model system for investigations into the nature of cell-fate decisions and generation of lineage diversity. In the studies described here, I have examined two aspects of this question in cell culture. The first aspect concerns the cellular dynamics underlying the cell-fate decisions. A necessary prerequisite to the study lineage diversification is the reliable production of differentiated cells from undifferentiated precursors in a controllable environment. I have developed a system for the growth of rat neural crest cells. The system allows the serial propagation of a defined sub-population of neural crest cells at clonal density. In the system neural crest cells can differentiate into at least two identifiable cell types; peripheral neurons and Schwann cells. By sub-cloning I have been able to address specific predictions made by a stem cell model of neural crest development, and found neural crest cells to possess multipotency, self-renewal and the capacity to divide asymmetrically. The second aspect of the question addressed in this study concerns the ability of the neural crest cell environment to control the choice of cell fate. I have examined various culture conditions for their ability to affect the choice of cell fate both in clonal <b>cultures</b> and in <b>mass</b> <b>cultures.</b> In the clonal cultures I found that the fate of neural crest cell clones can be altered in an instructive fashion by the composition of the substrate, or by the presence of fetal bovine serum. In <b>mass</b> <b>cultures,</b> we have examined the effect of medium composition on the expression of adrenergic traits and on the expression of a transcription factor, MASH- 1, thought to participate in neural determination. Finally, in <b>mass</b> <b>cultures</b> of neo-natal adrenal chromaffin cells, we have examined the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor on neuronal differentiation, mitosis and acquisition of trophic dependence. ...|$|R

40|$|Rotifers and {{astaxanthin}} both play {{an important}} part in the aquaculture industry. Rotifers are used as a substitute for copepods, the main source of food for larval fish in natural systems, due to the ease with which they can be cultured. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid and antioxidant which brightens the coloring of fish and improves fish health. Rotifers are believed to be a method through which astaxanthin can be bioencapsulated and vectored to larval fish. As a result, {{it is important to understand}} the effect of astaxanthin on rotifers themselves. This experiment uses a multitude of different protocols to determine how different astaxanthin compounds effects rotifers on both the individual and population levels. Reproductive tables and fluorescent imaging were used to assess the health of individual rotifers; population density measurements in <b>mass</b> <b>cultures</b> were used to assess rotifer population health. The reproductive ability of rotifers was significantly different from control under multiple astaxanthin treatments. Astaxanthin enrichment also created a higher stable population density in the <b>mass</b> <b>cultures.</b> The fluorescent imaging showed that the rotifers reached peak astaxanthin concentration within the rotifer gut after 3 hours, and but concentration returned to control levels within 24 hours of removal from astaxanthin.
