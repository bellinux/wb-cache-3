They are an important basis of traditional <b>mountain</b> <b>farming</b> because of excellent places for alpine agriculture or pastures.|$|E

50|$|The GTA is a subalpine, montane trail {{primarily}} traversing {{a previously}} cultivated, densely populated landscape.

Some abandoned hamlets had populations of about 100; others {{have one or two}} older residents left. Some descendants of original residents, heirs to property, return to the hamlets during summer as a second home; however, most houses have fallen into disrepair.|$|E
