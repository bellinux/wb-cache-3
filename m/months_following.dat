Later, given the press of tactical operations {{and the need to}} replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E

5|$|In Thailand, however, {{substantial}} {{efforts to}} prevent further such occurrences had not materialized in the <b>months</b> <b>following</b> the accident.

Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
