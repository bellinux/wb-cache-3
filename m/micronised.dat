40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} for green forming with nanosized yttria-doped, partially stabilised zirconia (Y-PSZ) powder using both uniaxial compaction and colloidal suspensions has been investigated. Green compacts were fabricated from a Y-PSZ nanopowder, a submicron powder of similar composition and combinations {{of the two}} by die pressing at varying axial stress, with the effect of a <b>micronising</b> milling process on the green density also being examined. Results indicated that the incorporation of the nanopowder into the submicron powder increased green density by up to 17 % whilst <b>micronising</b> helped to achieve green densities as high as 60 % of theoretical, even with the pure nanopowder. The zeta potential, viscosity and mean particle size of two different Y-PSZ nanosuspensions were measured for two different anionic polyelectrolytes, polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polymethacrylic acid (PMAA). The results showed that both led to flocculation under acidic conditions and hence increasing viscosity with increasing polyelectrolyte concentration...|$|R

However, it is only of low absorption in man. Recently, an innovative ferric pyrophosphate has been developed (Sunactive Fe™) based on small-particle-size ferric pyrophosphate (average size 0 · 3 μm) mixed with emulsifiers, so that it remains in suspension in liquid products. The aim of the present studies was to compare Fe absorption of <b>micronised,</b> dispersible ferric pyrophosphate (Sunactive Fe™) with that of ferrous sulfate in an infant cereal and a yoghurt drink. Two separate Fe absorption studies were made in adult women (ten women/study). Fe absorption {{was based on the}} erythrocyte incorporation of stable isotopes (57 Fe and 58 Fe) 14 d after the intake of labelled test meals of infant cereal (study 1) or yoghurt drink (study 2). Each test meal was fortified with 5 mg Fe as ferrous sulfate or <b>micronised,</b> dispersible ferric pyrophosphate. Results are presented as geometric means.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} into factors affecting the interparticulate cohesion profile of three <b>micronised</b> drugs, {{as a function of}} humidity. An atomic force microscope (AFM) colloid probe technique was correlated with physico-chemical properties and in-vitro performance.

40|$|Dry powder inhaler (DPI) {{products}} have traditionally comprised a simple formulation of <b>micronised</b> drug {{mixed with a}} carrier excipient, typically lactose monohydrate. The presence of the carrier is aimed at overcoming issues of poor flowability and dispersibility, associated with the cohesive nature of small, <b>micronised</b> active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles.

In tandem with the development of alternative formulations has been the development of devices designed to ensure the efficient delivery and dispersion of carrier-free powder on inhalation.

Methods: IB monohydrate and anhydrous crystals were produced from seed crystals and supercritical carbon dioxide crystallisation, respectively. Young's modulus of anhydrous and monohydrate IB crystals was determined using nanoindentation. For air-jet <b>micronised</b> crystals, the physicochemical and surface interfacial properties via the cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB) approach were investigated. These data were correlated to in-vitro aerosolisation performance of carrier-based DPI formulations containing either anhydrous or monohydrate IB. Key findings: Particle size and Young's modulus of both crystals were similar and this was reflected in their similar processing upon micronisation. Particle size of <b>micronised</b> anhydrous and monohydrate crystals were similar. CAB measurements of the <b>micronised</b> particles of monohydrate or anhydrous forms of IB with respect to lactose were 0. 70 (R 2 = 0. 998) and 0. 77 (R 2 = 0. 999), respectively. These data suggested that both samples had similar adhesion to lactose, which correlated with their similar in-vitro aerosolisation performance in DPI formulations. Conclusions: Monohydrate and anhydrous crystals of IB exhibited similar mechanical properties and interfacial properties upon secondary processing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{findings}} {{demonstrated that}} {{particle size reduction}} of insoluble fibre materials (i. e. starfruit insoluble fibre-rich fraction and cellulose) to micro-sizes effectively enhanced their physicochemical properties, which provided clues to their physiological functions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of particle size reduction of these insoluble fibres by micron technology on indices of bowel health. RESULTS: Feeding of the <b>micronised</b> fibres (9. 68 - 14. 3 mu m), especially those prepared by high-pressure micronisation, effectively (P < 0. 05) improved various caecal and faecal indices, such as decreasing the caecal ammonia concentration (by 20. 0 - 30. 0 %), increasing the faecal output (135 - 150 %) and moisture content (143 - 1571 / 0) and lowering the activities of undesired beta-D-glucosidase (by 39. 2 - 43. 6 %) and P-D-glucuronidase (by 71. 4 - 77. 5 %) in faeces of hamsters. Relationships between physicochemical properties and physiological functions of the <b>micronised</b> fibres were considered. The results also demonstrated that the type, processing and related particle size of insoluble fibres were important factors affecting their physicochemical properties and physiological functions. CONCLUSION: The consumption of <b>micronised</b> insoluble fibres at 5 % level might exert a favourable effect on improving various caecal and faecal indices.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} a function-based relationship between the physical and bulk properties of pre-blended mixtures of fine and coarse lactose grades with the in vitro performance of an adhesive active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Different grades of <b>micronised</b> and milled lactose (Lactohale (LH) LH 300, LH 230, LH 210 and Sorbolac 400) were pre-blended with coarse grades of lactose (LH 100, LH 206 and Respitose SV 010) at concentrations of 2. 5, 5, 10 and 20 wt. %. The bulk and rheological properties and particle size distributions were characterised. The pre-blends were formulated with <b>micronised</b> budesonide and in vitro performance in a Cyclohaler device tested using a next-generation impactor (NGI) at 90 l/min. Correlations between the lactose properties and in vitro performance were established using linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses. The addition of milled and <b>micronised</b> lactose fines with the coarse lactose had a significant influence on physical and rheological properties of the bulk lactose. Formulations of the different pre-blends with budesonide directly influenced in vitro performance attributes including fine particle fraction, mass median aerodynamic diameter and pre-separator deposition. While linear regression suggested a number of physical and bulk properties may influence in vitro performance, ANN analysis suggested the critical parameters in describing in vitro deposition patterns were the relative concentrations of lactose fines % < 4. 5 μm and % < 15 μm.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the progestagen component in combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for breast cancer risk has been long debated. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} progestins exert both genomic transcriptional and non-genomic effects that can enhance the proliferation, invasiveness and spread of breast cancer cells. According to a novel hypothesis, progestins can still activate cancer stem cells in patients with pre-existing, clinically undetected breast cancer. However, some experimental and clinical data suggest that different progestins may have a different impact on the pathophysiology of malignant breast cells. In vitro studies on estrogen receptor (ER) + breast cancer cells have shown that the addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to estradiol (E(2)) produces a significantly higher increase of the mRNA levels and activities of estrogen-activating enzymes aromatase, 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type- 1 and sulfatase when compared with progesterone plus E(2). In randomised trial performed on ovariectomised adult female monkeys, oral E(2) plus MPA have resulted in a significantly greater proliferation of breast lobular and ductal epithelium when compared with placebo, whereas E(2) plus <b>micronised</b> progesterone have not.
