5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> this etiquette is that opposing enforcers {{must agree to}} a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, {{he did not believe}} in winning at any costs; he truly believed that the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> college football was the college football player. As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{enlisted in}} the Maryland National Guard as a private in 1916 and served with it on the Mexican border and the Western Front during World War I before {{transferring}} to the United States Army Air Service. After the war, he obtained a regular commission. Already qualified as an aerial observer, he became a pilot in 1922. For many years he was an influential instructor at the Air Corps Tactical School. Wilson became a leading theorist who embraced the doctrine that strategic bombing was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> air power. He argued that by attacking vulnerabilities, whole industries could be brought to a halt without necessarily having to destroy all of the factories. The doctrine which Wilson expounded later {{became the basis for}} AWPD-1, the Army Air Forces' strategic war plan developed in 1941.|$|E

The latter is able to feed an entire community {{for nearly a year}} from its meat, blubber, and skin. Inuit hunters most often hunt juvenile whales which, compared to adults, are safer to hunt and have tastier skin. Ringed seal and bearded seal are the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> an Inuit diet and is often the largest part of an Inuit hunter's diet.|$|E
25|$|The Fourteenth Army was {{supported}} by 221 Group RAF, which operated B-25 Mitchell bombers, Hawker Hurricane and P-47 Thunderbolt fighters and long-range Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers. They could also call upon the B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the Far Eastern Strategic Air Force. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> air support was probably the Combat Cargo Task Force, which included both British and American squadrons of transport aircraft, in particular the ubiquitous C47. Fourteenth Army required 7,000 sorties by transport aircraft every day during the maximum intensity of the fighting.|$|E
25|$|When and how {{applications}} are taught varies from style to style. Today, many styles begin to teach new students {{by focusing on}} exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, {{in order to allow}} its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.|$|E

Staff members protested that the speech was not the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the debate, and that it was a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention.

25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the routinization Hasidism {{underwent}} was {{the adoption}} of dynasticism. The first to claim legitimacy by right of descent from the Besht was his grandson, Boruch of Medzhybizh, appointed 1782. He held a lavish court with Hershel of Ostropol as jester, and demanded the other Righteous acknowledge his supremacy. Upon the death of Menachem Nachum Twersky of Chernobyl, his son Mordechai Twersky succeeded him. The principle was conclusively affirmed in the great dispute after Liadi's demise in 1813: his senior acolyte Aharon HaLevi of Strashelye was defeated by his son, Dovber Schneuri, whose offspring retained the title for 181 years.|$|E
25|$|The solute {{content of}} water is perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> water conditions, as total {{dissolved}} solids and other constituents dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.|$|E
