40|$|Abstract- The study {{investigated}} the effects of different methods of application of selected <b>mordants</b> on dyeing woven cotton with dyes from the stem bark of Albizia coriaria. The methods of application of <b>mordants</b> used includes; pre-mordanting, simultaneous <b>mordanting</b> and post-mordanting. The effects on cotton analyzed are color fastness to; light, washing, wet and dry rubbing and color characteristics on CIELab color coordinates. Aqueous extraction method was used to extract the dye. Some selected <b>mordants</b> were used for dyeing viz; alum, ferrous sulphate 1, and iron water. In the control dyeing {{without the use of}} <b>mordants,</b> very good fastness were registered with the following fastness ratings; for washing (4 - 5), dry rubbing (5), wet rubbing (5) and light (4). The natural dye is a substantive dye since it registered very good fastness grades without the use of <b>mordants.</b> The use of <b>mordants</b> improved color fastness to light from ratings of (4) to (5) and (6) for iron water and ferrous sulphate and a poor fastness of (3) was recorded for alum. Post-mordanting method registered the best overall fastness results and the best color strengths K/S values and color saturation values C. However, the most brilliant colors were registered with simultaneous <b>mordanting</b> method with all <b>mordants.</b> However, there was no observable effect of <b>mordanting</b> methods on the redness or yellowness of color.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 62) Dandelion roots, dock roots, English walnut hulls, eucalyptus bark, eucalyptus hulls, eucalyptus leaves, juniper berries, mistletoe, kelp {{and onion}} skins were the natural dye materials selected for this study. Five colorfastness tests were performed using these ten natural dyes and four <b>mordants.</b> The {{study was designed}} to obtain qualitative information on the colorfastness properties of the ten natural dyes to light, laundering, crocking, perspiration and drycleaning and to determine the effect of the <b>mordants</b> on these colorfastness properties. Alum, chrome, iron and tin were the <b>mordants</b> used. For the most part, the ten natural dyes rated satisfactory on the crocking, laundering, drycleaning and perspiration tests. A few dye/mordant combinations rated satisfactory to light. These included: juniper berries <b>mordanted</b> with tin, <b>mordanted</b> English walnut hulls, eucalyptus hulls and leaves <b>mordanted</b> with iron, eucalyptus bark <b>mordanted</b> with chrome and iron plus all kelp samples except those <b>mordanted</b> with tin. The lightfastness of dock roots, mistletoe and eucalyptus hulls was poor. Generally, colorfastness was increased by applying <b>mordants.</b> Iron <b>mordanted</b> samples averaged lower ratings than the other <b>mordanted</b> samples on all colorfastness tests except light and averaged lower ratings the the unmordanted samples on the crocking and laundering tests. Alum, tin and chrome did very well on the colorfastness tests except for lightfastness, in which case they did average compared with the other samples...|$|R

30|$|In this study, wool fibers are dyed with {{a natural}} {{colorant}} extracted from walnut bark in presence and absence of <b>mordants.</b> The effect of aluminum sulfate, ferrous sulfate, and stannous chloride <b>mordants</b> on colorimetric and fastness properties of wool fibers was investigated. Juglone was identified as the main coloring component in walnut bark extract by UV visible and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. The results showed that pretreatment with metallic <b>mordants</b> substantially improved the colorimetric and fastness properties of wool fibers dyed with walnut bark extract. Ferrous sulfate and stannous chloride <b>mordanted</b> wool fibers shows best results than potassium aluminum sulfate <b>mordanted</b> and unmordanted wool fibers. This is ascribed due to strong chelating power of ferrous sulfate and stannous chloride <b>mordants.</b>|$|R

40|$|Samples of {{untreated}} and ammonia-treated {{wheat straw}} were <b>mordanted</b> with sodium dichromate after being chopped, ground, or ground and washed in neutral detergent solution. The NDF {{content of the}} <b>mordanted</b> samples increased to 97 to 100 % DM in those ground or ground and neutral detergent-washed, whereas the increase was lower (92 % DM) in those chopped. Chromium content after <b>mordanting</b> was 4. 0 % DM in the samples washed in neutral detergent solution and 2. 4 to 2. 6 % DM in those simply chopped or ground. There were no major differences due to ammonia treatment. Particle size distribution of ground samples showed significant differences in proportions of particles larger than 1 mm with control samples less than ground and <b>mordanted</b> samples less than ground, neutral detergent-washed, and <b>mordanted</b> samples. There also were variable and significant effects of these treatments on functional specific gravity. Rumen DM disappearance after 48 -h incubation in fiber bags was reduced greatly by <b>mordanting</b> but was negligible only with the previous neutral detergent treatment. The estimated rumen passage rates of <b>mordanted</b> samples of untreated straw differed significantly among treatments with chopped samples less than ground samples, which were less than ground and neutral detergent-washed samples, reflecting their differences in particle size and functional specific gravity.

5|$|The priory's lands around Guisborough were {{a source}} of wealth for the Chaloners. Around 1595, Sir Thomas Chaloner's son, also called Thomas, {{established}} England's first alum works at Belman Bank south of the town. Alum was an important product {{with a variety of}} industrial uses. It was especially important to the cloth industry as a <b>mordant</b> (a substance used to fix dyes on cloth). The supply of alum was controlled by a cartel controlled by the Papal States and Spain which were in conflict with England and exercised a virtual monopoly on the provision of alum to Christian Europe, as the import of cheaper Turkish alum was banned by Pope Paul II in the mid-15th century. Chaloner visited the Pope's alum works at Tolfa near Rome and noticed the soil and vegetation around them resembled those of his estate at Guisborough. On his return he established alum works at Belman Bank with the aid of workmen smuggled from Rome, earning him a papal excommunication. John Walker Ord casts doubt on the story, noting an account published a few decades afterwards stated that the workmen came from France and does not mention Chaloner's travels in Italy.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of {{metallic}} <b>mordants,</b> ferrous sulfate <b>mordanted</b> samples dyed with the mango leaf extracts showed excellent light fastness. This happened due {{to the formation of}} a complex with transition metal which protected the chromophore from photolytic degradation. The photons sorbed by the chromophoric group dissipated their energy by resonating within the six-member ring thus formed and, hence, protecting the dyes. Thus, ferrous sulfate can bind with more dye molecules than alum or tin. During exposure to light, the fabrics <b>mordanted</b> with ferrous sulfate, alum, or tin may have the same number of dye molecules destroyed. But as the fabrics <b>mordanted</b> with ferrous sulfate had deeper shades due to bonding with more number of dye molecules, it seemed to fade less compared to the fabric <b>mordanted</b> with alum or tin.|$|R

30|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the color levelness of silk fabric dyed with mango, guava and henna leaves extracts and the differences among ΔE values obtained from different areas of fabric were used for such evaluation. It was concluded that unmordanted dyed samples have better color levelness quality than the <b>mordanted</b> ones. The unmordanted samples dyed with mango and guava leaves extracts showed excellent levelness quality while the unmordanted ones dyed with henna leaves extracts showed good levelness quality. On the other hand, in case of <b>mordanted</b> samples dyed with mango leaves extracts, the order of color levelness found was: alum > tin > alum–tin > ferrous sulphate–alum–tin > ferrous sulphate–alum > ferrous sulphate. Among the <b>mordanted</b> samples dyed with guava leaves extracts, the order found was: alum and alum–tin > tin > ferrous sulphate–alum–tin > ferrous sulphate–alum > ferrous sulphate. Thus among the <b>mordanted</b> samples dyed with henna leaves extracts, the order found was: alum > tin > alum–tin > ferrous sulphate–alum > ferrous sulphate–alum–tin > ferrous sulphate. It was found that all the <b>mordanted</b> dyed samples showed good leveling quality for the three vegetable dyes except ferrous sulphate <b>mordanted</b> sample dyed with henna leaves extract.

30|$|Woolen yarn {{samples were}} dyed {{with a natural}} {{coloring}} agent extracted from walnut bark {{in order to develop}} natural shades in conjunction with small amounts of different metallic salt <b>mordants.</b> Novel and fashionable shades of light and bright brown shades were observed in alum <b>mordanted</b> dyed samples; reddish brown shades in stannous chloride <b>mordanted</b> samples, and dark brown shades in ferrous sulfate <b>mordanted</b> samples (Fig.  7). The maximum relative color strength followed the trend as ferrous sulfate mordanted[*]>[*]stannous chloride[*]>[*]alum[*]>[*]unmordanted. All the dyed woolen yarn samples irrespective of metal <b>mordants</b> showed good to very good light fastness ratings. The wash fastness property was found to be from fairly good to excellent level in most of the cases whereas rub fastness was observed from fairly good to good level in most of cases.
