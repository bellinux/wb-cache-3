While filters {{are used for}} the main loop, components of the UPW system can contribute additional particle contamination into the water, and {{at the point of}} use, additional filtration is recommended. [...] The filters themselves must be constructed of ultraclean and robust materials, which do not contribute organics or cations/anions into the UPW, and must be integrity tested out of the factory to assure reliability and performance.

[...] The <b>microporous</b> <b>structure</b> of the filter is critical in providing particle control, and this structure can be isotropic or asymmetric. In the former case the pore distribution is uniform through the filter, while in the latter the finer surface provides the particle removal, with the coarser structure giving physical support as well reducing the overall differential pressure.|$|E

The measurements, which span more than 6 orders of magnitude in relaxation times, show a complex {{spin-lattice relaxation}} pattern that {{is strongly dependent on}} the growth conditions of the sample. The relaxation patterns change from multi-timescale relaxation for samples grown at temperatures below the amorphous-crystalline transition temperature to single exponential recovery for samples grown above the transition temperature. The slow-relaxation contribution seen in cold-grown samples exhibits a temperature dependence, and becomes even slower after the sample is annealed at 200 K. The fast-relaxation contribution seen in these samples, does not seem to change or disappear even when heating to temperatures where the sample is evaporated. The possibility that the fast relaxation component is linked to the <b>microporous</b> <b>structures</b> in amorphous ice samples is further examined using an environmental electron scanning microscope.

The composite coating layers consist of alumina (Al 2 O 3) nanoparticles and polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP) gel polymer electrolytes. The <b>microporous</b> <b>structure</b> of the composite coating layers is considered a crucial factor governing the thermal shrinkage and electrochemical performance of the separators. The <b>microporous</b> <b>structure</b> is determined by controlling the phase inversion, specifically the solvent-nonsolvent miscibility, in the coating solutions.
