The home {{positions}} of the pan and tilt angles of the mirror-drive 2 -DOF active vision system were set to one end of their <b>movable</b> <b>range</b> such that θ_ 0 = 0, where their drive voltages were 0  V. Because of the narrow movable ranges of the pan and tilt angles of the 2 -DOF active vision system, 0.17 ^∘ and 0.14 ^∘, respectively, the maximum speed of objects under observation without motion blur being incurred was determined theoretically by {{the ratio of the}} <b>movable</b> <b>range</b> of the duration time of the open exposure. Considering that the variations in the view angles via the mirrors correspond to twice those of the mirror angles, the maximum angular speeds for the pan and tilt angles are 67.1 ^∘/s and 49.7 ^∘/s, respectively. When the focal length of the zoom lens and the pixel pitch of the image sensor are f [mm] and Δ x = 0.01  mm, respectively, one pixel corresponds to 57.3 tan ^- 1 (Δ x/f) ≈ 0.573 f^- 1 ^∘, assuming f ≫Δ x; 1 ^∘ corresponds to 1.75 f pixel.

In order to cope with the shortage of manpower, it is desirable to develop the rehabilitation equipment.

It is possible to train the translational and rotational motion of the wrist joint by the adoption of parallel links. Training of the translational motion of the wrist joint has not been discussed in existing methods.

The nerve responses to joint movement were classified to two type responses; one is tonic type response which continued firing as joint flexion, second is phasic type which showed fast adaptation. Almost of units (about 90 %) responded with increase of firing to flexion but few units showed inhibition. Firing {{rate of the}} tonic type response depended on angle of the joint and, to a sustained flexion, the firing remained with steady rate depending on the angle. These tonic type receptors coded a joint position information. The phasic type receptor responded to a joint movement and a single cell responded to movement of only one direction (unidirectional), a flexion or an extension. Notwithstanding of steady rate of angular movement, the firing frequency reached maximum immediately after the initiation of the movement and rapidly adapted. Firing rate of these phasic unit depend on movement velocity. This phasic type response coded a movement direction and a rate. Unnatural opposite directional movement or lateral movement of the C - F joint which an animal cannot move itself caused also nerve responses.

40|$|Abstract—To improve single-handed {{operation}} of mobile de-vices, {{the use of}} rear touch panel has potential for user interac-tions. In this paper, a basic study of operational control simply achieved through drag and tap of the index finger on a rear touch panel is conducted. Since a user has to hold the handheld device firmly with the thumb and fingers, a <b>movable</b> <b>range</b> of the tip of an index finger is limited. This restriction requires a user to perform several times of dragging actions to reach a cursor to the long distance target. Considering such kinematic restriction, a technique optimized for rear operation is proposed, wherein not only the position but also the velocity of fingertip movement is regarded. Movement time, the number of dragging operation, and the throughputs of the proposed technique have been evaluated {{in comparison with the}} generic technique using Fitts’s law. Experiments have been conducted to perform the target selection in the form of reciprocal 1 D pointing tasks with ten participants. The combinations of two ways of holding the device (landscape and portrait) and two directions of dragging (horizontal and vertical) are considered. As a result, the proposed technique achieved the improvements of from 5 to 13 % shorter movement time, from 20 to 40 % higher throughputs and no deterioration of the number of dragging even for the longer distance targets. In addition, the further analysis addressed that there exists the advantageous combinations of the way of holding and the direction of dragging, which would be beneficial for better design of single-handed user interactions using rear touch.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the research completed during 2011 for the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project. The research {{is motivated by}} the desire to safely send humans in deep space missions and to keep radiation exposures within permitted limits. To this end current material shielding, developed for low earth orbit missions, is not a viable option due to payload and cost penalties. The active radiation shielding is the path forward for such missions. To achieve active space radiation shielding innovative large lightweight gossamer space structures are used. The goal is to deflect enough positive ions without attracting negatively charged plasma and to investigate if a charged Gossamer structure can perform charge deflections without significant structural instabilities occurring. In this study different innovative configurations are explored to design an optimum active shielding. In addition, to establish technological feasibility experiments are performed with up to 10 kV of membrane charging, and an electron flux source with up to 5 keV of energy and 5 mA of current. While these charge flux energy levels are much less than those encountered in space, the fundamental coupled interaction of charged Gossamer structures with the ambient charge flux can be experimentally investigated. Of interest are, will the EIMS remain inflated during the charge deflections, and are there visible charge flux interactions. Aluminum coated Mylar membrane prototype structures are created to test their inflation capability using electrostatic charging. To simulate the charge flux, a 5 keV electron emitter is utilized. The remaining charge flux {{at the end of the}} test chamber is measured with a Faraday cup mounted on a <b>movable</b> boom. A <b>range</b> of experiments with this electron emitter and detector were performed within a 30 x 60 cm vacuum chamber with vacuum environment capability of 10 - 7 Torr. Experiments are performed with the charge flux aimed at the electrostatically inflated membrane structure (EIMS) in both charged and uncharged configurations. The amount of charge shielding behind and around the EIMS was studied for different combinations of membrane structure voltages and electron energies. Both passive and active shielding were observed, with active shielding capable of deflecting nearly all incoming electrons. The pattern of charge distribution around the structure was studied as well as the stability of the structures in the charge flow. The charge deflection experiments illustrate that the EIMS remain inflated during charge deflection, but will experience small amplitude oscillations. Investigations were performed to determine a potential cause of the vibrations. It is postulated these vibrations are due to the charge flux causing local membrane charge distribution changes. As the membrane structure inflation pressure is changed, the shape responds, and causes the observed sustained vibration. Having identified this phenomenon is important when considering electrostatically inflated membrane structures (EIMS) in a space environment. Additionally, this project included a study of membrane material impacts, specifically the impact of membrane thickness. Extremely thin materials presented new challenges with vacuum preparation techniques and rapid charging. The thinner and lighter membrane materials were successfully inflated using electrostatic forces in a vacuum chamber. However, care must be taken when varying the potentials of such lighter structures as the currents can cause local heating and melting of the very thin membranes. Lastly, a preliminary analysis is performed to study rough order of magnitude power requirements for using EIMS for radiation shielding. The EIMS power requirement becomes increasingly more challenging as the spacecraft voltage is increased. As a result, the emphasis is on the deflection of charges away from the spacecraft rather than totally stopping them. This significantly alleviates the initial power requirements. With modest technological development(s) active shielding is emerging to be a viable option...|$|R
