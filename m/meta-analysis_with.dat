25|$|Anger treatments' {{success rates}} can be {{difficult}} to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The most concrete evidence for anger treatment is that multiple techniques have proven to be more successful than a single technique. The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment. The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of meta-analyses. In a 1998 <b>meta-analysis</b> <b>with</b> 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were used to compare the effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy. In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted. Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long lasting positive changes in behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of aggression, but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.|$|E

The {{purpose of this article is}} threefold: (a) to address why and when it is worthwhile to conduct a systematic review <b>with</b> <b>meta-analysis,</b> covering advantages of this approach in the context of the statistics reform in the behavioral sciences; (b) to explain how to conduct and publish a systematic review <b>with</b> <b>meta-analysis,</b> describe the main steps, and suggest best practices for each of them; and (c) to discuss the relevance of conducting a systematic review <b>with</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> for the emerging adulthood field, suggesting how this approach can be applied to address research questions about the specificity of this period. In addressing these issues, a fictitious systematic review <b>with</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> aimed at examining gender differences in the view of emerging adulthood as a period of exploration, instability, self-focus, feeling-in-between, and possibilities is presented. Furthermore, individual participant data systematic review <b>with</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> is proposed as an important future direction for conducting reviews within the social sciences...|$|R

50|$|Although these {{compensatory}} effects favour emotional intelligence, GCA {{still remains}} {{as the best}} predictor of job performance. Several researchers have studied the correlation between GCA and job performance among different job positions. For instance, Ghiselli (1973) found that salespersons had a higher correlation than sales clerk. The former obtained a correlation of 0.61 for GCA, 0.40 for perceptual ability and 0.29 for psychomotor abilities; whereas sales clerk obtained a correlation of 0.27 for GCA, 0.22 for perceptual ability and 0.17 for psychomotor abilities. Other studies compared GCA - job performance correlation between jobs of different complexity. Hunter and Hunter (1984) developed a <b>meta-analysis</b> <b>with</b> over 400 studies and found that this correlation was higher for jobs of high complexity (0.57). Followed by jobs of medium complexity (0.51) and low complexity (0.38).|$|E

40|$|For {{patients}} with cardiorenal syndrome, does chronic hemodialysis result in fewer heart failure (HF) exacerbations than diuretic use? Evidence-Based Answer: In {{patients with}} cardiorenal syndrome, chronic hemodialysis {{has not been}} compared with diuretics. Short-term hemodialysis with slow continuous ultrafiltration for 8 to 72 hours increases inpatient weight loss and fluid removal compared with intravenous (IV) diuretics (SOR: C, <b>meta-analysis</b> of RCTs <b>with</b> diseaseoriented outcomes). Ultrafiltration does not consistently reduce HF readmission rates (SOR: B, <b>meta-analysis</b> of RCTs <b>with</b> moderate heterogeneity).

40|$|The metaplus {{package is}} {{described}} {{with examples of}} its use for fitting meta-analysis and meta-regression. For either meta-analysis or meta-regression {{it is possible to}} fit one of three models: standard normal random effect, t-distribution random effect or mixture of normal random effects. The latter two models allow for robustness by allowing for a random effect distribution with heavier tails than the normal distribution, and for both robust models the presence of outliers may be tested using the parametric bootstrap. For the mixture of normal random effects model the outlier studies may be identified through their posterior probability of membership in the outlier component of the mixture. Plots allow the results of the different models to be compared.
