People also use comparisons to increase their understanding (e. g., “Is the war in Iraq more like Vietnam or World War II?”) and as a means of explanation (e. g., “She’s been like a sister to me”). Th ese latter functions of comparison are particularly relevant when the comparison involves the self and another person. Th is chapter takes feature matching, a general cognitive model of how people make comparisons, and examines how well this <b>model</b> <b>fi</b> ts self-other comparisons. In many cases, the <b>model</b> <b>fi</b> ts very nicely, suggesting that self-other comparisons are just like any other kind of comparison. Under other circumstances, at fi rst glance, outcomes for self-other comparisons appear to diff er from those predicted by the general model. However, with closer examination, these apparent deviations can be mostly accounted for by considering special qualities associated with the self, such as familiarity, accessibility, and a motivation to maintain a positive view of the self. Th e qualities may constitute specifi c examples of variables known to moderate general feature matching outcomes. Th e chapter starts by introducing the feature matching model. It will then cover two “hallmarks ” of feature matching, direction of comparison eff ects and cancellation eff ects, introducing each one’s role in comparisons in general and then exploring the evidence for these eff ects in self-other comparisons...|$|E

40|$|The {{well-known}} lack {{of power}} of unit root tests {{has often been}} attributed to the short length of macroeconomic variables and also to DGP’s that depart from the I(1) -I(0) alternatives. This paper shows that by using long spans of annual real GNP and GNP per capita (133 years) high power can be achieved, leading to the rejection of both the unit root and the trend-stationary hypothesis. This suggests that possibly neither model provides a good characterization of these data. Next, more flexible representations are considered, namely, processes containing structural breaks (SB) and fractional orders of integration (FI). Economic justification {{for the presence of}} these features in GNP is provided. It is shown that the latter <b>models</b> (<b>FI</b> and SB) are in general preferred to the ARIMA (I(1) or I(0)) ones. As a novelty in this literature, new techniques are applied to discriminate between <b>FI</b> and SB <b>models.</b> It turns out that the FI specification is preferred, implying that GNP and GNP per capita are non-stationary, highly persistent but mean-reverting series.

Thus, our fi ndings show that these scenarios are in general not reconcilable with dark matter stability unless tiny couplings or additional ad hoc symmetries are assumed, in contrast to minimal dark matter models where stability is entirely due to the standard model gauge symmetry. For some variants based on higher-order loops we find that alpha_ 2 reaches a Landau pole at rather low scales, a couple orders of magnitude from the characteristic scale of the model itself. Thus, we argue that some of these variations although consistent with dark matter stability and phenomenological constraints are hard to reconcile with perturbativity criteria. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Using the structural equation modeling approach, the study observes a positive and signifi cant relationship between capital structure and the performance of smallholder farmers.

Alcohol and tobacco present the strongest associations to illicit drugs use. Relationships with family, friends, classmates, and teachers were also associated with substance use, being this association mediated by certain factors, including psychological symptoms, well-being, and school satisfaction.

The use of UML as a systems design tool had the advantage that it greatly facilitated the transition into software development.
