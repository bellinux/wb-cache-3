5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Neptune (30.1 AU), though {{slightly}} smaller than Uranus, is more massive (equivalent to 17 Earths) and hence <b>more</b> <b>dense.</b> It radiates more internal heat, {{but not as}} much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E

5|$|South of the expressway, NY394 {{remains the}} primary lakeside roadway {{as it passes}} through the {{communities}} of Quigley Park and Cheney's Point. NY394 {{turns back to the}} southeast at an intersection with CR43, passing Edward F. Loomis Park and remaining on the now-southern edge of Chautauqua Lake. As the route approaches Lakewood, traffic generally becomes <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> and it intersects NY474, a largely rural roadway linking the Jamestown area to Wattsburg, Pennsylvania. NY394 continues onward through Lakewood and into Jamestown, where the lake comes to an end near an intersection with Jackson Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower tank to be filled first.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E

5|$|At Merriweather, M-64 turns easterly again, {{this time}} merging with M-28 and {{becoming}} {{a part of the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour. The two highways run together along the northern end of Lake Gogebic to Bergland. Turning north once again, M-64 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway. The highway runs through <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> forests parallel to the Big Iron River on this north–south leg. The trunkline leaves the national forest as it passes into the community of White Pine, and the road runs near a former copper mine in the area. M-64 approaches the shores of Lake Superior at Silver City. There, it meets the eastern terminus of the former M-107, a highway designation that ran west into the Porcupine Mountains along the current 107th Engineers Memorial Highway. M-64 turns east along Lake Superior following the shoreline to the outskirts of Ontonagon. The highway crosses the Ontonagon River and terminates on the eastern shore. The current intersection with US45 that marks the end of M-64 {{on the south side of}} downtown is also the western terminus of M-38.|$|E
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, the woodlands that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E

Route 57 heads into farmland with intermittent residences, crossing into Franklin Township. The route continues to New Village, where residences become <b>more</b> <b>dense.</b> A short distance after the intersection with County Route 633 (Edison Road), Route 57 heads back into farm fields. The road reaches the residential community of Broadway, where it comes to a junction with County Route 643 (Asbury Broadway Road).

5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Standard {{planetary}} models {{suggest that}} the interior of Saturn {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles. This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but <b>more</b> <b>dense.</b> Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000km and consists of gas.|$|E
40|$|National audienceWe are {{interested}} in the visualization of scalar images - whose values are slightly quantized (or not at all) - on color displays which are highly quantized (typically 8 -bits per channel). Nowadays, most of the available computer displays are like that, while image data become more and more accurate thanks to the increasing quality of image sensors (digital cameras for instance). We describe a simple solution in order to improve the visual quality of displayed gray-valued images. Our technique is inspired by the so-called pseudo-gray algorithm, initially proposed in [4]. We extend this method to limit the quantization effect of the displayed lightness as much as possible, thanks to the design of a <b>more</b> <b>denser</b> pseudo-gray colormap obtained under perceptual constraints...|$|R

An approach, which generates dense packing of spheres confined in cylindrical and cuboidal containers in three steps, is introduced in this work. A loose packing structure is first generated {{by means of a}} reference lattice method. Then a dense packing structure is obtained in a container by simulating dropping of particles under gravitational forces. Furthermore, a scheme that makes the bottom boundary fluctuate up and down was applied to obtain <b>more</b> <b>denser</b> packing. The discrete element method (DEM) was employed to simulate the interactions between particle-particle and particle-boundary during the particles' motions. Finally, two cases were presented to indicate the validity of the method proposed in this work...|$|R
50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines {{the volume of}} the cylinders is a common measure of the power of an engine.

5|$|The {{success of}} ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from {{its ability to}} adapt to the {{conditions}} of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation and unity of the Egyptian people {{in the context of an}} elaborate system of religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is <b>more</b> <b>dense,</b> diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E

5|$|Unhexquadium {{should be}} a soft metal like mercury, and {{metallic}} unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently. It {{is also expected to}} be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4eV. It should also have some similarities to oganesson {{as well as to the}} other group 12 elements. Unhexquadium {{should be a}}t most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474u, about 19.5times as much as that of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being <b>more</b> <b>dense</b> (at 47g·cm−3). Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.|$|E
