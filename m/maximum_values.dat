25|$|German dioxin incident: In January 2011 about 4700 German farms {{were banned}} from making {{deliveries}} after self-checking {{of an animal}} feed producer had showed levels of dioxin above maximum levels.

A number of discoveries have however been made. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes. A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.

25|$|The lifetime, service life, load life or {{useful life}} of {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{is a special}} characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte.

The lower these parameters compared with their <b>maximum</b> <b>values</b> the longer the capacitor's “life”.
