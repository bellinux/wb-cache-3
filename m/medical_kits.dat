5|$|Within {{two days}} of Phet's passage, most of the {{evacuees}} were allowed to return home. In Gwadar however, storm flooding caused shortages of food and medicine, leading to price increases. Balochistan Chief Minister Aslam Raisani allocated RS500million toward reconstructing damaged areas. The Sindh provincial government declared six districts as disaster areas. The government opened 214relief camps, with 160 in Karachi alone; these facilities also gave out food to storm victims. These relief camps were also opened in schools to service as temporary hospitals, with 24medical teams dispatched {{by the government to}} helped injured residents. The Pakistani military helped in search and rescue missions, and also traveled by air and sea to bring emergency blankets, tents, and medicine to damaged coastal towns. Responding to the storm damage, the Save the Children organization sent supplies to its Hyderabad office, including <b>medical</b> <b>kits</b> for two weeks of care for 8,000people, as well as 34,000water purification tablets. The International Red Cross's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund provided US$45,935 to support the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, which gave out 5,000mosquito nets, along with food and tents to affected families.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{government}} identified basic {{supplies that}} it needed {{in response to the}} storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment. The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction. Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs ($360,000 USD) for immediate relief assistance. Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan. Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities, due to the poor state of the roads. After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 <b>medical</b> <b>kits,</b> and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the floods}} in Costa Rica, the country's Red Cross opened shelters to house storm victims. The {{government}} advised residents not to drink {{water out of}} fear it could be polluted from the flooding. A state of emergency was declared on October18 due to the effects in Costa Rica. In Nicaragua, officials deployed about 3,000soldiers to assist in flood operations. The World Food Programme provided about 8tons of food to families in El Salvador affected by the flooding. Then-president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya declared a national state of emergency on October19. In Honduras, pre-positioned supplies from UNICEF quickly diminished due to the widespread distribution of blankets and <b>medical</b> <b>kits,</b> raising fears for the spread of disease. The World Food Programme provided about 58tons of food to 5,500families in Honduras. Residents returned home as floodwaters gradually receded. The Mercy Corps later provided corn and bean seeds to 1,300Honduran farmers to regrow the damaged crops. In May 2009, the World Bank provided $25million (USD) to Honduras to rebuild damaged roads and bridges. Workers in Guatemala airlifted food to storm victims due to residual flooding. The Guatemalan government provided $6.6million to residents in the northern portion of the country, including medical supplies and seeds to regrow crops. A state of emergency was declared for Cayo District in Belize. Search and rescue teams were deployed to the district, and medical crews visited several towns, providing help to 3,000people. The Belize National Emergency Management Organization provided meals to about 9,000people following the floods.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in <b>medical</b> <b>kits</b> of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{capabilities}} {{aboard the}} International Space Station (ISS) have been packaged to help astronaut crew medical officers (CMO) mitigate both urgent and non-urgent medical issues during their 6 -month expeditions. Two ISS crewmembers are designated as CMOs for each 3 -crewmember mission and are typically not physicians. In addition, the ISS may have communication gaps {{of up to}} 45 minutes during each orbit, necessitating medical equipment that can be reliably operated autonomously during flight. The retirement {{of the space shuttle}} combined with ten years of manned ISS expeditions led the Space Medicine Division at the NASA Johnson Space Center to reassess the current ISS <b>Medical</b> <b>Kit</b> System. This reassessment led to the system being streamlined to meet future logistical considerations with current Russian space vehicles and future NASA/commercial space vehicle systems. Methods The JSC Space Medicine Division coordinated the development of requirements, fabrication of prototypes, and conducted usability testing for the new ISS <b>Medical</b> <b>Kit</b> System in concert with implementing updated versions of the ISS Medical Check List and associated in-flight software applications. The teams constructed a <b>medical</b> <b>kit</b> system with the flexibility for use on the ISS, and resupply on the Russian Progress space vehicle and future NASA/commercial space vehicles. Results Prototype systems were developed, reviewed, and tested for implementation. Completion of Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews resulted in a streamlined ISS <b>Medical</b> <b>Kit</b> System that is being used for training by ISS crews starting with Expedition 27 (June 2011). Conclusions The team will present the process for designing, developing,, implementing, and training with this new ISS <b>Medical</b> <b>Kit</b> System...|$|R

25|$|Polypropylene {{has been}} used in hernia and pelvic organ {{prolapse}} repair operations to protect the body from new hernias in the same location. A small patch of the material is placed over the spot of the hernia, below the skin, and is painless and rarely, if ever, rejected by the body. However, a polypropylene mesh will erode the tissue surrounding it over the uncertain period from days to years. Therefore, the FDA has issued several warnings on the use of polypropylene mesh <b>medical</b> <b>kits</b> for certain applications in pelvic organ prolapse, specifically when introduced in close proximity to the vaginal wall due to a continued increase in number of mesh-driven tissue erosions reported by patients over the past few years. Most recently, on 3 January 2012, the FDA ordered 35 manufacturers of these mesh products to study the side effects of these devices.|$|E
25|$|The {{settlement}} was named Itascatown after the USCGC Itasca {{that brought the}} colonists to Howland and made regular cruises between the other equatorial islands during that era. Itascatown was a line of a half-dozen small wood-framed structures and tents near the beach on the island's western side. The fledgling colonists were given large stocks of canned food, water, and other supplies including a gasoline-powered refrigerator, radio equipment, complete <b>medical</b> <b>kits</b> and (characteristic of that era) vast quantities of cigarettes. Fishing provided much-needed variety for their diet. Most of the colonists' endeavors involved making hourly weather observations and gradually developing a rudimentary infrastructure on the island, including the clearing of a landing strip for airplanes. During this period the island was on Hawaii time, which was then 10.5 hours behind UTC. Similar colonization projects were started on nearby Baker Island, Jarvis Island and two other islands.|$|E

Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated using multiple techniques, such as eating, using <b>medical</b> <b>kits,</b> or calling for paramedics. If players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a [...] "wanted" [...] meter in the head-up display (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.|$|E

The World Bank led the assessment efforts, estimating the cost of recovery at $1.046billion, mostly toward rebuilding houses, regrowing crops, and restoring social services. The World Bank also provided $41million toward the Yemen Flood Protection and Emergency Reconstruction, which rebuilt vital infrastructure and ensured they were flood-proof. The World Food Programme assisted 43,000people with food and other emergency supplies. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference declared the situation a [...] "national catastrophe" [...] and started a drive to collect funds for the relief of flood victims. At an international donor conference, various individuals and countries pledged $301million to help with the reconstruction in the country. Arab nations in the region also donated cash and supplies to Yemen; Saudi Arabia pledged $100million in assistance. The United Arab Emirates Red Crescent assisted in the reconstruction work, sending $27.3million to rebuild 1,000houses; 750 of these were completed by December 2009. The Arab Fund sent $135million, including $35million for road reconstruction. The Japanese government provided funding toward building shelter for 700displaced Al-Akhdam people, designed to be away from the flood plain. Access to clean drinking water and proper shelter for the displaced helped mitigate the spread of disease. For many families, the effects of the disaster lasted several years due to insufficient assistance or disrupted jobs. By 2010, about 40% of the overall recovery cost was met by international donations, although funding was halted after political uprising in 2011.|$|E
