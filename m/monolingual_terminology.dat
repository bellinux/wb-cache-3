40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel methodology to perform bilingual terminology extraction, in which automatic alignment {{is used to}} improve the performance of terminology extraction for each language. The strengths of <b>monolingual</b> <b>terminology</b> extraction for each language are exploited to improve the performance of terminology extraction in the other language, thanks to {{the availability of a}} sentence-level aligned bilingual corpus, and an automatic noun phrase alignment mechanism. The experiment indicates that weaknesses in <b>monolingual</b> <b>terminology</b> extraction due to the limitation of resources in certain languages can be overcome by using another language which has no such limitation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Bilingual termbanks are {{important}} for many natural language processing (NLP) applications, es-pecially in translation workflows in industrial settings. In this paper, we apply a log-likelihood comparison method to extract <b>monolingual</b> <b>terminology</b> from the source and target sides of a parallel corpus. Then, using a Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation model, we create a bilingual terminology with the extracted monolingual term lists. We manually evaluate our novel terminology extraction model on English-to-Spanish and English-to-Hindi data sets, and observe excellent performance for all domains. Furthermore, we report the performance of our monolin-gual terminology extraction model comparing {{with a number of}} the state-of-the-art terminology extraction models on the English-to-Hindi datasets. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe TTC project (Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora) {{has contributed}} to {{leveraging}} computer-assisted translation tools, machine translation systems and multilingual content (corpora and terminology) management tools by generating bilingual terminologies automatically from comparable corpora in seven EU languages, as well as Russian and Chinese. This paper presents the main concept of TTC, discusses the issue of parallel corpora scarceness and potential of comparable corpora, and briefly describes the TTC terminology extraction workflow. The TTC terminology extraction workflow includes the collection of domain-specific comparable corpora from the web, extraction of <b>monolingual</b> <b>terminology</b> in the two domains of wind energy and mobile technology, and bilingual alignment of extracted terminology. We also present TTC usage scenarios, {{the way in which}} the project deals with under-resourced and disconnected languages, and report on the project midterm progress and results achieved during the two years of the project. And finally, we touch upon the problem of under-resourced languages (for example, Latvian) and disconnected languages (for example, Latvian and Russian) covered by the project...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we exploit domain-specific {{comparable}} corpora {{to build}} bilingual terminologies. We present the monolingual term extraction and the bilingual alignment {{that will allow}} us to identify and translate high specialised terminology. We stress the huge importance of taking into account both simple and complex terms in a multilingual environment. Such linguistic diversity implies to combine several methods to perfect accurately both <b>monolingual</b> and bilingual <b>terminology</b> extraction tasks. The methods are implemented in TTC TermSuite based on a UIMA framework...|$|R
40|$|<b>Monolingual</b> and {{multilingual}} <b>terminology</b> and collocation bases, {{covering a}} specific domain, used independently or integrated with other resources, {{have become a}} valuable electronic resource. Building of such resources could be assisted by automatic term extraction tools, combining statistical and linguistic approaches. In this paper, the research on term extraction from monolingual corpus is presented. The corpus consists of publicly accessible English legislative documents. In the paper, results of two hybrid approaches are compared: extraction using the TermeX tool and an automatic statistical extraction procedure followed by linguistic filtering through the open source linguistic engineering tool. The results have been elaborated through statistical measures of precision, recall, and F-measure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Terminology is {{the set of}} {{technical}} words or expressions used in specific contexts, which denotes the core concept in a formal discipline and is usually applied {{in the fields of}} machine translation, information retrieval, information extraction and text categorization, etc. Bilingual terminology extraction {{plays an important role in}} the application of bilingual dictionary compilation, bilingual Ontology construction, machine translation and cross-language information retrieval etc. This paper addresses the issues of <b>monolingual</b> <b>terminology</b> extraction and bilingual term alignment based on multi-level termhood. Design/methodology/approach: A method based on multi-level termhood is proposed. The new method computes the termhood of the terminology candidate as well as the sentence that includes the terminology by the comparison of the corpus. Since terminologies and general words usually have differently distribution in the corpus, termhood can also be used to constrain and enhance the performance of term alignment when aligning bilingual terms on the parallel corpus. In this paper, bilingual term alignment based on termhood constraints is presented. Findings: Experiment results show multi-level termhood can get better performance than existing method for terminology extraction. If termhood is used as constrain factor, the performance of bilingual term alignment can be improved...|$|E
