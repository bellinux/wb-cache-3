40|$|OBJECTIVE: HIV- 1 {{post-exposure}} prophylaxis (PEP) is frequently prescribed after exposure to source persons with an undetermined HIV serostatus. To reduce unnecessary use of PEP, we implemented a policy including active contacting of source persons {{and the availability}} of free, anonymous HIV testing ('PEP policy'). METHODS: All consultations for potential non-occupational HIV exposures i. e. outside the medical environment) were prospectively recorded. The impact of the PEP policy on PEP prescription and costs was analysed and modelled. RESULTS: Among 146 putative exposures, 47 involved a source person already known to be HIV positive and 23 had no indication for PEP. The remaining 76 exposures involved a source person of unknown HIV serostatus. Of 33 (43. 4 %) exposures for which the source person could be contacted and tested, PEP was avoided in 24 (72. 7 %), initiated and discontinued in seven (21. 2 %), and prescribed and completed in two (6. 1 %). In contrast, of 43 (56. 6 %) exposures for which the source person could not be tested, PEP was prescribed in 35 (81. 4 %), P &lt; 0. 001. Upon modelling, the PEP policy allowed a 31 % reduction of cost for <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> to source persons of unknown HIV serostatus. The policy was cost-saving for HIV prevalence of up to 70 % in the source population. The availability of all the source persons for testing would have reduced cost by 64 %. CONCLUSION: In the management of non-occupational HIV exposures, active contacting and free, anonymous testing of source persons proved feasible. This policy resulted in a decrease in prescription of PEP, proved to be cost-saving, and presumably helped to avoid unnecessary toxicity and psychological stress...|$|E

40|$|Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is a {{short term}} {{antiretroviral}} treatment to {{reduce the likelihood of}} HIV infection after potential exposure, either occupational or through sexual intercourse. Health workers are the backbone of HIV/AIDS initiatives, and therefore determine the success rates of related interventions. Occupational exposure to blood or other body fluids in health care settings constitutes a small but significant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne pathogens. In addition, such exposures can cause tremendous anxiety, fear and stress among health workers leading to a negative impact not only on the health workers, but also their families and colleagues. These infections acquired through the occupational route are largely preventable through strict infection prevention and control (IPC), universal precautions, use of safe devices, proper waste disposal, immunization against hepatitis B virus, and prompt <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> including the use of post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV.

40|$|Purpose: To better {{understand}} corporate risk management practice in Hong Kong and Singapore. To explore popular perception {{that use of}} derivatives in Hong Kong and Singapore lags that in the US. To explore possible speculative use of derivatives in these Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of non-financial corporations using {{the format of the}} 1998 Wharton study. I investigated the extent to which derivatives are used, how they are used, and methods for their oversight. Findings: Derivatives are used more extensively in Hong Kong and Singapore than in the US. They are particularly popular for managing foreign exchange risk. Their use is more speculative than is common in the US; that is, market predictions {{play a significant role in}} the size and timing of hedge trades and derivatives are often used for active <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures.</b> A lack of controls and management oversight (such as derivatives policies, regular valuations) is apparent, despite the extent of derivatives use. Research limitations/implications: Potential bias may have arisen due to the method used for recruiting survey respondents. In this study post-graduate students contacted and interviewed company staff, often based on their personal contacts. In contrast, the Wharton surveys have been mailed to potential respondents. Students may have been more likely to select companies that traded derivatives. The sample size (131 firms) is smaller than that of the Wharton studies, but probably sufficient to establish common trends. Practical implications: Need to address poor oversight of derivatives trading in order to prevent further disasters. Need to scrutinise the speculative use of derivatives to ensure that it is value-adding for firm owners. Originality/value: To highlight the extent of speculative use of derivatives in Hong Kong and Singapore.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three essays which focus on hedge fund performance and derivative hedging. The first essay uses ETF returns as proxies for tradable risk factors in hedge fund performance evaluation and identifies contemporaneously relevant risk factors from the entire universe of ETFs. The model provides more informative estimates of alpha and beta coefficients for predicting hedge fund out-of-sample performance compared with other widely used hedge fund factor models. Portfolios of top alpha hedge funds selected by the model generate statistically significant out-of-sample performance that is substantially higher compared with portfolios selected by other models. In addition, the beta-weighted clone portfolios exhibit substantially higher out-of-sample correlations with underlying hedge funds than clone portfolios formed using alternative models. The second essay shows that only hedge funds whose returns are driven by beta <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> to latent risk factors could be successfully replicated. I develop a methodology for creating a portfolio of ETFs that replicates risk factor exposures taken by successful beta active cloneable hedge funds. The methodology allows any investor to access active factor strategies employed by hedge funds. It {{could be interpreted as}} cloning beta exposures of the best beta active hedge funds, delivering outstanding long-term risk-adjusted performance. The active factor ETF portfolio only requires annual rebalancing, and is constructed with a transparent algorithmic approach, which conforms to a definition of a smart beta strategy. The third essay investigates the use of derivatives among firms. A careful study of hedging motives and hedging effectiveness is critical to understanding the financial impact of derivative use by firms. I examine the use of commodity derivatives by oil and gas producers and show that, on average, these firms report gains from their derivative positions. The profits from derivatives, particularly non-hedge profits, are positively associated with the extent of hedging that is classified as market timing activities...|$|E

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Immunisation against hepatitis B virus before <b>exposure,</b> proportion <b>of</b> known source patients tested for hepatitis B surface antigen and HIV antibodies, and reasons for not testing known source patients. RESULTS [...] 447 incidents were reported: 337 sharps injuries and 110 other exposures. 310 staff reporting incidents (205 (82 %) nurses) were already immune to hepatitis B virus, nearly always because of immunisation. 345 source patients were identified, 77 of whom had already been tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (28 positive results) and 58 for HIV antibodies (18 positive results). Of those not previously tested, 145 of 266 were subsequently tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (two positive) and 149 of 287 for HIV antibodies (none positive). The main reasons for not testing source patients were that the incident was not considered a risk, that the patient had gone home, and that the clinical team were unwilling to ask the patient. Specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin was given to 18 staff who were not immune and was avoided in 11 cases by a negative result for the patient.

The research advocates that (1) regulatory processes for technological hazards need to effectively incorporate ‘human systems’ into their routines as a way to become more holistic; (2) {{decision-making processes}} need to strengthen the transition from assessment <b>of</b> risks to <b>management</b> <b>of</b> exposure; (3) regulators need to shift focus to the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> as opposed to the current facility-centered <b>management</b> <b>of</b> risks; (4) this transition is facilitated if the regulatory process has an independent routine for management; and (5) a resilience plan, encompassing components from risk management and land-use planning, articulates the interaction between people and hazardous facilities, that share a common space, towards better practices to effectively manage exposure to risks. Considering these five points, the research suggests an adaptation of the Risk Governance Model for the regulation of hazardous linear installations...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{credit risk}} {{modelling}} {{is important for}} banks for the calculation of capital adequacy {{in terms of the}} Basel Accords, and for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> sectoral <b>exposure.</b> We examine Credit Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Credit Value at Risk (Credit CVaR) and the relationship between market and credit risk. Signiﬁ- cant association is found between diﬀerent Credit CVaR methods, and between market and credit risk. Simpler Credit CVaR methods are found to be viable alternatives to more complex methodology. The relationship between market and credit risk is used to develop a new model that allows banks to incorporate industry risk into transition modelling, without macroeconomic analysis...|$|R

A cross-sectional study of all clinical den-tal students in the four Nigerian dental schools was carried out by means of an anonymous self-administered questionnaire that asked questions on demography, number and type <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> <b>management</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposures,</b> personal protection against cross infection, and the reporting <b>of</b> such <b>exposures.</b> One hundred and fifty-three students responded (response rate of 84. 5 percent). Only thirty-three (37. 9 percent) were fully vaccinated against HBV. Ninety (58. 8 percent) of the students have had at least one occupational exposure. There was no significantly associated difference between sex, age, location <b>of</b> school, and <b>exposure.</b> Most <b>of</b> the <b>exposures</b> (44. 4 percent) occurred in association with manual tooth cleaning. There was inadequate protection of the eyes. None <b>of</b> the <b>exposures</b> were formally reported. It is the responsibility of training institutions to ensure the safety of the students by mandatory HBV vaccination prior to exposure and adequate training in work safety. Written policies and procedures should b...|$|R
