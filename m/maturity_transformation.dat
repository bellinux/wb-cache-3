One example is the credit arbitrage vehicle, {{also known as a}} Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV). A typical SIV is a company which seeks to 'arbitrage' credit by issuing debt or debt-like liabilities and purchasing debt or debt-like assets, and earning the credit spread differential between its assets and liabilities. Much of an SIV's portfolio may consist of asset-backed securities." [...] In reality there is no such [...] "arbitrage", the SIV is acting like any old fashioned spread banker, seeking to earn a spread between its income on assets and cost of funds on liabilities. It earns this spread by accepting two types of risk: a credit transformation (lending to AA borrowers while issuing AAA liabilities) and a <b>maturity</b> <b>transformation</b> (borrowing short while lending long).

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the market-based {{financial}} system since the mid- 1980 s {{changed the nature of}} financial intermediation in the United States profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, "shadow banks" are particularly important institutions. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose finance companies, structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored enterprises.; Shadow banks are interconnected along a vertically integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and repo. This intermediation chain binds shadow banks into a network, which is the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system rivals the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. Over the past decade, the shadow banking system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless short-term liabilities. <b>Maturity</b> and credit <b>transformation</b> in the shadow banking system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial crisis.; We document that the shadow banking system became severely strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional banks, shadow banks conduct credit, <b>maturity,</b> and liquidity <b>transformation,</b> but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access to public sources of liquidity, such as the Federal Reserve's discount window, or public sources of insurance, such as federal deposit insurance. The liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve and other government agencies' guarantee schemes were a direct response to the liquidity and capital shortfalls of shadow banks and, effectively, provided either a backstop to credit intermediation by the shadow banking system or to traditional banks for the exposure to shadow banks. Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.

" I followed the message coming from inner wisdom and realized that my symbolic images and their message were closely related to Cari Jung's perspective of the Self. In this heuristic self-inquiry, I have pursued the self-experience leading me to the essence of the Self, and the symbolic images along with reflexive knowledge were a major guideline to the self-experience of encountering the Self in a metaphoric, safe way.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of high-performance, low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio concretes has led to increased occurrences of early-age shrinkage cracking in civil engineering structures. To reduce the magnitude of early-age shrinkage {{and the potential for}} cracking, mitigation strategies using shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs), saturated lightweight aggregates, expansive cements and extended moist curing durations in construction have been recommended. However, to appropriately utilize these strategies, {{it is important to have}} a complete understanding of the driving forces of early-age volume change and how these methods work from a materials perspective to reduce shrinkage. This dissertation uses a first-principles approach to understand the mechanism of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) to generate an expansion and mitigate shrinkage at early-ages, quantify the influence of a CaO-based expansive additive in reducing unrestrained shrinkage, residual stress development and the cracking potential at early-ages and quantify the influence of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) and cement hydration (pore structure refinement) on the reduction induced in the fluid transport properties of the material. ^ The effects of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) are described in terms of inducing autogenous expansions in cement pastes at early ages. An evaluation comprising measurements of autogenous deformation, x-ray diffraction (Rietveld analysis), pore solution and thermogravimetric analysis and electron microscopy is performed to understand the chemical nature and physical effects of the expansion. Thermodynamic calculations performed on the measured liquid-phase compositions indicate the SRA produces elevated Portlandite super-saturations in the pore solution which results in crystallization stress driven expansions. The thermodynamic calculations are supported by deformation measurements performed on cement pastes mixed in solutions saturated with Portlandite or containing additional Sodium Hydroxide. Further, to quantify the influence of temperature on volume changes in SRA containing materials, deformation measurements are performed at different temperatures. The results indicate <b>maturity</b> <b>transformations</b> are incapable of simulating volume changes over any temperature regime due to the influence of temperature on salt solubility and pore solution composition, crystallization stresses and self-desiccation. ^ The performance of a CaO-based expansive additive is evaluated over a range of additive concentrations and curing conditions to quantify the reduction in restrained and unrestrained volume changes effected in low w/c cement pastes. The results suggest, under unrestrained sealed conditions the additive generates an expansion and reduces the magnitude of total shrinkage experienced by the material. However, the extent of drying shrinkage developed is noted to be similar in all systems and independent of the additive dosage. Under restrained sealed conditions, the additive induces a significant compressive stress which delays tensile stress development in the system. However, a critical additive concentration (around four percent) needs to be exceeded to appreciably reduce the risk of cracking at early-ages. ^ The influence of shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) is quantified in terms of the effects of SRA addition on fluid transport in cement-based materials. The change in the cement paste 2 ̆ 7 s pore solution properties, i. e., the surface tension and fluid-viscosity, induced by the addition of a SRA is observed to depress the fluid-sorption and wetting moisture diffusion coefficients, with the depression being a function of the SRA concentration. The experimental results are compared to analytical descriptions of water sorption and a good correlation is observed. These results allow for the change in pore-solution and fluid-transport properties to be incorporated from a fundamental perspective in models which aim to describe the service-life of structures. ^ Several experimental techniques such as chemical shrinkage, low temperature calorimetry and electrical impedance spectroscopy are evaluated in terms of their suitability to identify capillary porosity depercolation in cement pastes. The evidence provided by the experiments is: (1) that there exists a capillary porosity depercolation threshold around 20...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the influence a bank’s corporate governance structure has on its risk taking. To do so, the paper specifically looks at illiquidity and insolvency risk, {{as measured by}} a bank’s liquidity creation and its margin between interest income from loans and interest expenses on deposits. The relevance of this question is rooted in banks’ core business models: <b>maturity</b> <b>transformation.</b> By transforming short-term liabilities into long-term assets banks generate profits through the exploitation of the yield curve spread. However, in times of tightening or inverting yield curve spreads the banks’ transformation margins narrow. Management then faces a dilemma: accepting narrowed spreads and lower profits or increasing the volume of <b>maturity</b> <b>transformation.</b> Either option {{poses a threat to}} the bank, the former of insolvency, the latter of illiquidity. This paper tries to answer the question of how banks with different owner and manager structures deal with this trade-off. Analyzing a sample of 259 U. S. commercial banks over the period 1998 - 2010, the paper finds that banks with low separation of ownership and control increase their liquidity risk in times of narrowing or inverted yield curve structures to keep profit levels up through volume effects. In contrast, banks with higher separation of ownership and control opt for less liquidity risk, also in times of regular yield curve spreads, and thereby also accept lower interest rate margins...|$|E
30|$|The {{radiographic}} {{appearance of}} this tumor is often diagnostic: {{as a matter}} of fact, the continuity of the lesion with the underlying native bone cortex and medullary canal is pathognomonic of osteochondroma. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are useful for identifying and studying complications such as malignant transformation, bone fracture, vascular compromise, neurologic sequelae, and overlying bursa formation. The thickness of the cartilage cap is typically 1 – 3  cm in young patients, whereas in adults, it is often only a few millimeters thick or entirely absent [4, 8 – 10].

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence and}} intensity of crises in the international financial markets during the 1990 s have given new impetus to the debate on reform of the international financial system.

This paper responds {{to the question of whether}} an international lender of last resort is necessary by presenting both the differences and the similarities between a domestic financial market and an international one.

Both the recent financial crises, and the developments which can be observed in the banking sectors of Latin America and Eastern Europe, provide empirical evidence for this thesis. In these regions, banking sectors are emerging which are increasingly dominated by foreign banks, and thus have indirect access to an international lender of last resort. At the same time, there is an increasing tendency within emerging markets to introduce regulations which limit the extent to which transformation is performed in financial markets, and thus to limit as far as possible the risks which make an international lender of last resort necessary.
