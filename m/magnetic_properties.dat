40|$|A {{technique}} for analyzing {{the magnetic field}} in anisotropic material using the effective anisotropic reluctivity proposed by Enokizono is examined. It is shown that the Enokizono model can be transformed into another model having a conventional form. By expanding the examination of such a conventional form, a new finite element formulation for taking account of the two-dimensional (2 -D) <b>magnetic</b> <b>property</b> is proposed. As the modeling of the 2 -D <b>magnetic</b> <b>property</b> at the high flux density region {{is important in the}} practical analysis of the magnetic device, the extrapolation method of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>property</b> is examined.

5|$|Uncommon <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties</b> (spin glass state) were {{observed}} in diamond nanocrystals intercalated with potassium. Unlike paramagnetic host material, magnetic susceptibility measurements of intercalated nanodiamond revealed distinct ferromagnetic behavior at 5 K. This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon. The measurements presented first experimental evidence of intercalation-induced spin-glass state in a nanocrystalline diamond system.|$|E
5|$|Curium has {{peculiar}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties.</b> Whereas {{its neighbor}} element americium shows no deviation from Curie-Weiss paramagnetism {{in the entire}} temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an antiferromagnetic state upon cooling to 65–52 K, and β-Cm exhibits a ferrimagnetic transition at about 205 K. Meanwhile, curium pnictides show ferromagnetic transitions upon cooling: 244CmN and 244CmAs at 109 K, 248CmP at 73 K and 248CmSb at 162 K. The lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, {{as well as its}} pnictides, also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.|$|E
5|$|Paul Drude in 1900 {{proposed}} the first theoretical {{model for a}} classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's model described properties of metals {{in terms of a}} gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the Wiedemann–Franz law. However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat and <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties</b> of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The {{centimetre}} gram second {{system of}} units (CGS) was the first coherent metric system, having been developed in the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874, this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). The system's characteristics are that density is expressed in , force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs. Thermal energy was defined in calories, one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5°C to 16.5°C. The meeting also proposed two sets of units for electrical and <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties</b> – the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} protons in the nucleus defines to what {{chemical}} element the atom belongs: for example, all copper atoms contain 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element. The number of electrons influences the <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties</b> of an atom. Atoms can attach {{to one or}} more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties,</b> these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from {{the heat of the}} impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties</b> common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E
5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties,</b> due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors.

Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its <b>magnetic</b> <b>properties,</b> can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO3 and hence precipitates out. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.|$|E

40|$|A {{magnetic}} filter {{system has been}} constructed, and its performance has been investigated, to measure the <b>magnetic</b> <b>property</b> of monodisperse γ -Fe 2 O 3 particles in the size range from 100 to 300 nm. In the system, SS 430 screens are placed in the {{magnetic filter}} element and exposed to a strong external magnetic field generated by an electric coil. The high magnetic field gradient resulted frommagnetized fine wires enhances the collection of magnetic particles {{in addition to the}} particle collection via the diffusion mechanism. The particle concentrations at the upstream and downstream of the magnetic filter element were measured by an Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter (UCPC, TSI model 3025 A). Particle penetration obtained in the experiment is a function of particle size, particle <b>magnetic</b> <b>property,</b> and wire magnetization. To retrieve the <b>magnetic</b> <b>property</b> of characterized particles from the measured penetration data, a numerical model was further developed using the finite element package COMSOL Multiphysics 3. 5. In this modeling, a single mesh screen is assumed to be represented by unit cells. The flow, the magnetic fields, and particle trajectory were solved in a unit cell. The relationship between particle penetration and <b>magnetic</b> <b>property</b> can then be obtained via this model for the given particle size, aerosol flowrate, and external magnetic field strength. The numerical model was first validated by comparing the experimental penetration with the simulation results for the case of 100, 150, and 250 nm γ -Fe 2 O 3 particles having the magnetic susceptibility characterized by Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). The magnetic susceptibilities of other sizes from 100 to 300 nm were then derived from this model according to the measured penetration data...|$|R
