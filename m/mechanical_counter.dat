50|$|A {{mechanical}} {{computer is}} built from mechanical components such as levers and gears, rather than electronic components. The most common examples are adding machines and <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters,</b> which use the turning of gears to increment output displays. More complex examples could carry out multiplication and division—Friden used a moving head which paused at each column—and even differential analysis. One model {{sold in the}} 1960s calculated square roots.|$|R
30|$|Automated {{honeybee}} counters {{were the}} first technically feasible application to be introduced. Over the last 40 years, different approaches have been explored: <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters</b> [4], less intrusive infrared sensors [5], individual identification by radio frequency identification [6], and more recently, video-based counters with [7] and without identification [3].

50|$|The {{interface}} between the telescope fork and the instruments at both Nasmyth foci {{is provided by}} two rotator/adapters. Their main function is {{to compensate for the}} field rotation by a <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> rotation. The best quality of the TNG is that all the available instruments are permanently mounted at the telescope. This guarantees flexibility during an observing session, since it is possible to change instrument during the night with a loss of time limited to a few minutes.|$|E
5000|$|There {{followed}} {{a series of}} brilliant contributions to the [...] of nuclear physics. In 1929-30, with H. M. Cave and F. A. B. Ward he designed and constructed a counting device using thyratrons {{in conjunction with a}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter.</b> By 1931 a valve amplifier and thyratron-based automatic counting system were in regular use in the Cavendish Laboratory. Wynn-Williams' amplifier played an important part in James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932, and in numerous other experiments.|$|E

50|$|Printing tabulator Hollerith's tabulators were non-printing, {{displaying}} {{numbers on}} {{a row of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters.</b> This caused pauses during tabulation, as {{it was necessary to}} write totals by hand. The Census Bureau Machine Shop introduced the first printing tabulator in 1906. Powers started to produce printing tabulators in 1911, and his machines soon gained immense popularity. Despite their complexity, they were largely deployed by insurance companies because of their ability to produce written spreadsheets. Powers Accounting Machine Company was the only producer of printing tabulators until IBM introduced its own version in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|An {{instrument}} which totalises {{the events}} detected over a time period {{is known as}} a scaler. This colloquial name comes from the early days of automatic radiation counting, when a pulse-dividing circuit was required to [...] "scale down" [...] a high count rate to a speed which <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters</b> could register. This technique was developed by C E Wynn-Williams at The Cavendish Laboratory and first published in 1932. The original counters used a cascade of [...] "Eccles-Jordan" [...] divide-by-two circuits, today known as flip flops. Early count readings were therefore binary numbers [...] and had to be manually re-calculated into decimal values.|$|R
50|$|The first {{competition}} {{took place}} May 2 and May 3, 2007 at the New England Air Museum in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.

50|$|The {{number is}} usually displayed, with image or text, {{as an old}} inline digital image, a plain text or an old <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter.</b> Image renderization of digits may {{use a variety of}} fonts and styles; the classic example is the wheels of an odometer. The counter is often {{accompanied}} by the date it was set up or last reset, otherwise it becomes impossible to estimate within what time the number of page loads counted occurred. Some web counters were simply web bugs used by webmasters to track hits and included no visible on-page elements.|$|E
50|$|The {{tests were}} successful: the {{practicality}} of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> pressure spacesuit was demonstrated conclusively. The energy {{needed to move}} about was considerably less than conventional designs, which was a major improvement for long-duration spacewalks. Tests of punctures showed that up to a square millimeter of skin could be directly exposed to vacuum for extended periods with no permanent effect. A similar puncture in a conventional suit {{would result in a}} loss of pressure and breathing air. It weighed half as much as the primary pressure suit worn by NASA astronauts for Project Apollo, the A7L.|$|E

50|$|Early {{computers}} used relays, <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters</b> {{or delay}} lines for main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce {{data in the}} order it was written. Drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of vacuum tube triodes, and later, out of discrete transistors, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>counters</b> are digital <b>counters</b> built using <b>mechanical</b> components. Long before {{electronics}} became common, mechanical {{devices were}} used to count events. They typically consist {{of a series of}} disks mounted on an axle, with the digits 0 through 9 marked on their edge. The right most disk moves one increment with each event. Each disk except the left-most has a protrusion that, after the completion of one revolution, moves the next disk to the left one increment. Such counters were used as odometers for bicycles and cars and in tape recorders and fuel dispensers and to control manufacturing processes. One of the largest manufacturers was the Veeder-Root company, and their name was often used for this type of counter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new chief}} {{executive}} faced a daunting task. The company {{was in the}} midst of a period of rapid technological change, with nascent computer technologies - electronic computers, magnetic tape storage, disk drives, programming - creating new competitors and market uncertainties. Internally, the company was growing by leaps and bounds, creating organizational pressures and significant management challenges. Lacking the force of personality that Watson Sr. had long used to bind IBM together, Watson Jr. and his senior executives privately wondered if the new generation of leadership was up to challenge of managing a company through this tumultuous period. [...] "We are," [...] wrote one longtime IBM executive in 1956, [...] "in grave danger of losing our [...] "eternal" [...] values that are as valid in electronic days as in <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> days." ...|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{distances}} stated {{at that time}} were frequently based on imprecise estimates, Zürner had to survey {{the distances}} afresh or verify existing data. To achieve that he designed a survey vehicle {{in the shape of}} an electoral Saxon baggage coach. Each revolution of the rear wheel of the coach with a circumference of one Dresden rod (Dresdner Rute), i.e. 4.531 metres, was transmitted to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> in the coach by means of a chain. Zürner's assistants used a measuring cart {{in the shape of a}} wheelbarrow for those tracks unsuitable for a coach, which likewise measured the distances by the turning of a wheel and which was carried as the so-called [...] "fifth wheel on the wagon" [...] (fünftes Rad am Wagen) in a case on the surveying coach. Both methods enabled a very accurate survey of roads.|$|E
5000|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric clock}} does not contain a timekeeping oscillator such as a pendulum or balance wheel, but instead counts the oscillations of the AC utility current from its wall plug to keep time. It consists of a small AC synchronous motor, which turns the clock's hands through a reduction gear train. [...] The motor contains electromagnets which create a rotating magnetic field which turns an iron rotor. The rotation rate of the motor shaft is synchronized to the utility frequency; 60 cycles per second (Hz) in North and South America, 50 cycles per second in most other countries. The gear train scales this rotation so the minute hand rotates once per hour. Thus the synchronous clock {{can be regarded as}} not so much a timekeeper as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter,</b> whose hands display a running count of the number of cycles of alternating current.|$|E
40|$|TheKaunter v 2. 0. 1 What is TheKaunter? TheKaunter is a multi-category, {{configurable}} differential counter. Differential counters {{are used}} in fields like haematology, for counting blood cells; in marine science, for instance, they are used for counting different kinds of plankton organisms (eggs, larvae [...] .), among many other uses. Classic (<b>mechanical)</b> differential <b>counters</b> have up to 10 individual counters and one totalizer. TheKaunter features the possibility of having several categories or groups of counters with one totalizer by category and, unlike <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters,</b> TheKaunter makes possible to reset individual counters and decrease the count. In contrast to traditional devices, TheKaunter makes possible to export the results to a file for further processing/analysis. Features No theoretical limit of counters/categories. However, up {{to a total of}} 36 individual counters is recommended, due to limitations in keyboard and desktop/GUI size. Counters can be increased, decreased as well as individually reset. One totalizer for category/group of counters. User configurable section header color as well as counter background User configurable counter descriptive images. Category/counter names as well as key bindings are shown in the GUI for ease of use. Results are exportable to CSV {{as well as to the}} clipboard. Silent [...] . no more crank, lever, sounds in your lab [...] . English as well as Spanish translations are provided for the GUI...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1880s Herman Hollerith {{invented the}} {{recording}} of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine. Prior uses of machine readable media had been for lists of instructions (not data) to drive programmed machines such as Jacquard looms and mechanized musical instruments. [...] "After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards [...] ". [...] To process these punched cards, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Hollerith cards", he invented the keypunch, sorter, and tabulator unit record machines. These inventions were the foundation of the data processing industry. The tabulator used electromechanical relays to increment <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters.</b> Hollerith's method was used in the 1890 census. The company he founded in 1896, the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC), was one of four companies that in 1911 were amalgamated in the forming of a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, later renamed IBM.|$|R
30|$|Finger Tapping Test The Finger Tapping Test (FTT) {{is a test}} {{of motor}} speed that {{consists}} of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> mounted on a small (10 ″ ×  10 ″) board and on which a specially designed arm is mounted that measures the number of oscillations of the finger. Participants are instructed to use the finger of their dominant hand (FTD) to tap {{the arm of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> as fast as possible and then repeat this using the nondominant hand (FTND). The test requires five separate trials for each hand, with each trial lasting 10  s.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a different kind}} of space suit that is made of elastic cloth and has no joints. It provides excellent mobility and improved hand function. It was developed and tested in the 1960 ’s. Recent studies involved vacuum testing of a new elastic glove, then testing the physiological effects of <b>mechanical</b> <b>counter</b> pressure on the hand and arm. New textile technology will allow development of an elastic cloth that will ease donning, and there are other aids to donning under development. Computer-controlled textile machines will make close fitting garments for every astronaut, large or small. Thermal comfort results from physiologically controlled sweating with instant evaporative cooling through the porous elastic cloth. Compared to gas-pressurized suits, the elastic cloth suit has the advantages of low suit weight, small mass of expendables and increased safety. It is practical and effective for the exploration of Mars...|$|E
5000|$|On {{taking office}} as Melter and Refiner, Peale {{implemented}} the changes he had recommended {{based on what}} he had seen in Europe. He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint's Coining Department, headed by Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt, whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint's Assayer. Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814. Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all Peale's recommendations, telling Peale's nephew, engineer George Sellers, [...] "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down ... he wants something better and no doubt he would have it if we were starting anew." [...] As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt's caution, the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic, noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe, which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there. To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale invented a piling-box, allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked, and a counting board, speeding the work of the clerks. The counting board remained in use until the mints installed <b>mechanical</b> <b>counters</b> in 1934.|$|R
40|$|Capsule Nestling {{provisioning}} rates {{depend on}} nestling age and number, and on time of season, {{but not on}} time of day. Aims To determine patterns of nestling provisioning, the effort made by the parents, and the factors which affect them. Methods <b>Mechanical</b> <b>counters</b> to determine food provisioning patterns in 229 Great Tit Parus major nests over 4 years. Results Feeding frequency per chick showed a linear increase with nestling age and total feeding frequency stabilized {{towards the end of}} the nestling period. The number of visits per nest increased linearly, while those per nestling decreased linearly with brood-size. Feeding rates per nest declined throughout the breeding season parallel to the seasonal brood-size decline; feeding frequencies per nestling did not vary seasonally. Adult effort was almost constant throughout the day, independently of variations in brood-size, ambient temperature and date. Conclusion Previous studies of nestling provisioning patterns were either contradictory or poorly supported by low sample sizes. The present study involved a much larger sample and clarifies nestling provisioning patterns and the factors with which they are associated. The rate of food provisioning to young is a basic aspect of the study of foraging behaviour in wild animals, which has been studied primarily in birds (e. g. Gibb & Bett...|$|R
