40|$|Productivity {{and safety}} {{concerns}} of traditional cable harvesting {{systems have been}} the key drivers for increasing levels of mechanisation in New Zealand. The use of grapples in cable yarding could {{eliminate the need for}} motor-manual tree fallers and breaker-outs in most situations. A comparative time study was carried out on two mechanised cable harvesting systems utilising grapple carriages in an attempt to better understand the benefits and limitations of each system in different harvest settings. These systems include the Mechanical system which involved a swing yarder operating a mechanical grapple carriage and the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system,</b> which used a tower yarder with a motorised grapple carriage. The Mechanical system took less time to accumulate felled trees but took longer to unhook trees on the landing than the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system.</b> The Mechanical system had a shorter cycle time (2. 07 minutes) than the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system</b> (2. 32 minutes) and extracted 1. 3 tonnes more than the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system</b> per cycle. The <b>Motorised</b> <b>system</b> had shorter cycle times when in horizontal haul distances of less than 90 metres, but had the longest times when the distance exceeded this. Utilisation rates were similar between the two systems, although the main difference in delays between the two systems was the use of surgepiles on the landing by the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system.</b> Both systems were effective, although on average the Mechanical system was more productive, with a productivity of 45 t/SMH, compared to 40 t/SMH for the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system.</b> The Mechanical system was the most productive when extracting mechanically felled and pre-bunched or trees while the <b>Motorised</b> <b>system</b> was the most productive when extracting motor-manually felled trees. Pre-bunching with an excavator was a more cost effective method than handing stems directly to the grapple carriage. Further research of the Mechanical system under more adverse conditions would allow a better overall comparison...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent decades}} much {{research}} has focused on the use of space tether systems for payload orbital transfers. Orbit raising through the exchange of momentum using hanging tether systems in addition to enhanced momentum exchange resulting from motorised torque-driven systems have both been considered. In this paper the fo- cus is on the performance of symmetrically laden motorised momentum exchange tethers with the aim of conducting orbital transfers. These consist of two propulsion tethers symmetrically attached to a motor shaft with payloads, to be later trans- ferred, attached to their free ends. Rotation is achieved through reaction against two further tethers and masses attached to the motor stator with an estimated mass of this system, minus the propulsion tethers and payloads, of 1. 5 tonnes. By deriv- ing the maximum tension acting on a system orbiting an oblate Earth expressions are obtained for the maximum rotational velocity that the tether systems are capa- ble of withstanding, based upon the material properties of the tethers themselves. Having obtained these expressions the performance of both hanging and motorised tether systems for conducting orbital transfers is analysed in terms of the gain in energy when the orbital geometry and tether length are varied. From this analysis the material-specifc tether length which gives the greatest gain in rotational kinetic energy to the payloads is established for a <b>motorised</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, by utilising this material-specific length, the minimum semi-major axis which is capable of per- forming lunar transfers and Earth escape trajectories is obtained...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} motivational {{basis of the}} use of the bicycle for daily travel necessities in a big city. Different from {{previous}} research on cycling, this study used a social psychological model (Perugini and Bagozzi's model of goal-directed behaviour) as a theoretical framework and focussed on prediction of desires. A total of 387 residents of Rome (Italy) were administered a structured questionnaire measuring attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, positive and negative anticipated emotions, desire, and past behaviour concerning their use of the bike in the city. Results showed how positive emotions mediated the effects of attitudes, perceived social norms, and negative emotions on desire. This suggests that the affective factors could play a more direct role in orienting people's desire in relation to both the behaviour considered and the particular context: a large city where mobility is based on <b>motorised</b> <b>systems</b> and support facilities for bicycles are scarce.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{piezoelectric}} {{dynamic balance}} regulator, {{which can be}} used in <b>motorised</b> spindle <b>systems,</b> is presented. The dynamic balancing adjustment mechanism is driven by an in-plane bending vibration from an annular piezoelectric stator excited by a high-frequency sinusoidal input voltage. This device has different construction, characteristics and operating principles than a conventional balance regulator. In this work, a dynamic model of the regulator is first developed using a detailed analytical method. Thereafter, MATLAB is employed to numerically simulate the relations between the dominant parameters and the characteristics of the regulator based on thedynamic model. Finally, experimental measurements are used to certify the validity of the dynamic model.

The objective of this work was to obtain the hyperelastic and viscoelastic material properties of heel pad sub-layers (skin, micro-chamber and macro-chamber layers) in-vivo. An anatomically detailed 3 D Finite Element model of the human heel was used to derive the sub-layer material properties. A combined ultrasound imaging and <b>motorised</b> platform <b>system</b> was used to compress heel pad and to create input data for the Finite Element model. The force-strain responses of the heel pad and its sub-layers under slow compression (5 mm/s) and rapid loading-hold-unloading cycles (225 mm/s), were measured and hyperelastic and viscoelastic properties of the three heel pad sub-layers were estimated by the model. The loaded (under 315 N) thickness of the heel pad was measured from MR images and used for hyperelastic model validation. The capability of the model to predict peak plantar pressure was used for further validation. Experimental responses of the heel pad under different dynamic loading scenarios (loading-hold-unloading cycles at 141 mm/s and sinusoidal loading with maximum velocity of 300 mm/s) were used to validate the viscoelastic model. Good agreement was achieved between the predicted and experimental results for both hyperelastic (< 6. 4...|$|R
40|$|Pedestrian {{systems as}} a part of {{mobility}} systems is a key issue for the development of cities. Traditional planning and public policies based on modernist approaches have directed most efforts to improve <b>motorised</b> transport <b>systems,</b> reducing the participation of the non-motorised ones, including pedestrians, in the modal split. However, with the saturation of those approaches, there has been a clear trend worldwide regarding awareness about the importance of walking to raise liveability and efficiency in the urban areas. The shortage of parking in relation to the increasing amount of vehicles, fuel costs, congestion, limitation for infrastructure expansion and environment appeal have shifted attention to pedestrian systems. This paper presents a discussion on pedestrian systems design and its representation on the modal split in the City of Bogot?, considering for the analysis the "gaps? in modelling these systems. The methodologies used were descriptive and a case study.

40|$|Energy {{is a key}} {{input into}} the fish {{harvesting}} process. Efficient use of energy helps in reducing operational costs and environmental impact, while increasing profits. Energy optimisation is {{an important aspect of}} responsible fishing as enunciated in the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Gross Energy Requirement (GER) is the sum of all non-renewable energy resources consumed in making available a product or service and is expressed in energy units per physical unit of product or service delivered. GER is a measure of intensity of non-renewable resource use and it reflects the amount of depletion of earth’s inherited store of non-renewable energy in order to create and make available a product or service. In this study, GER in fish harvesting up to the point of landing is estimated in selected fish harvesting systems in the small-mechanised sectors of Indian fisheries and compared with reported results from selected non mechanised and <b>motorised</b> fishing <b>systems</b> to reflect the situation during 1997 - 1998.

Firstly, the various technical challenges that must be overcome to provide a good performance of such a system operating in harsh environmental conditions are discussed. The aims and objectives of the research project are then presented; followed by a mini-project which was carried out as an introduction to research methods.

40|$|Amid {{growing concern}} over {{climate change and}} the {{resultant}} need to reduce CO 2 emissions, {{as well as an}} ever-increasing global population with a rising demand for electricity, renewable energy sources have an important role to play in future electricity generation. One such source is tidal stream energy, which offers the potential for predictable electricity generation by harnessing the energy of the tide using arrays of underwater turbines. This research explores the impact of hydrodynamic interactions between the blades of a tidal stream turbine and its support structure on turbine performance, as well as the hydrodynamic interaction of multiple turbines. Experiments were carried out using scale model turbines installed in experimental water channels, and a <b>motorised</b> drive <b>system</b> and encoder was used to record turbine performance. Due to turbulence in the region upstream of the support structure, separation distance between the turbine blades and support structure was found to significantly influence performance. An optimal separation distance between the blades and support structure was found to allow maximum performance. The turbulent wake of an upstream turbine was also found to have a notable impact on downstream turbine performance, leading to a reduction in power output. This effect is governed by upstream and offset separation distance and support structure diameter. Particle Image Velocimetry was used to record downstream turbine velocity wakes, which were found be a complex amalgamation of turbine and support structure elements. The testing of a turbine installed on four complex support structures produced large differences in power outputs, further highlighting the influence of support structure design on turbine performance, and confirming its importance to the design of tidal stream turbine arrays...|$|R

With the advent of calcium-sensitive and fast response voltage-sensitive dyes, {{it is now possible}} to gain complex physiological recordings from various cardiac muscle preparations, while simultaneously optically sectioning the samples.

The aim of this thesis is to assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the different types of optical sectioning microscope methods that are currently available in many biological labs.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging has, until recently, {{been limited to}} scans with patients in the recumbent position. However, a new fully open magnetic {{resonance imaging}} unit has been configured to allow upright, partially upright, and recumbent imaging, enabling weight-bearing positional evaluation of the spinal column during various dynamic-kinetic manoeuvres for patients with degenerative conditions of the spine. In a prospective non-statistical analysis of cervical or lumbar imaging examinations, all studies were performed on a whole body magnetic resonance imaging system. The system operates at 0. 6 T using an electromagnet with a horizontal field, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the patient’s body. The unit was configured with a top/front-open design, incorporating a patient-scanning table with tilt, translation, and elevation functions. The unique <b>motorised</b> patient handling <b>system</b> developed for the scanner allows for vertical (upright, weight bearing) and horizontal (recumbent) positioning of all patients.

40|$|While {{the active}} dynamic {{stability}} of automobiles has {{increased over the}} past 17 years there have been very few similar advances made with electrically powered wheelchairs. This lack of improvement {{has led to a}} long standing acceptance of less-than-optimal stability and control of these wheelchairs. Accidents due to loss of stability are well documented. Hence, the healthcare industry has made several efforts for improved control of electric powered wheelchairs (EPWs) to provide enhanced comfort, safety and manoeuvrability at a lower cost. In response, an area of stability control was identified that could benefit from a feedback control system using solid state sensors. To design an effective closed–loop feedback controller with optimal performance to overcome instabilities, an accurate model of wheelchair dynamics needed to be created. Such a model can be employed to test various controllers quickly and repeatedly, without the difficulties of physically setting a wheelchair up for each test. This task was one central goal of this research. A wireless test-bed of a front wheel drive (FWD) wheelchair was also developed to validate a dynamic wheelchair model. It integrates sensors, a data control system, an embedded controller, and the <b>motorised</b> mechanical <b>system.</b> The wireless communication ensures the integrity of sensor data collected and control signals sent. The test-bed developed not only facilitates the development of feedback controllers of motorised wheelchairs, but the collected data {{can also be used to}} confirm theories of causes of dynamic instabilities. The prototype test-bed performed the required tasks to satisfaction as defined by the sponsor. Data collected from live tests in which the test-bed followed set patterns, was processed and analysed. The patterns were designed to induce instability. The analysis revealed that an occupied wheelchair is more stable than an unoccupied wheelchair, disproving an initial instability theory proposed in this research. However, a proximal theory explaining over-steer is confirmed. Two models of the FWD test-bed were created. First, a dynamic model inherited from prior research, based on equations of motion was tested and enhanced based on measured data. However, even with alterations to correct parameter values and variables in the equations, a complete model validation was not possible. Second, a kinematic model was created with a factor to compensate for dynamics not normally accounted in kinematic models. The kinematic model was partially validated versus the measured data. Although, still highly accurate, there is room for improvement in this model. Both models contained a sub-system drive motor model, to account for input forces to the FWD wheelchair system model, which is fully validated...|$|R
40|$|Every year, {{more than}} 5000 {{pedestrians}} and 2000 cyclists die on European roads. These vulnerable road users (VRU) are at especially high risk when interacting with <b>motorised</b> vehicles. Safety <b>systems</b> designed to mitigate or avoid crashes with VRU started to enter the market {{a few years ago}} and still need to be improved to be effective in all scenarios. Understanding how drivers interact with VRU is crucial to improve the development and the evaluation of safety systems. Today, however, there is a lack of knowledge about driver behaviour in interactions with VRU, which keeps active safety measures from expressing their full potential. This thesis has multiple objectives: 1) to provide new knowledge about driver behaviour in crossing interactions with VRU, 2) to present this knowledge to assessment programs such as Euro NCAP with the goal of improving their system-evaluation scenarios, and 3) to include this knowledge in a counterfactual analysis framework for safety-benefit evaluation. Results showed that the moment in which a VRU becomes visible to the driver had the largest influence on the driver braking response process in driver-VRU interactions. This thesis contributes to experimental methodologies by comparing the steps of the response process in test-track and in driving-simulator studies. Additionally, the thesis describes a driver braking response model and uses the information gained from it to suggest improvements in the design and evaluation of safety systems. Finally, a framework for counterfactual simulations was developed which is suitable for evaluating safety benefits and refining intelligent safety systems (such as autonomous emergency braking and frontal collision warning).

This study acknowledges the resulting dearth of user consultation data {{as one of the}} gaps and addresses it through utilising a wide user consultation exercise to direct and inform the research and development of Smart Homes. Users stress that the role of technology is to complement and enhance existing living arrangements and cannot act as a substitute to the care and support received from other people, either informally from family and friends or formally from service providers. A technology and design review informed design exercises culminating in the design of smart homes capable of being constructed for disabled persons and those requiring lifetime homes.

40|$|Blinds and {{shutters}} create privacy {{during the}} day and night in residential and commercial buildings. They are also used to keep rooms cool when sunny and to minimise heat loss at night or in winter; in turn this reduces use of air conditioning and heating, associated energy inputs, carbon and equivalent outputs and costs. As well as controlling temperature, blinds and shutters can be used to reduce glare, control light levels and to contribute to general health and well-being. Despite these various benefits in many instances in the UK blinds and shutters are not opened and closed and/or adjusted correctly and consequently the above benefits are not fully realised. One means of addressing this problem to ensure maximum operational energy savings and thermal comfort is the implementation of motorised and/or automatic blind opening and closing. By default however this increases the number and variety of components, materials and manufacturing processes and embodied environmental impact. In this study Life Cycle Assessment is used to measure and compare combined embodied environmental impact and potential operational energy savings of a variety of types of manual, motorised and automated blinds in a typical domestic environment in the UK. Currently the majority of manually operated blinds and shutters are either sent to landfill or incinerated with energy recovery at end of life even though the materials, manufacturing and assembly processes for these products indicate that reuse and recycling are relatively easy to achieve. Not only does this study clearly illustrate the benefits of reuse and recycling all types of blind at end-of-life, it also highlights the necessity for doing so in the case of <b>motorised</b> and automated <b>systems.</b> In addition to recycling the paper explores other business models (such as component reuse, remanufacture, leasing, buying a service), all of which are associated with the development of a Circular Economy for this sector.

40|$|The {{original}} idea underlying this thesis {{was to show}} whether {{and to what extent}} it is feasible to use a surgical C-arm for volume reconstruction in the field of medical imaging. Surgical C-arms are widely used as intra-operational imaging tools, for instance for navigation or verification. They provide the possibility to easily obtain X-ray images of a patient from an arbitrary viewing angle. These features make them a promising candidate for the use in volume reconstruction, since this requires the recording of a number of images from many directions. In the last years, several approaches with different kinds of C-arms have been undertaken by different research groups or companies. Since the three-dimensional imaging of patients requires an accurate knowledge of the projection geometry, the larger, more rigid, and <b>motorised</b> vascular G-arm <b>systems</b> have been the gantries of choice. These C-arms are usually heavy and ceiling-mounted. They require a large room to be placed and moved in. Surgical C-arms, on the other hand, are less stable, but movable and flexible. The feasibility of using a movable surgical C-arm for volume reconstruction of its linear attenuation coefficients will be evaluated in this thesis. To this end, system calibration techniques, reconstruction methods, visualisation techniques, and possible medical applications have been explored. It will be shown, which extend of calibration is necessary for a surgical C- arm to provide the quality of data needed for volume reconstruction. The reconstructions are performed {{on the basis of a}} standard algorithm due to Feldkamp et al. Results are presented as maximum-intensity-projections (MIPs), volume slices as in classic CT, and volume-rendered images of the reconstructed volumes. These images could be used for the diagnosis of bone-related injuries or diseases, the planning and/or verification of the placement of pins supporting the recovery of splintered bones or the modelling of prostheses with a higher precision than today. The work includes the development of new interpolative calibration methods that enable the use of arbitrary system trajectories in future C-arm gantries...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{significant}} number of trips in cities of developing counties are made on foot, especially in Sub Sahara Africa, the pedestrian environment has largely been neglected by most city authorities. Faced with high rates of motorization and the need to accommodate the growing requirements in increasingly urbanizing population; cities of the developing world are more preoccupied with <b>motorised</b> transport <b>systems</b> such as building arterial streets, Rapid Bus Transport systems (BRTs), fly overs, highways and so on so as to inter alia reduce congestion. In so doing, the needs of pedestrians that constitute the biggest users of walkways and streets are often ignored. The policy shift from social welfare to liberal economies coupled with the slow transformation of the economy from agriculture to manufacturing and services has widen the income gap between the rich and the poor; leading to further marginalization of the basic needs such as pedestrian walkways and the future for the most vulnerable groups. Continued disregard of planning for pedestrian friendly environment has also resulted in increased numbers of pedestrian fatalities, road traffic deaths as well as rise in household expenditure on transport costs, decreased quality of the public realm and hostile pedestrian environment. Despite researches and scholarly debates have identified insufficient knowledge on safety management, there is limited knowledge on how the pedestrian requirements are considered in policy making, planning and implementation of plans in situations of increased motorised transport. From this background, the overall objective {{of this study was to}} explore policy and planning interventions through which the walking environment in cities of developing countries can be improved. Specifically, the study aimed to achieve a number of objectives. Firstly, to study the pedestrian movement patterns in three case studies; explore the reasons why people walk more often for everyday life activities including their perspectives on the walking environment. Secondly, to examine how the existing urban design concepts, planning standards and national policies consider the pedestrian requirements in the formal planned and informal settlements including their implementations. On the methodological fronts, a multiple case study research design was employed. Sinza, Kariakoo, and Buguruni settlements in Dar es Salaam City, Tanzania, were used as case study areas. The data collection methods included interviews, observations, review of documents, pre structured group discussions, measurements, sketches and photographing. The analysis shows that people in the case study areas and the Dar es Salaam City in general often walk primarily because of: low income, proximity to services, a form of physical exercise, challenges related to public transport, and nature of their occupations. Regarding where they go most often, the results show that, the majority commute to workplaces, commercial service centres, community service centres, and social activities areas. Many people also walk in order to meet their recreation needs. Overwhelmingly, people in the City of Dar es Salaam commented that pedestrians are excluded from urban mobility and are not respected by motorists. Respondents further asserted that the walking environment is uncomfortable, dangerous, insecure due to crime, and that public facilities are inconveniently located. The study has also demonstrated empirically that in the situation of increased motorised transport, the pedestrians’ requirements are generally inadequately considered. Even where they are considered, their implementation was generally poor. In a few cases, where pedestrian walkways are adequately provided, they were enchroached by informal and formal vendors; used as parking areas or invaded due to extension of buildings. Their protection and maintenance were also given little or no attention by the respective authorities. To improve the walking environment this study recommends a number of measures: These include: formulation of a single consolidated pedestrian policy, establishment of pedestrian advocacy groups, review of design concepts and planning standards, provision of planning guidelines that adequately meet the pedestrian accessibility and safety needs, implement redevelopment schemes, pedestrianisation of the congested streets, expansion of the BRT services, promotion of the concept of shared space, establishment of transport department at municipal level, and launching of a transport authority within the city (DUTA). For effective implementation of the plan proposals, the study further recommends the establishment of a steering committee, formulation of strategic action plans and stringent enforcement of land use development control. Finally, it is also important to encourage private and public firms to partner with LGAs and invest part of their corporate social responsibilities to promote pedestrian facilities and overall environment in neighbourhoods...|$|R
40|$|Eco driving {{assistant}} {{systems can}} substantially help drivers to adapt a more fuel-efficient driving style, {{which would have}} a positive impact on the emissions caused by <b>motorised</b> traffic. Such <b>systems</b> try to influence drivers in everyday situations that are mostly determined by habits, time and money. The assessment of motivating and discouraging factors, which encourage regular usage, is therefore of crucial interest. This paper presents results of a survey that has been conducted simultaneously in eleven European countries in 2010 with over 5000 participants. The survey aimed to collect needs and requirements for future eco driving systems. It mainly assessed the acceptance of so-called cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS) applications which aim to influence the drivers route choice, their vehicle miles travelled, improve their behaviour towards a more economic driving style and to optimise the total traffic network to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The objective of this paper is to: 1. Investigate motivating and discouraging factors as well as the perceived usefulness of Green ITS by drivers in Europe 2. Describe regional differences within Europe to analyse their market potential. To assess user needs and requirements for future eco driving assistant systems, a standardised questionnaire study was selected as the most suitable method. This method can help to generate answers to identify desired functionalities and analyse motivating factors and barriers for vehicle drivers - information that help to design products according to the actual user needs. Furthermore, the approach allows analysing regional differences within Europe. The questionnaire was structured in three parts: The first and the second part included questions about the participants profile like their personal data (e. g. age, gender, sex.), their habits (e. g. annual mileage, driving purposes.) and information about their car(s). The third part, which represented the main part of the survey, addressed the acceptance of different eco driving assistant systems. Respondents were confronted with seven virtual eco driving applications that all aim to challenge inefficiencies either pre-trip, on-trip or post-trip. Additionally, illustrations of different driving situations were shown. Afterwards, the respondents had to valuate the usefulness of the eco driving systems with respect to the driving situations. The results of the survey show that all of the assessed applications were considered useful enhancements by the respondents. However, differences in the rating of the applications are negligible, especially between on-trip and post-trip applications. All application types show comprehensible direct benefits for the drivers, who mostly also stated that they would be willing to use eco driving assistant systems, especially if benefits would be less subtle, e. g. by showing monetised values. The latter finding becomes more evident as the results also show that even though users' acceptance of eco driving systems is very high, willingness to pay is not...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} design {{and control of the}} &# 147;GreenWeeder&# 148;, a non-herbicidal {{autonomous}} weeding robot, in order to autonomously track crop rows for weeding through electrocution in the inter-row space. The four wheel mobile robot platform was designed and built with a <b>motorised</b> Ackerman steering <b>system</b> allowing the robot to steer up to 30 degree left and right. It was also equipped with an electronically geared rear wheel drive, a pair of stereo cameras, a SICK LMS- 291 laser range finder to localize itself with respect to the crop rows, a GPS system for obtaining the robot position in the field and a long-range communication system for tele-supervision by operators. The first prototype of the robot electrocution system was also designed and constructed to ignite 22 kV electrical arcs to destroy weeds. Its operation was tested in the research field of the University of Sydney and the results of this experiment were analysed to improve the efficiency of this first prototype. An improved prototype of the electrocution system was then constructed and attached to a cradle extending out {{at the back of the}} mobile robot platform. The testing of this improved prototype was conducted at Lansdowne farm, a research field of the University of Sydney. After the construction of the robot platform, the robot control was considered with the demands for robot localization with respect to crop rows, an autonomously tracking control system and a manual control mode in order to take the robot to transportation vehicles. Firstly, the robot localization was accomplished by utilizing SICK LMS- 291 laser range finder sensor for the sensing and perception of the robot. Secondly, the robot control system was developed with a PID controller, a second order model of the robot system and a first order filter. The PID controller is in the standard form with the filtered derivative and the PI part being in automatic reset configuration. The second order model was identified using Matlab System Identification toolbox based on the robot kinematic analysis. The first order filter is utilized for filtering out the lateral deviations of the robot with respect to the crop rows received from the SICK laser sensor. A Simulink simulation model of the robot control system was also built in order to fine-tune PID and filter parameters. Thirdly, the manual control mode of the robot was produced. In this mode, a joystick can be attached to a notebook to wirelessly drive the robot around or it can be plugged into a USB port at the back of the robot to drive it without the notebook. After the robot control was implemented and simulated, some experiments were conducted with the robot autonomously tracking a strip of reflective tape mimicking a crop row stuck into the ground of a laboratory. Depending on distances from the row assigned to the controller, the robot tried to keep those distances away from the row. The results showed the lateral errors of the robot with respect to the row were approximately 4. 5 cm which were sufficient for our current agricultural application...|$|R
