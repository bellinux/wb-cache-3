5|$|As {{a result}} of {{improvements}} Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a <b>magnifying</b> capability of 20×, {{he was able to}} see celestial bodies more distinctly than was ever possible before. This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 what {{came to be known as}} the Galilean moons.|$|E
5|$|The first Tintin {{postage stamp}} was an eight-franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th {{anniversary of the}} {{publication}} of Tintin's first adventure on 29 September 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a <b>magnifying</b> glass at several stamps.|$|E

5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that makes use of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly <b>magnifying</b> the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E
5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a <b>magnifying</b> glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|The National Museum of Beirut {{currently}} exhibits 1300 {{artifacts from}} its collection of approximately 100,000 objects. The museum displays follow a chronological circuit beginning in Prehistory and ending in the Ottoman era. The circuit begins {{on the ground}} floor where 83 large objects are displayed, these include sarcophagi, mosaics statues and reliefs. The upper floor displays 1243 small and medium-sized artifacts arranged by chronological order and by theme in modern showcases with soft lighting and <b>magnifying</b> glasses that emphasize the aesthetic aspect of the artifacts.|$|E

40|$|The {{cross grid}} encoder is a {{diffraction}} grating type encoder to measure two-dimensional {{position of a}} optical head by using a grid plate, and is widely used in the industry to evaluate the two-dimensional contouring performance of a machine tool. In the graphical display of measured contouring error profiles, the error is often <b>magnified</b> to some given scale {{with respect to the}} reference trajectory. The conventional algorithm to compute the <b>magnified</b> contouring error profile, adopted in a commercial software to analyze an error profile measured by the cross grid encoder, makes the <b>magnified</b> trajectory discontinuous when the given reference trajectory is unsmooth, which makes it difficult to understand the <b>magnified</b> trajectory especially at corners. This paper proposes a new algorithm to compute the <b>magnified</b> trajectory of two-dimensional contouring error profiles such that the <b>magnified</b> trajectory becomes continuous even when the reference trajectory is unsmooth. Application examples are presented with error profiles obtained by using a cross grid encoder applied to a commercial machining center...|$|R
5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a <b>magnifying</b> glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a <b>magnifying</b> glass. By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his <b>magnifying</b> glass as well, proving that there never actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E

30|$|Given the above, we {{hypothesized}} that, {{in response to}} PE, <b>magnify</b> should be an adaptive emotion socialization strategy, and override a maladaptive strategy. We therefore expected that reward (PE and NE), <b>magnify</b> (PE), and override (NE) should correlate positively with emotional warmth and negatively with rejection or overprotection. The inverse relation was expected for punish, neglect (PE and NE), override (PE), and <b>magnify</b> (NE).|$|R
5|$|The decorations are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with <b>magnifying</b> glasses, although lenses of the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a <b>magnifying</b> glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a <b>magnifying</b> glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
30|$|For the NE, we had {{different}} expectations. We considered that reward and override were adaptive emotion socialization practices, while neglect, punish, and <b>magnify</b> were not. Indeed, parents perceived as using more reward and override {{were also more}} emotionally warm (positive MRP) and used less negative MRP, like rejection and overprotection (this last only for reward). Neglect use was associated with higher rejection and neglect of sadness and fear with overprotection; punish of sadness and anger with overprotection; and <b>magnify</b> with overprotection and <b>magnify</b> of anger with rejection. Finally, neglect was associated with less emotionally warm parenting, but contrary to our expectations, we found positive correlations with punish and <b>magnify.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the {{research}} process, Underwood provided photomicrographic {{images of the}} bacteria that were involved in {{the research}}, which were <b>magnified</b> 650 times in 1896. A later research article in 1898 showed photography of bacteria <b>magnified</b> 1,000 times.|$|R
50|$|Longer lenses <b>magnify</b> {{the subject}} more, {{apparently}} compressing distance and (when {{focused on the}} foreground) blurring the background because of their shallower depth of field. Wider lenses tend to <b>magnify</b> distance between objects while allowing greater depth of field.|$|R
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a <b>magnifying</b> glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E
25|$|Optical microscopes and <b>magnifying</b> devices {{also present}} unique safety challenges. If any optical power is present, {{and a simple}} <b>magnifying</b> device is {{used to examine the}} fiber end, then the user is no longer {{protected}} by beam divergence, since the entire beam may be imaged onto the eye. Therefore, simple <b>magnifying</b> devices should never be used in such situations. Optical connector inspection microscopes are available which incorporate blocking filters, thus greatly improving eye safety. The most recent such design also incorporates protection against red fault locating lasers.|$|E

40|$|Modulation of pain using visual {{distortion}} of body size (VDBS) {{has been the}} subject of various reports. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of VDBS on pain has been less often studied. In the present study, factors associated with modulation of pain threshold by VDBS were investigated. Visual feedback in the form of a <b>magnified</b> image of the hand was provided to 44 healthy adults to examine changes in pain. In participants with a higher pain threshold when visual feedback of a <b>magnified</b> image of the hand was provided, the two-point discrimination threshold decreased. In contrast, participants with a lower pain threshold with visual feedback of a <b>magnified</b> image of the hand experienced unpleasant emotions toward the <b>magnified</b> image of the hand. Interestingly, this emotional reaction was strongly associated with negative body consciousness in several subjects. These data suggested an analgesic effect of visual feedback in the form of a <b>magnified</b> image of the hand is only when tactile perception is vivid and the emotional reaction toward the <b>magnified</b> image is moderate. The results also suggested that negative body consciousness is important for the modulation of pain using VDBS...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} and {{effective}} image-magnification algorithm based on intervals is proposed. A low-resolution image is <b>magnified</b> to form a high-resolution image using a block-expanding method. Our proposed method associates each pixel with an interval obtained by a weighted aggregation of the pixels in its neighborhood. From the interval and with a linear K α operator, we obtain the <b>magnified</b> image.
