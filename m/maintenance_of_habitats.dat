40|$|The {{development}} of human societies rests on functioning ecosystems. This thesis builds on integrated theories of linked social-ecological systems and complex adaptive systems {{to increase the}} {{understanding of how to}} strengthen the capacity of ecosystems to generate services that sustain human well-being. In this work, I analyze such capacity in human-dominated production ecosystems in Tanzania and Madagascar, and how this capacity is related to local management practices. Resilience of social-ecological systems refers to the capacity to buffer change, to re-organize following disruption, and for adaptation and learning. In Papers I and II, qualitative interview methods are used for mapping and analyses of management practices in the agroecosystem of the Mbulu highlands, Northern Tanzania. Practices such as soil and water conservation, <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitats</b> for pollinators and predators of pests, intercropping, and landscape diversification, act to buffer food production in a variable environment and sustain underlying ecological processes. The practices are embedded in a decentralized but nested system of institutions, such as communal land rights and social networks, that can buffer for localized disturbances such as temporary droughts. Paper II compares these findings with practices in a farming system in Sweden, and suggests that similar mechanisms for dealing with uncertainty and change can exist in spite of different biophysical conditions. In Papers III and IV, interviews are combined with GIS tools and vegetation sampling to study characteristics and dynamics of the dry forests of Androy, southern Madagascar. Paper III reports on a previously underestimated capacity of the dry forest of southern Madagascar to regenerate, showing areas of regeneration roughly equal areas of degenerated forest (18 700 ha). The pattern of forest regeneration, degradation, and stable cover during the period 1986 - 2000 was related to the enforcement of customary property rights (Paper III). Paper IV reports on a network of locally protected forest patches in Androy that is embedded in a landscape managed for agricultural or livestock production and contributes to the generation of ecosystem services and ecosystem resilience at a landscape scale. Forest protection is secured by local taboos that provide a well-functioning and legitimate sanctioning system related to religious beliefs. In Paper V, two spatial modeling tools are used to assess the generation of two services, crop pollination and seed dispersal, by the protected forest patches in southern Androy. The functioning of these services is dependent on the spatial configuration of protected patches in the fragmented landscape and can be highly vulnerable to even small changes in landscape forest cover. In conclusion, many of the identified practices are found to make ecological sense in the context of complex systems and contribute to the resilience of social-ecological systems. The thesis illustrates that the capacity of human-dominated production ecosystems to sustain a flow of desired ecosystem services is strongly associated with local management practices and the governance system that they are embedded in, and that, contrary to what is often assumed, local management can and does add resilience for desired ecosystem services. These findings have substantial policy implications, as insufficient recognition of the dynamics of social-ecological interactions is likely to lead to failure of schemes for human development and biodiversity conservation...|$|E

We studied <b>habitat</b> selection <b>of</b> hoopoes in pine plantation forests using a multi-scale survey, including point-counts at the landscape level and radio-tracking at the home-range scale. We quantiWed habitat use by systematically observing bird behaviour and characterized foraging sites according to micro-habitat variables and abundance of the main prey in the study area, the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa). At the landscape scale, hoopoes selected <b>habitat</b> mosaics <b>of</b> high diversity, including deciduous woods and hedgerows as main nesting sites.

Hoopoe nesting success decreased during the three study years in line with processionary moth abundance. Thus, we suggest that hoopoes need complementation between foraging and breeding habitats to establish successfully in pine plantations.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} and viability of a marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia metapopulation in a Belgian successional landscape. Based on capture-mark-recapture and winter nest census data, we first estimated demography (survival and recruitment rates, population size, density dependence) and dispersal parameters (emigration rate, effect of patch connectivity on dispersal, mortality during dispersal). Then using RAMAS/GIS platform, we parameterised a population viability analysis (PVA) model with these parameters {{to simulate the}} future of this metapopulation under different scenarios. The metapopulation does not seem viable even if natural reforestation is controlled by adequate management. In its present state, the patch system is not able to sustain enough individuals: due to the large temporal fluctuations in demographic parameters, a carrying capacity far higher than currently would be necessary to limit extinction risk to 1 %, suggesting the existence of an extinction debt for the species in Belgium. The situation of E aurinia appears much worse compared to two other fritillary species threatened in Belgium, for which similar PVA are available. It is therefore urgent to increase the carrying capacity of the patch system. How and where it is achieved are of secondary importance for the gain in viability: improvement <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> quality through restoration, or increase <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> quantity via enlargement of existing patches and/or creation <b>of</b> new <b>habitat</b> in the matrix.

40|$|A useful {{theoretical}} {{approach in the}} literature for those trying to conserve forest biodiversity involves a number of strategies to achieve <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> for different species across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This approach emphasises the importance of implementing measures in off-reserve areas to complement reserve systems. This contrasts with both the traditional ‘set-aside’ approach to conservation and the primary aim of production forestry. Translating this risk-spreading approach into on-ground practice is often a difficult task.

This includes the development of measurable objectives, integration of conservation goals with silvicultural goals, development of clear and practical guidelines, effective training and communication programs {{and the development of a}} monitoring and an adaptive management process agreed to by all stakeholders.

In boreal forests composed of relatively short-lived species this approach would probably lead to fibre loss {{and a decrease in}} allowable cut. Alternatively, Bergeron et al. (1999) have suggested that silvicultural practices aimed at maintaining structural and compositional characteristics of over-aged stands in treated stands could, in boreal regions, guarantee <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitat</b> diversity while only slightly affecting allowable cut. In addition to usual clear-cutting followed by seeding or planting (or another even-age silvicultural system whose outcome resembled to post-fire conditions), some stands could be treat by partial cuts which approach the natural development of over-aged stands (Groot 2013) and still other stands with selection cuts in order to reflect the dynamics of old growth stands. The current challenge, however, is to identify sites characteristics (e.g. organic layer thickness threshold) that would help forest managers identify sites where clear-cutting may not be applicable, but where partial cuts may be desirable.|$|R
