40|$|Rapidly growing global {{networking}} has induced {{and supported}} an {{increased interest in}} the life sciences in such general issues as health, climate change, food security and biodiversity. Therefore, the need to address and share research data and materials in a systematic way emerged almost simultaneously. This movement {{has been described as}} the so-called global research commons. Also in microbiology, where the sharing of <b>microbiological</b> <b>materials</b> is a key issue, microbial commons is attracting attention. Microbiology is currently facing great challenges with the advances of high throughput screening and next-generation whole genome sequencing. Furthermore, the exploration and use of microorganisms in agriculture and food production are increasing so as to safeguard global food and feed production. Further to several meetings on the subject, a special issue of Research in Microbiology is dedicated to Microbial Research Commons with a series of reviews elaborating its major pay-offs and needs in basic and applied microbiology. This paper gives an introduction to these articles covering a range of topics. These include the role of public culture collections and biological resource centers and legal aspects in the exchange of materials, microbial classification, an internet-based platform for data-sharing, applications in agriculture and food production, and challenges in metagenomics and extremophile research.

Analysis of this 'biobackground' was undertaken in the 1 - 10 um size range and a 3 - 9 % contribution was found to be biological in origin - values which are in good agreement with other studies reported in the literature. A model based on the physics of turbulent mixing and dispersion was developed and validated against this analysis. The Gamma distribution (the basis of our model) is shown to comply with the scaling laws of the concentration moments of our data, which enables us to universally characterise both biological and non-biological material in the atmosphere.

40|$|Initiation of pitting of {{mild steel}} in {{seawater}} usually {{is attributed to}} anode-cathode reactions {{set up by the}} small manganese sulphide (MnS) inclusions present in most steels. On the other hand there is now considerable evidence that microbiological factors are involved in the early corrosion of mild steel in natural seawater. Presented herein are the results of a two year investigation of whether microbiological factors are likely to have {{a significant role in the}} pitting of mild steel exposed to seawater. In the experiment, natural seawater was pumped from a Port Stephens tributary and split into two streams. One stream flowed slowly through a tank in which 25 mm x 25 mm polished steel coupons were suspended and was then released back to the estuary. The second stream was passed through a series of filters and sterilized using ultra-violet (UV) lamps prior to entering a similar but sealed tank, also fitted with UV sterilization, where identical coupons were suspended, before being returned to the estuary. Coupons were removed at various time intervals and examined both visually and using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In all cases the metal surfaces show a considerable difference in topography between those recovered from natural and those from sterilised seawater. Since the only significant difference between the exposure conditions was the removal of living <b>microbiological</b> <b>material</b> it is concluded that microbiological factors are responsible, directly or indirectly, for the more severe pitting observed on the coupons exposed to natural seawater...|$|E
40|$|Health effects {{resulting}} from dust inhalation in occupational environments {{may be more}} strongly associated with specific microbial components, such as fungi, than to the particles. The aim {{of the present study}} is to characterize the occupational exposure to the fungal burden in four different occupational settings (two feed industries, one poultry and one waste sorting industry), presenting results from two air sampling methods – the impinger collector and the use of filters. In addition, the equipment used for the filter sampling method allowed a more accurate characterization regarding the dimension of the collected fungal particles (less than 2. 5 μm size). Air samples of 300 L were collected using the impinger Coriolis μ air sampler. Simultaneously, the aerosol monitor (DustTrak II model 8532, TSI®) allowed assessing viable <b>microbiological</b> <b>material</b> below the 2. 5 μm size. After sampling, filters were immersed in 300 mL of sterilized distilled water and agitated for 30 min at 100 rpm. 150 μl from the sterilized distilled water were subsequently spread onto malt extract agar (2 %) with chloramphenicol (0. 05 g/L). All plates were incubated at 27. 5 ºC during 5 – 7 days. With the impinger method, the fungal load ranged from 0 to 413 CFU. m- 3 and with the filter method, ranged from 0 to 64 CFU. m- 3. In one feed industry, Penicillium genus was the most frequently found genus (66. 7 %) using the impinger method and three more fungi species/genera/complex were found. The filter assay allowed the detection of only two species/genera/complex in the same industry. In the other feed industry, Cladosporium sp. was the most found (33. 3 %) with impinger method and three more species/genera/complex were also found. Through the filter assay four fungi species/genera/complex were found. In the assessed poultry, Rhyzopus sp. was the most frequently detected (61. 2 %) and more three species/genera/complex were isolated. Through the filter assay, only two fungal species/genera/complex were found. In the waste sorting industry Penicillium sp. was the most prevalent (73. 6 %) with the impinger method, being isolated two more different fungi species/genera/complex. Through the filter assay only Penicillium sp. was found. A more precise determination of occupational fungal exposure was ensured, since it was possible to obtain information regarding not only the characterization of fungal contamination (impinger method), but also the size of dust particles, and viable fungal particles, that can reach the worker ́s respiratory tract (filters method). Both methods should be used in parallel to enrich discussion regarding potential health effects of occupational exposure to fungi...|$|E

During the electrochemical measurement, the carrier is positioned in or at the sample chamber. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with a gel strip serving as the carrier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{determination of}} the microbiological state of a sample, comprises placing the biological material from the sample on a carrier, positioning the carrier with respect to a sample chamber with two electrodes, setting a specified temperature in the sample chamber and carrying out an electrochemical measurement using the electrodes. During the electrochemical measurement, the carrier is positioned in or at the sample chamber. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with a gel strip serving as the carrier. The positioning of the carrier comprises an insertion of the gel strip into the sample chamber. The insertion of the gel strip takes place in such a manner that the gel strip contacts the two electrodes. The determination further comprises an opening of a sterile packaging of the gel strip before the contacting of the sample with the gel strip. The sterile packaging of the gel strip is opened or partially removed, so that a handling region is covered by a remaining part of the sterile packaging after opening or partial removal of the sterile packaging. The placement of the biological material on the gel strip takes place using the opening in the sterile packaging. The positioning of the gel strip in the sample chamber comprises a positioning the gel strip including a remaining section of the sterile packaging, in such a manner that the gel strip contacts the two electrodes. The positioning of the gel strip takes place in such a manner that the remaining portion of the sterile packaging does not contact the electrodes. The placement of the biological material comprises a contacting step of the sample with an adhesive strip or non-woven fiber material serving as a carrier. The positioning of the carrier comprises a positioning of the adhesive strip in the sample chamber. The adhesive strip or the non-woven fiber material is attached to a lid for closing the sample chamber that the adhesive strips or the non-woven fiber material, is after closing positioned within the sample chamber. The determination further comprises a closing step of the sample chamber with the lid, so that the adhesive strip or the non-woven fiber material is positioned within the sample chamber after closing. The placement of the biological material comprises an insertion of a micro-filter serving as the carrier in a gas or liquid flow. The positioning of the carrier comprises a positioning of the micro-filter in the sample chamber. The micro-filter is attached to a lid for closing the sample chamber and partially comprises an area, in which the lid consists of an opening, so that the gas or the liquid flow flows through the opening in the lid through the micro-filter. The determination further comprises the closing step of the opening in the lid and the closing of the sample chamber with the lid, so that the micro-filter is positioned within the sample chamber after closing. The insertion comprises a pumping of the liquid growth medium from a storage tank into the sample chamber. The pumping of the liquid growth medium comprises an exertion of force on an elastic region of the storage tank, so that the liquid growth medium flows into the sample chamber, over a liquid connection with a valve. The pumping of the liquid growth medium comprises the exertion of force on an elastic region of the sample chamber or the lid of the sample chamber, so that the volume of the sample chamber reduces and a fluid present in the closed sample chamber flows out of the chamber. The pumping also comprises a releasing of the stress of the elastic region, so that the volume of the sample chamber increases. The determination further comprises reading of a temperature/time-integration unit to obtain a temperature/time-integral between a point of time before the implementation of the electrochemical measurement and the reading of the temperature/time-integration unit, evaluating the electrochemical measurement to get a quantity or concentration of the biological material at a point of time of the implementation of the electrochemical measurement, and calculating the amount or concentration of the biological material at the point of time before the implementation of the electrochemical measurement, using the temperature/time-integral.

Crestal bone loss was measured on radiographs taken immediately and 6 months after cementation. Cytokine levels, amounts of bacteria were determined in PICF/GCF samples. Data were tested by appropriate statistical analyses. Results: Clinical findings were similar in the crowns cemented extraorally or intraorally at all times (P[*]&# 60;[*]. 05). PICF and GCF data were similar. At 3 month, interleukin- 17 E and osteoprotegerin levels were lower in the intraorally cemented crowns. Conclusion: Extraorally and intraorally cemented crowns exhibited similar crestal bone loss after loading. Higher amount of osteoprotegerin at 3 month at the EOC than the IOC sites might bode well for good osseointegration...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} locally delivered doxycycline {{as an adjunct to}} non-surgical treatment with the use of an ultrasonic device compared to scaling and root planing using hand instruments, by means of clinical and <b>microbiological</b> criteria. <b>Material</b> and Methods: Thirty three patients with chronic periodontitis participated in this cohort study and were divided into two groups. Patients in control group received scaling and root planing using hand instruments, whereas patients in control group received ultrasonic debridement and 8. 8 % doxycycline gel was applied after initial therapy and at 3 months at preselected sites. Clinical recordings concerning probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index and gingival bleeding index were performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months after baseline. Subgingival samples were analysed using the “checkerboard” DNA-DNA hybridisation technique for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola. Results: Both treatments resulted in significant improvement in all clinical recordings. Six months after the treatment a statistically significant decrease was observed for Porphyromonas gingivalis in both of groups and Treponema denticola in the control group (P < 0. 05). No inter-group differences were observed (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Both treatment modalities provided comparable clinical and microbiological results in the treatment of chronic periodontitis...|$|R
40|$|Batches of <b>microbiological</b> {{reference}} <b>materials</b> (RMs) {{were prepared}} for performing feasibility certification studies in the European project 'MICROCRM'. Each of the three partners in the project, Institute Pasteur (Lille, Fr), the Public Health Laboratory Services, (Newcastle, UK) and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, (Bilthoven, NL) produced batches of one of three different types of microbiological RMs (pastilles, lenticules or capsules). Four batches of capsule RMs, each containing a different strain, were prepared at the RIVM. Each batch was tested for its homogeneity, long-term stability at storage temperature (- 20 degrees C) and short-term stability at elevated temperatures (5 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 36 degrees C). The batch of capsule RMs containing Escherichia coli was analysed using 2 different culture methods. The batch of RMs containing Enterococcus faecium was analysed using 4 different culture methods. Batches of RMs containing Clostridium perfringens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were each analysed using one culture method. The batch of RMs containing P. aeruginosa showed poor stability at storage temperature (- 20 degrees C), therefore it was decided not to use this batch for the feasibility certification studies. The quality of the three other batches of capsule RMs was sufficient to warrant use in further studies...|$|R
40|$|Intragastric balloon therapy, {{as a part}} of a {{multidisciplinary}} weight management program, is an effective short-term intervention for weight loss. Although the insertion procedure is easy and generally well tolerated by patients, a few complications can occur. We report here a heavy smoker with intragastric balloon insertion complicated by colonization with opportunistic organisms. The 27 -year-old female, body mass index 35. 5 kg/m 2, had a BioEnterics® Intragastric Balloon inserted under conscious sedation without any perioperative complications. Six months later, when the standard removal time arrived, the balloon was seen to be covered with a necrotic white-gray <b>material.</b> <b>Microbiological</b> examination revealed Enterobacter cloacae and Candida species yeast colonies. We recommend that asymptomatic fungal and/or bacterial colonization should be considered among the complications of the intragastric balloon procedure, despite its rarity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Today, most {{approaches}} to caries viewed that catastrophic change in normal plaque biofilm {{is responsible for}} the disease. The behavior and composition of the biofilm are a reflection of the oral environment; the caries is a reflection of adverse changes occurring in that environment. Thus, it is important to identify the pathogenicity of the plaque biofilm so as to predict the caries risk. The recently developed three-tone plaque disclosing agent was used to test its ability in identifying the pathogenicity of plaque. Aim: To assess the efficacy of three-tone plaque disclosing agent in identifying the plaque pathogenicity and correlate with the clinical caries status and <b>microbiological</b> findings. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Sixty children of 6 - 13 years age group of both sexes were clinically examined for caries and plaque scores, and then disclosing agent was applied; the color stained plaque samples were collected and cultured for microbiological assessment, and the data were analyzed based on the caries status of the children. Results: There was {{a significant difference between the}} pathological plaque of caries active and caries free group (P < 0. 05). The pathological plaque scores and the total colony counts, Streptococcus counts and mutans streptococci counts increased with the increase in caries. Conclusion: Three-tone plaque disclosing agent was effective in identifying pathological plaque and can be used as one of the chairside adjuvants in caries risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|Various {{technical}} bottlenecks {{limit the}} production of fibre hemp for textile destinations. The HempSys Project tackled {{most of the problems}} hampering {{the production of}} hemp fibre for textiles in Europe. An innovative production system was researched and developed in which harvesting is carried out at flowering, the stem cut into two portions of approx. 1 m long which are laid on the field in swaths, stem portions kept parallel. Baling and scutching is thereafter carried out with flax machines. The long fibre bundles obtained after scutching are retted with an innovative controlled <b>microbiological</b> process. <b>Materials</b> and Methods. During the project the effect of agrotechnique and biomass processing on fibre yield and quality was assessed at the level of plot trials and laboratory evaluation. In order to validate results at industrial scale large field trials with three plant populations and two harvesting times were set up in Cadriano (BO). Hemp stems cut at 1 meter length and bundled were scutched in a flax plant in Austria. The long fibre bundles obtained were weighed and quality evaluation was carried out. Results and discussion. Pure fibre content analysed at lab level showed a decrease in fibre content from the lower to the upper portions of the stem (58 % of bast fibre was found in the first meter), whil...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of the <b>microbiological</b> situation of <b>materials</b> for food packages are explained. An interaction can occur, even with packaging materials, which do not come into {{direct contact with the}} food. If the packaging material does come into immediate contact with the food, then certain microbiological requirements have to be fulfilled, which are especially high, when {{it is a question of}} highly perishable products. Heating the product in the package has a sterilizing effect on both product and inner surface of the package. In the case of aseptic packing, the product is heat-treated outside the package and put into the sterilized package. This requires that the packaging material used should be rather bacteria-free from the beginning and be sufficiently heat-resistant to the thermal treatment. In the case of radiation treatment, the packaging materials must neither decompose, nor release substances, which can migrate into the product. Examples explain the tasks...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. Basic {{periodontal}} treatment aims at eliminating supra- and sub-gingival plaque {{and establishing}} conditions {{which will allow}} effective self-performed plaque control. This aim is primarily achieved with sonic and ultrasonic scalers. However, generation of bacterial aerosols during these procedures is of great concern to patients, the dentist and the dental assistant. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the reduction in aerosol with and without high-volume evacuator through a <b>microbiological</b> study. <b>Materials</b> and methods. For this clinical study a fumigated closed operatory was selected. Maxillary incisors and canines were selected as an area for scaling. Piezoelectric ultrasonic scaling was performed in the absence and in the presence of a high-volume evacuator at 12 and 20 inches from the patient's oral cavity. In both groups scaling was carried out for 10 minutes. Nutrient agar plates were exposed for a total of 20 minutes. After this procedure, nutrient agar plates were incubated in an incubator at 37 °C for 24 hours. The next day the nutrient agar plates were examined for colony forming units by a single microbiologist. Results. The results showed no statistically significant differences in colony forming units (CFU) with and without the use of a high-volume evacuator either at 12 or 20 inches from the patient’s oral cavity. Conclusion. It was concluded that high-volume evacuator, when used as a separate unit without any modification, is not effective in reducing aerosol counts and environmental contamination...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increased {{knowledge}} of anaerobic {{bacteria in the}} development of periodontal diseases has led to new treatment strategies aiming primarily at suppression or elimination of specific periodontal pathogens. Over the last few decades, green tea has been subjected to many scientific and medical studies. Aim: The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the effect of green tea catechins on the red complex organisms using Polymerase Chain Reaction for <b>microbiological</b> analysis. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: A split mouth study was conducted, in which a total of 20 subjects were included. Green tea catechin as local drug delivery was placed at study sites. Clinical parameters namely probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) were recorded. Sub-gingival plaque samples were collected, and red complex micro-organisms were studied using PCR. Clinical and microbiological parameters were recorded at baseline, 1 st, and 5 th week after treatment. Results: The results showed statistically significant difference in PPD, GI, and PI and significant reduction of red complex organisms from baseline to 1 st week and baseline to 5 th week in both study and control groups (P < 0. 001). Intergroup comparison between study and control group was statistically insignificant for PPD, PI, and GI. A significantly greater reduction in Tannerella forsythus (Tf) at 1 st week and 5 th week and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) at 1 st week was observed in study group when compared to control group. Conclusion: Green tea catechin can be used as an effective local drug delivery along with scaling and root planing in treatment of chronic periodontitis...|$|R
