The sample is stratified into urban and rural strata, with each of these strata further stratified into substrata by governorate. The first stage consisted of selecting the village and shyakhas (urban neighborhoods) to be represented in the sample, which {{was done by the}} principle of probability proportional to size, meaning that some shyakhas or villages could appear more than once if their size warrants it. The selected villages and shyakhas were then subdivided into EAs of approximately 1500 dwelling units each and one or more EA was selected from each.

40|$|Every GIS {{professional}} {{is familiar}} with the notion that location can integrate disparate layers of information. This is no different in Statistics South Africa (Stats SA). The different layers of information benefit both the divisions of Geography and Social Statistics where key national demographic and economic data are gathered. One of the biggest GIS challenges up to date has been the creation of Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) for the current <b>Master</b> <b>Sample</b> frame. These are the national areas where all social surveys collect data from. By using an updated geographical <b>Master</b> <b>Sample</b> frame, current and accurate statistical data are collected from the field. It is returned and processed in a geographically referenced format. A further spin off from this process is that it can contribute to a national dwelling unit frame for South Africa. Linking location to statistics was previously just an attribute, but the situation is changing. Many have begun talk about a “spatial turn”, a new interest in location, and a new "spatial social science " that crosses the traditional boundaries between disciplines. Interest is rising in what possibilities GIS can offer: mapping, spatial analysis, and spatial modellin...|$|E
40|$|For {{evidence-based}} policy making, socio-economic planners need reliable data {{to evaluate}} existing economic policies. While household surveys {{can serve as}} a rich source of socio-economic data, conducting them often entails a great deal of administrative, technical and financial resources. With limited resources for data collection, this often puts pressure on national statistical systems to meet the continuously growing data demand of its stakeholders, especially in developing countries. Using a <b>master</b> <b>sample</b> design {{that can be used to}} select samples for multiple household surveys provides an opportunity to minimize the resources needed to collect household survey data regularly. In particular, using the same sampling design and frame to select samples either for multiple surveys of different content or for different rounds of the same survey could induce significant cost-savings instead of developing an independent design each time a household survey is to be carried out. This paper provides a step-by-step guide for developing a <b>master</b> <b>sample</b> design for household surveys in developing countries. Using Bangladesh as a case study, issues like effective sample allocation to ensure the reliability of domain estimates, stratification measures to reduce design effects and introducing household sample size adjustment when to maintain uniform selection probability within domain are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics is to enable developing countries to build a sound and comprehensive agricultural statistical system, that is sustainable, well integrated in the overall national statistical system and {{that is capable of}} responding to the information needs of the 21 st century. One of the three pillars of the Global Strategy is the integration of agriculture into the national statistical system which is obtained through three methodological tools: (i) an integrated survey framework, that defines the mix and frequency of data collection initiatives needed to meet the predefined data requirements; (ii) an integrated statistical data base, that provides data management system for different data sources (censuses, surveys, administrative data), using common definitions and classifications and ensuring that only one number is agreed as official statistics; (iii) a master sampling frame, that is the basis for selecting the sample of all agriculture-related surveys across the national statistical system, thus allowing coordinated data collections. Little guidance is currently available on buiding a <b>Master</b> <b>Sample</b> Frame for agricultural surveys in different country contexts. The FAO and UNFPA Guidelines for Linking Population and Housing Censuses with Agricultura Censuses aim to fill this gap.
