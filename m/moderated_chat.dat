40|$|BACKGROUND: Overweight, {{obesity and}} excess gestational weight gain (GWG) are {{associated}} with negative health outcomes for mother and child in pregnancy and across the life course. Interventions promoting GWG within guidelines report mixed results. Most are time and cost intensive, which limits scalability. Mobile technologies (mHealth) offer low cost, ready access and individually-tailored support. We aim to test the feasibility of an mHealth intervention promoting healthy nutrition, physical activity and GWG in women who begin pregnancy overweight or obese. METHODS/DESIGN: txt 4 two is a parallel randomised control trial pilot recruiting women with a singleton, live gestation between 10 (+ 0) and 17 (+ 6) weeks at the first hospital antenatal clinic visit. Inclusion criteria are pre-pregnancy BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and mobile phone ownership. One hundred consenting women will be randomised to intervention or control groups at a 1 : 1 ratio. All participants will receive standard antenatal care. In addition, the txt 4 two intervention will be delivered from baseline to 36 weeks gestation and consists of a tailored suite of theoretically-grounded, evidence-based intervention strategies focusing on healthy nutrition, physical activity and GWG. This includes: mobile phone interactive text messages promoting positive health behaviours, goal setting and self-monitoring; video messages; an information website; and a private <b>moderated</b> Facebook® <b>chat</b> forum. The primary outcome is the feasibility of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include GWG and participants 2 ̆ 7 knowledge and behaviour regarding diet and physical activity during pregnancy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{construction}} of social space in Computer Supported Collaborative Learning. The basic assumption of the thesis is that the digital mediation of a learning environment creates communicative barriers, because neither the participants nor the designers or teachers are {{fully aware of the}} demands set by the digital media. It takes knowledge and familiarity with the new media to implement a successful communication in CSCL. We suggest that the difficulties can be met by trying to include a sense of presence, awareness and community and thereby strengthening the informal aspects of communication with the introduction of instant messaging. The basic question is whether chat can alleviate the problems of time/space distanciation, be a tool in the deconstruction of the communicative barriers created by the digital mediation and possibly even bring new qualities to the learning environment. CSCL is a multi-disciplinary field of research, and the circumstances of the learning environment suggest considerations of the technological, pedagogical and communicative aspects. We argue that a larger sociological perspective is useful in order to look at virtual learning forms as a survival strategy in late modernity, when increased complexity demands that the individual continuously acquires new competencies in collaboration with others. We argue that the social processes in learning {{can be seen as a}} special kind of a community of practice (Wenger 2004), and that learning for the individual has cognitive, social and dynamic aspects. By strengthening the informal communication in the community of practice, the learning environment may be enhanced by the increased possibilities of negotiation of experience and interaction. As a means of understanding the consequences of the digital mediation of the learning process, we include the media theoretical approach of John B. Thompson (Slevin 2000, Thompson 2001) and discuss the influence of the three aspects of cultural transmission: the technical medium, the institutional apparatus and time/space distanciation. Our analysis of the consequences of mediation for the community of practice and the social space is based on an actual online learning process, arranged and implemented by us. The course was structured after Gilly Salmon’s model for active online learning (Salmon 2004), supplemented by a IRL kick off meeting and three <b>moderated</b> synchronous <b>chats.</b> Our conclusion on the process is that the participants understand and are motivated by the overall didactic design of the course, but some have initial difficulties with the group chat format. Over the three chats the communicative competence increases. The moderator on our orders strengthens his control, but is actually less and less needed, while the participants take charge of the virtual space. In spite of the difficulties with the chat format the majority of the group stays active and engaged and participate in the chats. While not expressing much enthusiasm about the chat format in the actual chats, they say in later interviews that the chats have had an importance in creating a social feeling, a sense of community and a common tone. Thus, our conclusion is, that chat is a possible tool is CSCL and can to a certain point create a feeling of togetherness through time and space...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates {{higher order}} perception, cognition, and individual-cultural {{differences}} under which <b>moderated</b> <b>chat</b> rooms may provide an effective alternative for students reviewing {{business information system}} course material in preparation for examination.

This study continues previous research (McNeese, et. al., 2002) that indicated problem solving and constructivist learning are socially constructed, situated in practice and context specific. The premise of this paper is that with proper design a cognitive task, such as students reviewing for exams, can be effectively supported even within the possible constraints of simple chat rooms. A potential benefit to students, based on previous research, is that groupware such as chat rooms can provide a constructivist learning environment and an equality of participation in group discussions (Benbasat and Lim 1993).

40|$|Background The leading {{causes of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality for people in high-income countries living with HIV are now non-AIDS malignancies, cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases associated with ageing. This protocol describes the trial of HealthMap, a model of care for people with HIV (PWHIV) that includes use of an interactive shared health record and self-management support. The aims of the HealthMap trial are to evaluate engagement of PWHIV and healthcare providers with the model, and its effectiveness for reducing coronary heart disease risk, enhancing self-management, and improving mental health and quality of life of PWHIV. Methods/Design The study is a two-arm cluster randomised trial involving HIV clinical sites in several states in Australia. Doctors will be randomised to the HealthMap model (immediate arm) or to proceed with usual care (deferred arm). People with HIV whose doctors are randomised to the immediate arm receive 1) new opportunities to discuss their health status and goals with their HIV doctor using a HealthMap shared health record; 2) access to their own health record from home; 3) access to health coaching delivered by telephone and online; and 4) access to a peer <b>moderated</b> online group <b>chat</b> programme. Data will be collected from participating PWHIV (n[*]=[*] 710) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months and from participating doctors (n[*]=[*] 60) at baseline and 12 months. The control arm will be offered the HealthMap intervention {{at the end of the}} trial. The primary study outcomes, measured at 12 months, are 1) 10 -year risk of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death as estimated by a Framingham Heart Study risk equation; and 2) Positive and Active Engagement in Life Scale from the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ). Discussion The study will determine the viability and utility of a novel technology-supported model of care for maintaining the health and wellbeing of people with HIV. If shown to be effective, the HealthMap model may provide a generalisable, scalable and sustainable system for supporting the care needs of people with HIV, addressing issues of equity of access.

40|$|Eating {{disorders}} are often characterized by multiple illness episodes and chronic courses. Despite well established and effective treatment options, {{a considerable number}} of patients fail to respond to these treatments or drop-out prematurely. Even after successful treatment, patients experience a high risk of relapse that is particularly pronounced in the first months following treatment termination. Maintenance of treatment gains and promotion of continued recovery is highly relevant to improve outcome and ultimately reduce the burden of illness. Interventions based on new technologies have the potential to extend the reach of treatment providers and to provide such maintenance support at reasonable cost and effort. Acknowledging the widespread use of communication technologies in today’s world and the increasing evidence to support the potential of e-health interventions in prevention, self-help, treatment and maintenance treatment of patients with eating disorders, the three studies presented in this dissertation were concerned with developing and evaluating an Internet-based support program as a step-down strategy for patients with bulimic symptomatology following discharge from treatment. Thus far, no study has addressed patients with BN and related EDNOS using the Internet at post-treatment. The program was developed within a European collaboration and followed an individually tailored intervention strategy which incorporated several modules of differing intensity. In the first study, the feasibility of the program was investigated among 22 participants who utilized the online program for four months. The results indicated the viability of an individually tailored intervention strategy in a heterogeneous sample with high satisfaction and acceptance ratings. In the second study, the efficacy of the intervention in maintaining and/or enhancing treatment gains was studied among 105 women who had received treatment for an eating disorder with bulimic symptomatology in routine care against a wait-list TAU control condition. It was hypothesized that intervention group participants would improve more compared to the control group participants {{at the end of the}} four-month intervention period on eating disorder related outcomes. In addition, the feasibility of the program was investigated within a larger sample. The program proved feasible and well-accepted. In tendency, participants of the aftercare intervention showed better results on all outcome measures, but the efficacy could not be demonstrated. Further research and larger trials are needed to determine the optimum intensity and duration of the intervention as well as patient characteristics associated with outcome. The third study was concerned with the text analyses of the <b>moderated</b> group <b>chat</b> sessions of the program to study relevant online themes of the chat interactions following treatment termination. In addition, the linguistic predictors of eating disorder related and general psychological well-being were investigated. The results indicate that using a higher ratio of words related to family of origin was significantly associated with improvements in eating disorder related attitudes, emotional distress, and a reduction in the frequency of binge eating episodes. This is the first study to show the importance of family level variables through sufferers’ own words after the end of treatment and may speak to the use of family-based treatment beyond treatment termination. In sum, the Internet-based intervention to address patients with bulimic symptomatology after discharge was feasible, well-accepted and associated with accelerated improvements on eating disorder related attitudes and general psychological well-being compared to a TAU condition although its efficacy could not be demonstrated in terms of statistical significance. A higher ratio of using family of origin words emerged as a linguistic predictor of improvement. Overall, the three studies discussed here add to the limited knowledge in the field of technology-enhanced interventions for eating disorders and may stimulate further research activities. ...|$|R
