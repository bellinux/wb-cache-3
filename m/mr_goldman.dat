40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 6) This item {{contains a}} copy of the original playbill. The purpose of this thesis production was to provide a theatrical experience that would be dramatically meaningful and aesthetically rewarding to San Fernando Valley State College audiences while posing {{at the same time a}} challenge in depth to student directors, actors and technicians. Lion in Winter, by James Goldman, is a comedy-drama of the genre referred to as "theatre of fact. ??? It takes the audience back in time to 1183 A. D. Henry II, the first Plantagenet King of England, has convened a Christmas court at his castle in Chinon, France. President in answer to his summons are his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, their sons Richard, Geoffrey and John, young King Philip of France, and his sister, Princess Alais. The story is concerned with the problems arising from King Henry's decision to name an heir to the English throne. The consequent conniving and maneuvering that takes place provides much of the action of the plot. The dialogue is witty, pungent, and often caustic, with moments of high humor, terrible cruelty, and deep emotion. Comic elements are frequently placed in direct juxtaposition with tragic elements, each strengthening and enhancing the other, yet the script is a tightly knit, beautifully cadenced poetic unit. The result is so powerful as to hold an audience riveted in involved attention. Moreover, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Goldman</b> has created in his characters seven unique, individual human beings, each one a very real challenge for the student actor to explore in depth. The theme of The Lion in Winter revolves around the idea of the continuity of life. Those who rise to the challenges of life despite its pain and suffering, man's inhumanity to man, and the obstacles and frustrations one encounters as he makes his way through life find their reward in the excitement of the challenge itself and in the knowledge that they have taken their world in their hands and shaped it as best they could for future generations. Very often, marital partners find that their efforts in shaping their world have separated them to such an extent that they cannot bridge the gap that has grown between them, that the remnants of a once great love can no longer exert the strength necessary to bring them back together. Such was the situation for Henry II and his Eleanor...|$|E
40|$|The Project Manager {{is one of}} the key {{individuals}} that can determine the success or failure of a project. NASA is fully committed to the training and development of Project Managers across the agency to ensure that highly capable individuals are equipped with the competencies and experience to successfully lead a project. An equally critical position is that of the Project Scientist. The Project Scientist provides the scientific leadership necessary for the scientific success of a project by insuring that the mission meets or exceeds the scientific requirements. Traditionally, NASA Goddard project scientists were appointed and approved by the Center Science Director based on their knowledge, experience, and other qualifications. However the process to obtain the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities was not documented or done in a systematic way. NASA Goddard's current Science Director, Nicholas White saw the need to create a pipeline for developing new projects scientists, and appointed a team to develop a process for training potential project scientists. The team members were Dr. Harley Thronson, Chair, Dr. Howard Kea, <b>Mr.</b> Mark <b>Goldman,</b> DACUM facilitator and the late Dr. Michael VanSteenberg. The DACUM process, an occupational analysis and evaluation system, was used to produce a picture of the project scientist's duties, tasks, knowledge, and skills.

5000|$|Goldman {{described}} the casting process as [...] "exciting, fun, and sometimes strange". He stated that {{focusing on the}} characteristics of each character, the voices, and acting abilities were crucial, saying that using voices that added to a movie's texture was part of the team's philosophy {{in the development of a}} film. Goldman found the strangest casting decision to be Dom DeLuise for Jeremy the Crow, which Goldman, Bluth, and Pomeroy had considered after they watched the 1978 film The End. Elizabeth Hartman was cast as <b>Mrs.</b> Brisby, with <b>Goldman</b> calling her performance in A Patch of Blue [...] "so believable and sincere that we all felt that she was right for the part." [...] Pomeroy suggested Derek Jacobi, who starred in the 1976 miniseries I Claudius, to play the part of Nicodemus. Peter Strauss, whom the team previously saw in another miniseries from 1976, Rich Man, Poor Man, was cast as Justin. Paul Shenar was assigned to play Jenner; the staff liked his [...] "dark, powerful voice".
