5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow.

5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, {{an increase in}} the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric <b>moisture</b> <b>content.</b> Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Soils and the {{underlying}} permafrost from undisturbed sites and sites that had been disturbed by construction activities at Marble Point and Pram Point in the McMurdo Sound regionwere sampled from excavated pits and drill cores. Gravimetric <b>moisture</b> (ice) <b>contents</b> and particle size distribution were determined. Volumetric <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were calculated from these results. At undisturbed sites soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> within the active layer (to c. 60 rm depth) were low and ranged from 0. 5 % by weight at the soil surface to 10 % above the permafrost. The permafrost was generally completely saturated with ice, but sometimes contained considerable excess ice, with ice contents rising as high as 80 % by volume. At disturbed sites, soil <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> within the active layer {{were similar to those}} of the undisturbed sites (generally ~ 1 0 % by weight) but within the permafrost, <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> were lower and less variable than in the undisturbed sites, rarely exceeding 20 % by weight. The release of considerable quantities of water from the permafrost as a result of land disturbance during construction activities caused stream flows, soil shrinkage, land slumping and salinisation, resulting in significant permanent environmental damage. At Marble Point there has been no significant re-establishment of icy permafrost in the disturbed soils in the 30 years since land disturbance occurred...|$|R
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through {{ground based}} and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first {{determine whether a}} fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning {{and the amount of}} fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale, {{transient}} supercells {{embedded within}} the outer bands {{of the hurricane}} produced numerous tornadoes throughout its path. Unlike supercells over the Great Plains, these storms last {{no more than a}} few hours and are often training. Most of the tornadoes occurred in the hurricane's right-front quadrant, where strong low-level wind shear, high <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> and low convective available potential energy combined to produce locally favorable tornadic conditions. A study in 2008 conducted through the American Geophysical Union found that the majority of Katrina-related supercells developed inland over the Gulf Coast rather than offshore, a finding contrary to multiple studies of prior tropical cyclones.|$|E

30|$|Radial {{variation}} in the 137 Cs concentration in each group is shown in Fig.  3. Gray, black, and white columns indicate total number, HMC and LMC groups. 137 Cs concentration ratios in the H 1 –H 3 positions in HMC group were lower (22 %) {{than those in the}} LMC group (74 %). These results suggested that Japanese cedar trees with higher heartwood <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> tended to accumulate more 137 Cs in the heartwood than trees with lower heartwood <b>moisture</b> <b>contents.</b> When rubidium (Rb), an alkali metal in the same group as K and Cs, was injected into the stem of several Japanese cedar cultivars with different heartwood <b>moisture</b> <b>contents,</b> Rb and K concentrations in the heartwood were higher in cultivars with higher heartwood <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> than in those with lower heartwood <b>moisture</b> <b>contents</b> [22]. Our results for 137 Cs and K are similar to those reported by Okada et al. [22]. Okada et al. [21] reported that the concentration of Cs and other alkali metals in Japanese cedar heartwood remained nearly constant along the radial direction. However, in the present study, the radial {{variation in}} 137 Cs concentration differed from that of K content (Fig.  2). Katayama et al. [2] examined radial variations of 137 Cs and 40 K concentrations in Japanese cedar by analysis of 115 annual rings harvested in 1979. They found that 137 Cs was detected in annual rings formed before 1945, suggesting that 137 Cs might move within the stem wood. A similar result was obtained by Kudo et al. [3].|$|R

5|$|The crystalline-solid {{structure}} of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor. However, once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture (e.g., fog, mist, light rain, etc.), the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive. A recent study {{has shown that the}} electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with (1) increasing <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> (2) increasing soluble salt content, and (3) increasing compaction (bulk density). The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems.|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|Luminosity {{has been}} {{reported}} in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric variables such as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.|$|E

5|$|On August14, 2015, a {{well-defined}} tropical wave, accompanied by significant surface pressure falls, traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening. A broad surface low developed along the wave on August15. Embedded within monsoon flow, various environmental factors enabled gradual {{development of the}} disturbance, including low wind shear, above-average sea surface temperatures, moderate <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> and favorable diffluence. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west-northwest throughout its entire existence. On August17, the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent. It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression—the fourth of the 2015season—at 06:00UTC on August18. At this time, it was situated about 825mi (1,325km) west-southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|During June1966, low {{atmospheric}} pressure {{stretched across the}} western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexicoa pattern that is conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. During {{the first few days}} of the month, a dissipating trough extended from the southeastern United States into the western Caribbean. A mid-level circulation developed along the trough near Cabo Gracias a Dios on June3. By the next day, the circulation had reached the surface, which marked the development of a tropical depression over eastern Nicaragua. On June 5, the depression crossed Honduras and emerged into the western Caribbean, moving north-northeastward through an area of warm sea surface temperatures. It had a good cyclonic circulation, convection, and <b>moisture</b> <b>content,</b> but most significantly, a passing trough to the north provided the depression with favorable outflow. On June 6, the depression rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm and later Hurricane Alma. This made it the earliest hurricane in the basin since Hurricane Able in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a <b>moisture</b> <b>content</b> of 50-to-52 {{percent and}} a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A study {{published}} in the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
