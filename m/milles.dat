5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named <b>Milles,</b> {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. <b>Milles</b> set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part of it as a stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the modern}} {{classical}} became either more decorative/art deco (Paul Manship, Jose de Creeft, Carl <b>Milles)</b> or more abstractly stylized or more expressive (and Gothic) (Anton Hanak, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Ernst Barlach, Arturo Martini)—or turned more to the Renaissance (Giacomo Manzù, Venanzo Crocetti) or stayed the same (Charles Despiau, Marcel Gimond).|$|E
25|$|Charles <b>Milles</b> Manson (born Charles <b>Milles</b> Maddox, November 12, 1934) is an American convicted {{mass murderer}} and former cult leader who led {{what became known}} as the Manson Family, a quasi-commune that arose in California in the late 1960s. Manson's {{followers}} committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971 he was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people – most notably of the actress Sharon Tate – all of which were carried out by members of the group at his instruction. Manson also received first-degree murder convictions for two other deaths. Manson was originally sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when California invalidated the state's death penalty statute in 1972. He is currently serving multiple life sentences at California State Prison in Corcoran.|$|E

50|$|Third group {{forming the}} <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indians were the <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band of Mississippi Chippewa, a band {{associated}} with the powerful Mississippi Chippewa. <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band of Mississippi Chippewa lived primarily along Nokasippi River, Cedar River and Ripple River (all located north and northwest of <b>Mille</b> Lacs Lake), the portage ways connecting these three rivers to <b>Mille</b> Lacs Lake, and along the northwestern and northern shores of <b>Mille</b> Lacs Lake.|$|R

Despite a number of later changes, Tessin's architecture still dominates the Orangery, which houses parts of the National Museum's sculpture collection, including works by the sculptors Johan Tobias Sergel, Carl <b>Milles</b> and Johan Niclas Byström. In 2005 the Orangery inspired the design of the music pavilion at Stålboga.|$|E
25|$|Three Irish artists Jerome Connor, Albert Power and Oliver Sheppard were chosen, {{and also}} the foreign artists Paul Manship (American), Percy Metcalfe (English) Carl <b>Milles</b> (Swedish) and Publio Morbiducci (Italian); {{a number of other}} artists were invited but did not take part. Each artist was paid and allowed to produce designs in plaster or metal, with a prize for the winner. Identifying marks were removed from the designs so the {{committee}} did not know whose designs were being judged. Percy Metcalfe's designs were chosen and design modifications were added with assistance from civil servants at the Department of Agriculture.|$|E
5000|$|When the White Earth Indian Reservation was established, {{like the}} rest of the Mississippi Chippewa, the <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indians were also {{encouraged}} to relocate. Many <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indians became homeless so under , homesteading and cemetery lands were secured for the <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indians. After the signing of the [...] "An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota" [...] (51st-1st-Ex.Doc.247) and a removal bill in May 27, 1902, many <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indians did remove themselves to the White Earth Inidan Reserveration, becoming the Removable <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band. Others remained on the <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indian Reservation, becoming the Non-removable <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band. Within few years, many of the Removable <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band left White Earth and returned to <b>Mille</b> Lacs, splitting the group onto two separate Indian Reservations.|$|R

25|$|Besides the {{political}} prisoners already detained there, Gurs was {{then used to}} intern foreign Jews, stateless persons, Romani, homosexuals, and prostitutes. Vichy opened its first internment camp in the northern zone on 5 October 1940, in Aincourt, in the Seine-et-Oise department, which it quickly filled with PCF members. The Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, in the Doubs, was used to intern Romani. The Camp des <b>Milles,</b> near Aix-en-Provence, was the largest internment camp in the Southeast of France; twenty-five hundred Jews were deported from there following the August 1942 raids. Exiled Republican, antifascist Spaniards who had sought refuge in France after the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War were then deported, and 5,000 of them died in Mauthausen concentration camp. In contrast, French colonial soldiers were interned by the Germans in French territory instead of being deported.|$|E
25|$|The French police, {{headed by}} Bousquet, arrested 7,000 Jews in the {{southern}} zone in August 1942. 2,500 of them transited through the Camp des <b>Milles</b> near Aix-en-Provence before joining Drancy. Then, on 22, 23 and 24 January 1943, assisted by Bousquet's police force, the Germans organized a raid in Marseilles. During the Battle of Marseilles, the French police checked the identity documents of 40,000 people, and the operation succeeded in sending 2,000 Marseillese people in the death trains, leading to the extermination camps. The operation also encompassed the expulsion of an entire neighborhood (30,000 persons) in the Old Port before its destruction. For this occasion, SS-Gruppenführer Karl Oberg, {{in charge of the}} German Police in France, made the trip from Paris, and transmitted to Bousquet orders directly received from Heinrich Himmler. It is another notable case of the French police's willful collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E

In 1858, the 12 townships forming the contemporary southern 10 townships of <b>Mille</b> Lacs County and the 2 northwestern townships in Isanti County were organized apart from either Benton or <b>Mille</b> Lacs County to form Monroe County, leaving the northern [...] "Square Top-knot" [...] as the <b>Mille</b> Lacs County. In 1860, Monroe and <b>Mille</b> Lacs Counties merged. Shortly thereafter, the two southeastern townships were transferred to Isanti County, forming the contemporary boundaries for the county.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mille</b> Lacs Indian Reservation is {{the popular}} {{name for the}} land-base for the <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band of Ojibwe in Central Minnesota, about 100 miles (160 km) north of Minneapolis-St. Paul. The {{contemporary}} <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band reservation has significant land holdings in <b>Mille</b> Lacs, Pine, Aitkin and Crow Wing counties, {{as well as other}} land holdings in Kanabec, Morrison, and Otter Tail Counties. <b>Mille</b> Lacs Indian Reservation is also the name of a formal Indian reservation established in 1855. It is one of the two formal reservations on which the contemporary <b>Mille</b> Lacs Band retains land holdings. The contemporary <b>Mille</b> Lacs band includes several aboriginal Ojibwe bands and villages, whose members reside in communities throughout central Minnesota.|$|R

500|$|While {{studying}} physics, Littleton {{also took}} sculpture classes with Avard Fairbanks at [...] Michigan, [...] which fueled his growing preference for art. After three semesters of physics, {{the pull of}} art proved stronger than his respect for his father's wishes, and, with sister Martha’s encouragement he arranged to study at Cranbrook Academy of Art for the 1941 spring semester. There he studied metalwork with Harry Bertoia and sculpture with Marshall Fredericks, and worked part-time as a studio assistant to the aging Carl <b>Milles.</b> Dr. Littleton was not pleased by his son's decision. Littleton enlisted Martha's aid in arriving at a compromise: [...] Littleton {{would return to the}} University of Michigan that fall, to major in industrial design.
