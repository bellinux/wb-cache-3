40|$|The {{inclusion}} of Internet Gaming Disorder as a preliminary diagnosis subsumed in Section III {{of the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- 5) has provoked mixed reactions. On the one hand, it has been appreciated as an important sign stressing the negative health-related impact of that disorder. Likewise, the definition of diagnostic criteria helps scientists and clinicians to refer to <b>mandatory</b> <b>indicators</b> associated with a health problem. On the other hand, it has been objected that this new diagnosis bears the danger of pathologizing normal behaviors that are a feature of healthy recreational activity for many people. However, the existence of diagnostic criteria is meant to avoid this danger. This emphasizes the necessity {{of being able to}} refer to as accurate defined criteria as possible. In its current version, the DSM criteria display not only strengths but also ambiguities. Both types will be discussed and necessary ideas to resolve those ambiguities will be presented for further research...|$|E

This paper {{argues that}} the most powerful, durable and {{effective}} agents of educational change are not the policy makers, the curriculum developers or even the education authorities themselves; they are the teachers. It further contends {{that the quality of}} the educational changes that teachers have the skills and opportunities to effect will only be as reliable and proficient as the teachers’ individual capacities for reflective practice and the development of self knowledge. These aspects of teacher development have, historically, been largely overlooked in the preparation and promotion of effective teachers. The emphasis has been more explicitly focused on the development and demonstration of teachers’ understanding of content knowledge and the associated pedagogies and in their capacities to understand their students as individual constructors of knowledge in diverse social contexts. Whilst the former teacher characteristics have traditionally been valued as desirable or even <b>mandatory</b> <b>indicators</b> of teacher quality, the latter are heavily impacted upon by the individual pedagogue's values, attitudes and notions of {{what it is to be}} a professional practitioner. In order for teachers to be effective in the Information Age, they need to recognize more than just their students’ background and learning preferences. They need to be able to take effective, positive action in the classroom context to improve the educational outcomes for their students. In order to do this they must have the willingness and cognitive capacities to recognize ethical dilemmas and examine their own perspectives on the issues they face critically and analytically. This requires regular, authentic reflection. The reflective process in which one teacher engaged as part of his role in a research study is documented [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Cities are {{responsible}} for the depletion of natural resources and agricultural lands, and 70 % of global CO 2 emissions. There are significant risks to cities from the impacts of climate change in addition to existing vulnerabilities, primarily because of rapid urbanization. Urban design and development are generally considered as the instrument to shape the future of the city and they determine the pattern of a city's resource usage and resilience to change, from climate or otherwise. Cities are inherently dynamic and require the participation and engagement of their diverse stakeholders for the effective management of change, which enables wider stakeholder involvement and buy-in at various stages of the development process. Sustainability assessment of urban design and development is increasingly being seen as indispensable for informed decision-making. A sustainability assessment tool also acts as a driver for the uptake of sustainable pathways by recognizing excellence through their rating system and by creating a market demand for sustainable products and processes. This research reviews six widely used sustainability assessment tools for urban design and development: BREEAM Communities, LEED-ND, CASBEE-UD, SBToolPT–UP, Pearl Community Rating System (PCRS) and GSAS/QSAS, to identify, compare and contrast the aim, structure, assessment methodology, scoring, weighting and suitability for application in different geographical contexts. Strengths and weaknesses of each tool are critically discussed. The study highlights the disparity in local and international contexts for global sustainability assessment tools. Despite their similarities in aim on environmental aspects, differences exist in the relative importance and share of mandatory vs optional indicators in both environmental and social dimensions. PCRS and GSAS/QSAS are new incarnations, but have widely varying shares of <b>mandatory</b> <b>indicators,</b> at 45. 4 % and 11. 36 % respectively, compared to 30 % in BREEAM Community. Considerations of economic and cultural aspects are only marginal in the reviewed sustainability assessment tools. However, the newly developed sustainability assessment tools such as GSAS/QSAS and PCRS diverge from their predecessors in their consideration of cultural aspects...|$|E

40|$|Culture {{methods for}} the {{detection}} of indicator bacteria are currently used for detection of waterborne bacteria. The need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a DNA microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. This DNA microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all <b>mandatory</b> <b>indicator</b> microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. The validation per-formed with DNA extracted from pure microbial cul-tures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. To overcome the high di-lution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial contaminants retained after filtering 100 ml of water, or a 10 -fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. The analysis of complex environ-mental water samples using culture methods and the DNA microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the DNA microarray. The results show that this DNA microarray may be a useful tool for water micro-biological surveillance...|$|R

Developing {{bilateral}} power {{trade with}} surrounding regions {{is not only}} in favor of improving economic benefit of units in Shanghai grid, but also contributing to the economic development and power distribution safety of Shanghai and surrounding regions. In this paper, considering the situation of indicator control of environmental capacity in key area on power generation enterprises, completion situation of pollution control in generation enterprises, bilateral trade model and evaluation method under the constraints of <b>mandatory</b> environmental <b>indicators</b> are analyzed. Furthermore, solution on achieving clean electricity generation of bilateral trade power {{in the city of}} Shanghai is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} radical {{economic}} reform envisages {{the introduction of}} economic norms into practice in place of <b>mandatory</b> volume <b>indicators</b> {{as one of its}} most important directions. However, scientific study of the problem yields more and more arguments in favor the need to develop a system of norms in the system of taxation already during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan. Demands for unity and stability have been made on economic norms from the very beginning, since individualization makes them indistinguishable from the previous volume address targets. But {{what is the difference between}} taxes and economic norms, and why must the transition be made to a tax system?...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{investigate}} the procedure for regulatory impact analysis and identify problems caused by the adoption of ineffective normative legal acts. The essence of the concept “regulatory impact analysis” and its main tasks are considered. The legislation {{in the field of}} RIA is studied, and the contradictions in terms of determining the number of stages of analysis and the timing of the baseline performance monitoring revealed. There made conclusions regarding the unsatisfactory quality of the developed RIAs and presence of violations of legislation requirements by regulatory bodies, mandatory promulgation of the draft normative legal act along with the analysis. There identified the most problematic stages of RIA for the developers, which include identification of <b>mandatory</b> performance <b>indicators,</b> evaluation of compliance with the requirements of the regulatory act and definition of the problem. It is suggested to improve the methodology for regulatory impact analysis by completing the list of its main stages with evaluation of quality and adjustment of RIA. Recommendations for eliminating contradictions in the legislation in the field of RIA are developed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{emphasis}} {{on the use of}} indicators for performance measurement and management in the transport sector. In the UK all local authorities are now required to set out five year programmes with commitments on progress on a range of <b>mandatory</b> and voluntary <b>indicators</b> linked to a series of key policy outcomes. Increasingly the financial settlements that they receive from central government will be related to their performance against these targets. Different types of information are needed to fulfil different roles in the decision-making process. Research in the UK has indicated that there are too many indicators and yet too little clarity about what is being collected and reported on, at what level and why. This paper reports on a study examining the use of indicators in 16 local and regional authorities in the UK. Results from a questionnaire and a series of follow-up interviews are combined with the findings of a desk-top review of performance management in the public sector to propose a more logical and connected process for developing a suite of indicators that both supports strategy development and monitoring. The results suggest that the current indicator sets are not broad enough to ensure that the strategies proposed are consistent with sustainable transport goals. The lack of a comprehensive framework also increases the risk of negative impacts from monitoring programmes such as measure fixation and myopia. The more comprehensive approach proposed seeks to bring together the aspirations of strategy with the realities of measurement...|$|R
