A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its <b>magnetic</b> <b>declination</b> {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E

He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.|$|E
5|$|When the Song {{capital was}} removed far south to Hangzhou, massive {{numbers of people}} came from the north. Unlike the flat plains of the north, the mountainous terrain riddled with lakes and rivers in {{southern}} China is largely a hindrance and inhospitable to widespread agriculture. Therefore, the Southern Song took on a unique maritime presence that was largely unseen in earlier dynasties, grown out {{of the need to}} secure importation of foreign resources. Commercial cities (located along the coast and by internal rivers), backed by patronage of the state, dramatically increased shipbuilding activity (funding harbor improvements, warehouse construction, and navigation beacons). Navigation at sea was made easier by the invention of the compass and Shen Kuo's treatise of the 11th century on the concept of true north (with <b>magnetic</b> <b>declination</b> towards the North Pole). With military defense and economic policy in mind, the Southern Song established China's first standing navy. China had a long naval history before that point (example, Battle of Chibi in 208), and even during the Northern Song era there were concerns with naval matters, as seen in examples such as the Chinese official Huang Huaixin of the Xining Reign (1068–1077) outlining a plan of employing a drydock for repair of 'imperial dragon boats' (see Science and technology of the Song dynasty). Already during the Northern Song, the Chinese had established fortified trade bases in the Philippines, a noted interest of the court to expand China's military power and economic influence abroad. Provincial armies in the Northern Song era also maintained naval river units. However, it was the Southern Song court that was the first to create a large, permanent standing naval institution for China in 1132. The new headquarters of the Southern Song Chinese admiralty was based at Dinghai, the office labeled as the Yanhai Zhizhi Shisi (Imperial Commissariat for the Control and Organization of Coastal Areas). Even as far back as 1129 officials proposed ambitious plans to conquer Korea with a new navy and use Korea as a base for launching invasions into Jin territory, but this scheme was never achieved and was of secondary importance to maintaining defense along the fluctuating border with Jin.|$|E

25|$|Mariners are {{concerned}} about very accurate measurements; however, casual users need not be concerned with differences between magnetic and true North. Except in areas of extreme <b>magnetic</b> <b>declination</b> variance (20 degrees or more), this is enough to protect from walking in a substantially different direction than expected over short distances, provided the terrain is fairly flat and visibility is not impaired. By carefully recording distances (time or paces) and magnetic bearings traveled, one can plot a course and return to one's starting point using the compass alone.|$|E

40|$|Latitude {{profiles}} of the ion and electron temperatures and total ion concentration across the equatorial region near 800 km altitude are routinely obtained from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft. We have examined these profiles at 2100 hours local time to discover the influences of field-aligned plasma transport induced by F region neutral winds. Such dependencies are readily seen by contrasting observations at different seasons and different longitudes distinguished by different <b>magnetic</b> <b>declinations.</b> These data show strong evidence for adiabatic heating produced by interhemispheric plasma transport. This heating manifests itself as a local temperature maximum that appears in the winter hemisphere during the solstices and is generally absent during equinox. A longitudinal variation in the appearance of this maximum {{is consistent with the}} roles of meridional and zonal winds in modulating the field-aligned plasma velocities. The data also show a local temperature minimum near the dip equator. However, it is not so easy to attribute this minimum to adiabatic cooling since transport of plasma from below and the latitude variation in the flux tube content may also produce such a minimum...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the large}} shift, {{the change in}} {{direction}} was never recorded by <b>magnetic</b> <b>declinations,</b> fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a continental collision have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend in the chain. To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|R

Allegedly the crew grew so homesick and fearful that they threatened to sail back to Spain. Columbus reasoned that the needle did not point to the North Star, but to some invisible point on the Earth. His reputation as an astronomer held weight with the crew, and his theory alleviated their alarm.

40|$|Magnetic storms {{result from}} the dynamic {{interaction}} of the solar wind with the coupled magnetospheric- ionospheric system. Large storms represent a potential hazard for the ac-tivities and infrastructure of a modern, technologically based society [Baker et al., 2008]; they can cause the loss of radio communications, reduce the accuracy of global positioning systems, damage satellite electronics and affect satellite opera-tions, increase pipeline corrosion, and induce voltage surges in electric power grids, causing blackouts. So while space weather starts with the Sun and {{is driven by the}} solar wind, it is on, or just above, the surface of the Earth that the practical effects of space weather are realized. Therefore, ground-based sensor networks, includ-ing magnetic observatories [Love, 2008], play an impor-tant role in space weather monitoring. A Colorful History In the early nineteenth century the German ge-ographer Alexander von Humboldt, while measuring <b>magnetic</b> <b>declinations</b> at his Berlin observatory, noticed that the field occasionally exhibited “magnetic storms,” or periods of rapid, irregular variation that sometimes persisted for several days. A scientific curiosity, magnetic storms were considered to be a nuisance for making global- scale maps of the geomagnetic field needed for compass- based navigation. To better understand storms, to support global mapping efforts, and to improve fundamen-tal understanding of the geomagnetic field, C.  F. Gauss and W. E. Weber organized the first campaign for coordinated magnetic field monitoring (1836 – 1841) with direct visual measurements made simultaneously around the world at predetermined times. The United States participated in this “Magnetischer Verein ” (“magnetic society”) with observa...|$|R
30|$|Since {{the dawn}} of archeomagnetic research, data {{obtained}} in Europe from archeological artifacts and volcanic deposits were used to build regional-scale geomagnetic directional secular variation curves (e.g., Chevalier 1925; Aitken and Hawley 1966; Tanguy 1969; Thellier 1966, 1981). An issue rapidly arose regarding the continuity between archeo-/paleomagnetic results and the most ancient instrumental or “direct” measurements of declinations (D) and inclinations (I). In Western Europe, <b>magnetic</b> <b>declinations</b> have been directly measured {{since the middle of}} the sixteenth century, whereas only {{a very small number of}} inclination data became available more than a century later (e.g., Jackson et al. 2000; Jonkers et al. 2003). These series of pioneering D and I measurements from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially those obtained in London and in Paris, were the subject of several compilations (e.g., Malin and Bullard 1981; Alexandrescu et al. 1996, 1997). Comprehensive datasets further incorporating measurements reported in ship logbooks by mariners during their navigation around the world have been used to construct global geomagnetic field models encompassing the past four centuries, in the form of Gauss coefficient time series. At present, the gufm 1 model developed by Jackson et al. (2000) is used most frequently. It enabled, in particular, studies to decipher the evolution of the main core flow patterns at the core surface (e.g., Hulot et al. 2002; Holme 2007; Finlay et al. 2016). Note that the first examples of global reconstruction of the ancient field date back to the nineteenth century; one can, for instance, mention the work of the Swedish scholar Carlheim-Gillensköld (1896), whose computations went back to the sixteenth century. More recently, a regional field model was also constructed for Europe using a spherical cap harmonic (SCHA) analysis technique incorporating both archeomagnetic and historical geomagnetic data (Pavón-Carrasco et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|The {{recovered}} {{time series}} data were first processed for quality control. Abnormal fluctuations, such as spikes and rectangular steps in raw time series data, were detected by eye through comparing different field components, and spikes were then linearly interpolated and steps were shifted to reduce discontinuity. The instrumental clock was compared with {{coordinated universal time}} (UTC) via global positioning system (GPS) just before deployment and after retrieval. The detected clock shift was corrected, {{based on the assumption}} that the shift accumulated linearly over time. For the OBEMs, the coordinate system was adjusted to a geographical one; the instrumental tilt was corrected using tilt angle data through Euler rotation, and the horizontal coordinate system was then rotated using the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>declination</b> predicted from the international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF) (IAGA Working Group V-MOD 2010). Coordinate system conversion was not applied to the EFOS data because the EFOSs measured only one component of the electric field.|$|R

By doing so, Shen fixed the outdated position of the pole star, which had shifted over the centuries since the time Zu Geng (fl. 5th century) had plotted it; {{this was due to}} the precession of the Earth's rotational axis. When making the first known experiments with a magnetic compass, Shen Kuo wrote that the needle always pointed slightly east rather than due south, an angle he measured which is now known as <b>magnetic</b> <b>declination,</b> and wrote that the compass needle in fact pointed towards the magnetic north pole instead of true north (indicated by the current pole star); this was a critical step in the history of accurate navigation with a compass.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>declination</b> of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E

Shen is famous for discovering the concept of true north and <b>magnetic</b> <b>declination</b> towards the North Pole by calculating a more accurate measurement of the astronomical meridian, and fixed the calculated position of the pole star that had shifted over the centuries. This allowed sailors to navigate the seas more accurately with the magnetic needle compass, also first described by Shen. [...] Shen was made famous for his written description of Bi Sheng, the inventor of movable type printing. Shen was also interested in geology, as he formulated a theory of geomorphology and climate change over time after making observations of strange natural phenomena. Using contemporary knowledge of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses, he theorized that the sun and moon were spherical in shape, not flat, while expanding upon the reasoning of earlier Chinese astronomical theorists. Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen used cosmological hypotheses when describing the variations of planetary motion, including retrogradation. One of Shen's greatest achievements, aided by Wei Pu, was correcting the lunar error by diligently recording and plotting the moon's orbital path three times a night {{over a period of}} five years. Unfortunately Shen had many political rivals at court who were determined to sabotage his work. The court fully accepted their corrections to lunar and solar error, but only partially adopted Shen and Wei's corrected plotting of the planetary orbital paths and various speeds.|$|E

40|$|A {{spherical cap}} {{harmonic}} analysis (SCHA) {{model has been}} used to derive a high-resolution regional model of the geomagnetic field in the southwest Pacific region over the past 400 years. Two different methods, a self-consistent and the gufm 1 dipole method, have been used to fill in gaps in the available data. The data used in the analysis were largely measurements of the magnetic field recorded in ships logs on voyages of exploration in the region. The method chosen for the investigation used a spherical cap of radius ₀ = 50 ° centered at co-latitude and longitude of (115 °, 160 °). The results of each method used for SCHA are presented as contour plots of <b>magnetic</b> field <b>declination,</b> inclination and intensity and are compared with similar plots for a global model, gufm 1. The root mean square misfit of the self- consistent and gufm 1 dipole model to the actual data were around 2900 nT and 23000 nT respectively. Overall, the results suggest that the self-consistent model produces a more reliable model of the geomagnetic field within the area of interest than does the gufm 1 dipole model. With more data included the self-consistent model could be further improved and used to develop a high-resolution mathematical model of the geomagnetic field in the southwest Pacific region...|$|R
