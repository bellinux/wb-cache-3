Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of artificial genetic selection, in which cells that have not taken up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the selectable <b>marker</b> <b>gene</b> encoded by the vector are able to survive.|$|E

Although myocardin {{has been shown}} to be a key regulator of this process, the role of its related factors, MKL 1 and MKL 2, in SMC phenotypic switching remains unknown. The present studies were aimed at determining if: (1) MKL factors contribute to the expression of SMC <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> in cultured SMCs; and (2) platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) -induced repression of SMC <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> is mediated by suppression of MKL factors. Results of gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that MKL factors regulated the expression of single and multiple CArG-containing SMC <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> such as SM-actin and telokin, but not CArG-independent SMC <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> such as smoothelin-B.

40|$|Molecular genetic tools {{have become}} {{increasingly}} important in fundamental and applied yeast research. Genetic modifica-tions, such as the targeted inactivation of genes or their con-trolled (over) expression from episomal or integrating vectors, {{require the use of}} selectable <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> for efficient detec-tion and selection of transformed cells (4). After genetic mod-ification, <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> may be applied to counterselect against revertants. Especially during gene expression from episomal vectors, this counterselection is often a prerequisite for avoid-ing overgrowth of the population with cells that have lost the expression vector (18, 33). Several <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> used in yeast genetics confer resis-tance against antibiotics or other toxic compounds (42). Selec-tion for strains that carry such <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> requires the ad-dition of these toxic compounds to the growth media. In addition to their toxicity, the price of many of these com-pounds precludes their use in large-scale processes (18). More-over, even in resistant strains, the presence of antibiotics may affect cellular function. An alternative is the use of <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> that complement specific nutritional requirements. Some of the most commonly applied <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> are wild-type alleles of yeast genes that encode key enzymes in the metabolic pathways towards essential monomers used in bio-synthesis.

However, the factors and mechanisms controlling this process are not fully understood. We recently showed that oxidized phospholipids, including 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -(5 -oxovaleroyl) -sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POVPC), which accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions, are potent repressors of expression of SMC differentiation <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> in cultured SMCs as well as in rat carotid arteries in vivo. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms whereby POVPC induces suppression of SMC differentiation <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> in cultured SMCs. Results showed that POVPC induced phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and Elk- 1. The MEK inhibitors U- 0126 and PD- 98059 attenuated POVPC-induced suppression of smooth muscle (SM) α-actin and SM-myosin heavy chain. POVPC also induced expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf 4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that POVPC caused simultaneous binding of Elk- 1 and Klf 4 to the promoter region of the SM α-actin gene. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed a physical interaction between Elk- 1 and Klf 4. Results in Klf 4 -null SMCs showed that blockade of both Klf 4 induction and Elk- 1 phosphorylation completely abolished POVPC-induced suppression of SMC differentiation <b>marker</b> <b>genes.</b> POVPC-induced suppression of SMC differentiation <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> was also accompanied by hypoacetylation of histone H 4 at the SM α-actin promoter, which was mediated by the recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC 2 and HDAC 5.

Recently, {{it was shown}} that phenotypic <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> exhibit variable expression in humans. In this study, the bovine tail {{was used to determine}} the ability of <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> to distinguish the outer and inner AF from NP tissue and isolated cells. METHODS: Bovine tail {{intervertebral disc}}s from 13 donors were dissected and correct isolation of tissue was confirmed. mRNA was isolated directly from tissue or passage 0 monolayer cells and used for gene expression measurements (qPCR). Conventional <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> (bAcan, bCol 1 a 1, bCol 2 a 1) and novel <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> (bAdamts 17, bBrachyury/T, bCD 24, bCol 5 a 1, bCol 12 a 1, bFoxf 1, bKrt 19, bPax 1, bSfrp 2) were evaluated. RESULTS: As expected bAcan, bCol 2 a 1 and bCol 1 a 1 distinguished outer AF from NP tissue, while inner AF and NP could not be discriminated. The NP markers bT, bCd 24 and bKrt 19 were significantly higher expressed in NP than inner and outer AF tissue. bFoxF 1 and bPax 1 only distinguished IVD tissues from AC. The AF markers bAdamts 17, bCol 5 a 1, bCol 12 a 1 and bSfrp 2 were higher expressed in the outer AF compared with inner AF and NP tissue. Monolayer culturing strongly decreased bAcan, bCol 2 a 1, bCD 24 and bCol 5 a 1 expression, while bCol 1 a 1, bT, bKrt 19 and bSfrp 2 were not affected.

It is unknown whether there are common <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> significant for SLE but independent of sample types, which may have potentials for follow-up translational research. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify common <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> across various sample types for SLE. Based on four public microarray gene expression datasets for SLE covering three representative types of blood-born samples (monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC; whole blood), we utilized three statistics (fold-change, FC; t-test p value; false discovery rate adjusted p value) to scrutinize genes simultaneously regulated with SLE across various sample types. For common <b>marker</b> <b>genes,</b> we conducted the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction analysis to gain insights into their functions. We identified 10 common <b>marker</b> <b>genes</b> associated with SLE (IFI 6, IFI 27, IFI 44 L, OAS 1, OAS 2, EIF 2 AK 2, PLSCR 1, STAT 1, RNASE 2, and GSTO 1). Significant up-regulation of IFI 6, IFI 27, and IFI 44 L with SLE was observed in all the studied sample types, though the FC was most striking in monocyte, compared with PBMC and whole blood (8. 82 - 251. 66 vs. 3. 73 - 74. 05 vs. 1. 19 - 1. 87). Eight of the above 10 genes, except RNASE 2 and GSTO 1, interact with each other and with known SLE susceptibility genes, participate in immune response, RNA and protein catabolism, and cell death.
