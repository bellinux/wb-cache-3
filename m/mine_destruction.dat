50|$|A mine {{clearance}} agency, or demining agency, {{is an organization}} involved in removal of landmines and Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) for military, humanitarian, or commercial reasons.Demining includes {{mine clearance}} (actual removal and destruction of landmines/UXO from the ground), as well as surveying, mapping and marking of hazardous areas. The broader realm of mine action also includes advocacy, victim assistance, antipersonnel <b>mine</b> stockpile <b>destruction,</b> <b>mine</b> risk education and research. The aim is to clear land so that civilians can {{return to their homes}} and their everyday routines without the threat of landmines and unexploded remnants of war (ERW), which include unexploded ordnance and abandoned explosive ordnance. This means that all the mines and ERW affecting the places where ordinary people live must be cleared, and their safety in areas that have been cleared must be guaranteed. Mines are cleared and the areas are thoroughly verified so that they can say without a doubt that the land is now safe, and people can use it without worrying about the weapons.|$|R
40|$|Crocodiles {{have a long}} {{breeding}} life, which {{ranges from}} 25 - 30 years. There are 27 species and subspecies of crocodiles throughout the world, 18 {{of which are in}} danger of extinction, the rest being threatened with declining population due to overhunting and habitat destruction. Two known crocodile species exist in the Philippines: Crocodylus mindorensis (freshwater crocodile) and C. porosus (saltwater crocodile). Killing adult crocodiles, as is being done now, drastically reduces the potential population. Moreover, toxic wastes from <b>mines,</b> <b>destruction</b> of marshes and riverine habitats, and the conversion of their natural habitats for fishponds additionally threaten their populations. Estimates indicate that there are only about 100 Philippine crocodiles in the wild now. The Crocodile Farming Institute (CFI) was established in Palawan, in 1987, in order to save the crocodiles from extinction in the Philippines. It {{is now one of the}} components of the Palawan Wildlife and Conservation Center, and aims to conserve the 2 endangered species in the Philippines and also to develop and introduce a suitable crocodile farming technology that will help uplift the socio-economic well-being of the Filipino people. CFI believes in the potential of commercial utilization of crocodiles as a dollar-generating industry for the Philippines. It is a very profitable business and could be a multi-million dollar industry. A brief outline is given of the economic and marketing potentials of farming crocodiles in the Philippines...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} organic and inorganic amendments on heavy metal immobilization in soil and organic carbon sequestration, a growth chamber study {{over a period of}} 18 months was conducted. Phytoremediation of two degraded soils, smelter-polluted soil and post-mining soil, was carried out using Scots Pine (Pinus Sylvestris L.) and Giant Miscanthus (Miscanthus x Giganteus). The increase in organic carbon content for lake chalk amended soils was noted. In addition, the largest root biomass production after fertilization of heavy metal contaminated soil with lake chalk was observed. This soil additive increases soil pH and reduces heavy metal mobility, which finally minimizes the harmful effect of metals on plant life and growth. Root biomass production of Giant Miscanthus was significantly higher than Scots pine root biomass for both soils. This may indicate better phytosequestration properties of Giant Miscanthus, {{especially in the case of}} land degradation due to <b>mining</b> and <b>destruction</b> of soil profiles...|$|R
