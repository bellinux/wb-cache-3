30|$|Proximal femoral {{excision}} is {{an effective}} technique for managing painful chronic hip dislocation in patients with non-ambulatory CP that is refractory to more conservative medical measures. Soft tissue interposition is not always performed according to published techniques, and when it is, it varies from simple capsular closure to complete <b>myoplasty.</b> Interposition <b>myoplasty</b> probably functions as a mechanical barrier that helps to reduce proximal femoral migration and articulation with the iliac wing. We therefore feel that this technique, in addition to appropriate use of peri-operative analgesia, tone-reducing medication and skin traction, helps achieve successful outcomes. We have described our proximal femoral resection surgical technique with our experience of post-operative management that has demonstrated substantial short-term clinical improvement in all patients.

40|$|It {{has become}} common {{practice}} in reconstructive surgery to transpose or transplant a variety of autologous tissues to fill defects at a recipient site. Using muscle tissue, it becomes possible to dynamically assist or replace an impaired or lost function. For these procedures the term dynamic myoplasty is generally used. In dynamic <b>myoplasty,</b> control of timing and rate of contraction of the transposed or transplanted muscle tissue is substantial, but presently not fully within reach. Currently used electrical stimulation protocols, which stimulate innervating nerves or the muscle tissue itself, supply gross on-off spasm-like contractions of the whole dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> muscle. This leads to rapid fatigue, which can be partly overcome using training protocols converting the dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> into a more fatigue resistant state {{at the cost of}} strength and responsiveness. Furthermore ischemic lesions, fibrotic changes and abundant scarring due to constant high tissue pressures are widespread reported in these procedures. This thesis reports on efforts to gain more control over dynamic myoplasties, in order to overcome some of the drawbacks of currently used electrical stimulation on one hand, and to give rise to more refined applications of dynamic myoplasties on the other. Conventional stimulation techniques recruit all or most of the muscle fibers simultaneously and continuously. Therefore, sequential segmental neuromuscular stimulation was introduced, in which only segments of the transferred muscle tissue are stimulated in a sequential fashion, providing continuous work, but with alternating partitions. This way, the temporary resting segments are reperfused during functioning of the dynamic <b>myoplasty.</b> The muscles studied were the canine gracilis and all experiments were acute studies in anesthetized animals. Comparison of sequential and conventional stimulation revealed the predicted increase in muscle fatigue resistance and muscle blood flow. These effects were more pronounced in the isometric setup with stretched out and fixed gracilis muscles reported in chapter 2, than in a non-isometric setup with gracilis based neo-sphincters, which were allowed to shorten during stimulation, as described in chapter 3. The shortening of the muscle tissue Summary kinking of the intra-muscular blood vessels within the neo-sphincters could be a reason for the less distinct increase of perfusion and subsequent fatigue resistance during non-isometric contractions. Apart from improving perfusion, reducing the load of the dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> will improve its endurance as well. Furthermore, it is likely that reducing the load will decrease ischemia, leading to less fibrotic changes and subsequent scarring of the involved tissues. To economize the load of the dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> to exact (and changing) needs, control over the contraction rate of the muscle tissue needs to be precise. Closed-loop control proved to be a good cybernetic tool to regulate the pressures generated by gracilis based sequentially stimulated neo-sphincters in an acute dog study as was elucidated in chapter 4. The inherent problem in closed-loop control of oscillations was successfully reduced to less than 10 % of the target-pressures by using optimized correction frequencies, correction thresholds and transition times. Modulation of the stimulation amplitudes proved to be superior over modulation of the stimulation frequency in order to tune the performance of the neo-sphincters. Having increased fatigue resistance and being able to precisely control the rate of performance, a dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> should be able to perform more complex tasks. Therefore, an acute dog study was designed in which gracilis based neo-sphincters were made to maintain a pressure gradient with the bladder during fast and slowly changing bladder pressures, using a combination of sequential stimulation, closed-loop control and a function-controlling algorithm. Results, set out in chapter 5, showed that the neo-sphincter was able to maintain the desired pressure gradient with the bladder during fast and slowly changing bladder pressures. Accuracy showed no significant difference when compared to the native sphincter, which served as control. Addition of a simplified self-learning component in the algorithm, adapting the duty cycle of individual segments to their relative state of fatigue, proved feasible and meaningful in this study design. Overall this thesis reports improvement in fatigue resistance and control over a dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> using sequential stimulation, closed-loop control and function-controlling algorithms in acute studies. A comparable implantable New electrical stimulation techniques in dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> system, can be used in chronic studies. Availability of this implantable system should be able to confirm the lesser need for muscle fiber type transformation, using training regimens, and also reveal other benefits as prevention of ischemic lesions, fibrotic changes and abundant scar formation. All these improvements should offer more versatile dynamic myoplasties, broadening the abilities of reconstructive surgeons in the repair of functional defects...|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} options to treat this {{condition}} including femoral resection with subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy [13], open reduction and joint reconstruction [14, 15], arthrodesis [16] and proximal femoral resection [6, 12, 17, 18]. Proximal femoral resection below the lesser trochanter {{is a particularly}} well-known salvage procedure, and the technique has evolved to include interposition <b>myoplasty</b> [12, 18]. A proximal femoral resection results in a mobile lower limb that may then be positioned easily and comfortably irrespective of pelvic obliquity or fixed contracture of the contralateral hip. The interposition <b>myoplasty</b> aims {{to reduce the risk}} of failure associated with painful proximal femoral migration. Overall, this procedure is associated with an improvement in quality of life and patient/carer satisfaction [12, 18]. However, soft tissue interposition may be suboptimal or often not performed altogether from both our own experience and published reports [6, 17] of continued/recurrent pain.|$|E
40|$|Long-standing {{peripheral}} monolateral {{facial paralysis}} {{in the adult}} has challenged otolaryngologists, neurologists and plastic surgeons for centuries. Notwithstanding, {{the ultimate goal of}} normality of the paralyzed hemi-face with symmetry at rest, and the achievement of a spontaneous symmetrical smile with corneal protection, has not been fully reached. At the beginning of the 20 (th) century, the main options were neural reconstructions including accessory to facial nerve transfer and hypoglossal to facial nerve crossover. In {{the first half of the}} 20 (th) century, various techniques for static correction with autologous temporalis muscle and fascia grafts were proposed as the techniques of Gillies (1934) and McLaughlin (1949). Cross-facial nerve grafts have been performed since the beginning of the 1970 s often with the attempt to transplant free-muscle to restore active movements. However, these transplants were non-vascularized, and further evaluations revealed central fibrosis and minimal return of function. A major step was taken in the second half of the 1970 s, with the introduction of microneurovascular muscle transfer in facial reanimation, which, often combined in two steps with a cross-facial nerve graft, has become the most popular option for the comprehensive treatment of long-standing facial paralysis. In the second half of the 1990 s in France, a regional muscle transfer technique with the definite advantages of being one-step, technically easier and relatively fast, namely lengthening temporalis <b>myoplasty,</b> acquired popularity and consensus among surgeons treating facial paralysis. A total of 111 patients with facial paralysis were treated in Caen between 1997 and 2005 by a single surgeon who developed 2 variants of the technique (V 1, V 2), each with its advantages and disadvantages, but both based on the same anatomo-functional background and aim, which is transfer of the temporalis muscle tendon on the coronoid process to the lips. For a comprehensive treatment of the paralysis, the eyelids are usually managed by Paul Tessier's technique to lengthen the levator muscle of the upper eyelid by aponeurosis interposition, combined with external blepharorrhaphy with Krastinova-Lolov's technique. Facial reanimation using lengthening temporalis <b>myoplasty</b> is a dynamic procedure that has its roots in the techniques of Gillies and McLaughlin. This method is a true lengthening <b>myoplasty</b> procedure using no intermediate grafts. In general, the results with a 1 -stage combination of lengthening temporalis <b>myoplasty</b> and static correction of the lagophthalmos appear comparable with the major series in the literature using free microneurovascular transfers combined with cross-facial nerve grafts for longstanding peripheral monolateral facial paralysis. The obvious advantages of temporalis elongation <b>myoplasty</b> consist in its technical ease, a single step, low incidence of complications and markedly reduced operating time...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} neurovascular anatomy and length of the long head of biceps femoris (LHBF) is suitable for its possible use {{in the creation of}} a dynamic perianal <b>myoplasty</b> to restore faecal continence. If intramuscular arterioarterial anastomoses exist between a muscle's vascular pedicles then the delay procedure, i. e. ligating the vascular pedicles to the transposed section of the muscle, 4 – 6 wk before transposition, can be used to improve blood flow to the distal part of the transposed muscle. The intramuscular arterial anatomy of 20 biceps femoris muscles was shown by dissection (14) or radiographically (6). The mean entry point of the upper major vascular pedicle to the LHBF was 12 cm (s. d. 3. 3) and the mean length of the LHBF was 36. 8 cm (s. d. 1. 8). Therefore the ratio between upper major vascular pedicle entry point and muscle length in 95 % of specimens was 0. 33 (0. 2). In the present study intramuscular arterioarterial anastomoses were found between the arterial pedicles to the non-transposed and transposed sections of the LHBF and between the long and short heads of this muscle.

40|$|Some {{life-saving}} surgeries {{result in}} the necessity to establish permanent intestinal stomas; this outcome has an undeniable physical and emotional effect on the patient's life. Although patients with permanent stomas reasonably adjust, complications that include peristomal skin irritation, pouching system dysfunction, social inhibition, depression, and sexual dysfunction also have been reported. The quest for intestinal stomal continence has resulted in numerous non-surgical and surgical continent diversion techniques. The use of dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> is one of them. Dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> is a term given {{to the use of}} electrical stimulation devices to stimulate surgically elevated muscle flaps. It has been used to treat fecal and urinary incontinence using a gracilis muscle flap neo-sphincter. Another clinical example is use of the lattissimus dorsi muscle to augment the pump function of the heart in patients with chronic heart failure. None of the attempted techniques to maintain stomal continence have enjoyed widespread use because of associated complications or because these techniques were not able to provide complete continence. However, the use of dynamic <b>myoplasty</b> to achieve stomal continence has also met with limited success. Denervation atrophy caused by flap elevation to construct the sphincter and early muscle fatigue caused by continuous electrical stimulation were responsible for these disappointing results. It was our goal {{to see if we could}} make an abdominal stoma continent using dynamic <b>myoplasty.</b> A multiphase project was undertaken that was designed to solve the critical issues of denervation atrophy and early muscle fatigue. To solve the problem of denervation atrophy an anatomic feasibility study was undertaken in fresh human cadavers. This first study was designed to determine which local muscle could serve as an innervated and well-perfused muscle flap. The rectus abdominis muscle (RAM) was found to be ideal. Of the two RAM stoma sphincter designs the island flap was found to be superior to the peninsula flap design. The next phase of the study was to identify an animal suitable for the development of a model for stoma sphincter design. In an acute canine study, it was determined that the RAM island flap sphincter design used in human cadavers could be applied to the dog. Using an electrical stimulation device, the muscle was able to be stimulated and to generate peak pressures well above 60 mm Hg (pressure needed to maintain fecal continence in humans). Muscle fatigue was found to be directly proportional to the stimulation frequency and continence was provided at all the tested bowel pressures (30, 65 and 100 mm Hg). These promising acute functional study results paved the way for the initiation of chronic trials incorporating survival operations in dogs. In the first chronic study, it was revealed that the sphincter design was fatigue-resistant for 4 hours up to three months post-op with one of the two training protocols tested. In addition, a second chronic study was undertaken to test whether direct nerve stimulation, as opposed to intramuscular stimulation, would render more favorable results. Although the numbers were too small there was a tendency that the sphincter could be trained faster with direct nerve stimulation. However, electrode failure (displacement and lead fracture) led to a non-functioning sphincter in 63...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is an {{alternative}} therapy for end-stage heart failure. We investigated the mechanisms, both acute and chronic, by which a synchronously stimulated conditioned muscle wrap affects left ventricular function in a chronic canine model of dilated cardiomyopathy. Methods: Nineteen dogs underwent rapid ventricular pacing {{at a rate of}} 215 beats/min for 4 weeks to create a model of heart failure. Eight dogs were then randomly selected to undergo cardiomyoplasty, and all dogs received 6 additional weeks of rapid ventricular pacing. The cardiomyoplasty group also received a graded muscle conditioning protocol of synchronized burst stimulation to transform the muscle wrap. All dogs were studied with pressure-volume analysis and echocardiography at baseline and after 4 and 10 weeks of rapid ventricular pacing. Data in the cardiomyoplasty group were analyzed with the stimulator off, with it augmenting every beat (1 : 1), and with it augmenting only every other beat (1 : 2). Results: Stimulator “off” data at 10 weeks of rapid pacing demonstrated chronic effects by enhanced ventricular function (end-systolic elastance = l. 80 after <b>myoplasty</b> vs 1. 17 for controls, p = 0. 005) and a stabilization of volumes and composite end-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relations in the cardiomyoplasty group when compared with controls. <b>Myoplasty</b> stimulation increased apparent contractility (preload recruitable stroke work = 31. 3 for stimulator “off” vs 40. 6 for stimulator 1 : 2 assisted beats [p < 0. 05] and vs 45. 4 for stimulator 1 : 1 [p < 0. 05]). Conclusions: Benefits from dynamic cardiomyoplasty are by at least two mechanisms: (1) the girdling effects of a conditioned muscle wrap, which halts the chronic remodeling of heart failure, and (2) active systolic assistance, which augments the apparent contractility of the failing heart.

30|$|In this series, {{there was}} one {{revision}} due to migration of the proximal femur {{but there were no}} other cases of symptomatic proximal femoral migration and none identified in those undergoing radiological follow-up. We accept there still may be a degree of proximal femoral migration in some of these patients but this is only of concern if it causes pain and/or functional difficulty, including the ability to sit. Our one case of femoral migration was associated with pain due to the protrusion of the bone through the skin and soft tissues where at revision surgery, failure of the <b>myoplasty</b> was noted. This may have been preventable by a more prolonged period of skin traction to control muscle spasm and allow the soft tissues to heal but our philosophy has been to avoid prolonged bed rest with the attendant risks of chest infection and pressure sores.|$|E
40|$|A 58 {{year old}} man {{underwent}} 6 surgical interventions for various complications of massive biventricular myocardial infarction {{over a period}} of 2 years following acute occlusion of a possibly "hyperdominant" left anterior descending coronary artery. These included concomitant repair of apicoanterior post-infarction VSD and right ventricular free wall rupture, repeat repair of recurrent VSD following inferoposterior extension of VSD in the infarcted septum 5 weeks later, repair of delayed right ventricular free wall rupture 4 weeks subsequently, repair of a bleeding left ventricular aneurysm eroding through left chest wall 16 months thereafter, repair of right upper lobe lung tear causing massive anterior mediastinal haemorrhage, mimicking yet another cardiac rupture, 2 months later, followed, at the same admission, 2 weeks later, by sternal reconstruction for dehisced and infected sternum using pedicled myocutaneous latissimus dorsi flap. 5 years after the latissimus <b>myoplasty,</b> the patient remains in NYHA class 1 and is leading a normal life...|$|E
30|$|All {{treatment}} modalities {{were included}} in this study (conservative and surgical intervention). Studies that utilized injection as a method of treatment were categorized in one treatment group and subgroups were identified based on the material utilized for injection, including; methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) injection, bone marrow injection, combined MPA with bone marrow, combined bone marrow with demineralized bone matrix (DBM), and combined bone marrow with MPA and DBM. The technique of injection procedure was reviewed in each article to identify whether inner wall disruption was performed or not, and based on this criterion, every injection subgroup was subcategorized into injection with and without inner wall disruption. Studies on surgical treatment were examined and subgroups were identified, including: curettage only, curettage with bone graft (autograft versus allograft), curettage with bone substitution (calcium sulphate pellets, calcium phosphate pellets, Hydroxyapetite, ceramic substitute), curettage with <b>myoplasty,</b> cyst excision, flexible intramedullary nailing (IM nail) and continuous decompression with cannulated screws.|$|E
40|$|Amputation {{osteoplasty}} is {{a technique}} modification promoted by Ertl to enhance rehabilitation after transtibial amputation. Two different techniques for creating sealing of the medullary canal and a distal bone block have been described in the literature. One technique consists of a periosteal sleeve that is sutured over the cut end of the bone. The second technique consists of hinging a segment of fibula into a slot in the cut end of the tibia. The desired goal of amputation osteoplasty {{is to create an}} end-bearing limb to enhance rehabilitation. In addition to creation of a bone bridge, Ertl also recommends <b>myoplasty,</b> neuroplasty, individual vessel ligation, and a special skin closure. This report is a small case series of five patients successfully treated with lower extremity amputation osteoplasty, to illustrate the techniques and report initial good results. Two patients had each of the techniques and one patient had both of the techniques. All five patients had good wound healing, accelerated rehabilitation, and the ability to use end-bearing prostheses...|$|E

40|$|The {{fibre type}} {{distribution}} has been mapped in the latissimus dorsi muscle of the Dutch rabbit. Using the myosin ATPase stain, a distinct border {{was found to}} run in a cranial to caudal direction, which effectively divided the muscle into 2 segments of different fibre type proportions. Although both segments contained mostly fast twitch fibres, the medial areas were found to contain approximately 10 - 20 % slow (i. e. type I) fibres while the lateral portions contained very few, if any, slow fibres. Significantly fewer type IIa fibres were {{also found in the}} lateral areas of the muscle. These histochemical findings were confirmed by the use of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated that more messenger RNA of the slow myosin heavy chain was found in the medial regions compared with the lateral segment. These results demonstrate the importance of choosing well defined sampling sites when evaluating regimes designed to transform this heterogeneous muscle for use in subsequent <b>myoplasty</b> procedures...|$|E
30|$|Skeletal myoblasts (SKM) are the {{progenitor}} {{cells of}} skeletal muscle. Initial observations that SKMs could be harvested from an autologous origin, easily expanded ex vivo and undergo spontaneous differentiation into contractile muscle sparked interest in SKMs for cardiac <b>myoplasty</b> (Taylor et al. 1998). Early uncontrolled clinical studies reported that SKMs could engraft in the injured heart with remarkable efficiency and enable {{significant improvement in}} cardiac function (Menasche et al. 2003). These findings were not reproduced in a subsequent prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial (Menasche et al. 2008), where 97 participants with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction underwent transepicardial autologous SKM injection {{at the time of}} coronary artery bypass grafting. Six months following the procedure, no improvement in LV function was found when compared to placebo. Importantly, a high prevalence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was observed leading to premature discontinuation of the trial. Similar results were observed in the SEISMIC trial which used transendocardial injection of autologous SKMs (Veltman et al. 2008). A follow-up study conducted four years later reported no significant change in LV function compared to the placebo group.|$|E
