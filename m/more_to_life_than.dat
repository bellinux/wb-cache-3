At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that there was <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>than</b> just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-Boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC.|$|E

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>than</b> material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Human Behaviour" [...] {{features}} a [...] "bouncing riff" [...] sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim, with [...] "its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument, the timpani." [...] Its lyrics [...] refer to Björk's {{experience as a}} child, finding the behaviour of adults [...] "rather chaotic and nonsensical," [...] instead finding harmony with other children, nature and animals. Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough, she sings {{from the point of}} view of an animal, with its opening line being [...] "If you ever get close to a human/And human behaviour/Be ready, be ready to get confused". Following track [...] "Crying" [...] shows a contradiction between its [...] "bubbly, shiny-surfaced acid disco-pop" [...] sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in a big city. [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] —considered an ambient track by Rolling Stone— reflected Björk's newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably Talvin Singh. In a spontaneous fashion, the song's strings —and also those of [...] "Come to Me"— were recorded by a fim studio orchestra in India. The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, with lyrics that have been described as [...] "sweet and just the slightest bit naughty."

O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J.
