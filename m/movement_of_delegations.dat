Also present if desired is a commentator: each broadcaster may supply their own commentary for their TV and/or radio feed, to be broadcast in each country. The commentators are given dedicated commentary booths situated around the back of the arena behind the audience.|$|R

40|$|Europe is {{a heavyweight}} in global finance. But {{does it have}} a {{presence}} in global financial governance to match? This paper employs a principal-agent approach to analyse patterns <b>of</b> policy-making <b>delegation</b> in the EU to explore this question. It finds a U-shaped relationship between the extent <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> and the 'European presence' in global financial governance: when member states either remain in control of policy or delegate extensive competencies, European stakeholders are well represented. In contrast, intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> can undermine the European presence by tying member states' hands without sufficiently empowering supranational agents to fill the gap. Patterns <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> are traced to the heterogeneity of member state interests and the pre-existence of international governance arrangements. These arguments about the origins and consequences <b>of</b> <b>delegation</b> patterns are supported by evidence from three core domains of financial governance: banking regulation; accounting standards; and capital market regulation...|$|R
