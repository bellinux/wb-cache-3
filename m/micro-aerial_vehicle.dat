These regional solutions capture nonlinear behavior better than linearized point solutions. They also avoid the computational difficulties that emerge when attempting to create a cell map for the entire state-space.

40|$|Autonomously {{navigating}} robots {{have long}} been a tough challenge facing engineers. The recent push to develop <b>micro-aerial</b> <b>vehicles</b> for practical military, civilian, and industrial use has added a significant power and time constraint to the challenge. In contrast, animals, from insects to humans, have been navigating successfully for millennia using {{a wide range of}} variants of the ultra-low-power computational system known as the brain. For this reason, we look to biological systems to inspire a solution suitable for autonomously navigating <b>micro-aerial</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this dissertation, the focus is on studying the neurobiological structures involved in mammalian spatial navigation. The mammalian brain areas widely believed to contribute directly to navigation tasks are the Head Direction Cells, Grid Cells and Place Cells found in the post-subiculum, the medial entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus, respectively. In addition to studying the neurobiological structures involved in navigation, we investigate various neural models that seek to explain the operation of these structures and adapt them to neuromorphic VLSI circuits and systems. We choose the neuromorphic approach for our systems because we are interested in understanding the interaction between the real-time, physical implementation of the algorithms and the real-world problem (robot and environment). By utilizing both analog and asynchronous digital circuits to mimic similar computations in neural systems, we envision very low power VLSI implementations suitable for providing practical solutions for spatial navigation in <b>micro-aerial</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

On {{the basis of}} the camera pose estimation using AprilTag, we design an AprilTag array as the calibration target and employ a nonlinear optimization to calculate the single-camera extrinsic parameters when multiple tags are in the field of view of the camera. The extrinsic parameters of camera–camera and laser–camera are then calibrated, respectively. A global optimization is finally used to refine all the extrinsic parameters by minimizing a re-projection error. This algorithm is adapted to the extrinsic calibration of multiple cameras even if there is non-overlapping field of view. For algorithm validation, we have built a <b>micro-aerial</b> <b>vehicle</b> platform with multi-sensor system to collect real data, and the experiment results confirmed that the proposed algorithm yields great performance.|$|E
