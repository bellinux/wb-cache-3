5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its {{primary goal is}} to find blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 <b>months.</b> <b>Without</b> a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several <b>months</b> <b>without</b> eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam is {{effective}} in the relief of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks. However, {{it is not a}} first line treatment since the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated on an open basis for up to 8 <b>months</b> <b>without</b> apparent loss of benefit.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according {{to the amount of}} precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive <b>months</b> <b>without</b> precipitation, arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, {{after the}} miners had worked 14 <b>months</b> <b>without</b> benefits, UMWA {{president}} Richard Trumka declared a strike against the Pittston Coal Company. Around 2,000 UMWA members {{who worked for}} Pittston {{walked out of the}} mines and reported to the picket line. Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers. To ensure that production would continue, Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement miners and coal trucks across the picket line.|$|E

5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with {{intervals}} of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular menstruation {{is known as}} metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia. Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. Amenorrhea refers to more than three to six <b>months</b> <b>without</b> menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.|$|E

5|$|After {{spending}} eight <b>months</b> <b>without</b> {{being able}} to play any football, Villa finally returned from his injury in the 73rd minute of Barcelona's 2–0 win over Dinamo Bucharest on 11 August 2012. Eight days later, he played his first competitive football match since December 2011 in Barcelona's first La Liga {{game of the season}} where he received a standing ovation while coming on as a substitute for Pedro. It only took seven minutes before Villa found himself on the score-sheet while sealing a 5–1 victory for his team against Real Sociedad. On 28 November, Villa scored two goals in a 3–1 over Deportivo Alavés, which included his 300th career goal.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the species}} {{and where it}} lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, {{catching}} prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many <b>months</b> <b>without</b> feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.|$|E

5|$|The 18-valence {{electron}} rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species {{generated by}} this reaction demonstrates again {{the instability of}} the rhodocene moiety, in {{that it can be}} refluxed in toluene for <b>months</b> <b>without</b> 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocene forming but in oxidising conditions the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{consensus}} about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps {{to understand their}} full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several <b>months</b> <b>without</b> eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for <b>months</b> <b>without</b> being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|In stream {{communities}}, few animal groups became extinct {{because such}} communities rely less directly on food from living plants {{and more on}} detritus that washes in from the land, buffering them from extinction. Similar, but more complex patterns {{have been found in}} the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the water column than among animals living on or in the sea floor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on primary production from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the ocean floor feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding. Coccolithophorids and mollusks (including ammonites, rudists, freshwater snails, and mussels), and those organisms whose food chain included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of mosasaurs, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary. The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, crocodyliforms and champsosaurs, were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers, can survive for <b>months</b> <b>without</b> food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|League {{football}} was suspended in September 1939 with {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War, and team affairs in wartime competitions were handled by director and acting manager Arthur Wright, before his resignation from illness midway through the 1942–43 season. He was replaced by Tom Lockie, who carried on until after the 1945–46 FA Cup, when Mitchell returned for the 1946–47 Football League season. Mitchell resigned in February 1950 to concentrate on his business interests, and was succeeded in April by Birmingham City northern scout and former York player Dick Duckworth. He lifted the club {{from the bottom of the}} table to a top four position, but left in October 1952 to take over at Stockport County. Former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer took over in November 1952, but his health declined and died in February 1953, after less than three months in charge. Sheffield United assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, before he resigned in September 1954 over a dispute with the board regarding team selection. York went the next 18 <b>months</b> <b>without</b> an official manager, with team matters handled by trainer Lockie and secretary Sherrington. This was a successful period for the club; York reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, and were beaten by Newcastle United in a replay.|$|E
