The present paper views an algorithm for improving the dynamic accuracy of such <b>measuring</b> <b>systems.</b> It is based on the Kalman method. The algorithm aims to eliminate the influence of a number of interference sources, each of which is of secondary significance. However, their total effect can cause considerable distortion of the measurement signal. The algorithm model is designed for gyro-free <b>measuring</b> <b>systems.</b> It is based on one {{of the most}} widely used elements in the dynamic systems, namely the physical pendulum, due to which <b>measuring</b> <b>systems</b> of high dynamic accuracy and low cost can be developed. The presented experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with respect to the dynamic accuracy of <b>measuring</b> <b>systems</b> of this type...|$|R
25|$|The {{travel time}} of the neutrinos had to be {{measured}} by tracking {{the time they were}} created, and the time they were detected, and using a common clock to ensure the times were in sync. As Fig.1 shows, the time <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> included the neutrino source at CERN, the detector at LNGS (Gran Sasso), and a satellite element common to both. The common clock was the time signal from multiple GPS satellites visible from both CERN and LNGS. CERN's beams-department engineers worked with the OPERA team to provide a travel time measurement between the source at CERN and a point just before the OPERA detector's electronics, using accurate GPS receivers. This included timing the proton beams' interactions at CERN, and timing the creation of intermediate particles eventually decaying into neutrinos (see Fig.3).|$|E
500|$|The <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> for gauging a film's {{success is}} based on {{unadjusted}} grosses, mainly because historically {{this is the way}} it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a [...] "top film of all time", so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.|$|E

40|$|Optical <b>measuring</b> <b>systems</b> {{provide much}} more detail on the {{deformation}} of the blank in the bulge test than conventional contact height <b>measuring</b> <b>systems.</b> A {{significant increase in}} accuracy of the stress-strain curve {{can be achieved by}} fitting the surface to more complicated equations than the traditional spherical surface and by considering the local strain data to approximate the curvature for the midplane. In particular an ellipsoid shape is shown to be very accurate in describing the surface of the blank. Contact height <b>measuring</b> <b>systems</b> provide insufficient data to fit a surface to an ellipsoid shape and to establish local strain data. Pragmatic equations are proposed using the work hardening coefficient from the tensile test to approximate the same accuracy in stress-strain curves as obtained by optical <b>measuring</b> <b>systems</b> using the before mentioned evaluation method...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{criticism}} of the <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> itself is that it fails the most important criterion of a sample: it is not random in the statistical sense of the word. A {{small fraction of the}} population is selected and only those that actually accept are used as the sample size. In many local areas during the 1990s, the difference between a rating that kept a show on the air and one that would cancel it was so small as to be statistically insignificant, and yet the show that just happened to get the higher rating would survive. In addition, the Nielsen ratings encouraged a strong push for demographic measurements. This caused problems with households that had multiple television sets or households where viewers would enter the simpler codes (usually their child's) raising serious questions {{to the quality of the}} demographic data. The situation further deteriorated as the popularity of cable television expanded the number of viewable networks to the point that the margin of error has increased, because the sampling sizes are too small. Compounding matters is the fact that of the sample data that is collected, advertisers will not pay for time shifted programs (those that are recorded for replay at a different time), rendering the [...] "raw" [...] numbers useless from a statistical point of view. Even in 2013, it was noted that Internet streams of television programs were still not counted because they had either no ads (such as Netflix) or totally different advertising (such as Hulu) than their television counterparts, effectively skewing the raw data on how popular a show really is.|$|E
2500|$|The viewing {{figures for}} the event {{have been the subject}} of much speculation, with Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{estimating}} that 2 billion people would watch the wedding. Following the event, this figure was duly reported by the media, but was criticised by some news outlets for being inaccurate and unfounded. Estimated figures include a peak audience of 26.3 million viewers and a total of 36.7 million watching at least some part of the wedding coverage in the UK, while in the United States, the wedding drew an average audience of 22.8 million, with over 60 million tuning in at some point to watch some of the coverage. In India, a reported 42.1 million viewers tuned in, 9.9 million viewers in Germany, 9.6 million viewers in France, 5.22 million viewers watched the event in Canada with twelve million tuning in at some point, five million in Australia, and one million was expected in China, for an audience of 122 million to 176 million viewers, drawing from a total population pool of 3.126 billion (approximately 45% of the world's population). Other reported figures put the global audience at 162 million viewers. In addition to the television audiences, the ceremony attracted 72 million live streams and a reach of 101 million streams on YouTube across 188 countries. With its 72 million streams, the wedding has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records for the record of [...] "Most Live Streams for a Single Event", beating out the Michael Jackson memorial service in 2009. It has been suggested that the [...] "two billion" [...] figure is exaggerated, and that there are too many gaps in the worldwide TV <b>measuring</b> <b>system</b> to accurately audit global audience figures.|$|E
