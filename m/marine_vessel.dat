2500|$|As {{the debate}} continued, NMFS urged {{the public to}} keep away from Springer, and officially {{authorized}} a volunteer, on-the-water monitoring project involving Washington-based non-profit organizations possessing the <b>marine</b> <b>vessel</b> resources {{to keep track of}} the calf — the Whale Museum, and Project SeaWolf. Project SeaWolf, a Marysville, Washington-based marine advocacy group spearheaded by A. Michael Kundu (previously the PNW Director for the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society), Seattle media personality Bob Mclaughlin, and Robert Wood, had logged more time on the water with Springer than any government or non-government group, tracking her movements, alerting ferry captains of her presence, keeping curious boaters at a safe distance away, as well as shooting and distributing to the media footage of the orca rubbing against boats. The highly experienced monitoring team included photographer and marine advocate Kelley Balcomb-Bartok, son of noted orca researcher Ken Balcomb of The Center for Whale Research, and members of the Friday Harbor-based boater education program, Soundwatch. The monitors took shifts monitoring Springer and keeping the public away, but the growing number of onlookers were making the effort unsustainable.|$|E
