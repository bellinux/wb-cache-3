"I {{love them}}," [...] Dias said; [...] "I love them as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>sons.</b> At first, {{when they came}} to me from Señor Barriett, it was for his sake that I consented to {{accompany}} and aid them; but from that night when they saved my life by rushing, with no weapons save their sticks, into the midst of five men with drawn knives, I felt how noble they were, and I loved them not only for the sake of my life, but for their bravery. Since then my feelings have grown every day.
