50|$|Previously München-Laim <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> (Rangierbahnhöfe) was {{along with}} Munich East <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> one of Munich’s two <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards.</b> With the {{commissioning}} {{of the new}} Munich North <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> the station’s <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> lost its purpose, as wagons were now handling at the new facility. As Deutsche Bahn required additional storage space for Intercity-Express trains, parts of the old rail yard were rebuilt and modernised. The trains enter these storage sidings via a connecting track from the Munich Hauptbahnhof depot.|$|R

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{covers the}} design of medium and large <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> including the dimensioning of their working parts. Firstly, the thesis defines <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> divisioning according to function, design, shape and use of automatic equipment. It furthermore describes the workflow at half automatic and fully automatic <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards,</b> based on {{the data for the}} only Slovenian <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Zalog. The next section describes various <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> devices with special emphasis on shorter turnouts specific for hump yards, and different brake systems according to the yard automatic equipment. The dimensioning of different track groups of a <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> and the requirements for upper and lower track superstructure are defined as a part of spatial placement. Different track groups with their longitudinal and transverse profile features, ground plans and equations for different calculation methods are presented. The latter include the number and length of the tracks, track capacity and their utilization. Where multiple methods of calculation can be used, choosing the right one is defined. The goal of the thesis is to check the existing dimensions of Zalog <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> based on an actual capacity common for the last 12 years. For easier understanding, the role of Zalog <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> is defined within the Slovenian and European rail network. Different measures for improvements are presented based on the comparison of the existing and new <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> dimensioning data...|$|R
50|$|Teesside had {{a number}} of <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> {{servicing}} the coal mines and steel mills of Consett, West County Durham and North Yorkshire, as well as those for Middlesbrough Dock. The decision was hence taken to rationalise these to one <b>yard,</b> Tees <b>Marshalling</b> <b>Yard</b> on part of the site of the once electrified Erimus <b>Marshalling</b> <b>Yard.</b>|$|R

50|$|At {{each end}} of the line are two of the largest <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> in Europe: Mannheim <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> and Basel SBB <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in Muttenz. One <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> of this line—in Heidelberg—has been closed and the new {{district}} of Bahnstadt has been built on its site. There are still DB freight yards in Karlsruhe, Offenburg, Freiburg and Basel. Karlsruhe freight yard is equipped with electronic interlocking and is controlled from the control centre in Karlsruhe. The other are still operated locally, some using electromechanical interlocking.|$|R
50|$|Leipzig-Engelsdorf <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> (Bahnhof Leipzig-Engelsdorf) is {{the central}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> in the Leipzig rail node in the German state of Saxony. Until it was closed in 1994, {{there was also a}} <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> at Leipzig-Wahren station. It is located on the Leipzig-Dresden, Engelsdorf-Leipzig-Connewitz and Leipzig-Wahren-Engelsdorf {{railways}} in the Leipzig suburb of Engelsdorf. The halts of Leipzig Werkstättenstraße (on the Leipzig-Geithain railway) and Leipzig-Engelsdorf Hp (Haltepunkte, on the Leipzig-Dresden railway) are located in the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> area. It was called Bahnhof Engelsdorf (b Leipzig) until December 2016.|$|R
50|$|Feltham <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> {{also known}} as Feltham hump yard, was a large railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> {{designed}} for the concentration of freight traffic to and from South West London, and for transfer to other <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> in London. It {{was built on the}} Waterloo to Reading Line. It opened in 1918 and was closed by British Railways on 6 January 1969.|$|R
50|$|Perth <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> (also {{known as}} Perth Yard) was a railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> to the {{immediate}} west of Perth railway station in Perth, Western Australia and east of West Perth railway station.|$|R
5000|$|Between 2005 {{and the end}} of 2006 the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> of Achères and Villeneuve-Saint-Georges {{closed the}} Grande Ceinture thus no longer links the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> at Le Bourget to the radial lines.|$|R
50|$|In Switzerland, {{freight traffic}} is handled {{at the three}} large <b>marshalling</b> (shunting) <b>yards</b> at Basel-Muttenz, Zurich-Limmattal and Lausanne-Triage. These <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> are {{currently}} operated by SBB Infrastructure. From January 2015, SBB Cargo will take over responsibility for planning and production at the domestic <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> in Limmattal and Lausanne on behalf of SBB Infrastructure. SBB Cargo will therefore now {{be responsible for the}} entire production process for freight traffic - from collecting the freight wagons from the customer and shunting them in the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> right through to delivering them to the recipients. However, SBB Infrastructure will retain responsibility for the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> themselves, remain the contact partner for rail transport activities and continue to ensure the provision of traffic control, thus guaranteeing equal treatment.|$|R
50|$|The {{first section}} ("south ring") was opened on 1 October 1898 {{and joined the}} lines from Crailsheim, from Augsburg and from Regensburg with the Rangierprovisorium (temporary <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard)</b> {{on the site of}} today's Nuremberg <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> (Nürnberg Rbf).|$|R
50|$|The Halle (Saale) <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> on {{both sides}} of the tracks to the east next to the {{passenger}} station was formerly important, but is largely closed today. A modern <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> is planned to be built on the same site however.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} basic directions in transport junctions? abroad {{in the second}} half of the XX century. The sorting works? concentration and structural changes in the schemes for the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> are given in the article as well. The history shows that in the postwar practice abroad much attention was paid to rational distribution of reconstructed and newly erected <b>marshalling</b> railway <b>yards.</b> In most cases for a long period the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> were developing according to private interests of railway societies. In the second half of the XX century changes in the countries? economies and in the railway operational conditions determined more rational distribution of the railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> in the rail network of every country. The history of science and technology testifies that when modern railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> abroad were reconstructed, they were equipped with newest technical devices providing self-routing, automatic cars? braking by means of moderators etc. The research of the sorting works? concentration and structural changes in the schemes for railway <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> is of extreme topicality nowadays. ? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ????? ?? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?? ????. ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ???? ????????????? ??????????????? ???????. ??????? ???????????????, ??? ??????? ???????? ? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ???????. ? ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ??????? ??????????? ? ??????? ??????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??????????????? ???????. ????????? ????????? ????? ? ??????? ?????? ???????? ????? ?? ?????? ???????? ?? ???? ?????????? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????? ?? ???? ???? ???????? ????? ?????? ?????????? ??????. ??????? ????? ? ??????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ? ???? ????????????? ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????, ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????????, ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????????? ? ??. ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???? ????????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ? ? ???? ?????...|$|R
50|$|On 1 December 1941, a {{new line}} was opened between Ranam and Ch'ŏngjin to allow trains to bypass the Ch'ŏngjin <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard.</b> The {{existing}} line, running via Kangdŏk and the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard,</b> was detached from the Hamgyeong Line and designated the Kangdŏk Line; at the same time, a 2.4 km connection from Ch'ŏngjin Sŏhang Station (Ch'ŏngjin West Port, today called Songp'yŏng) to Kangdŏk was built, to allow southbound trains to access the <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> without having to reverse at Ranam.|$|R
50|$|Wagonload traffic {{typically}} {{consists of}} individual wagons load with goods at separate locations (goods shed), transferred to <b>marshalling</b> <b>yards</b> where the wagons are sorted by destination, then transported to a destination <b>marshalling</b> <b>yard</b> where individual wagons are separated and collected into trains per destination.|$|R
