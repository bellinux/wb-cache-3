40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{forecasting}} accuracy of bankruptcy hazard rate models for U. S. companies {{over the time}} period 1962 – 1999 using both yearly and monthly observation intervals. The contribution {{of this paper is}} <b>multiple-fold.</b> One, using an expanded bankruptcy database we validate the superior forecasting performance of Shumway’s (2001) model as opposed to Altman (1968) and Zmijewski (1984). Two, we demonstrate the importance of including industry effects in hazard rate estimation. Industry groupings are shown to significantly affect both the intercept and slope coeffi-cients in the forecasting equations. Three, we extend the hazard rate model to apply to financial firms and monthly observation intervals. Due to data limitations, most of the existing literature employs only yearly observations. We show that bankruptcy prediction is markedly improved using monthly observation intervals. Fourth, consistent with the notion of market efficiency with respect to publicly available information, we demonstrate that accounting variables add little predictive power when market variables are already included in the bankruptcy model. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{differential}} delay time is proposed for refraction static correction without picking first arrival {{times in the}} CDP reflection data processing. This new method is a modification of the ABCD method; it uses cross-correlation to measure the first arrival time difference between signals received at stations B and C, instead of directly computing them from their picked times. By taking advantage of <b>multiple-fold</b> CDP data, we apply the "line-up trace" measurement of cross-correlations, which may alleviate the effect of data imperfections. The problem of refractor velocity variation has also been solved to a certain extent, which allows for a reliable delay time to be adequately estimated for each station and consequently the static correction value. A synthetic model and a real case with a severe weathered layer problem have been tested to evaluate the method. Stable and man age able computation processes have been explored to attain the maximum performance. The results are quite satisfactory.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{possibility}} of getting infinite energy {{in the center of}} mass frame of colliding charged particles in a general stationary charged black hole. For black holes with two-fold degenerate horizon, it is found that arbitrary high center-of-mass energy can be attained, provided that one of the particle has critical angular momentum or critical charge, and the remained parameters of particles and black holes satisfy certain restriction. For black holes with <b>multiple-fold</b> degenerate event horizons, the restriction is released. For non-degenerate black holes, the ultra-high center-of-mass is possible to be reached by invoking the multiple scattering mechanism. We obtain a condition for the existence of innermost stable circular orbit with critical angular momentum or charge on any-fold degenerate horizons, which is essential to get ultra-high center-of-mass energy without fine-tuning problem. We also discuss the proper time spending by the particle to reach the horizon and the duality between frame dragging effect and electromagnetic interaction. Some of these general results are applied to braneworld small black holes. Comment: 23 pages, no figures, revised version accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{techniques}} can bring numerous benefits, such as higher spectral efficiency, to point-to-point wireless links. More recently, there has been interest in extending MIMO concepts to multiuser wireless systems. Our focus in this paper is on network MIMO, a family of techniques whereby each end user in a wireless access network is served through several access points within its range of influence. By tightly coordinating the transmission and reception of signals at multiple access points, network MIMO can transcend the limits on spectral efficiency imposed by cochannel interference. Taking prior information-theoretic analyses of network MIMO to the next level, we quantify the spectral efficiency gains obtainable under realistic propagation and operational conditions in a typical indoor deployment. Our study relies on detailed simulations and, for specificity, is conducted largely within the physical-layer framework of the IEEE 802.16 e Mobile WiMAX system. Furthermore, to facilitate the coordination between access points, we assume that a high-capacity local area network, such as Gigabit Ethernet, connects all the access points.

40|$|Frequency {{facilitation}} (FF), comprising a {{rapid and}} <b>multiple-fold</b> {{increase in the}} magnitude of evoked field potentials, is elicited by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) at mossy fiber [...] CA 3 synapses. Here, we show that in freely behaving rats, FF reliably occurs in response to 1 and 2 Hz but not in response to 0. 25 -, 0. 3 -, or 0. 5 -Hz LFS. Strikingly, prolonged (~ 600 s) FF was tightly correlated to the induction of longterm depression (LTD) in freely moving animals. Although LFS at 2 Hz elicited unstable FF and unstable LTD, application of LFS at 1 Hz elicited pronounced FF, as well as robust LTD that persisted for over 24 h. This correlation of prolonged FF with LTD was absent at stimulation frequencies that did not induce FF. The adenosine-A 1 receptor appears to participate in these effects: Application of adenosine-A 1, but not adenosine-A 3, receptor antagonists enhanced mossy fiber synaptic transmission and occluded FF. Furthermore, adenosine-A 1 receptor antagonism resulted in more stable FF at 1 or 2 Hz and elicited more potent LTD. These data support the fact that FF contributes to the enablement of long-term information storage at mossy fiber [...] CA 3 synapses and that the adenosine-A 1 receptor may regulate the thresholds for this process...|$|E

The influence of PLGA/AgNpPGA/AscH particles on (i) viability and superoxide production of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro, (ii) morphology and expression of osteogenic markers in osteoblastic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells in vitro, and (iii) antimicrobial activity against a Gram-positive bacterium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, was investigated. PLGA/AgNpPGA/AscH nanoparticles showed a superior and extended antibacterial activity against both types of bacteria. The nanoparticles appeared {{to be capable of}} delivering ascorbate to the cells, which was evidenced by the significant decrease in the level of superoxides in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and which could have a therapeutic potential in preventing oxidative stress. PLGA/AgNpPGA/AscH nanoparticles had a positive effect on MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblastic cells in vitro, promoting: (i) an intimate contact with the cells and preservation of their healthy morphologies; (ii) unreduced cell viability; and (iii) <b>multiple-fold</b> upregulation of two osteogenic markers: osteocalcin and type I procollagen.

40|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{wireless}} technology is an emerging cost effective approach to offer <b>multiple-fold</b> capacity improvement {{relative to the}} conventional single-antenna systems. To achieve the capacities of MIMO channels, MIMO bit-interleaved-coded-modulation (BICM) systems with iterative detection and decoding (IDD) are studied in this thesis. The research for this dissertation is conducted based on the iterative receivers with convolutional codes and turbo codes. A variety of MIMO detectors, such as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector, a list sphere detector (LSD) and a parallel interference canceller (PIC) together with a decision statistic combiner (DSC), are studied. The performance of these iterative receivers is investigated via bounding techniques or Monte-Carlos simulations. Moreover, the computational complexities of the components are quantified and compared. The convergence behaviors of the iterative receivers are analyzed via variance transfer (VTR) functions and variance exchange graphs (VEGs). The analysis of convergence behavior facilitates the finding of components with good matching. For a fast fading channel, we show that the waterfall region of an iterative receiver can be predicted by VEG. For a slow fading channel, it is shown that the performance of an iterative receiver is essentially limited by the early interception ratio (ECR) which is obtained via simulations. After the transfer properties of the detectors are unveiled, a detection switching (DSW) methodology is proposed and the switching criterion based on cross entropy (CE) is derived. By employing DSW, the performance of an iterative receiver with a list sphere detector (LSD) of a small list size is considerably improved. It is shown that the iterative receiver achieves a performance very close to that with a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector but with a significantly reduced complexity. For an iterative receiver with more than two components, various iteration schedules are explored. The schedules are applied in an iterative receiver with PIC-DSC. It is shown that the iterative receiver with a periodic scheduling outperforms that with the conventional scheduling {{at the same level}} of complexity...|$|E

A subset of individuals was additionally genotyped for Y-STR loci included in the Yfiler and PowerPlex Y 23 (PPY 23) systems (75 % and 62 %, respectively), allowing the comparison of RM and conventional Y-STRs. Considering the whole set of 13 RM Y-STRs, 1501 unique haplotypes were observed among the 1509 sampled Italian men with a haplotype diversity of 0. 999996, largely superior to Yfiler and PPY 23 with 0. 999914 and 0. 999950, respectively. AMOVA indicated that 99. 996 % of the haplotype variation was within populations, confirming that genetic-geographic structure is almost undetected by RM Y-STRs. Haplotype sharing among regional Italian populations was not observed at all with the complete set of 13 RM Y-STRs. Haplotype sharing within Italian populations was very rare (0. 27 % non-unique haplotypes), and lower in urban (0. 22 %) than rural (0. 29 %) areas. Additionally, 422 father-son pairs were investigated, and 20. 1 % {{of them could be}} discriminated by the whole set of 13 RM Y-STRs, which was very close to the theoretically expected estimate of 19. 5 % given the mutation rates of the markers used.

30|$|Energy-efficient sleep {{schedule}} with {{service coverage}} guarantee is firstly given by Zhang et al. in [20]. The mathematical {{relationships among the}} QoC, the number of working nodes, {{the size of the}} sensing area, and the sensing ranges of the sensor nodes are derived while no location information is required in this algorithm. Based on the mathematical relationship, three scheduling strategies are proposed, i.e., Efficient Coverage Algorithm Based on Node Scheduling Strategy (ECNSS) [21], Energy-efficient Multi-target Coverage Control Protocol (EMCCP) [22], and Efficient Rendezvous algorithms for mobility-enabled (ERME) [23]. In these three scheduling schemes, the working nodes are chosen in completely a random method, which may result in the instability of the QoC. Furthermore, the limited delay mechanism is employed in the scheduling schemes to ensure that all the data can be collected within the monitoring area. Liu et al. [24] derived the mathematical relationships among the QoC, the size of the network monitoring area, the sensing range of the nodes, and the node density. Again, the location information is not needed for the QoC during the derivation. Also included are three methods to evaluate the coverage, i.e., partial coverage, node coverage, and monitoring ability. A further modification was made based on the protocol in [25], and the energy balance strategy was introduced. The working nodes are chosen according to the remained energy, and optimization is performed on the distribution of working nodes. Therefore, the network lifetime is further prolonged. An extension of the results in [26] was made in [27], and the influence of edge effects is considered. As a result, the analytical results are more accurate and many <b>multiple-fold</b> coverage problems can be analyzed. Zeng et al. [28] studied the coverage problem for the sensor network where the node deployment satisfies the two-dimension normal distribution. Wu et al. [29] proposed a probability-based calculation method for the node redundancy degree, according to which, the node could independently calculate its own redundancy degree. Furthermore, a node scheduling protocol, lightweight deployment-aware scheduling (LDAS) is proposed with no location information required. However, the sponsorship of the two-hop neighbors for the sensing area of the nodes is neglected. As a result, many of the working nodes chosen by the LDAS algorithm are redundant. A joint scheduling algorithm is proposed by Chen et al. [30] which adds more working nodes to guarantee the network connectivity with the required QoC.|$|E
40|$|Pharmacogenetics is {{the study}} of {{variability}} in drug response attributed to genetic variation. Olanzapine (OLA) is a widely used antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia treatment. The pharmacokinetics of OLA display large inter-individual variation leading to <b>multiple-fold</b> differences in drug exposure between patients at a given dose. This variation in turn gives rise to the need of individualized dosing in order to avoid concentration-dependent adverse effects and therapeutic failure. The observed variability has been partially explained by environmental and physiological factors. Genetically determined differences in drug metabolism represent a less studied source of variability. Precluded contribution by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 D 6 calls for evaluation of the other major OLA metabolizing enzymes. The objective of this thesis was to study pharmacogenetic influence of flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) 1 and 3, CYP 1 A 2 and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1 A 4 on therapeutic OLA exposure. We conducted genetic association studies applying gene re-sequencing and genotyping of candidate and tagging SNPs. Patients carrying the FMO 1 * 6 allele displayed increased dose-adjusted concentrations (C/Ds) of OLA, in serum as well as cerebrospinal fluid. Patients who were homozygous for the FMO 3 K 158 -G 308 compound variant showed reduced C/Ds of OLA N-oxide metabolite, but no alteration in OLA exposure. This compound variant is expected to have clinical relevance primarily for non-African populations, since low frequencies were detected among native Africans. Deviation in OLA exposure was observed in carrier of a rare FMO 3 mutation, predicted in silico to affect gene splicing. Reduced OLA exposure was observed in UGT 1 A 4 * 3 carriers. The CYP 1 A 2 - 163 (A) (CYP 1 A 2 * 1 F) variant was not associated with increase in CYP 1 A 2 -catalyzed OLA metabolism or reduction in OLA exposure. Correlations were detected for two cis-acting variants within the inter-genetic region of the CYP 1 A cluster and a trans-acting variant located upstream the locus encoding aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The inconsistent data reported for CYP 1 A 2 * 1 F could be explained by presence of ethnic specific haplotype structures incorporating the - 163 (A) variant. A continuously improved understanding of the wide range of factors that can influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will increase the likelihood of achieving optimal treatment response for individual patients...|$|E
