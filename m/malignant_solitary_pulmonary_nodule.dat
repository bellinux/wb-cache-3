Experts’ beliefs may help fill these {{knowledge}} gaps and explain variation in clinical practices. MethodsUsing a modified Delphi process, we surveyed a group of lung cancer experts about tumor growth, disease progression, and prognosis in patients with malignant SPN. After completing the first survey, experts were given the opportunity during a second survey to revise their responses in light of their peers’ beliefs. ResultsThe response rate was 100 % (14 of 14) for both surveys. There was consensus that disease progression depends on the tumor growth rate, that survival for patients with untreated lung cancer is approximated by a declining exponential function, and that treatment is delayed by approximately 1 tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) in patients who undergo a period of “watchful waiting. ” Just over half of experts (8 of 14) agreed that lung cancer progresses in three steps (from local to regional to distant disease), whereas 43 % (6 of 14) preferred a 2 -step model (from local to systemic disease). Likewise, 64 % of experts (9 of 14) believed that malignant nodules grow exponentially, whereas 36 % (5 of 14) believed that growth is slower than exponential. Experts’ estimates of the risk of disease progression during a period of observation lasting 1 TVDT varied from 1 to 50 %. Estimates of 5 -year survival for patients in whom diagnosis and treatment were delayed by 1 TVDT varied between 40 % and 80 %.

Fourty-eight patients with malignant SPN were included (NCT 01931579). The diagnostic accuracy for lung cancer using r-EBUS coupled with pCLE imaging was 79. 2 %.

Normalized IC (NIC), slope of the spectral HU curve (λHU) and net CT number enhancement on 70 keV images were calculated. The two-sample t-test was used to compare quantitative parameters. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to calculate sensitivity and specificity. There were 63 nodules, with 37 malignant nodules (59 %) and 26 benign nodules (41 %). NIC, λHU and net CT number enhancement on 70 keV images for malignant nodules were all greater than those of benign nodules.

It is important to differentiate malignant nodules from benign nodules in the least invasive way and to make as specific and an accurate diagnosis as possible. In patients with a high probability of malignancy, surgery is the preferred strategy. Diagnostic algorithm for approaching the <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodule,</b> stratifying clinical risk factors in a standardized manner and blending this information with radiologic clues, would point the physician toward a benign or malignant cause. Such an approach {{would be expected to}} spare patients with benign causes the morbidity and cost associated with invasive tissue sampling and, at the same time, guide the physician toward recommending invasive tests for the nodules likely to be malignant...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT) -guided percutaneous lung biopsy for <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules.</b> Three hundred and eleven patients (211 males and 100 females), {{with a mean}} age of 59. 6 years (range, 19 - 87 years), who were diagnosed with <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> and underwent CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy between January 2008 and January 2014 were reviewed. All patients were confirmed by surgery or the clinical course. The overall diagnostic accuracy and incidence of complications were calculated, and the factors influencing these were statistically evaluated and compared. Specimens were successfully obtained from all 311 patients. A total of 217 and 94 cases were found to be malignant and benign lesions, respectively, by biopsy. Two hundred and twenty-five (72. 3 %) carcinomas, 78 (25. 1 %) benign lesions, and 8 (2. 6 %) inconclusive lesions were confirmed by surgery and the clinical course. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy were 92. 9 %, 95. 3 %, and 95. 7 %, respectively. The incidences of pneumothorax and self-limiting bleeding were 17. 7 % and 11. 6 %, respectively. Taking account of all evidence, CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy for <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodules</b> is an efficient, and safe diagnostic method associated with few complications...|$|R
40|$|The <b>solitary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>nodule</b> (SPN) {{has always}} been a {{diagnostic}} challenge for the radiologists. Currently, with increased utilization of computed tomography (CT) greater number of nodules is being discovered, with numerous indeterminate lesions, which frequently cannot be immediately classified into benign or malignant category. In this article we review the imaging features of benign and malignant round opacities; we demonstrate currently used standards and also more advanced techniques that are helpful in evaluating SPNs such as contrast-enhanced CT, PET/CT imaging and also pathologic sampling with biopsy or surgical resection. We also summarize the methods of evaluating and managing SPNs based on the latest guidelines from the Fleischner Society and American College of Chest Physicians.
