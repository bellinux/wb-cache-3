5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} people joining {{organised}} dog sports with their terriers. The obedience training required at a certain level in most dog sports is fairly easy, though the precision and long-lasting drive needed in the higher levels <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to achieve. Many Irish Terriers excel in dog agility, even though it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to balance the speed, independence and precision needed in the higher levels. To date there is one Agility Champion in the US, {{and a handful of}} Finnish and Swedish Irish terriers compete at the most difficult classes.|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} in {{applying}} the same logic, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> {{to solve a}} 25-case problem {{than it would be}} to solve an n-case problem, and then apply it to the case where n=25.|$|R

25|$|They can be {{as small}} as 1-5mm in diameter, but can also grow or spread into large masses in the genital or anal area. In some cases they look like small stalks. They <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> ("keratinized") or soft. Their color can be variable, and {{sometimes}} they may bleed.|$|E
25|$|Although it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{today to}} {{understand}} the allure of the caloric theory, {{at the time it}} seemed to have some clear advantages. Carnot's successful theory of heat engines had also been based on the caloric assumption, and only later was it proved by Lord Kelvin that Carnot's mathematics were equally valid without assuming a caloric fluid.|$|E
25|$|However, if {{short-term}} memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons, {{as well as}} intra-neural dynamic processes, the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to extract. The uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning.|$|E
30|$|Assessment of AIA {{symptoms}} in bipolar mania could enable physicians to identify patients with more severe depressive symptoms, allowing for appropriate intervention.

25|$|Soft Mouth Springers {{are taught}} to deliver game with a soft mouth, meaning he does not {{puncture}} it with his teeth. The game should always be fit for the table. If a springer damages the bird, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> mouthed. This is a serious fault, {{but it can be}} difficult to determine whether it may have been genetic or caused by poor training methods. Breeders generally avoid using any springer that is hard mouthed.|$|E
25|$|Mimicry and {{camouflage}} enable {{animals to}} appear to be other than they are. Prey animals may appear as predators, or vice versa; both predators and prey <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to see (crypsis), or may be mistaken for other objects (mimesis). In Batesian mimicry, harmless animals may appear to be distasteful or poisonous. In automimicry, animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.|$|E
25|$|All {{proposed}} {{solar radiation}} management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at {{tens of billions of}} US dollars annually. Space sunshades would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to agree. However, the more effective {{solar radiation management}} proposals currently appear to have low enough direct implementation costs that {{it would be in the}} interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the thyroid}} and adrenal gland can be infiltrated. It is {{estimated}} that 10-20% of individuals with amyloidosis have hypothyroidism. Adrenal infiltration <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to appreciate given that its symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and low blood sodium concentration <b>may</b> <b>be</b> attributed to autonomic neuropathy and heart failure.|$|R
50|$|Though transposable {{elements}} were discovered {{due in large}} part to their deleterious effects, epigenetic research has shown that they <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> in some cases, beneficial to the host organism.(1,5) This research indicates that the distinction between those two aspects, mutualist and parasite, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to accurately describe than was once thought.|$|R
5000|$|Fat-finger {{errors are}} {{a product of}} the {{electronic}} processing of orders which requires details to be input using keyboards.

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{intangible}} performance include status symbols, {{such as a}} corner office, and increased autonomy and freedom. Increased autonomy demonstrates trust in an employee, may decrease occupational stress and improve job satisfaction. A 2010 study found positive relationships between job satisfaction and life satisfaction, happiness at work, positive affect, {{and the absence of}} negative affect which may also be interrelated with work motivation. Since it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> for an employee to achieve a similar level of trust in a new organization, increased autonomy may also help improve retention.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of a symbol for a chord defines {{the root of the}} chord. The root of the chord is always played by one of the {{instruments}} in the ensemble (usually by a bass instrument). Failure to include the root means that the indicated chord <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> to hear for some listeners. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are below.|$|E
25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> {{to discern the}} light flanks present {{in many of these}} waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they never seem to show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{customers}} who use motorized shopping carts are not full-time wheelchair users, but find shopping easier using the device since a regular cart <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to push, especially when filled with merchandise, and walking through a large store <b>may</b> <b>be</b> cumbersome for one {{who is able to}} walk only short distances on their own power.|$|R
50|$|Schaum's Outlines {{are part}} of the {{educational}} supplements niche of book publishing. They are a staple in the educational sections of retail bookstores, where books on subjects such as chemistry and calculus <b>may</b> <b>be</b> found.
