5|$|Nonstandard {{amino acids}} are usually formed through {{modifications}} to standard amino acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway {{or by the}} demethylation of <b>methionine</b> via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl <b>methionine,</b> while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.|$|E
5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a <b>methionine</b> auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing <b>methionine)</b> in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any <b>methionine</b> residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E

5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of <b>methionine</b> (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of <b>methionine</b> as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
5|$|Although {{far less}} common than other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include <b>methionine</b> aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are usually}} {{continuously}} regenerated and their concentrations maintained {{at a steady}} level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and S-adenosylmethionine by <b>methionine</b> adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian copper {{transporter}} 1 (CTR 1) is a high-affinity copper influx transporter {{that also}} mediates the uptake of platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin (cDDP). <b>Methionines</b> 150, 154, and histidine 139 {{have been proposed}} to form a series of stacked rings in the pore formed by the CTR 1 homotrimer, {{each of which is}} required for maximal copper transport. To examine the mechanism by which hCTR 1 also transports cDDP, variant forms of hCTR 1 in which <b>methionines</b> 150 and 154 were converted to isoleucines or in which histidine 139 was converted to alanine were re-expressed in cells in which both alleles of CTR 1 had been knocked out. Each of these conversions disabled copper transport and increased cellular resistance to the cytotoxic effect of copper. In contrast, conversion of the <b>methionines</b> increased the uptake and cytotoxicity of cDDP well above that attained with wild-type hCTR 1. Conversion of His 139 to alanine did not impair cDDP uptake and actually enhanced cytotoxicity. Thus, although Met 150 and Met 154 facilitate the movement of copper through the pore, they serve to obstruct the passage of cDDP. None of the modifications altered the ability of cDDP to trigger the degradation of hCTR 1, indicating that cDDP must interact with hCTR 1 at other sites as well. Although both copper and cDDP may rely on a series of transchelation reactions to pass through the hCTR 1 trimeric complex, the details of the molecular interactions must be different, which provides a potential basis for selective pharmacological modulation of copper versus cDDP cytotoxicity...|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, <b>methionine,</b> threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{and plants}} can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain {{some of the}} amino acids from the diet. The amino acids that an organism cannot synthesize on its own {{are referred to as}} essential amino acids. Key enzymes that synthesize certain amino acids are not present in animals — such as aspartokinase, which catalyses {{the first step in the}} synthesis of lysine, <b>methionine,</b> and threonine from aspartate. If amino acids are present in the environment, microorganisms can conserve energy by taking up the amino acids from their surroundings and downregulating their biosynthetic pathways.|$|E
5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and <b>methionine),</b> nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
40|$|Polar coastal seawaters are {{saturated}} by high oxygen concentrations, which impose {{very effective}} adaptive strategies to strive against a continuous environmental oxidative stress. We studied these strategies in Euplotes nobilii (Ciliophora: Spirotrichea), a ciliate species dwelling in Antarctic and Arctic coastal seawaters, {{in comparison with}} Euplotes raikovi, a sister species living in temperate seawaters. Cell samples of the two species were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -induced oxidative stress and analyzed for their survival rates and levels of expression of the genes encoding the enzyme methionine-sulfoxide reductase (Msr) A, which restores oxidized <b>methionines</b> (in their S form) of damaged proteins {{to the status of}} functional <b>methionines.</b> While 6 h of exposure to a 750 -µM concentration of H 2 O 2 did not affect E. nobilii viability, these conditions were lethal to E. raikovi. In correlation with this inter-specific difference in the cell survival to oxidative stress, the MsrA-coding genes of the two species showed different mechanisms of expression: constitutive in E. nobilii, elicited by induction in E. raikovi...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Autosomal {{recessive}} congenital short bowel {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in CLMP. No mutations {{were found in the}} affected males of a family with presumed X-linked congenital short bowel syndrome or in an isolated male patient. Our aim was to identify the disease-causing mutation in these patients. Methods: We performed mutation analysis of the second exon of FLNA in the two surviving affected males of the presumed X-linked family and in the isolated patient. Results: We identified a novel 2 -base-pair deletion in the second exon of FLNA in all these male patients. The deletion is located between two nearby <b>methionines</b> at the N-terminus of filamin A. Previous studies showed that translation of FLNA occurs from both <b>methionines,</b> resulting in two isoforms of the protein. We hypothesized that the longer isoform is no longer translated due to the mutation and that this mutation is therefore not lethal for males in utero. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize that congenital short bowel syndrome can be the presenting symptom in male patients with mutations in FLNA. Genet Med 2013 : 15 (4) : 310 - 31...|$|R
40|$|The small {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} (sHsps) possess a chaperone-like activity which prevents aggregation of other proteins during transient heat or oxidative stress. The sHsps bind, onto their surface, molten globule forms of other proteins, thereby keeping {{them in a}} refolding competent state. In Hsp 21, a chloroplast-located sHsp in all higher plants, there is a highly conserved region forming an amphipathic α-helix with several <b>methionines</b> on the hydrophobic side according to secondary structure prediction. This paper describes how sulfoxidation of the <b>methionines</b> in this amphipathic α-helix caused conformational changes {{and a reduction in}} the Hsp 21 oligomer size, and a complete loss of the chaperone-like activity. Concomitantly, there was a loss of an outer-surface located α-helix as determined by limited proteolysis and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The present data indicate that the methionine-rich amphipathic α-helix, a motif of unknown physiological significance which evolved during the land plant evolution, is crucial for binding of substrate proteins and has rendered the chaperone-like activity of Hsp 21 very dependent on the chloroplast redox state...|$|R
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and <b>methionine</b> have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for <b>methionine.</b> Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a primary transcript) using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue {{to their}} high hydrophobicity, it is a {{challenge}} to obtain high yields of transmembrane peptides for structural and functional characterization. In the present work, a robust method is developed for the expression, purification and reconstitution of transmembrane peptides, especially for those containing conserved <b>methionines.</b> By using a truncated and mutated glutathione-S-transferase construct as the carrier protein and hydroxylamine (which specifically cleaves the peptide bond between Asn and Gly) as the cleavage reagent, 10  mg of the first transmembrane helix of CorA, a Mg 2 + transporter from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can be conveniently obtained with high purity from 1  L of M 9 minimal media under optimized conditions. The biophysical properties of the peptide were studied by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the results show that this CorA peptide is well folded in detergent micelles and the secondary structure is very similar to that in recent crystal structures. In addition, this CorA construct is oligomeric in perfluoro-octanoic acid micelles. The compatibility with the transmembrane peptides containing conserved <b>methionines,</b> the high yield and the simple process make the present method competitive with other commonly used methods to produce such peptides for structural and functional studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{determinants}} for specificity in the Ca 2 +-dependent {{response of}} the regulatory N-terminal domain of skeletal troponin-C are a combination of intrinsic and induced properties. We characterized computationally the intrinsic propensity of this domain for structural changes similar to those observed experimentally in the Ca 2 +-induced transition. The preference for such changes was assessed by comparing the structural effect of the harmonic and quasiharmonic vibrations specific for each Ca 2 + occupancy with crystallographic data. Results show that only the Ca 2 +-saturated form of the protein features a slow vibrational motion preparatory for the transition. From the characteristics of this mode, we identified a molecular mechanism for transition, by which residues 42 - 51 of helix B and of the adjacent linker move toward helices (A, D), and bind to the surface used by the protein to interact with troponin-I. By obstructing the access of the target to hydrophobic residues important {{in the formation of}} the complex, helix B and the adjacent linker act as an autoinhibitory structural element. Specific properties of the <b>methionines</b> at the interaction surface were found to favor the binding of the autoinhibitory region. Located over hydrophobic residues critical for binding, the <b>methionines</b> are easily displaceable to increase the accessibility of these residues to molecular encounter...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{mammalian}} innate immune response, Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 can signal via the adaptor protein TRIF/TICAM- 1 {{to elicit}} the production of type-I interferons and cytokines. Recent studies have suggested an autoinhibitory role for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of TRIF. This domain has no significant sequence similarity to proteins of known structure. In this paper, the crystallization and X-ray diffraction analysis of TRIF-NTD and its selenomethionine- labelled mutant TRIF-NTDA 66 M/L 113 M are reported. Thin plate-like crystals of native TRIF-NTD obtained using polyethylene glycol 3350 as precipitant diffracted X-rays to 1. 9 A ° resolution. To facilitate phase determination, two additional <b>methionines</b> were incorporated into the protein at positions chosen based on the occurrence of <b>methionines</b> in TRIF homologues in different species. Crystals of the selenomethionine-labelled protein were obtained under conditions similar to the wild-type protein; these crystals diffracted X-rays to 2. 5 A ° resolution. The TRIF-NTD and TRIF-NTDA 66 M/L 113 M crystals have the symmetry of space groups P 212121 and P 1, and most likely contain two and four molecules in the asymmetric unit, respectively. These results provide a sound foundation for the future structure determination of this novel domain. M. Obayed Ullah, Thomas Ve, Jameris Dkhar, Mohammed Alaidarous, Daniel J. Ericsson, Matthew J.

In this work, we decided to fully oxidise calmodulin in order to study the consequences on cation binding, domain stability, and alpha helicity. Oxidation of <b>methionines</b> unfolds completely the apostate of the protein, which upon calcium binding recovers the major part of its secondary and tertiary structure.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we address the {{oxidative}} modifications {{accounting for the}} structural and functional impairment of the actomyosin complex under the oxidative stress mediated by peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Experiments on purified myosin and actin have shown that submicromolar ONOO- concentrations produce strong inhibition of the F-actin stimulated myosin ATPase activity. The peroxynitrite-induced actomyosin impairment correlated with structural modifications that decrease the thermal stability of both actin and myosin leading to partially unfolded states. The results suggest a major role for the highly reactive cysteines on actin and on myosin and also for some critical <b>methionines</b> on G-actin. 3 -nitrotyrosine does not contribute significantly to the observed functional alterations...|$|R
