5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{are often}} preceded by certain experiences, known as auras. They include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena. Jerking activity <b>may</b> <b>start</b> {{in a specific}} muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it {{is known as a}} Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.|$|E

5|$|Jet streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main jet streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. Jet streams <b>may</b> <b>start,</b> stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Several L half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. Like impedance must always face like in these combinations. There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L half-sections. Where ZiT faces ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section formed is a T section. Further additions of half-sections to either of these forms a ladder network which <b>may</b> <b>start</b> and end with series or shunt elements.|$|E
5|$|The player may suspend {{and save}} the game at any time.

5|$|Water pipits {{leave their}} {{breeding}} sites from mid-September, although the eastern subspecies <b>may</b> <b>start</b> moving south before then. The spring migration starts in February and March, with arrival on the breeding grounds in April and May. The water pipit {{has been recorded}} as a vagrant in Belarus, Gibraltar and Latvia, and on islands including the Canaries, Iceland, Malta and Svalbard.|$|E
5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration <b>may</b> <b>start</b> as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, {{but the majority of}} birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the common}} {{presentation}} of acute low back pain, pain develops after movements that involve lifting, twisting, or forward-bending. The symptoms <b>may</b> <b>start</b> {{soon after the}} movements or upon waking up the following morning. The description of the symptoms may range from tenderness at a particular point to diffuse pain. It {{may or may not}} worsen with certain movements, such as raising a leg, or positions, such as sitting or standing. Pain radiating down the legs (known as sciatica) may be present. The first experience of acute low back pain is typically between the ages of 20 and 40. This is often a person's first reason to see a medical professional as an adult. Recurrent episodes occur in more than half of people with the repeated episodes being generally more painful than the first.|$|E

5|$|Several L-shape half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. Like impedance must always face like in these combinations. There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L-shaped half-sections. Where a port of image impedance ZiT faces another ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section so formed is a T section.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center track forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) track and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} track. They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) track and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the track configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern track, and trains from the yard <b>may</b> <b>start</b> service on the northern track.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females <b>may</b> <b>start</b> {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E

5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she <b>may</b> <b>start</b> grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion <b>may</b> <b>start.</b> Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure {{of the sources of}} campaign finance and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must disclose their source of funding. Campaign funding <b>may</b> <b>start</b> six months before the election day and end two weeks after the election regardless of when the costs are actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over €1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group that supports the candidate. Candidates are barred from receiving anonymous contributions of over €1,500 in value.|$|E

5|$|Within {{its native}} Northern Hemisphere range, the first-year male common {{blackbird}} of the nominate race <b>may</b> <b>start</b> singing {{as early as}} late January in fine weather {{in order to establish}} a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee, a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and chook, chook vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives chink-chink calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight. During the northern winter, blackbirds can be heard quietly singing to themselves, so much so that September and October are the only months in which the song cannot be heard. Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high seee alarm call for threats from birds of prey since the sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains <b>may</b> <b>start</b> running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the regular}} season games {{resulted}} in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in {{the rules of the game}} to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning <b>may</b> <b>start</b> within 15minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.|$|E
