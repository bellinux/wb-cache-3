5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's {{reaction}} control thrusters {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian <b>mission</b> <b>specialist,</b> Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with Atlantiss Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.|$|E
5|$|Mission specialists Jerry Ross and Bill McArthur {{inspected}} the spacesuits they would don should a spacewalk become necessary during the mating or docking operations. Following the space suit inspection, <b>Mission</b> <b>Specialist</b> Chris Hadfield powered up the orbiter's robot arm {{in preparation for}} the next day's transfer of the docking module over to Atlantiss docking system. All systems affiliated with the robot arm operated as expected and were ready to support the mating.|$|E
5|$|NASA had no {{official}} policy prohibiting women, but {{the requirement that}} astronauts had to be military test pilots effectively excluded them. NASA dropped this requirement in 1965, but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, although none as pilots. After Tereshkova, no women of any nationality would fly in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. During the late 1970s, Glenn reportedly supported Space Shuttle <b>Mission</b> <b>Specialist</b> Judith Resnik in her career.|$|E
50|$|NASA Astronaut Group 9 was {{announced}} on May 29, 1980, and completed their training by 1981. This group, composed of 19 candidates, {{was selected to}} supplement the 35 astronauts that had been selected in 1978, and {{marked the first time}} that non-Americans were trained as <b>mission</b> <b>specialists</b> with the selections of ESA astronauts Claude Nicollier and Wubbo Ockels. In keeping with the previous group, astronaut candidates were divided into pilots and <b>mission</b> <b>specialists,</b> with eight pilots, eleven <b>mission</b> <b>specialists,</b> and two international <b>mission</b> <b>specialists</b> within the group.|$|R
50|$|NASA Astronaut Group 17, (the Penguins), {{were chosen}} by NASA in 1998. The group of 32 {{candidates}} included eight pilots, 17 <b>mission</b> <b>specialists,</b> and seven international <b>mission</b> <b>specialists</b> who become NASA astronauts. They began training in August 1998.|$|R
50|$|NASA Astronaut Group 20 (The Chumps) saw the {{training}} of nine <b>mission</b> <b>specialists,</b> and five international <b>mission</b> <b>specialists</b> to become NASA astronauts. These 14 astronauts began training in August 2009 and officially graduated as astronauts on 4 November 2011.|$|R
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 <b>mission</b> <b>specialist,</b> {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Kelly and <b>Mission</b> <b>Specialist</b> Linda Godwin {{used the}} Shuttle's robotic arm {{to lift the}} Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module from the shuttle payload bay and attach it to a berth on the station's Unity node. The crews began {{unloading}} supplies the same day. Mission managers extended Endeavour's flight duration to 12 days to allow the crew to assist with additional maintenance tasks on the station, including work on a treadmill and replacing a failed compressor {{in one of the}} air conditioners in the Zvezda Service Module. A change of command ceremony took place on December 13 as Expedition 3 ended and Expedition 4 began. STS-108 returned to Earth with the previous ISS crew of three men.|$|E
5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian <b>mission</b> <b>specialist</b> Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items {{between the}} two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. The aim was to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E
50|$|NASA Astronaut Group 19 (The Peacocks). The group saw the {{training}} of two pilots, six <b>mission</b> <b>specialists,</b> three educator <b>mission</b> <b>specialists</b> to become NASA astronauts. These 11 astronauts began training in 2004.This was the last group to fly Space Shuttles.|$|R

5|$|The {{origin of}} Cortana is not {{explained}} in the video games, but in the Halo novels. Her first chronological appearance in the story is in , a 2001 prequel to the first Halo game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana makes a reference to this event via voiceover in Halo 3 during a cinematic before gameplay begins. Cortana and the Spartans are assigned a near-suicidal mission: to take the cruiser Pillar of Autumn to the home world of the Covenant, an alliance of alien races, and capture one of their Prophets to force a truce. Cortana's role is {{to act as a}} <b>mission</b> <b>specialist,</b> hacking the Covenant systems and piloting the captured Covenant ship. Before the mission, Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's MJOLNIR battle armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of Colonel Ackerson, the ONI operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. When the Covenant attacks the planet Reach, one of the largest planetary military bases besides Earth, Cortana guides the Pillar of Autumn based on star charts on a Forerunner tablet, thus bringing them to Halo. During , Cortana serves the same role she did in Halo: Combat Evolved, but her role is expanded such as showing her saving the Master Chief's life from a Flood Infection Form at one point.|$|E
