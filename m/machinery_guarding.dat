50|$|In {{common with}} most of Europe and North America, Australian State Parliaments {{have responded to the}} problem of {{workplace}} illness, injury, and death by enacting legislation regulating workplace hazards. Until the 1970s and 80s, these standards were generally detailed and technical, focusing mainly on prescriptive measures such as specifying <b>machinery</b> <b>guarding</b> measures to be adopted to prevent injury to workers operating dangerous machinery. Beginning in 2008, state and federal regulations were harmonised, giving greater clarity and consistency in the legislation in effect in the various states.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an empirically based {{study of the}} manner in which Victorian Magistrates Courts {{constructed}} occupational health and safety (OHS) issues when hearing prosecutions for offences under the Industrial Safety, Health and Welfare Act 1981 (the ISHWA) and the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1985 (OHSA) from 1983 to 1991. These statutes established OHS standards for employers and other relevant parties. The State government enforced these standards through an OHS inspectorate which had a range of enforcement powers, including prosecution. After outlining the historical development of Victoria’s OHS legislation, the magistracy’s historical role in its enforcement, and the development of an enforcement culture in which inspectors viewed prosecution as a last resort, the study shows how the key provisions of the ISHWA and OHSA required occupiers of workplaces and employers to provide and maintain safe systems of work, including the guarding of dangerous machinery. Using a wide range of empirical research methods and legal materials, it shows how the enforcement policies, procedures and practices of the inspectorate heavily slanted inspectors workplace investigations and hence prosecutions towards a restricted and often superficial, analysis of incidents (or “events”) most of which involved injuries on machinery. There was evidence, however, that after the establishment of the Central Investigation Unit in 1989 cases were more thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. From 1990 the majority of prosecutions were taken under the employer’s general duty provisions, and by 1991 there was evidence that prosecutions were focusing on matters other than <b>machinery</b> <b>guarding...</b>|$|E
40|$|DNA-interacting {{proteins}} fulfil a {{vital role}} in the living cell. They allow the cell to quickly respond to changes in its environment by tuning the level of transcription. Furthermore, sophisticated protein <b>machineries</b> <b>guard</b> the DNA against hazardous influences that may damage it. A disruption of this delicate balance of regulation can lead to severe consequences for the cell ranging from the inability to perform certain functions to cancer or cell death. Detailed knowledge of the structure of protein-DNA complexes at atomic resolution provides valuable insights into their function and impacts on many different fields such as medical sciences, molecular biology and pharmacology. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography are the classical experimental methods used to solve the three-dimensional structure of these complexes. Although they are readily able to solve the structures of individual proteins in their free, unbound form, they often experience difficulties in solving the complex. The transient and reversible nature of protein-DNA associations, together with the difficulty of solving the structure of the DNA, makes these types of complexes a challenge to solve. This thesis deals with computational docking as alternative method to model the complex starting from the individual proteins and the DNA in their unbound form. Chapter 2 provides and overview of the young, but growing protein-DNA docking field. Its describes that the development of effective docking methods is slowed down by two main challenges; dealing with the conformational changes in both the protein and the DNA upon complex formation, and the efficiency of finding the correct interaction interface. In chapter 3, a unique two-stage protein-DNA docking method implemented in HADDOCK is described, that aims to deal with these challenges. This method uses additional experimental information about the complex to drive the docking, enabling better reconstruction of the interface. The use of explicit flexibility during the docking together with a DNA modelling stage enabled the method to deal with the conformational changes in protein and DNA upon complex formation. Chapter 4 describes the DNA analysis and modelling tool 3 D-DART, used in the modelling stage of the docking protocol. This tool, available as web server, can be used to model DNA structures with custom conformations. Chapter 5 describes a dedicated protein-DNA docking benchmark, providing a representative selection of challenging protein-DNA complexes useful for validation, development and comparison of protein-DNA docking methods. Finally, the two-stage protein-DNA docking method is challenged using this benchmark. The method was successful in accurately modelling the variety of DNA conformational changes present in the benchmark and to assemble the protein-DNA interfaces using available experimental information. Despite the excellent results, there are still a number of test cases that pose a considerable challenge to the method. However, with the methods and tools described, the stage is set for further developments, stimulating others to take the challenges and leverage protein-DNA docking to the next level of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} molecular mechanism that underlies one of the main DNA repair pathways in mammals, nucleotide excision rcpair. In chapter 1 the relevance of DNA repair in general is outlined. An overview of mammalian strategies to counteract DNA damage is provided, to show that an intricate network of repair <b>machineries</b> permanently <b>guards</b> the integrity of the genome. In discussing each repair pathway, attention is focussed on how DNA damage is removed and what protein fhetors arc required to accomplish this. Chapter I serves as a framework for chapter 2, in which one repair pathway, mammalian nucleotide excision repair, is discussed more extensively. In this chapter, a comprehensive oven,jew of the characteristics of each protein factor involved in nucleotide excision repair is given. Our own observations will be included in this overview, which will serve as a fundament to build a model that addresses the molecular steps that lead to DNA incisions around the damage, a key event in nucleotide excision repair. Additionally, a model will be presented for transcriptioncoupled repair, a phenomenon that accounts for the fast removal of DNA damage from actively transcribed template strands. The contributions of this thesis to the repair field are summarized in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6. For implications of these data, other than those discussed in chapters 1 and 2, the reader is reterred to the discussion sections that conclude each of the latter chapters...|$|R
5000|$|The {{expansion}} of the town was very rapid {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. There was a great influx of people from country areas. The poor were [...] "crowded in in offensive, dark, damp and incommodious habitations, a too fertile source of disease". Dr John Ferriar, a physician at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 1795 helped to set up a Board of Health which rented 4 houses in Portland Street belonging to the Lunatic Asylum for use as a fever hospital. He described to the Committee for the Regulation of the Police the appalling living conditions in cellars without lighting, sanitation or ventilation. People newly arrived from the country were particularly vulnerable to fevers. The Board pressed for the wheels of <b>machinery</b> to be <b>guarded</b> against accidents. A scheme for inoculating poor people for smallpox was started in 1784. Jenner's scheme of vaccination was enthusiastically adopted in 1800, and 1000 people were vaccinated in six months ...|$|R
30|$|When Hale and Hovden [1] {{reviewed}} {{the development of}} the scientific study of safety in organizations, they identified three ages of safety. The first age lasted from the 19 th century until Second World War and was concerned “with technical measures to <b>guard</b> <b>machinery,</b> stop explosions and prevent structures collapsing.” The second age focused on “personnel selection, training and motivation as prevention measures, often based on theories of accident proneness.” As late as in the 1990 s and as a reaction “to the idea that health and safety could be captured simply by matching the individual to technology,” management systems became the focus of development and research. More than a decade later, Özkan and Lajunen [2] applied this argument to safety in the context of road traffic and extended it by distinguishing four different paradigms that can be interpreted as a successive unfolding of analytical perspectives: The first period of road safety research and practice focused on technical safety measures, the second dealt primarily with behavioural and individual factors, the third was concerned with ergonomics and sociotechnical systems, and the fourth (contemporary) age deals with culture. Culture is a safety factor in its own right and became a focus of crystallization for developing safety measures and policies, especially in the US [3 – 5].|$|R
5000|$|The {{enforcement}} of UK Factory Acts before that of 1833 {{had been left}} to local magistrates, which had meant that any compliance with those acts within the cotton industry to which they applied was effectively voluntary. The initial role of the Factory Inspectorate was to ensure compliance with the limits on age and working hours for children in the cotton industry, thus protecting them from overwork and injury. Four factory inspectors were appointed, with powers equivalent to a magistrate, the right to enter at will any cotton mill at work, and powers to introduce regulations (without Parliamentary approval) to effectively implement the Factory Act. [...] The inspectors were assisted by 'superintendents', who had none of their powers (the lack of a right of entry being a particular weakness). By the Factory Act of 1844 the superintendents became 'sub-inspectors' with the right of entry at will. By the same Act, the inspectors lost their magisterial powers {{and the right to}} make regulations was transferred to the Home Secretary a duty to <b>guard</b> <b>machinery</b> was laid on employers (but only where the machinery was in areas accessed by children or young persons), the Factory Inspectorate therefore becoming concerned with the adequacy of machine guarding.|$|R
40|$|Three hazards, {{organic dust}} toxic {{syndrome}} (ODTS), confined spaces, and power take offs (PTOs) associated with farm machinery were discussed. ODTS {{is a little}} known respiratory illness that occurs following exposure to heavy concentrations of organic dusts contaminated with microorganisms. Because its symptoms, including general weakness, headache, chills, body aches, and cough, are similar {{to other forms of}} respiratory illness, it is often misdiagnosed and treated. Other common clinical characteristics of the illness included impaired pulmonary function, increase of white blood cells, and absence of antibodies typically associated with certain allergic lung disease, including farmer's lung with which it is most often confused. The risk of developing this illness can be reduced by being aware of the adverse effects of breathing organic dust when shoveling or moving organic materials such as oats, wood chips, composted leaves, and silage. Other risk reducing measures included: informing one's doctor of recent dust exposure when seeking treatment for respiratory illness, carefully harvesting and storing agricultural products to reduce spoilage, using automated or mechanized equipment to move decayed materials, using source containment, local exhaust ventilation, and wet methods of dust suppression, and using NIOSH approved respirators when exposure to organic dust cannot be avoided. Confined space hazards {{come in the form of}} manure pits, silos, vats, wells and digesters in the agricultural industry and present a multitude of risks including oxygen deficiency, flammable atmospheres, toxic gases, solvents, and mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic energy. Farm machinery presents the hazard of entanglement. A recent study reported that at least 346 farm workers aged 16 or older died from entanglement injuries between 1980 and 1989. Almost 10, 000 nonfatal entanglement injuries occurred between 1982 and 1986, 864 resulting in amputation, all caused by the use of inadequately <b>guarded</b> <b>machinery</b> and failure to follow proper safety precautions. Incidents of entanglement can be prevented by placing retrofit guards on farm equipment, disengaging the PTO, and turning off the tractor ignition before performing maintenance. DHHS publication; no.

25|$|On 16 February 1943, the Service du Travail Obligatoire (STO) {{organisation}} was created, {{requiring the}} call up of able-bodied French men {{to work in}} Germany. In the Reich, with so many men had been called up for service with the Wehrmacht and the very sexist Nazi regime reluctant to have German women work in factories as Hitler believed working damaged a woman's womb, so throughout the war the German state had a policy of bringing foreign workers to Germany to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Reports had reached France (which were true) that at the Dora works near the Buchenwald concentration camp, about 10,000 slave workers, mostly French and Russian, had to work on building V2 rockets in a vast subterranean factory in living quarters meant to house only 2, 500 people, were allowed to sleep only four and half hours every night and were regularly brutalized by the guards. The chief pleasure of the slaves, both French and Russian, at the Dora works was urinating on the <b>machinery</b> when the <b>guards</b> were not looking. The underground press gave much coverage to the conditions at the Dora works, pointed out those Frenchmen who {{went to work in}} Germany were not paid the generous wages promised by the Organisation Todt and instead were turned into slaves, all of which the underground papers used as reasons for why the French should not go to work in Germany. Under the law of 16 February 1943 all able-bodied Frenchmen aged 20–22 who were not miners, farmers and university students had to report to the STO to do two years labour in Germany. As the occupation went on, service with the STO was widened with farmers and university students losing their exempt status until the point in 1944 was reached that all fit men aged 18–60 and women aged 18–45 were being called up for service with the STO. Men over 45 and all women serving in the STO were guaranteed not to go to Germany and many were called up with the STO were put to work building the Atlantic Wall for the Organisation Todt, but those called up with the STO {{had no way of knowing}} where they would go when they entered the ranks of the STO. The so-called réfractaires attempted to avoid being called up for the STO and often went into hiding rather work in the Reich. At least 40,000 Frenchmen (80% of the resistance were people under the age of thirty) fled to the countryside, becoming the core of the maquis guerrillas. Those who fled into the countryside rejected the term réfractaire with its connotations of laziness and called themselves the maquis, which originated as Corsican Italian slang for bandits, whose root word was macchia, which was the term for the scrubland and forests of Corsica. Those who lived in the macchia of Corsica were usually bandits, and those men fleeing to the countryside chose the term maquis as a more romantic and defiant term than réfractaire. By June 1943, the term maquis which had been a little known word borrowed from the Corsican dialect of Italian at the beginning of 1943 become widely known all over France. It was only in 1943 that guerilla warfare emerged in France as opposed to the more sporadic attacks against the Germans that had been going since the summer of 1941 and the resistance changed from an urban movement to a rural movement that was most active in central and southern France.|$|R
