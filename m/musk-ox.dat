25|$|The <b>Musk-Ox</b> and Other Tales, {{translated}} by R. Norman, Routledge, 1944.|$|E
25|$|His {{literary}} {{career began}} in the early 1860s with the publication of his short story The Extinguished Flame (1862), and his novellas <b>Musk-Ox</b> (May 1863) and The Life of a Peasant Woman (September, 1863). His first novel No Way Out was published under the pseudonym M.Stebnitsky in 1864. From the mid-1860s to the mid-1880s Leskov published a wide range of works, including journalism, sketches, short stories, and novels. Leskov's major works, many of which continue to be published in modern versions, were written during this time. A number of his later works were banned because of their satirical treatment of the Russian Orthodox Church and its functionaries. Leskov died on 5 March 1895, aged 64, and was interred in the Volkovo Cemetery in Saint Petersburg, in the section reserved for literary figures.|$|E

60|$|Under {{the very}} {{shadow of the}} tepee, where the little <b>musk-oxen</b> had been tethered, they lay {{stretched}} out pathetically on crimson snow--stiff stone-cold, dead. Moccasin tracks {{told the story of}} the tragedy.|$|R
60|$|While {{he built}} a fire before the tepee, Jones strode up and down, {{suddenly}} to whip out his knife and make for the tame little <b>musk-oxen,</b> now digging the snow. Then he wheeled abruptly and held out the blade to Rea.|$|R
6000|$|... "You go and fetch {{two of the}} kites, Benjy, and you'll {{soon find}} out. Overhaul them well and see that {{everything}} is taut and shipshape. Let Butterface help you, and send Alf and Chingatok to me. I suppose Leo is off after <b>musk-oxen,</b> as usual." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 1862 saw {{the launch}} of Leskov's {{literary}} career, {{with the publication of}} [...] "The Extinguished Flame" [...] (later re-issued as [...] "The Drought") in the March issue of Vek magazine, edited by Grigory Eliseev, followed by the short novels <b>Musk-Ox</b> (May 1863) and The Life of a Peasant Woman (September, 1863). In August the compilation Three stories by M. Stebnitsky came out. Another trip, to Riga in summer, resulted in a report on the Old Believers community there, which was published as a brochure {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
2500|$|Some modern {{scholars}} argue that, {{contrary to}} what his contemporary detractors said, Leskov had not held [...] "reactionary" [...] or even [...] "conservative" [...] sensibilities and his outlook was basically that of a democratic enlightener, who placed great hopes upon the 1861 social reform and became deeply disillusioned soon afterwards. The post-serfdom anachronisms that permeated Russian life in every aspect, became one of his basic themes. Unlike Dostoyevsky, who saw the greatest danger {{in the development of}} capitalism in Russia, Leskov regarded the [...] "immovability of Russia's 'old ways' as its main liability," [...] critic Viduetskaya insisted. Leskov's attitude towards 'revolutionaries' was never entirely negative, this critic argued; it's just that he saw them as totally unprepared for the mission they were trying to take upon themselves, this tragic incongruity being the leitmotif of many of his best known works; (The <b>Musk-Ox,</b> Mystery Man, The Passed By, At Daggers Drawn).|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} {{there was great}} {{excitement}} among the natives. A <b>musk-ox</b> had been seen, and all were eager for the hunt.|$|E
40|$|O n {{northern}} Ellesmere Island (79 ° N) <b>musk-oxen</b> experience over 4 {{months of}} continuous daylight and breed {{near the end}} of this period, but in southern regions of their range (which extends to 63 ° N) breeding occurs in early fall, when nights are lengthening. Because they breed under such different l ight/dark cycles the influence of photoperiod on their reproductive cycle is not clear. Tener (1965) suggested that the annual r h y t h m of reproduct ion i n <b>musk-oxen</b> may be entrained by photoperiodic cues surrounding the vernal equinox. Photoperiodic informat ion is conveyed to the neuroendocrine axis by melatonin, a hormone produced i n the pineal gland at night (Reiter, 1991). O u r objec...|$|R
60|$|Of all Jones's prizes of {{captured}} wild beasts--which numbered {{nearly every}} species common to western North America--he took greatest {{pride in the}} little <b>musk-oxen.</b> In truth, so great had been his passion to capture some of these rare and inaccessible mammals, that he considered the day's world the fulfillment of his life's purpose. He was happy. Never had he been so delighted as when, the very evening of their captivity, the <b>musk-oxen,</b> evincing no particular fear of him, began to dig with sharp hoofs into the snow for moss. And they found moss, and ate it, which solved Jones's greatest problem. He had hardly dared to think how to feed them, and here they were picking sustenance out of the frozen snow.|$|R
60|$|Two <b>musk-oxen</b> {{were loaded}} on a sled and hauled to camp in one trip. Skinning them was but short work for such expert hands. All the choice {{cuts of meat}} were saved. No time was lost in broiling a steak, which they found sweet and juicy, with a flavor of musk that was disagreeable.|$|R
60|$|The cougar, or {{mountain}} lion, is a Navajo {{god and the}} Navajos {{hold him}} in as much fear and reverence as do the Great Slave Indians the <b>musk-ox.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The <b>musk-ox</b> hunters sat long silent. Finally Rea {{shook his}} shaggy locks and roared. [...] "Ho! Ho! Jackoway out of wood! Jackoway out of wood! Jackoway out of wood!" ...|$|E
60|$|Most of the able-bodied {{men and a}} few of {{the youngsters}} set off next day to obtain a supply of walrus, seal, and <b>musk-ox</b> flesh--or {{anything}} else that happened to be procurable.|$|E
60|$|Spring weather at twenty-five below zero! On April 12th a {{small band}} of Indians made their appearance. Of the Dog tribe were they, an offcast of the Great Slaves, {{according}} to Rea, and as motley, starring and starved as the Yellow Knives. But they were friendly, which presupposed ignorance of the white hunters, and Rea persuaded the strongest brave to accompany them as guide northward after <b>musk-oxen.</b>|$|R
60|$|The <b>musk-oxen</b> squared {{round to}} the dogs, and were soon {{surrounded}} by the yelping pack. Jones came up to find six old bulls uttering grunts of rage and shaking ram-like horns at their tormentors. Notwithstanding that for Jones this was the cumulation of years of desire, the crowning moment, the climax and fruition of long-harbored dreams, he halted before the tame and helpless beasts, with joy not unmixed with pain.|$|R
60|$|Ten {{or fifteen}} women who {{remained}} had separated {{themselves from the}} silent men, and were drawing in towards the prisoners. It reminded one of the stealthy encircling, before the rush in at the quarry, of wolves round <b>musk-oxen</b> in the North. The prisoners saw, and drew together more closely. The Mayor covered {{his face with his}} hands for an instant. De Forest, bareheaded, stepped forward between the prisoners, and the slowly, stiffly moving line.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{white man}} knows; no Indian will tell," [...] {{answered}} the interpreter. [...] "The traders {{think it means}} the Great Slave, the North Star, the North Spirit, the North Wind, the North Lights and the <b>musk-ox</b> god." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunter, you {{are most}} unwise," [...] broke in the commandant, in his officious voice. [...] "The Indians will never permit {{you to take a}} <b>musk-ox</b> alive from the north. They worship him, pray to him. It is a wonder you have not been stopped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The lean white bear hath {{seen it in}} the long, long Arctic night, The <b>musk-ox</b> {{knows the}} {{standard}} that flouts the Northern Light: What is the Flag of England? Ye have but my bergs to dare, Ye have but my drifts to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!' ...|$|E
60|$|So I led him on in talk, {{and soon}} I marvelled, for he talked of {{game and the}} ways thereof. He had killed the Siberian wolf of westernmost Alaska, and the chamois in the secret Rockies. He averred he knew the haunts where the last buffalo still roamed; that he had hung on the flanks of the caribou when they ran by the hundred thousand, and slept in the Great Barrens on the <b>musk-ox's</b> winter trail.|$|R
60|$|It {{might be}} {{supposed}} that {{in such a}} climate animal life could scarcely exist; but such is not the case. The inhabitants of part of the arctic regions, named Esquimaux (more correctly Eskimos, with the accent on the last syllable), are a stout, hardy, healthy race and the polar bears, foxes, wolves, seals, <b>musk-oxen,</b> walruses, etcetera, that dwell there, seem to enjoy their existence {{just as much as}} do the animals of more favoured and warmer climes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} is. It {{has long been}} known that the Greenland Eskimos have a {{tradition}} of an island in an iceless sea, lying away in the far north, where there are many <b>musk-oxen,</b> and, from what I have been told by our friend Chingatok, I am disposed to think that he and his kindred inhabit this island, or group of islands, in the Polar basin--not far, perhaps, from the Pole itself. He says there are <b>musk-oxen</b> there. But there is another creature, and a much bigger one than any Eskimo, bigger even than Chingatok, who bears his testimony to an open Polar sea, namely, the Greenland whale. It has been ascertained that the `right' whale does not, and cannot, enter the tropical regions of the Ocean. They are to him as a sea of fire, a wall of adamant, so that it is impossible for him to swim south, double Cape Horn, and proceed to the North Pacific; yet the very same kind of whale found in Baffin's Bay is found at Behring Straits. Now, the question is, how did he get there?" ...|$|R
60|$|Amoraq {{jumped from}} the bench where she sat, and began to sweep things into the girl's lap--stone lamps, iron skin-scrapers, tin kettles, deer-skins {{embroidered}} with <b>musk-ox</b> teeth, and real canvas-needles such as sailors use--the finest dowry that has ever been given on {{the far edge of}} the Arctic Circle, and the girl from the North bowed her head down to the very floor.|$|E
60|$|But we must {{press on}} after other game, {{and we will}} now try and get {{a shot at a}} <b>musk-ox.</b> We shall have to go {{somewhat}} out of our way to find this animal, for he lives in the upper portions of North America, but an ocean and a continent or two are not at all difficult to cross--in a book.|$|E
60|$|Oolichuk and Butterface {{carried the}} game-bags, {{and these were}} soon filled with such game as was thought best for food. Sending them back to camp with orders to empty the bags and return, Leo and Benjy took to the uplands in search of nobler game. It was not {{difficult}} to find. Soon a splendid stag was shot by Leo and a <b>musk-ox</b> by Benjy.|$|E
60|$|On the day {{following}} the desertion, Jones found tracks {{to the north}} of the camp, making a broad trail in which were numerous little imprints that sent him flying back to get Rea and the dogs. Muskoxen in great numbers had passed in the night, and Jones and Rea had not trailed the herd a mile before they had it in sight. When the dogs burst into full cry, the <b>musk-oxen</b> climbed a high knoll and squared about to give battle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor is Lake Owatawetness {{merely an}} Angler's Paradise. Vast forests of primeval pine slope {{to the very}} shores of the lake, to which descend great droves of bears--brown, green, and bear-coloured--while as the shades of evening fall, the air is loud with the lowing of moose, cariboo, antelope, cantelope, <b>musk-oxes,</b> musk-rats, and other graminivorous mammalia of the forest. These {{enormous}} quadrumana generally move off about 10.30 p.m., from which hour until 11.45 p.m. the whole shore is reserved for bison and buffalo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell them {{thus they}} show their true qualities, to insult in council. Tell them {{they are not}} chiefs, but dogs. Tell them they are not even squaws, only poor, miserable starved dogs. Tell them I {{turn my back on}} them. Tell them the paleface has fought real chiefs, fierce, bold, like eagles, and he turns his back on dogs. Tell them {{he is the one who}} could teach them to raise the <b>musk-oxen</b> and the reindeer, and to keep out the cold and the wolf. But they are blinded. Tell them the hunter goes north." ...|$|R

6000|$|No vacillation {{attended}} the Indian's mood. From friendly guide, he had suddenly {{been transformed into}} a dark, sullen savage. He refused the <b>musk-ox</b> meat offered by Jones, and he pointed south and looked at the white hunters as if he asked them to go with him. Both men shook their heads in answer. The savage struck his breast a sounding blow and with his index finger pointed at the white of the north, he shouted dramatically: [...] "Naza! Naza! Naza!" ...|$|E

60|$|To {{a man of}} Jones's {{experience}} and skill, the capturing of the calves was a ridiculously easy piece of work. The cows tossed their heads, watched the dogs, and forgot their young. The first cast of the lasso settled over the neck of a little fellow. Jones hauled him out over the slippery snow and laughed as he bound the hairy legs. In less time than he had taken to capture one buffalo calf, with half the escort, {{he had all the}} little <b>musk-oxen</b> bound fast. Then he signaled this feat by pealing out an Indian yell of victory.|$|R
60|$|That {{night they}} encamped, amid heavy squalls {{of wind and}} rain, {{at the foot of}} a rocky hill, on the top of which their new guide said that it blew a gale every day of the year! Here the Dog-rib became very unhappy, and pretended to be ill, but a strict watch was kept on him so that he could not escape. The country around them was very wild and rugged, and they were {{informed}} by their guide that great numbers of bears and small white buffaloes (<b>musk-oxen?)</b> frequented the mountains; also some tribes of Indians. Here some of the party attempted to ascend a steep hill, but were almost suffocated and fairly driven back by clouds of mosquitoes.|$|R
60|$|Three {{days after}} that, Captain Vane {{and his party}} {{approached}} the shores of Great Isle. It was low like the other islands of Flatland, but of greater extent, insomuch that its entire circumference could not be seen from its highest central point. Like the other islands it was quite destitute of trees, but the low bush was luxuriantly dense, and filled, they were told, with herds of reindeer and <b>musk-oxen.</b> Myriads of wild-fowl--from the lordly swan to the twittering sandpiper--swarmed among its sedgy lakelets, while grouse and ptarmigan were {{to be seen in}} large flocks on its uplands. The land was clothed in mosses and grasses of the richest green, and decked with variegated wild-flowers and berries.|$|R
