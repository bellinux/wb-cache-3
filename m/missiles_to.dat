5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive news coverage of the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided <b>missiles)</b> <b>to</b> destroy enemy weapons and installations. Some commentators considered the game's subject matter in bad taste, with one magazine reporting an incident of veterans burning copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, German and Italian Tornados {{participated in}} Operation Allied Force, NATO's {{military}} operation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War. The ECR aircraft would escort various allies' aircraft while carrying several AGM-88 HARM <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> counter attempted use of radar against the allied aircraft. During the Kosovo hostilities, Germany's IDS Tornados would routinely conduct reconnaissance flights to identify both enemy ground forces and civilian refugees within Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|On August 20, 1985, Israel sent 96 American-made TOW <b>{{missiles}}</b> <b>to</b> Iran {{through an}} arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar. Subsequently, on September 14, 1985, 408 more TOW missiles were delivered. On September 15, 1985, following the second delivery, Reverend Benjamin Weir {{was released by}} his captors, the Islamic Jihad Organization.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 August one of the {{transport}} aircraft's flight officers, a Barksdale-assigned B-52 instructor radar navigator, closely inspected the six missiles on the right wing only, which were all properly loaded with training warheads. The B-52 command pilot did not do a final verification check, before signing the manifest listing the cargo as a dozen unarmed AGM-129 <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> depart Minot.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E

After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped <b>to</b> guide the <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.|$|R

5|$|As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated electronic countermeasures (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> serve in the interceptor role.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1942, German flak commanders had already {{concluded}} that AAA would be essentially useless against jet aircraft, and began development of guided <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> fill this role. Most forces {{reached the same}} conclusion soon after, with both the US and UK starting missile development programs before the war ended. The UK's Green Mace {{was one of the}} last attempts to develop a useful high-altitude AAA weapon, but its development ended in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev told Mikoyan of {{his idea}} of {{shipping}} Soviet <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> Cuba. Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles. In early November 1962, after the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a framework to remove Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba, Khrushchev dispatched Mikoyan to Havana to help persuade Castro to cooperate in the withdrawal. Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed {{about the death of}} his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son Sergo there instead.|$|E

50|$|Designed for all-round defence against {{simultaneous}} {{air attacks}} from multiple targets, the Umkhonto-IR missile {{is the first}} vertically launched infrared-homing surface-to-air missile, also the first IR-homing <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> use lock-on-after-launch. Upon launch, the <b>missile</b> flies <b>to</b> a lock-on point, following on-board inertial navigation. The missile then activates its two-colour IR-seeker (variant of U-Darter AAM's seeker) and locks on. Target updates are received via data link, enabling the <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> counter evasive manoeuvres by the target.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, NATO {{countries}} {{signed a}} Memorandum of Agreement that the United States would develop a medium-range air-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> replace the AIM-7 Sparrow, while Britain and Germany would develop a short-range air-to-air <b>missile</b> <b>to</b> replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder. The US design developed as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, while the UK-German design developed as the AIM-132 ASRAAM.|$|R
5|$|Levels {{consist of}} several missions, {{which are based}} around the {{destruction}} of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The Apache is armed with a machine gun, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from soldiers with small arms, to anti-aircraft <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> tanks and armoured cars.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October 2007, Secretary of the Air Force Wynne {{told the}} House Armed Services Committee that he {{believed}} that the 5th Bomb Wing could be recertified and could resume ferrying the AGM-129 cruise <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> Barksdale for retirement. He did not provide a timeline for that recertification process. On 1 November 2007 Colonel Joel Westa took command of the 5th Bomb Wing. That same day, General Keys retired from the Air Force.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1984, two Saudi Arabian {{fighter pilots}} shot down two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal Saudi Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired air-to-air <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> {{bring down the}} Iranian planes. The Saudi fighter pilots had KC-135 aerial tanker planes and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS {{surveillance}} planes assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in Saudi airspace over the Gulf near the Saudi island Al Arabiyah, about 60 miles northeast of Jubail.|$|E

5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> reduce the cost of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|The New England Division of the Army Corps of Engineers {{managed the}} {{construction}} of these sites. The sites were manned by men from the 3rd Missile Battalion, 61st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, and provided defense for Loring and the northeastern approaches to the United States. In 1960, sites L-13 and L-58 underwent conversion from Ajax <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> the MIM-14 Nike-Hercules missiles. These sites remained operational until 1966, although the site at Limestone was closed in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American {{warships}} in the Red Sea fired thirteen {{missiles at}} Sudan's Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed {{except for the}} administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.|$|E

5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between the target and a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one {{at either end of the}} passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were machicolations, openings for <b>missiles</b> <b>to</b> be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
