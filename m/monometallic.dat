50|$|Silver {{being in}} the same group as copper, Pd-Ag(I) {{bimetallic}} systems are inherently similar to Pd-Cu catalytic systems. However, silver salts are better suited for protodecarboxylation of carboxylic acids than their copper equivalents, allowing milder reaction conditions in Pd-Ag cycles relative to Pd-Cu cycles.Ag(I) catalyzed <b>monometallic</b> systems have also been reported. Their proficiency (relative to copper) is likely attributed to lower electronegativity and greater expansion of d-orbitals, which promote decarboxylation of the substrate.One limitation of this catalyst combination is that the silver salts will form insoluble silver halides, forcing the reaction to require a stoichiometric amount of Ag if halides are present. This obstacle was overcome by Goossen et al. in 2010 by using aryl triflates, and catalytic reaction with aryl sulfonates has also been reported.|$|E
50|$|Extending {{the idea}} of heteroligated structures, {{there was also a}} need to design a {{catalytic}} structure that would allow for the inclusion of mono-metallic catalyst that could be completely turned off. To this end the triple-layer motif was developed, composed of two transition metal nodes, two chemically inert blocking exterior layers, and a single catalytically active interior ligand. This complex was synthesized using the WLA and HILR processes, and it can be reversibly activated and deactivated through small-molecule or elemental anion effector reactions that assemble and disassemble the trilayer structures. In the recent Al(III)-salen example, the polymerization of ε-caprolactone could be turned on and off based on the ancillary ligands and abstraction agents added to the system. Unlike in previous catalytic structures that utilized bimetallic systems, utilizing the tri-layer motif allows for the incorporation of a <b>monometallic</b> catalyst, opening the scope of potential catalysts that can be employed in these types of structures.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, {{there was}} a great deal of {{scholarly}} debate and political controversy regarding the use of bimetallism in place of a gold or silver standard (monometallism). Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates. Some scholars argued that bimetallism was inherently unstable owing to Gresham's law, and that its replacement by a <b>monometallic</b> standard was inevitable. Other scholars claimed that in practice bimetallism had a stabilizing effect on economies. The controversy became largely moot after technological progress and the South African and Klondike Gold Rushes increased the supply of gold in circulation at the end of the century, ending most of the political pressure for greater use of silver. It became completely academic after the 1971 Nixon shock, since when all of the world's currencies have operated as more or less freely floating fiat money, unconnected to the value of silver or gold. Nonetheless, academics continue to inconclusively debate the relative use of the metallic standards.|$|E
50|$|Forgione, P., Bilodeau, F et al. {{reported}} that heteroatoms containing a carboxylic acid also are tolerated by palladium <b>monometallic</b> systems and undergo decarboxylative cross coupling with aryl halides. In the proposed mechanism the initial step is oxidative {{addition of the}} aryl halide forming an aryl-palladium intermediate. Electrophilic palladation then occurs at carbon-3 of the heteroatom. From this intermediate there are two possible pathways for the cycle to continue on. The first is palladium migration from carbon-3 to carbon-2 along with the expulsion of carbon dioxide. This forms the aryl-palladium-heteroatom intermediate, which undergoes reductive elimination to form the final heteroaromatic compound. The second pathway only occurs when R is a proton. If this is the case, deprotonation occurs to regain aromaticity of the heteroatom. This intermediate then undergoes reductive elimination, coupling the aryl to the carbon-3 position of the heteroatom. As this compound still contains the carboxylic acid it is then free to re enter the catalytic cycle where it undergoes coupling at the carbon 2 position, along with the expulsion of carbon dioxide to form a biaryl heteroatom. As this pathway competes with the decarboxylation step, two products are formed making this reaction less selective. As a result, heteroatoms, which are substituted at the carbon 3 position and are more favored due to the higher level of control they provide.|$|E
