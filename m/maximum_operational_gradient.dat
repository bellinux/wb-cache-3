40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{research}} {{results of the}} operational parameter effect on Thermal Contact Resistance (TCR) in a copper-aluminum L-type finned tube are presented. The investigated operational parameters were the <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> temperature {{and the number of}} repeated heating-cooling cycles. The TCR was experimentally determined by measuring the total heat supply, core tube wall and inner fin surface temperatures for steady-state and natural-convection conditions. In addition, the specimen was tested through up to 200 heating-cooling cycles. The experimental results showed a TCR increase of 81 % {{at the same time as}} the average temperature difference between the hot inner flow and cooling air increased from 30 °C to 130 °C; over the <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> temperature (120 °C), the TCR increased faster than before; and, after the heating-cooling cycle testing the TCR presented an increase of 31 % in respect with the initial value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To be able {{to design}} next {{generation}} of gas turbines {{it is necessary to}} improve the knowledge about the stress values produced in the turbine. A gas turbine rotating system is loaded with time by the changes in stress levels as a result of start-up and shutdown procedures, i. e. Low-cycle fatigue (lcf), as well as by steady forces caused by rotation (centrifugal stress) and thermal gradients, as also by high-cycle fatigue(hcf) in the course of normal operating conditions. Except during the start-up and shutdown procedures, the emphasis are given on the steady state analysis because of the turbine’s maximum operating period is in almost steady state. The main entity of these versatile machines is made by the blades and vanes, which are subjected during operation to very high thermal and mechanical stresses (combined effects of centrifugal force and thermal gradient), in aggressive environment. The research on gas turbine cooling systems is coupled with the flow and heat transfer associated with rotating turbine. Therefore this report has primarily focused on the heat transfer characteristics, centrifugal and the thermal stresses arising in the disk. The maximum stresses obtained from different analyses by using innovative high heat resistant material inconel 718 are found to be within the yield strength of the material. Interesting results obtained in terms of <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> radial stress, <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> hoop stress, <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> Vonmises stress, the temperature field etc. The values of the stresses indicate that the disk attains steady state after 450 seconds.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{analysis}} of stress {{values that are}} produced while the turbine is running are the key factors of study while designing the next generation gas turbines. A gas turbine rotating system is loaded with time by the changes in stress levels {{as a result of}} start-up and shutdown procedures. Hot section blades typically fail because of creep, oxidation, low-cycle fatigue (LCF), and high-cycle fatigue (HCF). Contributing factors often include environmental attack, corrosion, cyclic loads, over firing, or inadequate refurbishment. Hot section blading are life-limited items and require refurbishment or replacement at intervals dependent upon thermal exposure. The temperature gradients that can be established in the transient state are generally higher than those that occur in the steady-state and hence thermal shock is important factor to be considered relative to ordinary thermal stress. The “heart ” of these versatile machines is made by the blades and vanes, which are subjected during operation to very high thermal and mechanical stresses (combined effects of centrifugal force and thermal gradient), in aggressive environment. The research on gas turbine cooling systems is coupled with the flow and heat transfer associated with rotating turbine. Therefore this report has primarily focused on the Transient heat transfer characteristics, centrifugal and the thermal stresses arising in the disk.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{floating}} offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) are planned in the com-ing years {{due to their}} high potential in the massive generation of clean energy from ocean wind. In the present study, a numerical prediction tool has been developed for the fully coupled dynamic analysis of an FOWT system in the time domain including aero-loading, tower/blade elasticity, blade-rotor dynamics and control, mooring dynamics, and platform motions so that the influence of aero-elastic-control dynamics on the hull-mooring performance and vice versa can be assessed. The Hywind spar design with a 5 MW National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) turbine is selected as an example and two different collinear wind-wave-current environmental conditions, <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> and survival conditions, are applied for this study. The <b>maximum</b> <b>operational</b> condition means the maximum environmental condition with normal blade-turbine opera-tion and the survival condition represents the extreme situation without any blade-turbine operation. Through this study, it is seen that the ultimate-loading environments for different structural components of the FOWT can be different. The developed technol-ogy and numerical tool are readily applicable {{to the design of}} any type of future FOWTs in any combinations of irregular waves, dynamic winds, and steady currents.
