40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} several years, a {{multitude}} of genes {{has been linked to}} <b>mental</b> <b>retardations</b> in humans, in particular the most commonly occurring X-linked <b>mental</b> <b>retardations.</b> An emerging idea is that structural and functional abnormali-ties in spines and synapses are a common feature of <b>mental</b> <b>retardations.</b> Consistent with this concept, a number of genes that control synaptic function have been implicated in X-linked <b>mental</b> <b>retardations.</b> In this review we discuss aberrations in spine and synapse structure and function in X-linked human <b>mental</b> <b>retardations</b> and corresponding mouse models with mutations in genes that modulate synaptic structure and function. A thorough understanding of these synaptic structures and abnormalities would enhance our knowledge of the normal process of learning and understand how synaptic aberra-tions contribute to cognitive deficits such as those observed in <b>mental</b> <b>retardations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Germline {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or <b>mental</b> <b>retardation</b> (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to germline KIF11 mutations.|$|E

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>mental</b> <b>retardations</b> are in part genetotrophic diseases (diseases in which the genetic pattern of the afflicted individual requires an augmented supply {{of one or more}} nutrients such that when these nutrients are adequately supplied the disease is ameliorated), we carried out a partially double-blind experiment with 16 retarded children (initial IQs, approximately 17 - 70) of school age who wee given nutritional supplements or placebos during a period of 8 months. The supplement contained 8 minerals in moderate amounts and 11 vitamins, mostly in relatively large amounts. During the first 4 - month period (double-blind) the 5 children who received supplements increased their average IQ by 5. 0 - 9. 6, depending on the investigator, whereas the 11 subjects given placebos showed negligible change. The difference between these two groups is statistically significant (P less than 0. 05). During the second period, the subjects who had been given placebos in the first study received supplements; they showed an average IQ increase of at least 10. 2, a highly significant gain (P less than 0. 001). Three of the five subjects who were given supplements for both periods showed additional IQ gains during the second 4 months. Three of four children with Down syndrome gained between 10 and 25 units in IQ and also showed physical changes toward normal. Other evidence suggests that the supplement improved visual acuity in two children and increased growth rates. These results support {{the hypothesis that}} <b>mental</b> <b>retardations</b> are in part genetotrophic in origin...|$|R

5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine.

40|$|Neuroligins (NLs) are postsynaptic transmembrane cell-adhesion {{proteins}} that {{play a key}} role in the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that NLs contribute to synapse formation and synaptic transmission.

Deletions or mutations in NL genes have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders or <b>mental</b> <b>retardations,</b> and mice harboring the reported NL deletions or mutations exhibit autism-related behaviors and synapse dysfunction. Conversely, synaptic activity can regulate the phosphorylation, expression, and cleavage of NLs, which, in turn, can influence synaptic activity.
