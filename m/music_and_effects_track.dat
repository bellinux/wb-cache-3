5000|$|In 2016, the International English dub was {{included}} on the U.S. DVD and Blu-Ray releases from Kraken, though the audio mix was not the original monaural track that was originally heard on Toho's English language prints. The English dialogue was originally mixed with an alternate <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>track</b> that contained different music edits and sound effects from the Japanese theatrical version, most notably a distinct [...] "cry" [...] produced by Godzilla during the film's ending. The U.S. home video version instead uses the conventional <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>track</b> used for the regular Japanese version mixed in DTS 5.1 surround sound instead of mono.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{era when}} these scores were recorded, {{nearly half of the}} music masters have been lost so the scores had to be reconstructed and {{restored}} from the best available sources, mainly the <b>Music</b> <b>and</b> <b>Effects</b> <b>tracks</b> as well as monaural ¼″ tapes.|$|R

50|$|Minkler {{started working}} as a {{recordist}} when he was 17, and started mixing in 1974 when he was 22. His early projects included commercials, television shows and industrial films. His first major film came in 1976 when he was hired for temporary work on <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>tracks</b> for the foreign release of All the President’s Men, with rerecording mixers Arthur Piantadosi and Les Fresholtz, at Warner Brothers' Stage 5. He continued to work with Piantadosi and Fresholtz on another 35 films, and considers them his mentors.|$|R

50|$|After a {{long period}} denying Sams request for sound, Harry agreed to change, {{as long as the}} studios use of {{synchronized}} sound was for background music purposes only. The Warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company Western Electric and established Vitaphone. In 1926, Vitaphone began making films with <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>tracks,</b> most notably, in the feature Don Juan starring John Barrymore. The film was silent, but it featured a large number of Vitaphone shorts at the beginning. To hype Don Juans release, Harry acquired the large Piccadilly Theater in Manhattan, New York City, and renamed it Warners Theatre.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} international dub is not known to have ever been released on video in its complete form. The only evidence of its existence is in the Hindi theatrical version. The Hindi dubbing company lacked a clean <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>track</b> and only had access to {{a copy of the}} original English version. Therefore, English dialog was muted and replaced with library tracks and music {{from other parts of the}} film itself, but occasionally the English source track was left intact.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, two DVD editions were released, both {{featuring}} a newly restored {{version of the}} film with audio commentary and an isolated <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>track.</b> One of the two DVD releases was a [...] "Two-Disc Special Edition", featuring production documentaries, trailers, various outtakes, newsreels, radio shows and still galleries. The other set, a [...] "Three-Disc Collector's Edition", included these features, {{as well as the}} digitally restored 80th-anniversary edition of the 1925 feature-length silent film version of The Wizard of Oz, other silent Oz movies, and a 1933 animated short version.|$|E
50|$|Multiple film historians {{criticized the}} {{restoration}} work. Jonathan Rosenbaum argued that numerous {{changes were made}} against Welles's intent and that the restoration was incompetent, having used as its source an original distribution print with a flawed soundtrack. In fact, the visual elements of the 1992 restoration utilized a fine-grain master positive—discovered in a storage in New Jersey—as its source, not a distribution print. The audio came from a distribution print that was re-synchronized, virtually syllable-by-syllable by the restoration team to match the master positive. As some voice parts had music underneath, the newly recorded <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>effects</b> <b>track</b> had to match whatever music was underneath the dialogue, leading to inconsistencies. The flaw in the American cut's soundtrack is how white noise is audible in the background throughout dialogue and music, but that the noise cuts out {{when there is no}} action—meaning the white noise is more noticeable whenever it returns. The restoration sought to minimize this problem, but it is still present in places. By contrast, the white noise problem is not present to begin with in Welles's original 1952 European cut.|$|E

50|$|Produced by Hal Roach and {{released}} to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, {{it was the}} 91st Our Gang short that was released. The short, a silent film, was produced {{in the early spring}} of 1929, but withheld until after three sound Our Gang films had already been released. Cat, Dog, and Co. was released with a synchronized <b>music</b> <b>and</b> sound <b>effects</b> <b>track</b> on phonographic disc.|$|R

50|$|Habeas Corpus is a 1928 short comedy silent film {{starring}} Laurel and Hardy as grave-robbers {{hired by}} a mad scientist. It {{was shot in}} July 1928 and released by M-G-M on December 1. Although technically a silent film—having intertitles and no synchronized dialogue—it was the inaugural Roach film released with a synchronized <b>music</b> <b>and</b> sounds <b>effects</b> <b>track</b> for theatres wired for sound. The Victor sound discs were long thought lost until a lone set surfaced in the 1990s and was reunited with the film elements.|$|R

5|$|In 1982, an {{animated}} television series called Lupin VIII was planned as a French-Japanese co-production, featuring {{the descendants of}} Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Zenigata, but was never completed. Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a <b>music</b> <b>and</b> sound <b>effects</b> <b>track,</b> but the voice-overs were never recorded. It {{has been suggested that}} the project was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting a large amount of money for use of the Lupin name. The single episode was later included in the 2012 Lupin III Master File box set.|$|R
50|$|Cosmos was {{unavailable}} {{for many years}} after its initial release because of copyright issues with the soundtrack music, {{but when it was}} released in 2000 on worldwide NTSC DVD, subtitles in seven languages and remastered 5.1 sound were included, as well as an alternative <b>music</b> <b>and</b> sound <b>effects</b> <b>track.</b> In 2005, The Science Channel rebroadcast the series for its 25th anniversary, with updated computer graphics and film footage, digital sound, and information about relevant scientific discoveries in the intervening 25 years. Despite being shown again on the Science Channel, the total amount of time for the original 13 episodes (780 minutes) was reduced 25% to 585 minutes (45 minutes per episode) in order to make room for commercials.|$|R
5000|$|Four Sons is a 1928 silent drama film {{directed}} and produced by John Ford and {{written for the}} screen by Philip Klein from a story by I. A. R. Wylie first published in the Saturday Evening Post as [...] "Grandmother Bernle Learns Her Letters" [...] (1926). It {{is one of only}} a handful of survivors out of the more than fifty silent films that Ford directed between 1917 and 1928. It starred Margaret Mann, James Hall, and Charles Morton. The film is also notable for the presence of the young John Wayne in an uncredited role as an officer. Though [...] "silent," [...] it was released with a Movietone <b>music</b> <b>and</b> sound <b>effects</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 419-seat Theater, another {{original}} {{building on}} the Burbank lot, shows first-run Disney films for studio employees and guests. It has plush stadium seating and has been upgraded {{over the years to}} keep pace with new technology in the exhibition of films. Food and drink are not allowed inside. [...] Throughout its history, the theater has also been used for post-production sound mixing. According to the Disney production services website, [...] "The Main Theater is a state-of-the-art digital sound dubbing and screening facility that was first used to mix the sound for Fantasia 1940. Sound mixers blend dialogue, <b>music,</b> <b>and</b> sound <b>effects</b> <b>tracks</b> to the various levels appropriate for a movie theater. The acoustics are designed to simulate a theater that is three-quarters full. Although the theater is empty during the mixing session, extra padding in the seats and specially designed walls absorb and reflect the sound. This helps the sound mixers to know what the final product will sound like when it is released to the public." ...|$|R
5000|$|International {{versions}} were sound {{versions of}} films which the producing company {{did not feel}} were worth the expense of re-shooting in a foreign language. They were meant {{to cash in on}} the talkie craze; by 1930 anything with sound did well at the box-office while silent films were largely ignored by the public. These [...] "international sound versions" [...] were basically part-talkies and were largely silent except for musical sequences. Since the film included a synchronized <b>music</b> <b>and</b> a sound <b>effect</b> <b>track,</b> it could be advertised as a sound picture and could therefore capitalize on the talkie craze in foreign markets (instead of the more expensive method of actually re-filming talking sequences in foreign languages).|$|R
500|$|DJ Hero 2 {{follows from}} its {{predecessor}} in simulating {{the performance of}} a disc jockey mixing one or two songs using a special turntable controller. The controller, the same unit as shipped previously with DJ Hero, includes a rotatable turntable to use for recording scratching, three [...] "stream" [...] buttons to match notes from the two <b>music</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>and</b> an <b>effects</b> <b>track,</b> <b>and</b> a slider to control the crossfade between tracks. These actions are presented to the players through on-screen notation that scrolls in time with the music. Players score points by performing the actions correctly, but are not penalized otherwise. By successfully completing a consecutive set of actions, the player can increase their scoring multiplier up to 4x; the multiplier returns to 1x should they miss any actions. Certain marked sections, when played correctly, fill a [...] "Euphoria" [...] (the [...] "Star Power" [...] for this game) meter which can be unleashed using another button on the controller and will temporarily double the scoring. The player can also earn the ability to rewind a song by a few seconds by playing a long string of consecutive notes. They can rewind the song by quickly spinning the turntable in reverse; the rewind effect can be used to either correct a mistake or further boost one's scoring.|$|R

Mary Philbin and Norman Kerry reenacted their roles for the sound re-shoot, and Edward Martindel, George B. Williams, Phillips Smalley, Ray Holderness, and Edward Davis added to the cast to replace actors who were unavailable. [...] Universal was contractually unable to loop Chaney's dialogue, but [...] "third person" [...] dialogue by the Phantom was looped over shots of his shadow. (The voice-overs are uncredited, but are probably Phillips Smalley.) Because Chaney's talkie debut was eagerly anticipated by film-goers, advertisements emphasized, [...] "Lon Chaney's portrayal is a silent one!" ...|$|R
