The inclusion of Mr. Goschen, who had only been in parliament three years, {{was the subject of}} remark. People who asked what he had done to <b>merit</b> <b>promotion</b> so striking, did not know his book on foreign exchanges, and were perhaps in no case competent to judge it.(108) Something seems to have been said about Mr. Bright, for in a note to Lord Russell (Dec. 11) Mr. Gladstone writes: “With reference to your remark about Bright, he has for many years held language of a studious moderation about reform. And there is something odious in fighting shy of a man, so powerful in talent, of such undoubted integrity. Without feeling, however, that he is permanently proscribed, I am under the impression that in the present critical state of feeling on your own side with respect to the franchise, his name would sink the government and the bill together.” When Palmerston invited Cobden to join his cabinet in 1859, Cobden spoke of Bright, how he had avoided personalities in his recent speeches. “It is not personalities that we complained of,” Palmerston replied; “a public man is right in attacking persons. But it is his attacks on classes that have given offence to powerful bodies, who can make their resentment felt.”(109) ...|$|E

50|$|It {{can also}} be argued that social promotion, by keeping most {{students}} {{at the elementary school}} level from advancing at their own pace, is the reason they don't take their education seriously.

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} social {{promotion}}, there is the <b>merit</b> <b>promotion,</b> either by mid-term promotion or by using a course-based curriculum with a directed acyclic graph of prerequisites similar to college curricula.

50|$|Once hired, {{employees}} {{have the right}} to occasional cost of living increases, as well as raises based on <b>merit.</b> <b>Promotions,</b> however, are not a right, and there are often fewer openings than qualified applicants.

It is only unethical if the employer did not give the employee proper consideration or used improper criteria for the promotion.|$|R

50|$|The Table of Ranks re-organised the {{foundations}} of feudal Russian nobility (mestnichestvo) by recognising service in the military, in the civil service, and at the imperial court {{as the basis of}} an aristocrat's standing in society. The table divided ranks in 14 grades, with all nobles regardless of birth or wealth (at least in theory) beginning {{at the bottom of the}} table and rising through their service (sluzhba) to the tsar. While all grades were open by <b>merit,</b> <b>promotion</b> required qualification for the next rank, and grades 1 through 5 required the personal approval of the tsar himself. Despite initial resistance from noblemen, many of whom were still illiterate in the 18th century and who shunned the paper-pushing life of the civil servant, the eventual effect of the Table of Ranks was to create an educated class of noble bureaucrats.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the beliefs of mathematics educators regarding issues of scholarship and tenure associated with material published in electronic journals on the Internet. Based on 58 responses received through an e-mail survey, the study showed that respondents felt: comparable print and e-journals should garner the same prestige and respect; serving as an editor of an e-journal should be as respectable as carrying out the same responsibilities for a print journal; articles in e-journal format based on a blind peer-review process should be accepted for <b>merit,</b> <b>promotion,</b> and tenure review; and that review committees should consider e-journal articles equal to print journal articles in regard to questions of <b>merit,</b> <b>promotion,</b> and tenure. There is also agreement that e-journal publications that do not appear in print format should be judged on their own merit. There is support for research published in e-journals as meeting the criteria of scholarship. (MKA) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best {{that can be made}} from the original document...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} teacher and school executive satisfaction derived from a study involving 892 respondents in 71 government schools in Western Sydney, Australia. Factor analysis of survey items was utilised to develop an eight factor model of teacher satisfaction. The eight factors were named: school leadership, climate, decision making; <b>merit</b> <b>promotion</b> and local hiring; school infrastructure; school reputation; status and image of teachers; student achievement; workload {{and the impact of}} change; and professional self-growth. Scores on the scales fell into three domains: 'core business of teaching' factors (student achievement; professional self-growth); school level factors (school leadership, climate, decision making; school infrastructure; school reputation); and system level/societal factors (workload and impact of change; status and image of teachers; <b>merit</b> <b>promotion).</b> Respondents were most satisfied with 'core business' aspects and least satisfied with system level/societal factors, while school level factors showed the most variation, reflecting the influence of teachers' specific and varying within-school experiences. Leadership, communication and decision making styles were found to be important contributing factors to satisfaction with school based aspects of respondents' roles. It is argued that within the important, school level domain, action to improve teacher satisfaction is most likely to be effective...|$|E
