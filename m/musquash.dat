500|$|The muskrat's name {{probably}} {{comes from}} a word of Algonquian (possibly Powhatan) origin, muscascus (literally [...] "it is red", so called for its colorings), or from the Abenaki native word m√≤skwas, {{as seen in the}} archaic English name for the animal, <b>musquash.</b> Because of the association with the [...] "musky" [...] odor, which the muskrat uses to mark its territory, and its flattened tail, the name became altered to musk-beaver; later it became muskrat due to its resemblance to rats.|$|E
6000|$|Just before {{night we}} saw a <b>musquash,</b> the only one we saw in this voyage, {{swimming}} downward {{on the opposite side}} of the stream. The Indian, wishing to get one to eat, hushed us, saying, [...] "Stop, me call 'em"; and, sitting flat on the bank, he began to make a curious squeaking, wiry sound with his lips, exerting himself considerably. I was greatly surprised--thought that I had at last got into the wilderness, and that he was a wild man indeed, to be talking to a <b>musquash!</b> I did not know which of the two was the strangest to me. He seemed suddenly to have quite forsaken humanity, and gone over to the <b>musquash</b> side. The <b>musquash,</b> however, as near as I could see, did not turn aside, and the Indian said that he saw our fire; but it was evident that he was in the habit of calling the <b>musquash</b> to him, as he said. An acquaintance of mine who was hunting moose in these woods a month after this, tells me that his Indian in this way repeatedly called the <b>musquash</b> within reach of his paddle in the moonlight, and struck at them.|$|E

60|$|All {{the long}} summer {{he belongs to}} the tribe of Ishmael, {{wandering}} through lakes and streams wherever fancy leads him. It is {{as if he were}} bound to see the world after being cooped up in his narrow quarters all winter. Even the strong family ties, one of the most characteristic and interesting things in beaver life, are for the time loosened. Every family group when it breaks up housekeeping in the spring represents five generations. First, there are the two old beavers, heads of the family and absolute rulers, who first engineered the big dam and houses, and have directed repairs for nobody knows how long. Next in importance are the baby beavers, no bigger than <b>musquashes,</b> with fur like silk velvet, and eyes always wide open at the wonders of the first season out; then the one-and two-year-olds, frisky as boys let loose from school, always in mischief and having to be looked after, and occasionally nipped; then the three-year-olds, who presently leave the group and go their separate happy ways in search of mates. So the long days go by in a kind of careless summer excursion; and when one sometimes finds their camping ground in his own summer roving through the wilderness, he looks upon it with curious sympathy. Fellow campers are they, pitching their tents by sunny lakes and alder-fringed, trout-haunted brooks, always close to Nature's heart, and loving the wild, free life much as he does himself.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of a lack}} of {{food and}} an {{upcoming}} strict winter, one of these Gwich'in nomad groups decides to leave behind two old women in the snow-covered wilderness.Left back and dumbfounded in fright, 75-year-old Sa' and 80-year-old Ch'idzigyaak remain seated in the snow after the leader announced the decision to the tribe. Before moving on, Ch'idzigyaak's daughter gives them an untanned moose's skin, or babiche. As another familial gesture, Ch'idzigyaak's grandson hides his osseous hatchet, which is the symbol of his manhood, for the two women. The tribe leaves. Left back to themselves, the two women at first sit silently. In their desperation, however, they decide it's better to die trying to survive. Sa' succeeds in killing a squirrel using the hatchet as a weapon. The two women boil the meat and drink the broth. They then go on to set rabbit traps {{and in the middle of}} the night wake to animal noises: they find two rabbits in their traps. The women now decide to move on to hunt better game. In order to cross the snow, they make themselves snowshoes. Eventually, they reach a river where their tribe had fished successfully in the warmer season. On each night of their journey of several days, the women dig a snow shelter protected by animal hides. They save the embers of their campfires to start a new fire the next evening. In this way, the fire never goes out. In the mornings, the two old women complain about their pains in the joints. Finally they reach their familiar river and set up a winter camp there. However, they hide inland from The People, another tribe, for fear of cannibalism. Fortunately, the two old women succeed in building up a generous supply of food made up of smoked <b>musquashes</b> and beavers. In the summer, they catch large amounts of fish and manage to dry and store them away.|$|R

60|$|His {{apparent}} {{business was}} somewhat prosaic. <b>Musquash,</b> the Blackfeet, {{in place of}} remaining quietly on his reserve, had {{in a state of}} inebriation reverted to the primitive customs of his race, and taking the trail, not only annexed some of his white neighbors' ponies and badly frightened their wives, but drove off a steer with which he feasted his people. The owner following came upon the hide, and <b>Musquash,</b> seeing {{it was too late to}} remove the brand from it, expressed his contrition, and pleaded in extenuation that he was rather worthy of sympathy than blame, because he would never have laid hands on what was not his had not a white man sold him deleterious liquor. As no white man is allowed to supply an Indian with alcohol in any form, the wardens of the prairie took a somewhat similar view of the case, and Stimson was, from motives which he did not mention, especially anxious to get his grip upon the other offender.|$|E
60|$|My kind {{publishers}} announced, {{some time}} ago, {{a table of}} contents, which included chapters on jay and fish-hawk, panther, and <b>musquash,</b> and a certain savage old bull moose that once took up his abode too near my camp for comfort. My only excuse for their non-appearance is that my little book was full before their turn came. They will find their place, I trust, in another volume presently.|$|E
60|$|It was {{fascinating}} sport always, whether the trout were rising or not. One had to fish with his ears, and keep {{most of his}} wits in his hand, ready to strike quick and hard when the moment came, {{after an hour of}} casting. Half the time you would not see your fish at all, but only hear the savage plunge as he swirled down with your fly. At other times, as you struck sharply at the plunge, your fly would come back to you, or tangle itself up in unseen snags; and far out, where the verge of the firelight rippled away into darkness, you would see a sharp wave-wedge shooting away, which told you that your trout was only a <b>musquash.</b> Swimming quietly by, he had seen you and your fire, and slapped his tail down hard on the water to make you jump. That is a way <b>Musquash</b> has in the night, so that he can make up his mind what queer thing {{you are and what you}} are doing.|$|E
60|$|My {{companion}} having {{returned with}} his bag, we set forward again. The walking rapidly grew worse {{and the path}} more indistinct, and at length we found ourselves in a more open and regular swamp made less passable than ordinary by the unusual wetness of the season. We sank a foot deep in water and mud at every step, and sometimes up to our knees. The trail was almost obliterated, being {{no more than a}} <b>musquash</b> leaves in similar places when he parts the floating sedge. In fact, it probably was a <b>musquash</b> trail in some places. We concluded that if Mud Pond was as muddy as the approach to it was wet, it certainly deserved its name. It would have been amusing to behold the dogged and deliberate pace at which we entered that swamp, without interchanging a word, as if determined to go through it, though it should come up to our necks. Having penetrated a considerable distance into this and found a tussock on which we could deposit our loads, though there was no place to sit, my companion went back {{for the rest of his}} pack.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there be}} many {{pictures}} on my mind. Of a huge manufacturing city of {{three hundred thousand}} souls lighted and warmed by natural gas, so that the great valley full of flaming furnaces sent up no smoke wreaths to the clear sky. Of <b>Musquash</b> itself lighted by the same mysterious agency, flares of gas eight feet long, roaring day and night {{at the corners of}} the grass-grown streets because it wasn't worth while to turn them out; of fleets of coal-flats being hauled down the river on an interminable journey to St. Louis; of factories nestling in woods where all the axe-handles and shovels in the world seemed to be manufactured daily; and last, of that quaint forgotten German community, the Brotherhood of Perpetual Separation, who founded themselves when the State was yet young and land cheap, and are now dying out because they will neither marry nor give in marriage and their recruits are very few. The advance in the value of land has almost smothered these poor old people in a golden affluence that they never desired. They live in a little village where the houses are built old Dutch fashion, with their front doors away from the road, and cobbled paths all about. The cloistered peace of <b>Musquash</b> is a metropolitan riot beside the hush of that village. And there is, too, a love-tale tucked away among the flowers. It has taken seventy years in the telling, for the brother and sister loved each other well, but they loved their duty to the brotherhood more. So they have lived and still do live, seeing each other daily, and separated for all time. Any trouble that might have been is altogether wiped out of their faces, which are as calm as those of very little children. To the uninitiated those constant ones resemble extremely old people in garments of absurd cut. But they love each other, and that seems to bring one back quite naturally to the girls and the boys in <b>Musquash.</b> The boys were nice boys--graduates of Yale of course; you mustn't mention Harvard here--but none the less skilled in business, in stocks and shares, the boring for oil, and the sale of everything that can be sold by one sinner to another. Skilled, too, in baseball, big-shouldered, with straight eyes and square chins--but not above occasional diversion and mild orgies. They will make good citizens and possess the earth, and eventually wed one of the nice white muslin dresses. There are worse things in this world than being [...] "one of the boys" [...] in <b>Musquash.</b>|$|E
60|$|If {{on a lake}} shore, {{where the}} rise of water is never great, the beaver's house is four or five feet high. On streams subject to freshets they may be {{two or three times}} that height. As {{in the case of the}} <b>musquash</b> (or muskrat), a strange {{instinct}} guides the beaver as to the height of his dwelling. He builds high or low, according to his expectations of high or low water; and he is rarely drowned out of his dry nest.|$|E
60|$|Late on the {{following}} day the Nor'-West scouts reported the party of Indians, and soon a set of sleighs departed from the fort with loudly-ringing bells. After a long day's march of forty miles, they reached the encampment, where they found all the Indians dead drunk, and not a skin, not even the remnant of a <b>musquash,</b> left to repay them for their trouble! Then it was that they discovered the ruse of the ball, and vowed to have their revenge.|$|E
60|$|Once {{the chance}} came as I was {{watching}} a muskrat at his supper. It was twilight in the woods. I had drifted in close to shore in my canoe to see what <b>Musquash</b> was doing {{on top of a}} rock. All muskrats have favorite eating places--a rock, a stranded log, a tree boll that leans out over the water, and always a pretty spot--whither they bring food from a distance, evidently for the purpose of eating it where they feel most at home. This one had gathered a half dozen big fresh-water clams onto his dining table, and sat down in the midst to enjoy the feast. He would take a clam in his fore paws, whack it a few times on the rock till the shell cracked, then open it with his teeth and devour the morsel inside. He ate leisurely, tasting each clam critically before swallowing, and sitting up often to wash his whiskers or to look out over the lake. A hermit thrush sang marvelously sweet above him; the twilight colors glowed deep and deeper in the water below, where his shadow was clearly eating clams also, in the midst of heaven's splendor.--Altogether a pretty scene, and a moment of peace that I still love to remember. I quite forgot that <b>Musquash</b> is a villain. But the tragedy was near, as it always is in the wilderness. Suddenly a movement caught my eye on the bank above. Something was waving nervously under the bushes. Before I could make out what it was, there was a fearful rush, a gleam of wild yellow eyes, a squeak from the muskrat. Then Upweekis, looking gaunt and dark and strange in his summer coat, was crouched on the rock with <b>Musquash</b> between his great paws, growling fiercely as he cracked the bones. He bit his game all over, {{to make sure that it}} was quite dead, then took it by the back of the neck, glided into the bushes with his stub tail twitching, and became a shadow again.|$|E
60|$|Could we have {{followed}} the family on this first night of their wanderings, before the raids began and the dogs had scattered them, we would have understood why Mooweesuk is called a brother to the bear. Running he steps on his toes like a dog; and anatomically, especially {{in the development of}} the skull and ear bones, he suggests the prehistoric ancestor of both dog and wolf; but otherwise he is a pocket-edition of Mooween in all his habits. The mother always leads, like a bear, and the little ones follow in single file, noting everything that the mother calls attention to. They sit on their haunches and walk flat-footed, like a bear, leaving a track from their hind feet like that of a dwarf baby. Everything eatable in the woods ministers to their hunger, as it does to that of the greedy prowler in the black coat. Now they stir up an ant's nest; now they grub into a rotten log for worms and beetles. If they can find sweet sap, or a bit of molasses in an old camp, they dip their paws in it and then lick them clean, as Mooween does. They hunt now for wintergreen berries, and now for a woodmouse. They find a shallow place in the brook when the suckers are running and wait there till the big fish go by, when they flip them out with their paws and scramble after them. From this fishing they turn to lush water-grass, or to digging frogs and turtles out of the mud; and the turtle's shell is cracked by dropping a stone upon it. Now they steal into the coop and scuttle away with a chicken; and after eating it they come back to the garden to crack a pumpkin open and make a dessert of the seeds. Now they see a muskrat swimming by in the pond with a mussel in his mouth, and they follow after him along the bank; for <b>Musquash</b> has a curious habit of eating in regular places--a flat rock, a stranded log, a certain tussock from which he has cut away the grass--and will often gather half a dozen or more clams and mussels before he sits down to dine. Mooweesuk watches till he finds the place; then, while <b>Musquash</b> is gone away after more clams, he will run off with all that he finds on the dining table. A score of times, on the ponds and streams, I have read the record of this little comedy. You can always tell the place where <b>Musquash</b> eats by the pile of mussel shells in the water below it; and sometimes you will find Mooweesuk's track stealing down to the place, and if you follow it you will find where he cracked the clams that <b>Musquash</b> had gathered.|$|E
60|$|A <b>musquash</b> came by, {{and rubbed}} his nose against the canoe, and nibbled a lily root before he noticed me. A shoal of minnows were playing among the grasses near by. A dragon-fly stood on his head against a reed--a most {{difficult}} feat, I should think. He was trying some contortion that I couldn't make out, when a deer stepped down the bank and never saw me. Doing nothing pays one under such circumstances, if only by the glimpses it gives of animal life. It is so rare to see a wild thing unconscious.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} loon, a mother bird, on a {{different}} lake, whose two eggs had been carried off by a thieving muskrat; {{but she did not}} know who did it, for <b>Musquash</b> knows how to roll the eggs into water and carry them off, before eating, where the mother bird will not find the shells. She came swimming down to meet us the moment our canoe entered the lake; and what she seemed to cry was, [...] "Where are they? O where are they?" [...] She followed us across the lake, accusing us of robbery, and asking the same question over and over.|$|E
60|$|The rivers, {{which are}} crossed in wooden canoes, {{in the absence}} of bridges, are well stocked with fish, the {{principal}} kinds being goldeyes, sturgeon, and catfish. Of these, I think the goldeyes the best; at any rate, they are the most numerous. The wild animals inhabiting the woods and prairies are much the same as in the other parts of North America-- namely, wolves, foxes, brown and black bears, martens, minks, <b>musquash,</b> rabbits, etcetera; while the woods are filled with game, the marshes and ponds with ducks, geese, swans, cranes, {{and a host of other}} water-fowl.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} {{especially one}} big <b>musquash</b> that I {{was going to}} shoot near one of my traps, when I stopped short at noticing some queer thing about him. The trap was set in shallow water where a path made by muskrats came {{up out of the}} river into the grass. Just over the trap was a turnip on a pointed stick to draw the creature's attention and give him something to anticipate until he should put his foot on the deadly pan beneath. But the old <b>musquash</b> avoided the path, as if he had suffered in such places before. Instead of following the ways of his ancestors he came out at another spot behind the trap, and I saw with horrible regret that he had cut off both his fore legs, probably at different times, when he had been twice caught in man's abominable inventions. When he came up out of the stream he rose on his hind legs and waddled through the grass like a bear or a monkey, for he had no fore feet to rest upon. He climbed a tussock beside the bait with immense caution, pulled in the turnip with his two poor stumps of forearms, ate it where he was, and slipped back into the stream again; while the boy watched with a new wonder in the twilight, and forgot all about the gun as he tended his traps.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had started}} up to interfere, for I had grown {{fond of the}} little wild things whose growth I had watched from the beginning, when a great {{splashing}} began on my left, and I saw the old mother bird coming like a fury. She was half swimming, half flying, tearing over the water at a great pace, a foamy white wake behind her.--"Now, you little villain, take your medicine. It's coming; it's coming," [...] I cried excitedly, and dodged back to watch. But <b>Musquash,</b> intent on his evil doing (he has no need whatever to turn flesh-eater), kept on viciously after the exhausted little ones, paying no heed to his rear.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Musquash</b> knows {{well that}} when a young loon, or a shelldrake, or a black duck, is caught in the open like that, he always tries to get back where his mother hid him when she went away. That is what the poor little fellows {{were trying to do}} now, only to be driven back and kept moving wildly by the muskrat, who lifted himself now and then from the water, and wiggled his ugly jaws in {{anticipation}} of the feast. He had missed the eggs in his search; but young loon would be better, and more of it.--"There you are!" [...] he snapped viciously, lunging at the nearest loon, which flashed under water and barely escaped.|$|E
60|$|All this is digression; and I {{have almost}} {{forgotten}} my surgery {{and the particular}} muskrat I was talking about. He, too, had been caught in some other fellow's trap and had bitten his leg off {{only a few days}} before. The wound was not yet healed, and the amazing thing about it was that he had covered it with some kind of sticky vegetable gum, probably from some pine-tree that had been split or barked close to the ground where <b>Musquash</b> could reach it easily. He had smeared it thickly all over the wound and well up the leg above it, so that all dirt and even all air and water were excluded perfectly.|$|E
60|$|It was {{at least}} five miles by the way we had come, and as my {{companion}} had gone over most of it three times he had walked full a dozen miles. In the winter, when the water is frozen and the snow is four feet deep, it is no doubt a tolerable path to a footman. If you want an exact recipe for making such a road, take one part Mud Pond, and dilute it with equal parts of Umbazookskus and Apmoojenegamook; then send a family of <b>musquash</b> through to locate it, look after the grades and culverts, and finish it to their minds, and let a hurricane follow to do the fencing.|$|E
6000|$|The little {{community}} {{seemed to}} be as self-contained as an Indian village. Had {{the rest of the}} land sunk under the sea, <b>Musquash</b> would have gone on sending its sons to school in order to make them [...] "good citizens," [...] which is the constant prayer of the true American father, settling its own road-making, local cesses, town-lot arbitrations, and internal government by ballot and vote and due respect to the voices of the headmen (which is the salvation of the ballot), until such time as all should take their places in the cemetery appointed for their faith. Here were Americans and no aliens--men ruling themselves by themselves and for themselves and their wives and their children--in peace, order, and decency.|$|E
60|$|Midnight in the wilderness. The belated moon wheels slowly {{above the}} eastern ridge, where {{for a few}} minutes past a mighty pine and {{hundreds}} of pointed spruce tops have been standing out in inky blackness against the gray and brightening background. The silver light steals swiftly down the evergreen tops, sending long black shadows creeping before it, and falls glistening and shimmering across the sleeping waters of a forest lake. No ripple breaks its polished surface; no plash of <b>musquash</b> or leaping trout sends its vibrations up into the still, frosty air; no sound of beast or bird awakens the echoes of the silent forest. Nature seems dying, her life frozen out of her by the chill of the October night; and no voice tells of her suffering.|$|E
60|$|The African hunter Cumming {{tells us}} that the skin of the eland, {{as well as that of}} most other antelopes just killed, emits the most delicious perfume of trees and grass. I would have every man so much like a wild antelope, so much a part and parcel of nature, that his very person should thus sweetly {{advertise}} our senses of his presence, and remind us of those parts of nature which he most haunts. I feel no disposition to be satirical, when the trapper's coat emits the odor of <b>musquash</b> even; it is a sweeter scent to me than that which commonly exhales from the merchant's or the scholar's garments. When I go into their wardrobes and handle their vestments, I am reminded of no grassy plains and flowery meads which they have frequented, but of dusty merchants' exchanges and libraries rather.|$|E
60|$|When {{the next}} still, misty night came, it found me afloat on the lonely little pond {{with a dark}} lantern {{fastened}} to an upright stick {{just in front of}} me in the canoe. In the shadow of the shores all was black as Egypt; but out in the middle the outlines of the pond could be followed vaguely by the heavy cloud of woods against the lighter sky. The stillness was intense; every slightest sound,--the creak of a bough or the ripple of a passing <b>musquash,</b> the plunk of a water drop into the lake or the snap of a rotten twig, broken by the weight of clinging mist,--came to the strained ear with startling suddenness. Then, as I waited and sifted the night sounds, a dainty plop, plop, plop! sent the canoe gliding like a shadow toward the shore whence the sounds had come.|$|E
60|$|The {{sun sets}} on some retired meadow, where no house is visible, {{with all the}} glory and splendor that it lavishes on cities, and perchance as it has never set before--where there is but a solitary marsh hawk to have his wings gilded by it, or only a <b>musquash</b> looks out from his cabin, {{and there is some}} little black-veined brook {{in the midst of the}} marsh, just {{beginning}} to meander, winding slowly round a decaying stump. We walked in so pure and bright a light, gilding the withered grass and leaves, so softly and serenely bright, I thought I had never bathed in such a golden flood, without a ripple or a murmur to it. The west side of every wood and rising ground gleamed like the boundary of Elysium, and the sun on our backs seemed like a gentle herdsman driving us home at evening.|$|E
60|$|This {{swimming}} {{power of}} Keeonekh {{is all the}} more astonishing when one remembers that he is distinctively a land animal, with none of the special endowments of the seal, who is his only rival as a fisherman. Nature undoubtedly intended him to get his living, as the other members of his large family do, by hunting in the woods, and endowed him accordingly. He is a strong runner, a good climber, a patient tireless hunter, and his nose is keen as a brier. With a little practice he could again get his living by hunting, as his ancestors did. If squirrels and rats and rabbits were too nimble at first, there are plenty of <b>musquash</b> to be caught, and he need not stop at a fawn or a sheep, for he is enormously strong, and the grip of his jaws is not to be loosened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go to {{the head}} of the class, Peter," [...] said Old Mother Nature, smiling. [...] "Jerry is the very one, the largest member of the Rat family. Sometimes he is spoken of as a little cousin of Paddy the Beaver. Probably this is because he looks {{something}} like a small Beaver, builds a house in the water as Paddy does, and lives in very much the same way. The truth is, he is no more closely related to Paddy than he is to the rest of you. He is a true Rat. He is called Muskrat because he carries with him a scent called musk. It is not an unpleasant scent, like that of Jimmy Skunk, and isn't used for the same purpose. Jerry uses his to tell his friends where he has been. He leaves a little of it at the places he visits. Some folks call him <b>Musquash,</b> but Muskrat is better.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{while the}} mother was gone fishing, the little ones came out of their hiding among the grasses, and ventured out some {{distance}} into the bay. It was their first journey alone into the world; they were full of the wonder and importance of it. Suddenly, as I watched, they began to dart about wildly, moving with astonishing rapidity for such little fellows, and whistling loudly. From the bank above, a swift ripple had cut out into the water {{between them and the}} only bit of bog with which they were familiar. Just behind the ripple were the sharp nose and the beady eyes of <b>Musquash,</b> who is always in some mischief of this kind. In one of his prowlings he had discovered the little brood; now he was man≈ìuvering craftily to keep the frightened youngsters moving till they should be tired out, while he himself crept carefully between them and the shore.|$|E
