50|$|Budweiser is brewed using barley malt, rice, water, hops and yeast. It is lagered with {{beechwood}} {{chips in}} the aging vessel. While beechwood chips {{are used in}} the <b>maturation</b> <b>tank,</b> there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in sodium bicarbonate soda for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood. The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, flocculation of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a krausening procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. By placing the beechwood chips {{at the bottom of the}} tank, the yeast remains in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl, that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.|$|E

This paper reviewed the studies on the maturation diets for mud crab broodstock, genus Scylla and compared independently to identify their effect on reproductive performance and larval quality. The broodstock is usually caught from the wild and held in the spawning or <b>maturation</b> <b>tank</b> for further use of hatchery seed production. Mud crab broodstock was fed either natural diet, artificial diet or mixed diet. Trash fishes were commonly used as a natural feed for mud crab broodstock; meanwhile artificial diets are from formulated fish meal and various kinds of feed. The results indicated that mud crab broodstock has a high dietary requirement for lipids, fatty acids and protein which are to be used during the maturation and breeding processes. However, the natural diet produce better larval quality compared to the artificial diet. The mixed diet is the better diet which resulted in better reproductive performances such as growth, survival, fecundity and maturation processes. This review also discusses the problems in the previous studies for the potential future research to develop very high quality and cost-effective formulated diet for the enhancement of broodstock and seed production technology.

Results showed successful rearing of Penaeus monodon (nauplii-postlarvae) in systems with facilities for wastewater recirculation. Aeration systems became ineffective in maintaining acceptable water quality as shown by increases in 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), ammonia (NH 4 -N) and nitrite (NO 2 -N) nitrogen, and decreases in dissolved oxygen (DO). For broodstock maturation, a recirculating system with a preconditioned biological filter was compared with a flow-through system. Biological filtration proved to be useful in meeting water quality requirements. Nitrification was satisfactory with ammonia levels lower than 1 Â· 0 mg liter âˆ’ 1. The pH values in the biofilter effluent were maintained at 7 Â· 8 â€“ 8 Â· 3. BOD 5 levels were below 10 mg liter âˆ’ 1 while DO tended to drop due to the nitrifying activity of the filter.

40|$|Commercially {{important}} penaeids of {{the closed}} thelycum group belong to five subgenera {{of the genus}} Penaeus â€” Penaeus, Fenneropenaeus, Marsupenaeus and Melicertus that are almost exclusively Indo-West Pacific and Farfantepenaeus that is predominantly Western Atlantic. Since the ablation of Penaeus duorarum {{more than a decade}} ago, the first for any penaeid, around 23 species have been matured in captivity, 17 of them belonging to the closed thelycum subgenera (P. aztecus, P. brasiliensis, P. californiensis, P. duorarum, P. esculentus, P. indicus, P. japonicus, P. kerathurus, P. latisulcatus, P. merguiensis, P. monodon, P. notialis, P. orientalis, P. paulensis, P. penicillatus, P. plebejus, and P. semisulcatus). The complete spectrum of controlled reproduction in penaeids covers maturation, spawning, hatching of eggs into viable larvae, and the production of postlarvae to constitute the next batch of broodstock. The full closing of the cycle has been achieved in at least six closed thelycum species whereas gaps, e. g. inability of mature females to spawn or nonhatching of eggs, remain for the others. Spawners or mature females used in commercial hatcheries and research laboratories are either wild-caught or matured in captivity with human control ranging from nil to a regular closing of the cycle. Wild spawners may be spawned directly after capture and transport or subjected to environmental manipulation, e. g. thermal control to induce or inhibit spawning. Females matured in captivity may come from wild broodstock (adults and subadults caught from estuaries or "sourced" by trawlers from offshore waters) or captive (pond- or tank-reared) broodstock. Introduced or exotic penaeid species must depend on a pond- or tank-reared broodstock whereas indigenous prawns and shrimps may be constituted from wild or captive broodstock. There are three basic approaches employed singly or in combination to induce ovarian maturation in penaeids â€” endocrine, dietary or nutritional and environmental. Endocrine manipulation has so far been synonymous with unilateral eyestalk ablation, a technique with far-reaching impact on penaeid aquaculture. Closed thelycum penaeids may be classified into those that require ablation in order to mature and those that do not. To a third group belong species that have been experimentally induced to mature with and without ablation. Diets for maturation include fresh and frozen animal sources (mussel, clam, oyster, squid, marine worms, shrimps, fish) and formulated pellets given in any combination. The choice of marine worms and mollusks is based on their high levels of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid, the dominant fatty acids found in mature ovaries and testes. Environmental parameters studied in relation to maturation include light (intensity, quality and photoperiod), temperature, salinity and pH. Although a regular closing of the cycle has been achieved for some, the state-of-the-art for most penaeids is the successful production of larvae and postlarvae from either wild spawners or wild immature/spent females matured/rematured in captivity. The improvement of reproductive performance including larval quality from captive broodstock remains a major area for future research and includes the determination of minimum age and size for maturation. The complete description of the nutritional and environmental requirements for maturation should lead to the development of alternatives to ablation such as photoperiod manipulation or the use of reproductive hormones. The present focus on characterizing the physicochemical and dietary requirements for maturation should be extended to other phases of reproduction: mating, spawning, fertilization and hatching. Studies on biology (molting, mating, fertilization including the cortical reaction) and biochemistry (maturation stages) provide baseline information for designing <b>maturation</b> <b>tanks</b> and formulating broodstock pellets. Investigations of wild stocks complement laboratory studies in elucidating the interrelationships among molting, mating, maturation and spawning.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringStacy L. HutchinsonThe {{shortage}} of clean, usable {{water is a}} global problem (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). As much as 80 % of the world’s population {{has been reported to}} be in areas of high water security risk due to a convergence of factors, such as watershed disturbance, pollution, water resource development and biotic factors (Voeroesmarty et al., 2010). Water reuse technologies are a potential solution to this problem. However, implementation of treatment technologies for improved water reuse require rapid, effective monitoring techniques capable of insuring treatment quality. Fluorescence spectroscopy has shown potential for wastewater treatment monitoring due to its sensitivity, selectivity, and capacity to be employed in-situ. Online fluorescence data and full fluorescence excitation-emission matrices coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were employed to evaluate the treatment performance of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) at Fort Riley, KS. Specific research goals were {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} fluorescence for monitoring wastewater treatment and to determine the contamination detection limit of fluorescence techniques in a non-potable reuse scenario. Study results revealed a two-stage startup period, the first 60 days indicated membrane cake layer formation and the first 90 days showed signs of oxic <b>tank</b> <b>maturation.</b> Fluorescence was found to be effective at monitoring carbon concentration trends throughout the MBR system, showed preferential removal of protein-like dissolved organic matter (DOM), and an increase in biodegradation of DOM as the oxic tank matured.

40|$|The thesis work {{concerns}} the multiseriate exodermis (MEX), an outermost cortical layer (two or more cell layers thick) characterized by Casparian bands and suberin lamellae. Diverse aspects of Iris germanica's MEX were examined including its maturation under differing growth conditions, {{and how this}} maturation affected water and solute permeability. Also, suberin metabolite profiles for the maturing MEX of I. germanica and the maturing uniseriate exodermis of Allium cepa were established. This multidisciplinary approach resulted in a comprehensive understanding of how anatomical and biochemical changes to the exodermis affect water and solute permeability of the MEX. Most previous studies of exodermal development have involved species with a uniseriate exodermis. To extend this work, the MEX in I. germanica roots was investigated. The outermost exodermal layer matured first with normal Casparian bands and suberin lamellae. But as subsequent layers matured, the Casparian band extended into the tangential and anticlinal walls of their cells. This atypical Casparian band was continuous around the root circumference. MEX maturation {{was influenced by the}} roots' growth medium. Plants were grown in soil or hydroponics (with and without a humid air gap), and their roots were sectioned and stained with various dyes to detect Casparian bands and suberin lamellae. In soil-grown roots, the exodermis started maturing (with concurrent deposition of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae) 10 mm from the root tip, and two layers had matured by 70 mm. In hydroponically grown roots, exodermal maturation was delayed. However, in basal regions exposed to an air gap in the hydroponic <b>tank,</b> <b>maturation</b> of the second exodermal layer was accelerated. Therefore, changes in growth conditions have striking effects on exodermal maturation in I. germanica. With respect to radial water and solute transport, I. germanica roots with a mature MEX had lower permeability rates compared with uniseriate exodermal roots or roots in which the endodermis represents the major transport barrier. Transport studies were conducted on completely submerged roots and air gap-exposed root regions using a pressure chamber whereby water permeability (Lppc) was measured quantitatively across the entire root. This instrument proved to be preferable because in large diameter roots (up to 2. 5 mm in I. germanica), root hydraulics were affected by the large water storage capacity of the central cortex. Compared with regions of roots with no mature exodermal layers, the mature MEX reduced Lppc from 8. 5 x 10 - 8 to 3. 9 x 10 - 8 m s- 1 MPa- 1. Puncturing the MEX increased Lppc to 19 x 10 - 8 m s- 1 MPa- 1, indicating that the MEX is an important hydraulically resistant tissue. A root pressure probe was used to measure the permeability of roots to NaCl and ethanol; solute permeability was reduced in the presence of two mature MEX layers. The MEX of I. germanica should {{play an important role in}} survival under conditions of drought and salt stress. Suberin is a complex biopolymer with a poly(aliphatic) domain (SPAD) that, in the case of a suberin lamellae, is known to be located between the cell wall and plasma membrane. The location and lipophilic nature of the SPAD establishes it as a structure restrictive to radial water transport through the transcellular pathway. Synthesis of the SPAD in a maturing exodermis was not well understood. Hence, a suberin metabolite analysis during development was conducted on the maturing MEX of I. germanica grown in submerged and air gap hydroponic conditions. Suberin monomers of the soluble (unpolymerized) and insoluble (polymerized) fractions were chemically isolated, then quantified and identified by GC-MS. Interestingly, in air gap-exposed regions, there was an increased synthesis and deposition of insoluble SPAD monomers in the first two exodermal layers, compared with submerged regions. The SPAD fraction included fatty acids, α,ω-dioic acids, ω-OH fatty acids, and ferulic acid, with C 18 : 1 α,ω-dioic acid and ω-OH fatty acid being the two most abundant monomers. Also, in tissue that matured in the air gap, the composition of the soluble fraction changed significantly among exodermal maturation stages and between growth conditions. Of particular significance, increased amounts of alkanes, the major component of waxes, accumulated in the first exodermal layer. Other monomers of the soluble fraction included fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and ferulic acid, that were SPAD biosynthetic precursors. It was postulated that the localized and abundant deposition of C 18 : 1 α,ω-dioic acid and ω-OH fatty acid, along with high accumulation of intercalated waxes in the first mature exodermal layer, were more important than the overall number of suberized exodermal layers for reducing water loss from the root during drought. Lastly, hydroponically grown Allium cepa roots were used as models to analyze SPAD synthesis in a maturing uniseriate exodermis. Roots were divided into four maturation zones based on the growth rate and the deposition of suberin lamellae in maturing exodermal cells as determined by histochemical analyses. The chemical composition of the soluble fraction was essentially unchanged as the exodermis matured. In contrast, the SPAD composition differed during maturation, mainly due to significant increases in the deposition of C 18 : 1 α,ω-dioic acids and C 18 : 1 ω-OH fatty acids. It is proposed that the exodermal maturation zones with corresponding suberin metabolite profiles be used as targets for the functional enzymatic characterization of suberin biosynthetic pathways...|$|R
