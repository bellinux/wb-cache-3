5000|$|The {{neighborhood}} association, {{known as}} the [...] "Wijkvereniging het Ooievaarsnest", regularly organizes neighborhood festivities and events for children. It has also represented the neighborhood in matters pertaining {{to the expansion of}} the <b>motorway,</b> <b>improvement</b> of the sewers and improvement of rainwater drainage capacity (a long-standing neighborhood problem due to bad land preparation, as a result of hasty building in the 1970s).|$|E
50|$|Ploiești is {{situated}} on the A3 motorway (partially completed as of Spring 2014), the main route to Romania's northern and western provinces and the Western EU. Henri Coandă International Airport is 45 km distant, and the ski resorts of the Prahova Valley can be reached in an hour's drive. The scarcity of modern motorways and well-built roads around Ploiești, as in Romania in general, makes transport a challenge. Under the scrutiny of the EU, several <b>motorway</b> <b>improvement</b> projects are planned or in progress.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} {{concession}} agreement between the Greek state and the consortium operating the motorway (Moreas S.A.), the latter is responsible for constructing, operating, maintaining and modernizing the A7. In existing sections of the <b>motorway,</b> <b>improvements</b> include the straightening of dangerous curves, constructing new tunnels, completing the Artemision tunnel, adding more light fixtures and upgrading the median throughout.http://www.moreas.com.gr/defaulten.asp?catid=18270 ...|$|R
2500|$|Most of the motorway's length was {{complete}} by 1980. Since then, the only additions {{have been a}} new interchange with the M80 motorway in 1992, a [...] eastern extension from Newbridge to the then-new Edinburgh City Bypass in 1995, and the new junction on the approach to the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow connecting to the new M74 extension in 2011. As part of the Scottish Government's 'M8 M73 M74 <b>Motorway</b> <b>Improvements</b> programme', on which construction began in early 2015, the remaining unfinished section between Baillieston (J8) and Newhouse (J6) was built, alongside other major improvements enhancing connectivity to the local road network, M73, and M74. The new section was fully opened on 30 April 2017.|$|R

50|$|Smartlink is {{an element}} of the {{transport}} strategy for Ashford (along with M20 <b>motorway,</b> junction 10 <b>improvements,</b> junction 10A development, a new Victoria Way and the dualing of Chart Road.) It is intended to increase ithe number and proportion of trips by sustainable means, particularly passenger transport. The aim is integrated bus provision across the town.|$|R
25|$|For roads, the M5 {{motorway}} {{between the}} West Midlands and the West Country and its junction with the M6 motorway {{passes through the}} town, making West Bromwich at the hub of Britain's <b>motorway</b> network. <b>Improvements</b> are underway at A41 junction by West Bromwich town centre after a £25 million project grant was awarded to the area to cut congestion for commuters. The junction, which is where The Expressway meets All saints way, currently carries over 60,000 vehicles a day, and is close to Junction 1 of the M5 The project involves {{the creation of a}} dual carriageway underpass, beneath an improved roundabout. This work began in June 2010 and should hopefully be completed in Autumn 2012. West Bromwich has its own bus station in the town centre, with connections to Birmingham and other major towns in the West Midlands region.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} degree of concern over the continuing sprawl of low density development outwards from the Dublin Region and the leapfrogging pattern of commuter based housing development as urban centres some distance away from Dublin experience rapid development patterns in response to increases in metropolitan house prices. Interestingly, one contributing factor to this development pattern has been quoted as road infrastructure (Williams & Shiels, 1998). The construction of the M 50 Cring <b>motorway</b> and <b>improvement</b> {{of all of the}} national primary road corridors connecting to it, have contributed to a wider catchment area for commuteTh. ln a way, the housing market in the region fonns a reasonably accurate and transparent illustration of the traditional trade [...] off theory of land prices (Alonso, 1965) where house buyers base their locational choice on the trade-off between lower house prices with higher travel to work costs...|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} works related to {{environmental}} mitigation, post-project landscaping or improvement of non-motorway transport links {{were associated with}} the project (and either paid for or undertaken by NZTA). These included a 3.5m wide replacement foot/cycle bridge over Beachcroft Road, a new 3.5m wide foot/cycle bridge over Onehunga Harbour Road at the Old Mangere Bridge, an upgraded underpass under the motorway connecting to Onehunga, as well as improved links to the walking and cycling paths along the harbour and <b>motorway</b> edges and <b>improvement</b> works on the Old Mangere Bridge causeway. After finishing work, NZTA reinstated their large construction staging site along the southern harbour front as an open space, [...] "passive recreation" [...] park with Pohutukawa.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} about carpool. Carpool is an {{arrangement}} whereby several participants travel {{together in one}} vehicle to the same or nearby destination. Advantages and disadvantages will be presented on some examples from the USA and Canada as well as different systems of carpool. Carpooling is increasing also in Europe and in Slovenia as well. Observations have been made along Slovenian motorways to record sites near motorways access, which are usually not regulated as parking lot, where cars are parked, while commuters continue their journey with other commuters. A survey has been made {{on some of these}} sites to achieve data from commuters, who already carpool every day. An additional survey has been distributed to random drivers in order to find people who like carpool as a way to commute every day and potential commuters who would be willing to share their ride with other commuters. Both survey results are presented. In the following section transportation modelling is treated. Special attention will be given to the prioritisation of high-occupancy vehicles. Carpool incentives are provided to encourage carpooling as well as arrangement proposals of sites near <b>motorways</b> access and <b>improvements</b> in order to develop carpool in Slovenia...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} contains {{general information}} about some important issues concerning habitat fragmentation due to linear infrastructure and measures taken to counteract this phenomenon. COST 341 At the International Conference on Ecology and Transportation (ICOET) 2003, I presented {{an overview of}} COST 341. This European action, ordered by the European Union (EU), was initiated by the Infra Eco Network of Europe (IENE). The action concluded in November 2003 with a well-attended international conference in Brussels. At this conference, we appreciated it very much that several ICOET representatives attended. As the official chairman of the conference, I gave {{a piece of the}} jigsaw to Mary Gray to remind the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to continue with the subject and to use the information. At the conference, the products of the COST 341 action were presented. These products include the European Review, the handbook, the national state-of-the-art-reports, and the database. The Handbook of Cost 341 was translated to national versions for several countries. In each version of the handbook, specific, nationally oriented comments and questions were added. This was done in the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. In several of the 18 connected countries inside the action, the national working groups still exist as groups of well-informed people concerned about habitat fragmentation due to linear infrastructure. Also very important is that the network of people at the international level is still vital. When {{there is a need for}} information, a second opinion, or advice, a COST 341 colleague is willing to give assistance. This is only possible because there is a network of capable and involved people. The information gathered in COST 341 was the basis of several contributions at conferences concerning environmental issues in general or habitat fragmentation specifically. At the World Road Association (PIARC) 2003 World Congress in Durban, the results of COST 341 were presented as well. Habitat fragmentation now is included in the work of PIARC in Technical Committee (TC) 2. 1, Sustainable development and road transport. I am responsible for the action mitigation of the environmental impact of road transport, one of several actions under this TC. This technical committee sent out a questionnaire to contacts all over the world, and we will hope to have enough feedback to produce some practical recommendations on how to handle fragmentation in our report to the next World Congress in Paris 2007. At conferences in France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland this information was given to other people for use in other situations. Some general developments with big impact in Europe Previously, there were several EU directives concerning environmental issues around transport. Four of note include: the Habitat and Bird Directive, Soil Directive, Noise Directive, and Air Quality Directive. These directives must be implemented in the national legislation of each country that signed such a directive. These EU directives have a big influence on policy and legal aspects concerning nature protection and environmental issues along roads and rail lines. For example, the Air Quality Directive, which is already implemented in Dutch legislation, was enforced in this year and caused reconstruction plans to be stopped. A Dutch high court decided that the expected pollution levels would be too high. That means that the reconstruction was postponed until the expected impact has been measurably decreased. This court decision gave an enormous push to the research and measures involving air pollution due to traffic. Since 2004, there have been 10 new member nations added to the EU. The bilateral contacts intensified rapidly. There is an enormous increase of travel and cargo trade to and from these countries. And with this increasing amount of movement, there is a big need for new <b>motorways</b> and <b>improvement</b> of roads. This urgent need demands knowledge and for a new set of cooperation tools. These new countries must fulfill the regulations for road-building activities ordered by the EU directives. That is an important reason for several bilateral contacts, projects, and programs to exchange knowledge and information. So at this moment (September 2005), there is a conference in Poland where the 10 new EU countries are discussing the possibilities and tools for environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments. Chapter 1 20 ICOET 2005 Proceedings Some developments in the Netherlands In the new handbook (Leidraad aunavoorzieningen; see [URL] there is a lot of information about approaches, procedures, and ideas for defragmentation measures. The Long-Term Defragmentation Program has been launched and has been accepted by Parliament. In this program three ministries (Agriculture, Nature Protection and Food; Transport, Public Works and Water Management; Spatial Planning and Housing) give their intentions, including work schemes and money to counteract fragmentation due to national infrastructure (motorways, canals, and rail). This program is to solve the problems in the ecological main structure, including the robust zones inside that main structure. The approach in this long-term program is areaoriented, integrated, and based on cooperation between involved parties in the region. Biographical Sketch: Hans Bekker graduated from the Agricultural University of Wageningen as an engineer.
