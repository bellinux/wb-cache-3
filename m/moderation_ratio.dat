The calculations are an extension of those documented in ORNL/CSD/TM- 284. Specifically, the data for low-enriched UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O spheres have been extended to highly enriched uranium. These calculations, together with those reported in ORNL/CSD/TM- 284, provide a consistent set of critical parameters (k{sub {infinity}}, volume, mass, mass of water) for UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 } and water over {{the full range of}} enrichment and <b>moderation</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we have studied {{slightly}} modified water reactors and their applications to transition scenarios. The PWR and CANDU reactors have been considered. New fuels based on Thorium {{have been tested}} : Thorium/Plutonium and Thorium/Uranium- 233, with different fissile isotope contents. Changes in the geometry of the assemblies were also explored to modify the <b>moderation</b> <b>ratio,</b> and consequently the neutron flux spectrum. A core equivalent assembly methodology was introduced as an exploratory approach and to reduce the computation time. Several basic safety analyses were also performed. We have finally developed a new scenario code, named OSCAR (Optimized Scenario Code for Advanced Reactors), to study the efficiency of these modified reactors in transition to GenIV reactors or in symbiotic fleet...|$|E
40|$|A {{conversion}} ratio of near 1. 0 {{can be achieved}} in a pebble-bed reactor using the (once through then out) loading scheine, having an economic burn-up of the fuel, an economic power density and a <b>moderation</b> <b>ratio,</b> which is considered realistically for the future. The flexibility of the reactor concept and of the fuel element design allows to recycle the fuel during full-power operation. In the present report first the criteria are shown, which are necessary to reach a high {{conversion ratio}}. Further it is presented that the conversion ratio increases considerably by closing the fuel cycle in consequence of the building-up of U- 233. In this way the fuel inventory and the fuel consumption can considerably be diminished. lt is demonstrated that the building-up and the accumulation of U- 236 effects an important deterioration of the neutron econamy. By taking the reprocessed uranium through an isotope separation (for example : ultragas-centrifugation) and by separation of U- 236 from the other uranium isotopes {{it is possible to}} reduce the fuel consumption considerably. The expenditure and the cost which are necessary for the isotope separation are presented...|$|E
40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) {{concept has}} a unique feature, if {{compared}} {{to the majority of}} other reactor designs, that its fuel is liquid. This property creates, on one hand, several technical challenges; on the other hand, it offers flexibility in shaping and designing of the active core. Accordingly, single fuel fluid can, for instance, circulate through several core zones with different <b>moderation</b> <b>ratios.</b> This possibility was already considered in the past; however, in relation to the thermal MSR. In the presented study, an extreme case of hybrid spectrum MSR is proposed and preliminarily analyzed. It is concluded that hybrid spectrum may provide several advantages and could be applicable especially during the initial phase of the fuel cycle or by the transition to equilibrium cycle...|$|R

With respect to Pu enrichments and <b>moderation</b> [H/(Pu+U) atomic] <b>ratios</b> (MR), four-different homogeneous (Pu-U) O{sub 2 }-polystyrene mixtures were considered: (Mixture 1) 7. 6 wt% Pu with 19. 5 MR, (Mixture 2) 7. 89 wt% Pu with 51. 8 MR, (Mixture 3) 14. 62 wt% Pu with 30. 6 MR, and (Mixture 4) 30. 0 wt% Pu with 47. 4 MR. The Pu{sup 240 } isotopic contents in Pu were 23 wt% for Mixture 1 and 8 wt% for Mixtures 2 - 4. In all mixtures, the uranium was depleted to about 0. 151 wt% U{sup 235 }.

40|$|Abstract – Molten salt reactors, in the {{configuration}} presented here and called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR), are particularly {{well suited to}} fulfil the criteria chosen by the Generation IV forum, and may be operated in simplified and safe conditions in the Th/ 233 U fuel cycle with fluoride salts. Amongst all MSR configurations in the thorium cycle, many studies have highlighted {{the configuration}}s with no moderator in the core as simple and very promising. Since 233 U does not exist on earth and is not being produced today, we aim at designing a critical MSR able to burn the Plutonium and the Minor Actinides produced in the current operating reactors, and consequently to convert this Plutonium into 233 U. This leads to closing the current fuel cycle thanks to TMSRs started with transuranic elements on a Thorium base, i. e. started in the Th/Pu fuel cycle, similarly to fast neutron reactors operated in the U/Pu fuel cycle. We will detail optimizations of this transition between the reactors of second and third generations to the Thorium cycle. Such a transition {{is based on a}} fleet of TMSRs with no moderator in the core, including TMSRs started with Plutonium and TMSRs directly started with 233 U. We developed parametric studies to optimize these TMSRs, amongst which the study presented here, based on one of the main TMSR parameters: the percentage of heavy nuclei in the fuel salt of the TMSR configuration, which modifies the <b>moderation</b> <b>ratio</b> of the reactor and thus influences both the initial fissile inventory and the spectrum of the reactor. We analyze the characteristics of each reactor configuration, in terms of deterministic safety parameters, fissile matter inventory, salt reprocessing, radiotoxicity and waste production, and finally deployment capacities...|$|E
40|$|The MSBR (Molten Salt Breeder Reactor) was an {{industrial}} project designed {{at the beginning}} of the seventies at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and based on Thorium. Just before, the MSRE worked very well during four years with molten fuel. The MSBR system, where a maximum breeding was wanted, included a graphite moderated core with the circulation of a 71. 7 %LiF- 16 %BeF 2 - 12 %ThF 4 - 0. 3 %UF 4 salt and a pyro-chemical reprocessing unit. To obtain a maximum breeding ratio, Protactinium was extracted and stored allowing decay out of the neutron flux. This required the entire salt volume to be reprocessed in ten days, the gaseous fission products and Minor Actinides being extracted continuously by helium bubbling and pyro-chemical methods. The doubling time was evaluated to around 25 years. The project has since been re-evaluated especially within the frame of the EURATOM concerted Action MOST. To have an acceptable global reactivity feedback coefficient, studies have shown various possibilities based on core geometry, neutron <b>moderation</b> <b>ratio</b> and salt composition. When requiring only a breeding ratio of one, it is possible to avoid continuous reprocessing and to strongly simplify it. These various options will be discussed. The detailed inventory will be given showing clearly the interest of the Thorium Molten Salt Reactor where the production of Americium and Curium is a factor of one hundred lower that for the U-Pu RNR. The amount of Uranium 232 which is always produced in the Thorium cycle will be calculated as well as its decay rate since its decay chain eventually results in a 2. 6 MeV γ –ray which may be used to detect and hence control the U 233 fuel movements. As the U 233 has to be produced in other reactors (PWR, RNR or other MSR), special cares have to be taken and will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of Global 2009 - 2734 - 2743 Selected paper - RGNInternational audienceThis study {{focuses on}} Th-fueled CANDU and PWR {{reactors}} {{as the third}} and last component of a reactor fleet. Plutonium extracted from spent fuel of a standard CANDU or PWR is converted in the second component (FR or CANDU) to Uranium (mainly 233 U) which feeds a Th/U multirecycling third component. Breeding and multirecycling of 233 U in CANDU is optimized by modifying the core. It {{has been shown that}} slight <b>Moderation</b> <b>Ratio</b> (MR) variations have no sensible impact on conversion. We demonstrate that heterogeneous bundles with fertile and fissile zones allow savings of about 7 % of 233 U initial inventory for the same burnup. However, for all the examined geometric modifications in Th/U fueled CANDU, the fissile inventory ratio at end of cycle is observed to be only dependent on the final burnup. Breeding is achieved for short burnups of 6 - 7 GWd/t. Multirecycling in CANDU is also simulated. In the multirecycling regime, higher burnup (~ 15 - 20 GWd/t at slightly lower conversion) can be sustained by the addition of a small quantity of Uranium from the second component of the reactor fleet at each recycle. A simple Th/U cycle neutronic analysis explains why the irradiation time is identical at each recycle if the 233 U initial mass introduced is kept constant. For the PWR case, studies show that variations in either the MR or the use of heterogeneous seed/blanket assemblies do little to improve conversion. In fact, it is found that at equivalent burnup the Th/U conversion progress margin by standard modifications is smaller in PWR than in CANDU. The faster neutron spectra, achievable by extreme sub-moderation, are required to expect breeding in existing PWR vessel and core. Obviously lower values of MR provoke difficulties in proper heat extraction and thermal-hydraulics. To get rid of these difficulties, we propose to use the so-called Spectrum Shift Control technique with a standard MR, a heavy water coolant and reactivity managed by progressive addition of H 2 O in the coolant. But managing reactivity this way has a cost in terms of conversion. Finally we evaluate another reactivity management technique based on fertile material withdrawal...|$|E

40|$|The world energy {{requirement}} will dramatically increase {{during this}} century, {{because of an}} increasing world population {{on the one hand}} and an increasing per capita energy consumption on the other hand. Future prospects of primary energy requirement, basing on different assumptions of the future technological, economical and ecological developments, predict a multiple of todays nuclear energy production capabilities worldwide. A worldwide phasing out of the nuclear energy option is not foreseeable. To the greatest possible extend today's nuclear fuel cycle is based on the usage of uraniumbased fuels in light water reactors. At this accumulating residues contain typically per tonne heavy metal beside fission products and surpluses of uranium also 11 kg transuranium elements (TRU). The TRU will dominate the hazardous potential for a very long time span in a future repository because of their long half-life and radiotoxicity whereas the fission products dominate only at the very beginning. Some of the transuranium isotopes are very good fissionable and open due to this a proliferation risk additionally. This paper analyses a possible evolution of todays fuel cycle, considering on the one hand the requirements of a sustainable waste disposal strategy and on the other hand the highest safety properties of today's western nuclear power plants. The aim is to deposit only the nuclear residuals which hazardous potential will fall below the natural hazardous potential of fresh nuclear fuel during a time period in which engineered barriers guarantee a safe encapsulation. By pin-cell, assembly and full-core simulations of the neutronics of a thoriumbased Pressurised Water Reactor with different calculational tools the possibility to operate the reactor with (Th,Pu) O$_{ 2 }$-fuel in a four-batch-mode up to a burn-up of 60 MWd/kg was shown. The nuclear stability of the system for all burn-up conditions was proven for the full core and especially for the void coefficients the pin-cell and assembly calculations were shown to be conservative. Under the term of minimal modifications of today's established systems further optimisation approaches with the aim of increasing the actinide consumption were performed. Beside the adjustment of <b>moderation</b> <b>ratio</b> the possibility to use spectral shifts within the pellet by a two layer approach and enlargement of the pellet diameter were analysed for different fuels of the second recycling step. Furthermore effects of hardening the neutron spectra by a cadmium filter between the inner and outer fuel zone were studied. Repercussions of those special designed fuel pins within the whole fuel assembly, the maximal fuel temperatures, heat surface stress and helium production were also part of the analysis. Very favourable is the heterogenous (Th,Am,U) O$_{ 2 }$ fuel, because without blending with fresh fuel an advantageous americium isotopic composition was found even up to the third recycling step...|$|E
