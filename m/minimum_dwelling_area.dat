40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} {{into the modern}} meaning of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling.</b> It discusses how this meaning gradually became disengaged from the minimum house. It proposes a new definition of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> based on the minimum social unit, that is, the individual. At {{the beginning of the}} 20 th century, the term Existenzminimum dwelling proposed a new way of living. This modernist definition of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> was based on a reproducible expendable minimum house. This thesis argues that this definition is no longer valid; yet, any present definition of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> is still informed by it. The reconfiguration of the minimum house as an expendable object disempowered the house as a tool for the experience of the home. This dissociation {{of the house and the}} home is a condition that has gradually diminished the role of the house in everyday life and redefined the experience of the home. The meaning of the home is now invested in a multiplicity of locations, experiences and objects. This thesis defines the minimum home as a core of personally meaningful possessions, the spatial configurations they create and recreate and the information they carry. This thesis’s definition of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> is based on this minimum home. This argument is pursued through two modes of inquiry. On the one hand with a critical analysis of texts, buildings, architectural projects and works of art. On the other hand by the development of a series of projects. These two investigations are parallel and overlapping. In this document, they are organised in a linear way. This structure assists the progress of the argument and reveals the gradual development of this thesis from an interest to develop a truly individual minimum house to the realisation that the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> is a personal project...|$|R
40|$|The Question of Housing in Czechoslovak Interwar Architecture - <b>Minimum</b> <b>Dwelling</b> in Housing Competition for Prague This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a problem of the <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> {{that was one of}} the most important topics of the avant-garde architecture. The main emphasis will be placed on public housing competitions in Prague during 1930 - 1931 and architectural designs, which brought new and progressive perceptions to the dilemma of an ideal housing estate. Due to the width of public housing problems, this thesis will be primarily focused on architectural works created for Prague.

40|$|The design {{focuses on}} an fixed and {{temporary}} intervention on an existing portiek dwelling in the Carnisse Eilandenbuurt, Rotterdam. Those dwellings are originally designed by architect Jo van den Broek. The portiek dwellings {{may be called}} <b>minimum</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The <b>minimum</b> <b>dwelling</b> {{is the theme of}} the research and design. The neighbourhood has always been a migration area. In today's situation the migrant is mostly coming from Eastern European countries and staying here temporary. The design focuses on this target group. This is the temporary part of the project; an flexible and durable interior unit, which is placed in the existing structure of the dwelling. The fixed part of the project focuses on the exterior and is an upgrade of the existing skin of the building. RMIT Housing HeritageArchitectureArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this short}} paper is {{to show how the}} spatial layout of neighbourhoods affect the {{behaviour}} of its dwellers. An area's social and spatial composition influences anti-social behaviour in built environments. However, social conditions can overrule spatial ones. A more adequate understanding of the relationship between an area's social and spatial composition requires studying a set of <b>dwelling</b> <b>areas</b> with and without social problems. For an according, exemplary investigation, four different types of <b>dwelling</b> <b>areas</b> were analysed. Two pre-War <b>dwelling</b> <b>areas</b> were chosen - one with large social problems (Ondiep in Utrecht) and one without (Hof van Delft in Delft). Similarly, two post-War urban areas were chosen - one with large social problems (Oosterwei in Gouda) and one without (Ommoord in Rotterdam). Static snapshots were taken in all four areas, during a whole day and evening on a week day and on a weekend day. The results were correlated with the following spatial configurative analyses: all-lines analyses and segment based angular analyses (in order to identify the main routes through cities). As it turns out, <b>dwelling</b> <b>areas</b> with a topological deep structure on their street net contribute to a separation of space use of various types of users. Group of youngsters tend to gather together in streets one topological step away from main streets or shopping centres with "blind" walls. The higher concentration of low income groups and immigrants, the larger the anti-social behaviour problems are in the <b>dwelling</b> <b>areas</b> in terms of vandalism and group forming of youngsters. <b>Dwelling</b> <b>areas</b> without main routes through them lacks a natural input of through travellers in which function as a social control for an area. Public spaces with low degree of inter-visibility of neighbours and few doors connected to streets affect an area’s degree of safety and street life. In Ondiep, the unsafest part is the street with few dwelling entrances connected to it. Likewise, inter-visibility is reduced by the way all inhabitants have their curtains closed most part of the time. As this initial investigation suggests, streets with high degree of inter-visibility and adjacent to main routes can contribute to create safe and vital <b>dwelling</b> <b>areas.</b> UrbanismArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

25|$|El Lissitzky's {{contacts}} in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, {{as well as}} the impact of Melnikov's Paris Pavilion, led to many architects outside the USSR considering their work as Constructivist by the late 1920s. Architects of the New Objectivity like Lissitzky's collaborators Mart Stam and the ABC Group led by Hannes Meyer embraced Constructivism's severe geometry and technologically advanced aesthetic, despite their remoteness from their original context. The shift of the Bauhaus in 1922 towards 'art and technology—a new unity' was often considered to be a Constructivist one, while the Czech critic and designer Karel Teige's 1932 book The <b>Minimum</b> <b>Dwelling</b> uses Functionalism and Constructivism as interchangeable terms.
