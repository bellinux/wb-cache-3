40|$|A {{detailed}} {{examination of the}} solution behaviour and crystallisation kinetics of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) is presented. The systems studied are: <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> methyl stearate and their binary mixtures in dodecane and methyl oleate solvents. Fractionation behaviour in palm methyl ester, soybean methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester fuel is also studied. Two principal techniques are employed in this work, i. e. turbidometric analysis of solutions during polythermal cycles and the gas chromatography analysis of solution supernatants {{as a function of}} temperature. The foundations of these two studied have been laid via the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the solid-state forms of <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and methyl stearate crystallised from solution. No evidence is found to suggest that the methyl stearate and <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> binary mixtures crystallise from methyl oleate solvent as a solid solution and no shift in the XRD patterns generated, i. e. no transition in solid state form crystallised is observed for the conditions under which solutions are crystallised. It is found that solution behaviour for <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> methyl stearate and their binary mixtures in both solvents is in negative deviation to ideality, with the pure solutes being the more deviated in comparison to the binary mixtures. Eutectic points are discovered at a composition of 75 mol% C 16 : 0 in the C 16 : 0 I C 18 : 0 binary mixture crystallisation from both solvents. Metastable zone widths (MSZW) are larger for both solutes in the methyl oleate solvent (6 - 9. 50 C) as compared to dodecane (3 - 6. 5 oC) and MSZWs are significantly smaller at the 100 mI scale, being about half those at the 1 ml scale. Nucleation rates for both solutes and their binary mixtures are about 2 - 13 k gilimin over a 100 - 250 g/l concentration range in both solvents. From the palm methyl ester and its blends with soy methyl ester and rapeseed methyl ester only C 16 : 0 is found to crystallise at the cloud points. A thermodynamic model for <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and methyl stearate solubilities in methyl oleate solvent predicts the fractionation behaviour in the blended fuels satisfactorily but less well in the pure palm methyl ester.

Therefore, improving energy efficiency, developing clean energy, and securing stable energy supply are the framework of Indonesia’s sustainable energy policies. Furthermore, finding alternative renewable energies becomes {{an important}} topic.

The economic competitiveness of biodiesel can be improved by applying in-situ process. This method didn’t include extraction time from seeds, and actually extraction oil from oilseed is not a short step. However, the excess alcohol was needed. In this study, in-situ esterification of high-acidity rice bran with methanol and sulfuric acid catalyst was investigated. The effects of methanol concentration and reaction time on purity and yield of biodiesel were discussed. Increasing the methanol dose from 50 to 200 mL increased the FAMEs yield by about 12 %. The yield of FAMEs increased from 8 to 48 % when the reaction time was increased from 10 to 60 min. The best conditions are: methanol of 200 ml, H 2 SO 4 to methanol = 5 % (v/v), temperature of 60 o C, reaction time of 60 min and stirrer rate of 600 rpm.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the post-translational {{processing}} of p 21 ras proteins. The primary translation product pro-p 21 is cytosolic and is rapidly converted to a cytosolic form (c-p 21) of higher mobility on SDS-PAGE. c-p 21 is converted in turn to the membrane-bound mature palmitoylated form (m-p 21) of slightly higher mobility. These processing steps are accompanied by increases in isoelectric point and in hydrophobicity as judged by Triton X- 114 partitioning. Although the increases in electrophoretic mobility and hydrophobicity precede acylation we show that mutation of Cys 186, which {{has been shown to}} block acylation, also abolishes the pro-p 21 to c-p 21 conversion. Thus the Cys 186 residue is involved in the processing steps prior to acylation. We have identified two processing events which contribute to the pro-p 21 conversion. Site-directed mutagenesis to insert tryptophan, which is not present in the wild type, followed by metabolic labelling with [3 H]tryptophan has allowed us to map a proteolytic processing event which removes the three C-terminal residues. In addition, both the c-p 21 and m-p 21 forms are carboxyl-methylated. Approximately one methyl group is incorporated per molecule of p 21 at steady state, which can partially account for the increase in isoelectric point.

The synthesis of sucrose palmitate was performed in 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol:dimethylsulfoxide mixtures by transesterification of different palmitic acid donors with sucrose, catalysed by the immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica B (Novozym 435). A protocol for substrate preparation different to that previously reported by our group was found to improve the reaction rate. Several parameters, such as sucrose and acyl donor loadings, the percentage of DMSO in the mixture {{and the nature of}} acyl donor, were investigated.

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{problem in}} mass isotopomer abundance mass spectrometry (MIAMS) is {{the dependence of}} measured mass isotopomer abundances on sample concentration. We have evaluated the role of ionization energy on mass isotopomer abundance ratios of <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> {{as a function of}} sample concentration. Ionization energy was varied using electron impact ionization (EI) and metastable atom bombardment (MAB). The latter generates a beam of metastable species capable of ionizing analyte molecules by Penning ionization. We observed that ionization of <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> by EI (70 eV) showed the greatest molecular ion fragmentation and also showed the greatest dependence of relative isotopomer abundance ratios on sample concentration. Ionization using the 3 P 2 and 3 P 0 states of metastable krypton (9. 92 and 10. 56 eV, respectively) resulted in almost no molecular ion fragmentation, and the isotopomer abundances quantified were essentially independent of sample concentration. Ionization using the 3 P 2 and 3 P 0 states of metastable argon (11. 55 and 11. 72 eV, respectively) showed molecular ion fragmentation intermediate between that of EI and MAB(Kr) and showed an isotopomer concentration dependence which was less severe than that observed with EI but more severe than that observed with MAB(Kr). The observed decrease in the dependence of isotopomer abundance on sample concentration with a decrease in molecular ion fragmentation is consistent with the hypothesis that proton transfer from a fragment cation to a neutral molecule is the gas phase reaction mechanism responsible for the concentration dependence. Alternative explanations, e. g., hydrogen abstraction from a neutral molecule to a molecular cation, is not supported by these results. Moreover, the MAB ionization technique shows potential for eliminating one source of error in MIAMS measurements of <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> in particular, and of fatty acids methyl esters, in general...|$|E

The activity of lipase was not decreased significantly compared to the free enzyme as catalysts. The product of transesterification reaction between stearate and methanol by immobilized enzyme as a catalyst produced a higher value of methyl ester abundance than that of the free enzyme. Besides of that, the relative abundance of <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> obtained from biodiesel conversion using PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 8 P 5 with the presence of glutaraldehyde reached 100 [...]...|$|E

The Cellular Fatty Acids (CFAs) were liberatedfrom whole cells by base hydrolysis, methylated and analyzedby gas-liquid chromatography. The principal fatty acids in C. pseudotuberculosis whole cell methylates were methyl laurate, methyl myristate, methyl palmitoleate, <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> methyl oleate and unknown with retention time 23. 825. The FAME profile of C. pseudotuberculosis isolates which were highly pathogenic in mice revealed high total area of palmitoleate (39. 053 % 0) and oleate (36. 973 %) while the least pathogenic showed high content of myristate (68. 506 %) ...|$|E

The effect of process parameters on the conversion was investigated. The optimum process parameters, consisting of a mole ratio of 1. 8 : 1 (methyl palmitate:triethanolamine), 170 °C, 10 mbar, 0. 5 % catalyst and a duration of 2 h, produced more than 90 % conversion. Transesterification employing Ca-Al is more environmentally friendly than the conventional approach using sodium methoxide, simplifies the downstream separation process and the reusability of the catalyst was successfully tested in three subsequent cycles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{analyzed}} the isotopomer abundance ratios of an equimolar mixture of nine fatty acid methyl esters (decanoate, undecanoate, laurate, tridecanoate, myristate, pentadecanoate, palmitate, heptadecanoate, and stearate) by selected-ion monitoring gas chromatography/electron impact/mass spectrometry (GC/EI/MS). The abundance {{of the second}} lowest m/z isotopomer (IM 1) increased disproportionately compared with the abundance of the lowest m/z isotopomer (IM 0) as a function of: (1) increasing sample size; (2) decreasing repeller voltage; and (3) decreasing alkyl chain length. We also compared the abundance of the third lowest m/z isotopomer (IM 2) and the abundance of the second lowest m/z isotopomer (IM 1) of <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and [4, 4 - 2 H 2]methyl palmitate. We observed that the IM 2 /IM 1 for <b>methyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> was significantly lower than IM 2 /IM 1 for [4, 4 - 2 H 2]methyl palmitate. From these results, {{as well as a}} consideration of basic principles of ion chemistry and ion physics, we conclude that gas-phase chemistry, specifically proton (or deuteron) transfer from fragment ions to molecules, is a major contributor to the sample size dependence observed in mass isotopomer abundance measurements of fatty acid methyl esters ionized by EI. Our results and analysis do not support hydrogen abstraction as the reaction mechanism. In addition, we calculate that rearranged molecular ions are unlikely to contribute significantly to intermolecular proton transfer because of their relatively brief lifetime. We also discuss alternative analytical techniques which might improve the precision and accuracy of isotopomer measurements by reducing molecular ion fragmentation...|$|E
