25|$|At B5, Taylor {{sang and}} played guitar and bass {{on his first}} solo album, Feelings Are Good (And Other Lies), working with {{collaborator}} Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. The home-grown album was marketed by mail order, and sold its CDs directly via the website. The <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>vocals</b> were generally rough and raw, much more akin to grunge and punk music than to Duran Duran, while the lyrics reflected Taylor's chaotic personal life and his ongoing divorce from de Cadenet. He participated in writing an album for the reunited Power Station in late 1996, but his personal problems forced him {{to withdraw from the}} project, which went on to record with Bernard Edwards on bass and toured with a hired bass player. Increasing creative differences within Duran Duran, his move to Los Angeles and a desire to focus on his solo work also led Taylor to reconsider his place in that band. In January 1997 he announced at a Duran Duran fan convention that he was leaving the band.|$|E

500|$|Written {{in the key}} of F {{major at}} a [...] "moderately bright" [...] tempo of 135, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is a [...] "yearning", downtempo Broadway and musical theatre-influenced power ballad, that {{gradually}} crescendos into a [...] "showstopping" [...] conclusion, bolstered by Benson's [...] "powerhouse performance". Varietys Andrew Barker summarized [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "slow-building, Broadway-style showstopper" [...] that [...] "moves effortlessly from busy, literate verses to a longing pre-chorus and a belted-to-the-rafters refrain", incorporating [...] "dramatic" [...] violins into its orchestration. Described as a [...] "big ballad", the song pairs Ashman's lyrics about pining for life on land with Menken’s [...] "soaring melody", beginning with a musical motif that resembles the sound of flowing water, described by D23 as [...] "tinkling piano keystrokes". Both the song's <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>vocals</b> swell with [...] "passion and longing".|$|E
500|$|Tom Young from BBC Music {{said that}} he did not see the actual {{performances}} on the tour and felt that [...] "some of the magnitude of the performance is lost and the track/scene changes appear needlessly long-winded. [...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>vocals</b> that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one just has to doff one's hat to her energy." [...] At the 50th Grammy Awards held on February 10, 2008 at Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Confessions Tour won in the category of Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|His {{transcendental}} signature style {{first came}} into full expression with his 1968 classic, Astral Weeks and he was noted to have remained a [...] "master of his transcendental craft" [...] in 2009 while performing the Astral Weeks songs live. This musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>vocals</b> build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with LA Weekly wrote [...] "he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known." [...] Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison's music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: [...] "But in his music {{the same sense of}} escape from ordinary limits – a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence – can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, the self is left behind, and the sound, that [...] "yarragh," [...] becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body." [...] A book reviewer further described it as [...] "This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life..." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{music for}} District 9 was scored by Canadian {{composer}} Clinton Shorter, who spent three weeks {{preparing for the}} film. Director Neill Blomkamp wanted a [...] "raw and dark" [...] score, but one that maintained its South African roots. This was a challenge for Shorter, who found much of the South African music he worked with to be optimistic and joyful. Unable to get the African drums to sound dark and heavy, Shorter used a combination of taiko drums and synthesized instruments for the desired effects, with the core African elements of the score conveyed in the vocals and smaller percussion. Both the score and soundtrack feature <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>vocals</b> from Kwaito artists.|$|E

2500|$|Following Jackson's death, AEG {{stated that}} they had over [...] "100 hours of footage of {{preparations}} and rehearsals for the shows". On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor Columbia Pictures and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled Michael Jackson's This Is It. According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage. The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue. The film was directed by Kenny Ortega who was also {{the director of the}} live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly. [...] Some of the <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>vocals</b> in the film were added from previous recordings, though most were from the live performance. The film was released on October 28, 2009.|$|E
