50|$|Meanwhile, Sayid {{presents}} Desmond to The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> {{who takes}} {{him to an}} old well. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> explains to Desmond that people built wells looking for the source that made compass needles spin at points like this location. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then throws Desmond down the well. Upon returning to his camp, Hurley's group arrives {{to talk to the}} <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Later, Jacob's protectors {{enter the}} statue {{and attempt to}} kill the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> who changes into the monster and kills them. After the men are all dead, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> reveals to Ben that his {{intention}} is to [...] "go home." [...] After exiting the statue, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> knocks out Richard and carries him into the jungle. Shortly after, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> offers Richard {{a second chance to}} join him, which Richard refuses. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then tracks down a drunken Sawyer (Josh Holloway), who recently lost Juliet. Sawyer realizes the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> is not John Locke, but agrees to follow him after he tells Sawyer why he is on the Island in the first place. Sawyer and the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> eventually reach a cave near a ledge, which has writing all over its walls. The writings are all people's names with numbers beside them. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> reveals to Sawyer the names represent the candidates to replace Jacob. He then has Sawyer join him on a mission to leave the island.|$|R
50|$|Soon after, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> sends Sawyer on a recon {{mission to}} Hydra Island.

After Jin is taken from his camp by Widmore's <b>men,</b> the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> takes Sayid with him to Hydra Island. He arrives on Hydra Island by himself, and confronts Widmore. After warning Widmore, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> returns to the main island, while Sayid spies on Widmore's team. After Sayid comes back, he shows the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> takes Desmond to an old well.

50|$|The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then confronts Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) as the monster. As Eko {{stares down}} the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> he sees {{flashing}} images of his past. In a second instance, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> {{takes the form}} of Mr. Eko's brother, Yemi (Adetokumboh McCormack), and demands Mr. Eko to repent for his sins. When Eko refuses, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> briefly disappears, only to return as the monster. He then kills Eko by slamming him repeatedly against nearby trees and the ground. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> also appears to Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and Kate as the monster; during the encounter, the monster releases a series of bright flashes. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> reappears later, and it is revealed it cannot penetrate the sonar fence that surrounds the Barracks.|$|R
5000|$|The next chronological {{appearance}} of the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> and Jacob was in [...] "The Incident", in which they talk on the beach as the Black Rock ship approaches. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> (who looks like his real form) states that he knows the ship was brought by Jacob, and expresses his disapproval of Jacob bringing people to the Island—stating that all they bring is corruption and destruction. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> tells Jacob he wishes to kill him, but their adoptive mother had prevented the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> from hurting Jacob, so he sought a [...] "loophole" [...] to kill him. Soon after, the Black Rock crashes onto the island, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> appears as the smoke monster and kills everyone on board except Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). He then returns {{in the form of}} Isabella, Richard's dead wife, telling him they are in hell, and tricks him into thinking that Jacob has taken her, letting Alpert know that he is the [...] "smoke monster" [...] but could not save Isabella from Jacob. Later, <b>in</b> the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black's</b> form, he frees Richard and gives him a knife to kill Jacob, whom the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> refers to as [...] "the devil." [...] However, Jacob convinces Richard otherwise. Shortly after, Jacob visits the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> and states that as long as he (Jacob) is alive, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> will never leave the Island. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then vows to kill Jacob and his subsequent replacements.|$|R
5000|$|Sayid, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> Claire, Kate Austen, and a {{group of}} the Others leave the Temple shortly after. In [...] "The Package", the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> asks Sayid to spy on Charles Widmore and his team on the other Island. Sayid agrees, but by this time he {{mentions}} he is devoid of any emotion: pain, happiness, etc.. Upon arriving at the shore of the second Island, he secretly watches a heavily sedated Desmond being dragged out of Widmore's submarine by two of Widmore's members. He waits in the sidelines for a few moments, and then he kills several of Widmore's men and has Desmond follow him. The next day, he ties him up to a tree and fetches the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black.</b> Sayid is ordered to head back to their camp. When the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> returns, Sayid asks of Desmond, but the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> tells him not to worry. Right after, Hurley, Jack, Frank Lapidus, and Sun arrive. Sayid of course shows no surprise at the sight of them. When Widmore's team threatens to waylay their camp with artillery shells, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> orders everyone to start leaving and asks Sayid to kill Desmond. Sayid heads to a well wherein Desmond was pushed <b>in</b> by the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> but instead of killing him, converses with him, and reveals that the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> has promised to resurrect the woman he loves. When Desmond asks Sayid why he believes this, Sayid reveals it was the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> who resurrected him after his death. Later, Sayid catches up with the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> telling him he has killed Desmond, which he later tells Jack is false.

5|$|Production of {{the film}} began in January 2006. Several visual effect {{companies}} were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever at the time; it was later overtaken by <b>Men</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> 3. In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.|$|E
5000|$|Following Ajira 316's {{crash on}} the Island, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> appears as Christian Shephard to Sun and Lapidus, informing {{them of the}} time travel {{undergone}} {{by the rest of}} the Oceanic 6. He then takes the form of the deceased Locke, whose body was on the plane, and tricks everyone into thinking Locke was brought back to life. Later, Ben tells the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> who he thinks is Locke, that he must travel to the monster's lair, which lies beneath the temple wall, to be judged for his complicity in his daughter's death. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> separates from Ben at the Temple and confronts Ben as the monster. After the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> retreats back into a vent, he reappears to Ben as Alex's manifestation, warning Ben to follow [...] "Locke's" [...] every word, to which he complies. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> (<b>in</b> the form of John Locke), Ben, and Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim), arrive at one of the Others' camps. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then instructs Richard to find a time-traveling Locke, and tell him he must die to bring his friends back to the island. Later, The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> demands Richard take him and the Others to see Jacob, to which Richard reluctantly complies. The next day, he tells Ben of his plan to kill Jacob. Later, Ben informs the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> of Alex's threat, to which the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> replies by telling Ben to kill Jacob. After arriving at Jacob's residence at the four-toed statue, the two enter and meet Jacob. Ben tells Jacob how he has sacrificed and suffered for the island but still had been ignored by Jacob. Ben then proceeds to stab Jacob, whom the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> kicks into a fire.|$|R
25|$|Inside the {{pedestal}} of the statue, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> {{who has taken}} the form of Locke, sends Ben to get Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell). Richard, however, refuses to go inside and instead shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> transforms into the Smoke Monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then tells Ben what Locke's final thoughts were, and explains that his own true goal is to return home. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> finds this ironic because Locke wanted desperately to stay and live on the island. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle.|$|R
500|$|Later, Charles Widmore's {{second in}} command, Zoe, {{arrives at the}} camp and threatens to destroy the camp with {{artillery}} shells if the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> does not give back Desmond.

After Jack leaves the group, due to his reluctance to leave the island, the remaining group reach Hydra Island. However, Widmore betrays them, and has them locked in the animal cages at Hydra Station. The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> attacks Widmore's camp as the Smoke Monster; allowing Jack, who has joined the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> to free Frank {{and the rest of}} the group.

There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote <b>Men</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> II.

5000|$|Elsewhere, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> {{follows the}} clues given by Lawrence's daughter, {{telling him to}} find a snake near a riverbank. Instead, he sees Hector's henchwoman Armistice bathing in the river, with a giant snake tattoo across her torso. Concluding that Armistice is the next clue, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> {{introduces}} himself to her. Armistice mentions that she is looking for something [...] "of great value", and the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> offers his assistance in return for finding out the story to Armistice's tattoo. Armistice allows the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> and Lawrence to join her gang. While camped, another guest who is traveling with the gang thanks the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> for his foundation's role in saving his sister's life.

Armistice then asks the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> why he wants to know about her tattoo so much, and he mentions how Arnold created Westworld and its story, and that he is interested in finding the end to that story. Armistice then reveals that her plan is to break Hector out of prison. Believing her current plan of stealing an army cannon will take too long, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> goes <b>in</b> himself, posing as a prisoner and using explosive cigars to break Hector out of his cell. Keeping her word, Armistice tells the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> that her tattoo is to symbolize all the men she has killed in revenge for killing her mother and that her only remaining target is Wyatt. Figuring Wyatt is the next clue, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> takes his leave with Lawrence, and en route, encounters a tortured Teddy tied up to a dead tree. Despite Teddy's pleas to end his misery, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> decides to cut Teddy free, stating that [...] "misery is all he has." ...|$|R

Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep downstairs in an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
5|$|On the boat, Mulder and Smith {{debate whether}} they should save Mulder’s mother Teena, despite the risk of <b>Men</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> {{awaiting}} them. Mulder ultimately agrees {{that it would be}} too dangerous to visit her. Instead, they head towards Canada, where Smith says Mulder will find his sister, Samantha. Meanwhile, the First Elder (Don S. Williams) meets with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in Teena's hospital room, confronting him with photos of his prior meeting with her, taken by X (Steven Williams). They realize that there is a leak, and plan to smoke out its source by releasing false information about Teena being in danger.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

But when the agents witness the flight of a mysterious craft, Mulder {{and a member of}} the <b>Men</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> switch bodies, unbeknownst the others.

5000|$|Elsewhere, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> follows {{information}} that Kissy {{had given him}} and tracks down the outlaw host Lawrence, who is set to be executed by a posse.

The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then interrogates Lawrence by holding {{his wife and daughter}} hostage, demanding he tell him where the [...] "maze" [...] is. The townspeople attempt to intervene to save Lawrence, but the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> kills them all and executes Lawrence's wife.

5000|$|Jin {{is skeptical}} of the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> and {{believes}} he is not Locke.

However, Jin {{has no choice but}} to follow the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black's</b> group as they journey across the Island. Sawyer and the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> tell him that he is a possible [...] "candidate" [...] of Jacob's (the leader of the Island and enemy of the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black),</b> meaning he may be chosen to watch the Island after Jacob's death. However, he is unaware of the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black's</b> intention to kill him, since he is a candidate. Late one night, while the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> is off retrieving Sun (as she may be a candidate as well), Jin and the others are attacked by Charles Widmore's team. Tranquilized, Jin is brought over to the second Island where Widmore's submarine is docked. Jin wakes up inside a DHARMA Initiative complex and meets Zoe (Sheila Kelley), who eagerly asks him about his hand-drawn map of the electromagnetism pockets, which he drew back in 1977. However, he demands to see Widmore.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{after the}} <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> chased after a blond boy, Sawyer met Richard in a clearing.

5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland who told the bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington.

50|$|The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> later {{cut down}} Richard from a sack he had hung him from in a tree, and {{promptly}} apologized for it.

25|$|On {{the way to}} {{the heart}} of the Island, Jack's group {{encounters}} the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black's</b> group. Jack tells the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel {{to the heart of the}} Island. Jack believes that Desmond can kill the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> predicted.

During a prolonged fight, the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> stabs Jack <b>in</b> the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> <b>in</b> the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails.

Sayid goes to the well, where he finds Desmond at the bottom. He tells Desmond that the <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> promised to bring the woman who died in his arms back to life, and believes him capable of this because Sayid himself was brought back.
