25|$|The {{discovery}} {{of life in}} extreme conditions has complicated definitions of habitability, but also generated much excitement amongst researchers in greatly broadening the known range of conditions under which life can persist. For example, a planet {{that might otherwise be}} unable to support an atmosphere given the solar conditions in its vicinity, <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so within a deep shadowed rift or volcanic cave. Similarly, craterous terrain might offer a refuge for primitive life. The Lawn Hill crater has been studied as an astrobiological analog, with researchers suggesting rapid sediment infill created a protected microenvironment for microbial organisms; similar conditions may have occurred over the geological history of Mars.|$|E

The crossover curse of various rap acts had come to pass, as their initial audience felt they had become too accessible; non-crossover rap acts like Big Daddy Kane and Boogie Down Productions had bigger street followings; meanwhile, pop radio had latched on to new faces like Tone Loc and Young MC, while non-radio followers became more enamored with hardcore acts like Ice-T and 2 Live Crew. The lead single, [...] "I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson" [...] {{was in the same}} vein as their other lead singles; with this one having Will say he could literally beat Mike Tyson in a boxing match. Jazzy Jeff is shown training Prince to perform this task, and after Prince loses, Jeff then claims that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it himself. James Avery and Alfonso Ribeiro (co-stars of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) show up as Don King and member of the fighting crew's posse, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 September 1942, Pius XII {{received}} a letter from Monsignor Montini (future Pope Paul VI), saying, [...] "the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms." [...] Later that month, Myron Taylor, U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's [...] "moral prestige" [...] was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Uruguay, Belgium, and Poland. Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically [...] "butchered". Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information which might [...] "tend to confirm the reports", and if so, what the Pope <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to influence public opinion against the [...] "barbarities". Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to [...] "verify their accuracy". Nevertheless, [...] "every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people". In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration [...] "German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race", Maglione replied that the Vatican was [...] "unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities." [...] Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.|$|E
