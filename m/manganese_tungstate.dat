The effect of high energy electron beam (EB) irradiation on the optical properties of MnWO 4 nanoparticles was investigated.

We observe the monoclinic P 2 /c to triclinic P 1 {{phase transition}} at 20. 1 GPa and get insight on the phase transition mechanism from {{the appearance of}} tilted triclinic domains.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the effect}} of Cr 2 O 3 {{addition}} on the electrical properties and microstructures of WO 3 -MnO 2 ceramics was studied. The samples were fabricated by the conventional solid phase reaction techniques. The current-voltage curves and impedance spectra of sintered samples were measured at room temperature. The samples without Cr 2 O 3 doping exhibit the max nonlinear coefficient α above 8 in current region from 1 mA to 10 mA and an unstable characteristic of current-voltage curve for repeat measuring cycle, while the samples doped with Cr 2 O 3 display lower nonlinearity with α about 5 and an improved stability of current-voltage curve at the same conditions. The impedance measurements indicate that the influence on electrical properties comes from grain boundary as well as grain. SEM shows the doping of Cr 2 O 3 into WO 3 -MnO 2 ceramics suppresses obviously the growth of WO 3, and XRD analysis reveals the coexistence of WO 3 phases with some <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstates</b> and chromium tungstates. The problems related to electrical transporting mechanism were discussed simply...|$|R
50|$|Tungstates occur {{naturally}} with molybdates. Scheelite, {{the mineral}} calcium tungstate, often contains {{a small amount}} of molybdate. Wolframite is <b>manganese</b> and iron <b>tungstate,</b> and all these are valuable sources of tungsten. Powellite is a mineral form of calcium molybdate containing {{a small amount of}} tungstate.|$|R
40|$|The multiferroic <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> (MnWO 4) {{has been}} studied by {{high-pressure}} Raman spectroscopy at room temperature under quasi-hydrostatic conditions up to 39. 3 GPa. The low-pressure wolframite phase undergoes a phase transition at 25. 7 GPa, a pressure around 8 GPa higher than that found in previous works which used less hydrostatic pressure-transmitting media. The pressure dependence of the Raman active modes of both the low- and high-pressure phases are reported and discussed comparing with the results available in the literature for MnWO 4 and related wolframites. A gradual pressure-induced phase transition from the low- to the high- pressure phase is suggested {{on the basis of}} the linear intensity decrease of the Raman mode with the lowest frequency up to the end of the phase transition.

40|$|Three {{anomalies}} {{were found}} during {{measurements of the}} heat capacity of <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> from 4 to 350 K by adiabatic calorimetry; a small peak at (6. 8 +/- 0. 1) K, and two large sharp peaks at (12. 57 +/- 0. 05) K and (13. 36 +/- 0. 05) K. The excess entropy associated with the antiferromagnetic transition was estimated by means of calculations which utilized the heat capacity of zinc tungstate to approximate contributions from lattice vibrations and was found in good accord with the value R ln 6. The results between 5 and 11. 5 K obey a power law: Cmag = AT 1. 73. The double anomaly is {{discussed in terms of}} the super-exchange properties of MnWO 4. Selected thermal functions, Cpo, So, and -{Go(T) - Ho(0) }/T are respectively 27. 40, 31. 66, and 16. 10 calth K- 1 mol- 1 at T = 298. 15 K...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} of a layered <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> diaminoalkane hybrid series suggests that this compound forms a spin- 5 / 2 spin-ladder structure. We use X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy results to infer the structure. DC magnetization of the manganese compound and a possible copper analogue appear {{to show that the}} manganese system behaves like 1 -dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains (i. e. J_∥≫ J_) while the copper system is fitted well by a S = 1 / 2 spin ladder model, giving the parameters g = 1. 920 ± 0. 008, J_∥/k_B = - 0. 3 ± 1. 4 K; J_/k_B = 213. 6 ± 1. 1 K. The ability to tune adjacent inorganic layers of the hybrid materials by altering the length of the organic `spacer' molecules gives enormous promise for the use of these materials, especially when doped, to provide a greater understanding of spin ladder systems.

40|$|Iron {{tungstate}} (FeWO$_ 4 $) and <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> (MnWO$_ 4 $) {{belong to}} a family of wolframite-type materials that has applications in various areas, including supercapacitors, batteries, and multiferroics. A detailed understanding of bulk properties and defect physics in these transition-metal tungstates has been lacking, however, impeding possible improvement of their functional properties. Here, we report a first-principles study of FeWO$_ 4 $ and MnWO$_ 4 $ using screened hybrid density-functional calculations. We find that in both compounds the electronic structure near the band edges are predominantly the highly localized transition-metal $d$ states, which allows {{for the formation of}} both hole polarons at the Fe (Mn) sites and electron polarons at the W sites. The dominant native point defects in FeWO$_ 4 $ (MnWO$_ 4 $) under realistic synthesis conditions are, however, the hole polarons at the Fe (Mn) sites and negatively charged Fe (Mn) vacancies. The presence of low-energy and highly mobile polarons provides explanation for the good p-type conductivity observed in experiments and the ability of the materials to store energy via a pseudocapacitive mechanism.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of C-H activation in selective oxidation reactions of short-chain alkane molecules over transition metal oxides is critically {{affected by the}} balance of acid-base and redox sites at {{the surface of the}} catalyst. Using the example of <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> we discuss how the relative abundance of these sites can be controlled via synthetic techniques. Phase-pure catalysts composed of the thermodynamic stable monoclinic MnWO 4 phase have been prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. Variation of the initial pH value resulted in rod-shaped nano-crystalline MnWO 4 catalysts composed of particles with varying aspect ratio. The synthesis products have been analysed by transmission elecron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared, and photoelectron spectroscopy. In-situ Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the dissolution-re-crystallization processes occuring under hydrothermal conditions. Ethanol oxidation was applied to probe the surface functionalities in terms of acid-base and redox properties. Changes in the aspect ratio of the primary catalyst particles are reflected in the product distribution induced by altering the fraction of acid-base and redox sites exposed at the surface of the catalysts in agreement with the proposed {{mechanism of}} particle growth by re-crystallization during ageing under hydrothermal conditions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> (MnWO 4) {{nanorods}} {{were prepared}} {{at room temperature}} by the co-precipitation method and synthesized after processing in a microwave-hydrothermal (MH) system at 140 degrees C for 6 - 96 min. These nanorods were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinements and Fourier transform (FT) -Raman spectroscopy. The growth direction, shape and average size distribution of nanorods were observed by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HR-TEM). The optical properties of the nanorods were investigated by ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. XRD patterns, Rietveld refinement data and FT-Raman spectroscopy indicate that the MnWO 4 precipitate {{is not a single}} phase structure while the nanorods synthesized by MH processing have a wolframite-type monoclinic structure without deleterious phases. FT-Raman spectra exhibited the presence of 17 Raman-active modes from 50 to 1, 000 cm(- 1). TEM and HR-TEM micrographs indicated that the nanorods are aggregated due to surface energy by Van der Waals forces and grow along the [100] direction. UV-vis absorption measurements confirmed non-linear values for the optical band gap (from 3. 2 to 2. 72 eV), which increased as the MH processing time increased. The structural characterizations indicated that the presence of defects in the MnWO 4 precipitate promotes a significant contribution to maximum PL emission, while MnWO 4 nanorods obtained by MH processing decrease the PL emission due to the reduction of defects in the lattice.

40|$|In this communication, {{we report}} {{the effect of}} {{different}} surfactants [cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) ] on the shape, growth and photoluminescence (PL) behavior of <b>manganese</b> <b>tungstate</b> (MnWO 4) crystals synthesized by the microwave-hydrothermal (MH) method at 413 K for 45 min. These crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy and PL measurements. XRD patterns proved that these crystals have a monoclinic structure. FE-SEM images showed that MnWO 4 crystals exhibit different shapes and growth mechanisms depending on the surfactant employed. The CTAB cationic surfactant promotes the hindrance of small nuclei {{that leads to the}} formation of flake-like nanocrystals, while SDS and AOT anionic surfactants promote a growth of crystals to plate-like and leaf-like crystals due to considerable size effect of counter-ions (RSO 4 - and RSO 2 O-) and an increase in Na+ ion remnants. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy revealed different optical band gap values due to modifications in the shape, surface and crystal size. Finally, the effect of surfactants on the crystal shapes and average crystal size distribution causing changes in the PL behavior of MnWO 4 crystals was explained.

40|$|Biogenic coalbed methane (CBM), an {{end product}} of {{anaerobic}} coal biodegradation, {{is a natural}} gas. It is generated and trapped in large quantities in deep, unmineable coalbeds. This dissertation describes {{a series of three}} integrated research studies to better understand the microbial players and trace element(s) limitations of methanogenic communities in this process. Microcosm experiments together with culture independent analyses demonstrated that hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens are dominated by Euryarchaeota in CBM production water from our sampling site, Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Based on 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries, Methanobacteria, Methanomicrobia, and Methanococci were major representatives of the methanogens. Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were found as most abundant bacterial lineages. Trace elements are essential components of enzymes or cofactors of metabolic pathways associated with organic matter degradation and methanogenesis. CBM production water enrichments were amended with a mixture of eight essential trace elements (iron, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, boron, and copper) at varying concentrations. Trace elements at optimized concentrations enhanced methane production by 37 % relative to unamended controls. Furthermore, transcript levels of a molecular marker for methanogens, mcrA, correlated positively with elevated rates of methane production (R 2 = 0. 95). Additionally, trace element amendments to enrichments caused a shift in the metabolically-active methanogenic community. The addition of individual iron, nickel, zinc, <b>manganese,</b> <b>tungstate,</b> and selenium at their respective concentration gradients produced either no significant enhancement or had negative effects on methane production. However, addition of molybdenum (143. 0 μg/L), cobalt (45. 0 μg/L), and copper (15 μg/L) enhanced methane production by 72 %, 55 %, and 34 %, respectively. The study revealed that molybdenum, cobalt, and copper were at limited concentrations in the CBM production water. Furthermore, addition of cobalt, molybdenum, and copper at their optimum concentrations for methane production caused an increase in methanogenic diversity and in transcript levels of mcrA (...|$|E
