40|$|A new {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic method with photodiode array detection {{was established}} for the determination of linalool in the plant <b>Michelia</b> <b>alba.</b> Linalool was extracted from the plant sample {{with the aid of}} ultrasound, and was analyzed on a Waters RP C 18 column (4. 6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) using an acetonitrile and water (55 : 45, v/v) mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 25 ºC, and the detection wavelength was 210 nm. The linear range of the method was 5 – 200 μg/mL with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9975. The recovery was 92 – 112 %, and the relative standard deviation was 1. 85 % (n = 9). The present method has been used to study the distribution of linalool in the plant <b>Michelia</b> <b>alba.</b> The plant samples include flowers, leaves and tender twigs. Furthermore, leaves included samples in their tender, grown-up and fallen phases, and flowers included samples in their juvenile, middle and whitening phases. The concentrations of linalool {{in different parts of the}} plant were 0. 21 – 0. 65 %, 1. 63 – 4. 89 % and 0. 43 % for leaves, flowers and tender twigs, respectively. The results showed that all the plant materials contained relative high concentration of linalool, and juvenile phase flowers contained the highest concentration of linalool. Notably, the fallen leaves also contained high concentrations of linalool, which could be a potential resource of this compound. The results obtained are very helpful for the potential full utilization of this plant...|$|R

40|$|Tyrosinase is {{the first}} and rate {{limiting}} enzyme in the synthesis of melanin pigments for coloring hair, skin, and eyes. As reported in this study, a natural product, (-) -N-formylanonaine isolated from the leaves of <b>Michelia</b> <b>alba</b> D. C. (Magnolianceae), was found to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase with an IC(50) of 74. 3 mu M and to have tyrosinase and melanin reducing activities in human epidermal melanocytes without apparent cytotoxicity to human cells, superior to the known tyrosinase inhibitors, such as kojic acid and 1 -phenyl- 2 -thiourea (PTU). Based on homology modeling, the compound binds the active site by coordinating with two Cu(2 +) ions. In addition, the compound had antioxidation activities in tests for scavenging 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power, and chelating metal ions. To our knowledge, this {{is the first}} study to reveal the bioactivities of (-) -N-formylanonaine from this plant species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of biochar vary with pyrolysis temperature. Chloropicrin (CP) {{is an effective}} fumigant for controlling soil-borne pests. This study investigated the {{characteristics of}} biochars prepared at 300, 500, and 700 °C by <b>michelia</b> <b>alba</b> (Magnolia denudata) wood and evaluated their capacity to adsorb CP. The study also determined the potential influence of biochar, which was added to sterilized and unsterilized soils at rates of 0 %, 1 %, 5 %, and 100 %, on CP degradation. The specific surface area, pore volume, and micropores increased considerably {{with an increase in}} the pyrolytic temperature. The adsorption rate of biochar for CP increased with increasing pyrolytic temperature. The maximum adsorption amounts of CP were similar for the three biochars. Next, the study examined the degradation ability of the biochar for CP. The degradation rate constant (k) of CP increased when biochar was added to the soil, and k increased with increased amendment rate and pyrolysis temperature. The results indicate that biochar can accelerate CP degradation in soil. The findings will be instructive in using biochar as a new fertilizer in fumigating soil with CP...|$|R

50|$|The {{alkaloid}} {{was first}} {{isolated from the}} bark of the Annona reticulata. It has since been found in Annona squamosa, the leaves of <b>Michelia</b> × <b>alba,</b> Fissistigma latifolium and Goniothalamus australis, among many others. The compound may be obtained by dry roasting the bark of Annona reticulata and extracting with methanol. The methanol is removed and the resulting syrup is then treated with hydrochloric acid and the insoluble salts filtered off. The filtrate can then made basic with NH4OH and extracted with diethyl ether. Shaking the extract with 5% sodium hydroxide and retaining the organic layer removes the phenolic content of the extract. The hydrogen chloride salt is then obtained by mixing with hydrochloric acid and recrystallized from diethyl ether. The free base can then be obtained. The anonaine content of Annona reticulata is approximately 0.12%, based on {{the weight of the}} starting dried bark.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} it has searched the {{influence}} of storage conditions upon ascorbic acid content in cabbage. The ascorbic acid content and pH evolution for 16 weeks {{has been carried out}} using, as biological material, cabbage samples from two varieties: white cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L. f. <b>alba</b> <b>DC.)</b> and red cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L. f. rubra (L.) Thell). The cabbage samples were kept in containers of glass and wood, constituting, for each sample, variants of experiences, in the presence {{and in the absence of}} oxygen, at following thermal thresholds: 4 °C, 8 °C and 15 °C. The ascorbic acid content of cabbages was determined through a method based on reduction by the ascorbic acid of 2. 6 -Dichlorphenol-indophenol (2. 6 -DCFIF) to the corresponding leucoderivate. The investigations have been carried out on freshly harvested material (week 0) and then every two weeks, for a total of 16 weeks. Compared to fresh harvested cabbage, at the end of the analysed interval (after 16 weeks of storage), the ascorbic acid content has registered different rates of diminution in the both varieties, depending on storage temperature, on storage length, and on variety. The ascorbic acid in white cabbage has registered losses, compared to red variety, so much the bigger as the temperature was higher and the storage duration was longer...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of seedling preparation technology (seedling flats with cell size of 20 ml, 40 ml and seedlings pulled from patches) and of seedling age {{at the time of}} planting (development stages of 3 – 4 true leaves and 5 – 6 true leaves) to the qualitative characteristics of seedling of selected cabbage species: white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata (L.) Alef. var. <b>alba</b> <b>DC.)</b> – Aros, Avak, Midor; cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. botrytis (L.) Alef. var. botrytis L.) – Beta, Delta, Rober and savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata (L.) Alef. var. sabauda L.) – Vega, Versus. The diameter and weight of rosaces, resp. heads, was evaluated in the harvested production. After splitting the harvested crop into several groups, the percentage of non-standard portion of the yield was determined. The use of older seedlings (5 – 6 true leaves) for the white and savoy cabbage planting had a positive influence to both average yield and the harvest earliness. On the other hand, for the cauliflower conclusively better average crop of rosaces and earlier harvests were achieved with younger seedling transplanting (3 – 4 true leaves). Seedling flats proved to be the most suitable way of seedling preplantation; no {{differences were found between the}} characteristics of products cultivated from the seedling flats with 20 ml and 40 ml cell volumes. In average, smaller amount of non-standard harvest plant parts was, gained with the transplanting from larger seedling flats (40 ml cell volume) ...|$|R
40|$|Leaching of NO 3 − from {{vegetable}} cropping {{systems can be}} very high compared to arable systems. This {{is a problem for}} vegetable growers in general as it decreases groundwater quality, and for organic growers in particular as the organic production is often limited by N. In a field experiment, we investigated the N uptake and root growth of three vegetables using minirhizotrons reaching 2. 4 m with the purpose to study the relationship between vegetable root distribution and uptake of NO 3 − from deep soil layers. NO 3 − uptake was studied over a 6 d period at the end of September by injection of 15 NO 3 − at four depths in the ranges: 0. 2 – 0. 8, 0. 6 – 1. 8, and 1 – 2. 5 m under late sweet corn (Zea mays L. convar. Saccharata Koern.), carrot (Daucus carota L.), and autumn white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. convar. capitata (L.) Alef. var. <b>alba</b> <b>DC),</b> respectively. The root depths of the three crops were 0. 6, 1. 3, and more than 2. 4 m, respectively. Uptake of 15 N was close to zero from placements below root depth, and linear relationships were found between root density and 15 N uptake from different depths. N inflow rates (uptake per unit root length) were in the same range for all species and depths. This indicates that the very different N use efficiencies often found for vegetable crops depend on species specific differences in root development over time and space, more than on differences in N uptake ability of the single root. Thus deep rooting is important for deep N uptake. Knowledge about deep root growth enables design of crop rotations with improved N use efficiency based on re-cycling of deep soil NO 3 − by vegetables...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{chromosomal}} {{numbers of}} three species of Bidens were determined {{based on an}} analysis of somatic metaphases. The species studied were Bidens pilosa L., Bidens subalternans <b>DC</b> and Bidens <b>alba</b> (L.) <b>DC,</b> all of which belong to the Bidens pilosa species complex. The three species have a similar morphology: Bidens pilosa and B. sub-alternans are widely distributed in agricultural areas, in disturbed habitats and along roadsides, whereas B. alba oc-curs only along the seacoast. Bidens pilosa has 2 n= 72 and B. subalternans and B. alba has 2 n= 48. These numbers agreed with the basic chromosomal number of n= 12 reported for the tribe Heliantheae and show {{that the number of}} metaphase chromosomes can be used to distinguish Bidens pilosa from the other two species of the B. pilosa complex in southeastern Brazil...|$|R
