25|$|Amid an {{upsurge in}} the number of sea arrivals in Italy from Libya in 2014, several European Union governments refused to fund the Italian-run rescue option Operation <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum,</b> which was {{replaced}} by Frontex's Operation Triton in November 2014. In {{the first six months of}} 2015, Greece overtook Italy as the first EU country of arrival, becoming, in the summer 2015, the starting point of a flow of refugees and migrants moving through Balkan countries to Northern European countries, mainly Germany and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Félix {{debuted in}} the European cinema in Spain, {{with the film}} <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> (1948), {{directed}} by Rafael Gil. With Gil as director, she realized another two films in 1950: Una mujer cualquiera and La noche del sábado. In 1951, she filmed the French-Spanish production La Couronne Noire directed by Luis Saslavsky based on a story by Jean Cocteau. She debuted in Italy with the film Incantesimo Tragico (1951). In the same year, she filmed Messalina (1951), directed by Carmine Gallone (at the time, the most expensive film of the Italian cinema). During the filming of this movie Félix suffered an emotional shock: her father {{died of a heart}} attack in Navojoa.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the First Punic War, the Roman navy was massively {{expanded}} and played a vital role in the Roman victory and the Roman Republic's eventual ascension to hegemony in the Mediterranean Sea. In {{the course of}} the first half of the 2nd century BC, Rome went on to destroy Carthage and subdue the Hellenistic kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean, achieving complete mastery of the inland sea, which they called <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum.</b> The Roman fleets were again prominent in the 1st century BC in the wars against the pirates, and in the civil wars that brought down the Republic, whose campaigns ranged across the Mediterranean. In 31 BC, the great naval Battle of Actium ended the civil wars culminating in the final victory of Augustus and the establishment of the Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} following the defeat of Macedon, Rome became embroiled in a war with the Seleucid Empire. This war too was decided mainly on land, although the combined Roman-Rhodian navy also achieved victories over the Seleucids at Myonessus and Eurymedon. These victories, which were invariably concluded with the imposition of peace treaties that prohibited the maintenance of anything but token naval forces, spelled {{the disappearance of the}} Hellenistic royal navies, leaving Rome and her allies unchallenged at sea. Coupled with the final destruction of Carthage, and the end of Macedon's independence, by {{the latter half of the}} 2nd century BC, Roman control over all of what was later to be dubbed <b>mare</b> <b>nostrum</b> ("our sea") had been established. Subsequently, the Roman navy was drastically reduced, depending on its Socii navales.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, changes and {{developments}} in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements {{to improve its}} security. Mustafa Kemal strongly believed that a close cooperation between the Balkan states {{based on the principle}} of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries, and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. Benito Mussolini had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum.</b> Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 in Spain, the Fascist regime {{made its}} most {{significant}} pre-war military intervention. The Spanish Republic was divided in the Spanish Civil War between the anticlerical socialist Republicans and the Church-supporting nationalists led by Francisco Franco under fascist Falange movement. Italy sent aircraft, weapons {{and a total}} of over 60,000 troops to aid the Spanish nationalists. The war helped train the Italian military for war and improve relations with the Roman Catholic Church. It was a success that secured Italy's naval access {{in and out of the}} Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and its ability to pursue its policy of <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> without fear of opposition by Spain. The other major foreign contributor to the Spanish Civil War was Germany. This was the first time that Italian and German forces fought together since the Franco-Prussian War in the 1870s. During the 1930s, Italy built many large battleships and other warships to solidify Italy's hold on the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|To gain back {{ground in}} Greece, Germany reluctantly began a Balkans Campaign {{alongside}} Italy which resulted {{also in the}} destruction of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the ceding of Dalmazia to Italy. Mussolini and Hitler compensated Croatian nationalists by endorsing the creation of the Independent State of Croatia under the extreme nationalist Ustaše. In order to receive the support of Italy, the Ustaše agreed to concede the main central portion of Dalmazia as well as various Adriatic Sea islands to Italy, as Dalmazia held a significant number of Italians. The ceding of the Adriatic Sea islands was considered by the Independent State of Croatia to be a minimal loss, as in exchange for those cessions they were allowed to annex all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, which led to the persecution of the Serb population there. Officially, the Independent State of Croatia was a kingdom and an Italian protectorate, ruled by Italian House of Savoy member Tomislav II of Croatia, but he never personally set foot on Croatian soil and the government was run by Ante Pavelić, the leader of the Ustaše. However, Italy did hold military control across all of Croatia's coast, which combined with Italian control of Albania and Montenegro gave Italy complete control of the Adriatic Sea, thus completing {{a key part of the}} <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> policy of the Fascists. The Ustaše movement proved valuable to Italy and Germany as a means to counter Royalist Chetnik guerrillas (although they did work with them because they did not really like the Ustaše movement whom they left up to the Germans) and the communist Yugoslav Partisans under Josip Broz Tito who opposed the occupation of Yugoslavia.|$|E
500|$|The Roman Empire {{completely}} encircled the Mediterranean, {{which they}} called [...] "our sea" [...] (<b>mare</b> <b>nostrum).</b> Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean {{as well as}} the major rivers of the Empire, including the Guadalquivir, Ebro, Rhône, Rhine, Tiber and Nile. Transport by water was preferred where possible, and moving commodities by land was more difficult. Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers.|$|E
500|$|The RMNDH was {{established}} by the Law on the Establishment of the Army and Navy issued on 10 April 1941 by retired Austro-Hungarian Lieutenant Colonel (later Marshal and Commander-in-chief of the armed forces) Slavko Kvaternik, {{with the approval of}} the German authorities. The task of the navy, along with the army, was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies. The Italians opposed the formation of a navy by the Independent State of Croatia ( [...] , NDH), as they considered the Adriatic to be <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> (Our Sea). The Germans supported the Italians in this, so the development of the RMNDH along the Adriatic coast was initially very restricted. On 18 May 1941, the Agreement on Military Matters Pertaining to Coastal Areas was signed in Romethe second of three Treaties of Rome signed that day. In this bilateral treaty with Italy, Croatia agreed to demilitarize the coastal area entirely, restricting itself to civil administration there. It also agreed not create any naval units in the Adriatic except for policing and customs purposes. By July 1941, the RMNDH consisted of two commands, the Coast and Maritime Traffic Command, and the River and River Traffic Command, and had its headquarters in the NDH capital, Zagreb.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, Benito Mussolini {{brought the}} fascist party {{to power in}} Italy with his March on Rome on 28 October. Mussolini {{repeatedly}} stated his dream of the Mediterranean Sea becoming an [...] "Italian lake" [...] (<b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum,</b> [...] "our sea") and valued war, saying [...] "Though words are beautiful things, rifles, machine guns, planes, and cannon are still more beautiful".|$|E
2500|$|In the Balkans, the Italian Royal Army conquered coastal Yugoslavia and, {{together}} with the Germans, finally defeated the Greek Army which was insufficiently aided by the British. [...] On 3 May 1941, the Italian and German Armies held a military parade in Athens to celebrate their victory in the Balkans. [...] In this parade, Mussolini {{for the first time}} boasted of an Italian <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum,</b> referring {{to the fact that the}} Mediterranean was becoming an Italian-dominated sea. [...] Effectively, it remained practically Italian from December 1941, after the sinking of two British battleships in Alexandria by the Italian frogmen of Luigi Durand De La Penne, until the landings of the Americans in Algeria (Operation Torch) in November 1942.|$|E
2500|$|In the 13th to 16th centuries, {{the strongest}} {{economic}} force in Northern Europe was the Hanseatic League, a federation of merchant {{cities around the}} Baltic Sea and the North Sea. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Poland, Denmark, and Sweden fought wars for Dominium maris baltici ("Lordship over the Baltic Sea"). Eventually, it was Sweden that virtually encompassed the Baltic Sea. In Sweden the sea was then referred to as <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> Balticum ("Our Baltic Sea"). The goal of Swedish warfare during the 17th century {{was to make the}} Baltic Sea an all-Swedish sea (Ett Svenskt innanhav), something that was accomplished except the rout between Riga in Latvia and Szczecin in Poland. [...] However, it was the Dutch who dominated Baltic trade in the seventeenth century.|$|E
2500|$|The movement's name {{is derived}} from the {{combination}} of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California Abstract Expressionist Jay Meuser, who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum,</b> [...] "It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." [...] Pollock's energetic [...] "action paintings", with their [...] "busy" [...] feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque Women series of Willem de Kooning's figurative paintings and the rectangles of color in Mark Rothko's Color Field paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.|$|E
2500|$|Papen {{arrived in}} Turkey on 27 April 1939, {{just after the}} signing of an Anglo-Turkish {{declaration}} of friendship, and met with Saracoğlu later that day. Speaking in French (the common language of diplomacy) Saracoğlu told Papen bluntly that the Turks regarded the Italian claim that the entire Mediterranean was <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> ("Our Sea") as a threat, which led Papen {{to say that the}} Turks did not have to fear the Italians just {{as long as they were}} Germany's friends, leading an insulted Saracoğlu to reply that the Turks depended upon the friendship of no-one for their security. Saracoğlu rejected Papen's suggestion of an Italo-Turkish friendship pact, saying such a treaty [...] "would displease Turkey enormously". Saracoğlu also told Papen that Germany's efforts to make the Balkans its sphere of influence both politically and economically were regarded as a threat and wanted to know if the Reich was prepared to go further, leading Papen to say [...] "Jamais d'la vie!" [...] ("I wouldn't dream of it!"), leading [...] Saracoğlu [...] to retort if that was the case, then the Germans could sleep quietly in their beds. Papen found the blunt, plain-speaking, no-nonsense Saracoğlu a difficult man to deal with and left his meeting [...] "visibly disconcerted".|$|E
2500|$|In April 1939, Ribbentrop {{received}} {{intelligence that}} Britain and Turkey were negotiating an alliance {{intended to keep}} Germany out of the Balkans. On 23 April 1939, the Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu told the British Ambassador of his nation's fears of Italian claims of the Mediterranean as <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> and German control of the Balkans, and suggested an Anglo-Soviet-Turkish alliance {{as the best way}} of countering the Axis. As the Germans had broken the Turkish diplomatic codes, Ribbentrop was well aware as he warned in a circular to German embassies that Anglo-Turkish talks had gone much further [...] "than what the Turks would care to tell us". Ribbentrop appointed von Papen Germany's ambassador in Ankara with instructions to win Turkey to an alliance with Germany. Ribbentrop had been attempting to appoint Papen as an ambassador to Turkey since April 1938. His first attempt ended in failure when the Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who remembered Papen well with considerable distaste from World War I, refused to accept him as ambassador, complaining in private the nomination of Papen must have been meant as some sort of German sick joke. The German Embassy in Ankara had been vacant ever since the retirement of the previous ambassador Friedrich von Keller in November 1938, and Ribbentrop was only able to get the Turks to accept Papen as ambassador when the Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu complained to Kroll in April 1939 about when the Germans were ever going to send a new ambassador. Papen's attempt to address Turkish fears of Italian expansionism by getting Ribbentrop to have Count Galeazzo Ciano promise the Turks that they had nothing to fear from Italy backfired when the Turks found the Italo-German effort to be both patronizing and insulting.|$|E
2500|$|World War II {{broke out}} {{in the first year of}} his presidency, and both the Allies and the Axis {{pressured}} İnönü to bring Turkey into the war on their side. [...] The Germans sent Franz von Papen to Ankara in April 1939 while the British sent Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and the French René Massigli. On 23 April 1939, Turkish Foreign Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu told Knatchbull-Hugessen of his nation's fears of Italian claims of the Mediterranean as <b>Mare</b> <b>Nostrum</b> and German control of the Balkans, and suggested an Anglo-Soviet-Turkish alliance as the best way of countering the Axis. In May 1939, during the visit of Maxime Weygand to Turkey, İnönü told the French Ambassador René Massigli that he believed that the best way of stopping Germany was an alliance of Turkey, the Soviet Union, France and Britain; that if such an alliance came into being, the Turks would allow Soviet ground and air forces onto their soil; and that he wanted a major programme of French military aid to modernize the Turkish armed forces. [...] The signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 drew Turkey away from the Allies; the Turks always believed that it was essential to have the Soviet Union as an ally to counter Germany, and thus the signing of the German-Soviet pact undercut completely the assumptions behind Turkish security policy. With the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, İnönü chose to be neutral in World War II as taking on Germany and the Soviet Union at the same time would be too much for Turkey, through he signed a treaty of alliance with Britain and France on 19 October 1939. It was only with France's defeat in June 1940 that İnönü abandoned the pro-Allied neutrality that he had followed since the beginning of the war. A major embarrassment for the Turks occurred in July 1940 when the Germans captured and published documents from the Quai d'Orsay in Paris showing the Turks were aware of Operation Pike as the Anglo-French plan in the winter of 1939-40 to bomb the oil fields in the Soviet Union from Turkey was codenamed, which was intended by Berlin to worsen relations between Ankara and Moscow. In turn, worsening relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey were intended to drive Turkey into the arms of the Reich. After the publication of the French documents relating to Operation Pike, İnönü had to fire Saracoğlu as Foreign Minister following Soviet complaints and signed an economic treaty with Germany that placed Turkey within the German economic sphere of influence, but İnönü would go no further towards the Axis.|$|E
