50|$|There {{have been}} claims by Holocaust deniers that the gas {{chambers}} which mainstream historians believe {{were for the}} massacre of civilians never existed, but rather that the structures identified as gas chambers actually served other purposes. These other purposes include cadaver storage, delousing, and disinfection. A similar argument is sometimes used that claims gas {{was not used to}} murder Jews and other victims, and that many gas chambers were also built after the war just for show. A document advancing this theory is the Leuchter report by Fred A. Leuchter, a paper stating that only traces of cyanide were found when he examined samples taken from one of the Auschwitz gas chambers in 1988. This is often cited as evidence that gas was not used in the chambers, as no trace amounts remain.

Markiewicz and his team used <b>microdiffusion</b> techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz.

40|$|The {{previously}} formulated rate-type aging creep law {{based on}} Maxwell chain is generalized to variable humidity and is calibrated by extensive comparisons with test {{data from the}} literature. The main object of attention is the Pickett effect, i. e., the apparent increase in creep due to drying simultaneous with loading. This effect is shown to have four sources, in their decreasing order of importance: (1) stress-induced shrinkage, (2) tensile strain softening due to progressive cracking, (3) irreversibility of unloading contraction after tensile strain-softening, and (4) increase of material stiffness due to aging (hydration). The model, which is a special case of a previously advanced thermodynamic theory, depends on only one hypothesis about the microscopic physical mechanism of creep: The creep rate depends on {{the magnitude of the}} flux of <b>microdiffusion</b> of water between the macropores (capillary pores) and the micropores in the cement gel. By assuming this <b>microdiffusion</b> to be infinitely fast, the effect is reduced to a dependence of creep viscosities on the time rate of pore humidity, and this is further shown to be equivalent to stress-induced shrinkage, in which the shrinkage coefficient defining the ratio of the increments of shrinkage strain and pore relative humidity depends on stress.

We evaluate three off-line techniques for measuring the 15 N signature of DON in the presence of inorganic N using a persulfate digestion followed by <b>microdiffusion.</b> The 15 N-DON signature is calculated from the difference between total dissolved 15 N (15 N-TDN) and inorganic 15 N. We quantified the 15 N recovery and signature of DON, NH 4 +, and NO 3 - in a series of inorganic N/DON mixtures (with a TDN concentration of 10 mg N L- 1) for three lab protocols. Phenylalanine was used as a model compound for DON. The best lab protocol determined the concentration of inorganic N and TDN prior to diffusion using improved spectrophotometric techniques. An accuracy of 88 % for 15 N-DON should be routinely possible; coefficient of variation wa...|$|E
40|$|A {{biomarker}} for lifetime fluoride exposure {{would facilitate}} population-based {{research and policy}} making but currently does not exist. This study examined the suitability of primary tooth dentin as a biomarker by comparing dentin fluoride concentration and fluoride exposures. Ninety-nine children's exfoliated primary teeth were collected from 2 fluoridated and 2 fluoride-deficient communities in North Carolina. Coronal dentin was isolated by microdissection and fluoride concentration assayed using the <b>microdiffusion,</b> ion-specific electrode technique. Information on children's fluoride exposures since birth from drinking water, toothpaste, supplements, rinses, food and beverages was collected by a self-reported questionnaire administered to caregivers. Only {{a small portion of}} the variance (10 %) in incisor dentin fluoride (mean 792, SD 402 mg/kg) was accounted for by the best linear regression model as evaluated by the adjusted R 2. A moderate portion of the variance (60 %) of molar dentin fluoride (mean 768, SD 489 mg/kg) was predicted by dietary fluoride supplement exposures, community of residence, and frequent tea consumption. Results for molars suggest that primary tooth dentin concentration may prove to be a satisfactory biomarker for fluoride exposure...|$|E

Al-though plain film radiography is still considered the first-line imaging modality for assessing the nature and defining the characteristics of primary bone lesions, cer-tain areas of the musculoskeletal system may be difficult to profile in plain films due to overlapping structures [1]. Computerized tomography can provide more de-tailed information, including focal destruction, periosteal most sensitive for evaluating changes in bone-marrow and defining the extent of a lesion, particularly when plain films or computerized tomography findings are suboptimal or indeterminate; however, it is not always the most specific. Despite their respective advantages, none of these imaging techniques can reliably differen-tiate between benign and malignant bone tumors, as many lesions are non-specific and display varying im-aging characteristics on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. MR characterization of bone lesions can be improved by the use of MR diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, as this is sensitive to changes in the <b>microdiffusion</b> of wate...|$|E
40|$|A novel microperfusion chamber was {{developed}} to measure kinetic cell volume changes under various extracellular conditions and to quantitatively determine cell membrane transport properties. This device eliminates modeling ambiguities and limitations inherent {{in the use of}} the <b>microdiffusion</b> chamber and the micropipette perfusion technique, both of which have been previously validated and are closely related optical technologies using light microscopy and image analysis. The resultant simplicity should prove to be especially valuable for study of the coupled transport of water and permeating solutes through cell membranes. Using the microperfusion chamber, water and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) permeability coefficients of mouse oocytes as well as the water permeability coefficient of golden hamster pancreatic islet cells were determined. In these experiments, the individual cells were held in the chamber and perfused at 22 degrees C with hyperosmotic media, with or without DMSO (1. 5 M). The cell volume change was videotaped and quantified by image analysis. Based on the experimental data and irreversible thermodynamics theory for the coupled mass transfer across the cell membrane, the water permeability coefficient of the oocytes was determined to be 0. 47 micron. min- 1. atm- 1 in the absence of DMSO and 0. 65 microns. min- 1. atm- 1 in the presence of DMSO. The DMSO permeability coefficient of the oocyte membrane and associated membrane reflection coefficient to DMSO were determined to be 0. 23 and 0. 85 micron/s, respectively. These values are consistent with those determined using the micropipette perfusion and <b>microdiffusion</b> chamber techniques. The water permeability coefficient of the golden hamster pancreatic islet cells was determined to be 0. 27 microns. min- 1. atm- 1, which agrees well with a value previously determined using an electronic sizing (Coulter counter) technique. The use of the microperfusion chamber has the following major advantages: 1) This method allows the extracellular condition(s) to be readily changed by perfusing a single cell or group of cells with a prepared medium (cells can be reperfused with a different medium to study the response of the same cell to different osmotic conditions). 2) The short mixing time of cells and perfusion medium allows for accurate control of the extracellular osmolality and ensures accuracy of the corresponding mathematical formulation (modeling). 3) This technique has wide applicability in studying the cell osmotic response and in determining cell membrane transport properties...|$|E
