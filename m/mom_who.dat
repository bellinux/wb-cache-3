25|$|The {{original}} duty of RAT Parents was to haze freshman {{members of}} the band and enforce RAT Rules. The modern role of RAT Parents is to welcome freshman band members, teach them Georgia Tech and band traditions, help them adjust to life at Tech and in the band and {{to act as a}} friend and advisor to them. In {{the early days of the}} tradition, there was just a Rat <b>Mom,</b> <b>who</b> was always a male band member. Since the mid-1980s, there has been both a RAT Mom and a RAT Dad, the latter of which is always a female band member. Until 1990, the selection of Rat Parents was fairly informal. From 1990 to 1993, RAT Parents were selected by the band's executive board, partly to keep the decision in the hands of the students. When the executive board was dissolved in 1993, the selection was made by the director of bands following an interview process. New RAT Parents are announced along with the new drum majors for the upcoming year.|$|E

Stu and Angelica, who are Christians, both find Passover boring, and Angelica argues why she and her parents should be at the Seder at all, especially considering Boris and Minka aren't actually related to them. Following an argument with Minka about what type of wine glasses they should use (either the glasses that belonged to Minka's mother or the ones that belonged Boris' father), Boris storms out of the room; the two families arrive and Didi tries comforting her <b>mom,</b> <b>who</b> believes Boris has run away.|$|E

500|$|Having {{portrayed the}} {{character}} for eight years, Rashad remains {{best known for}} her role as Clair; the actress established herself as a both household name and television icon during the 1980s for portraying [...] "the working <b>mom</b> <b>who</b> had it all". In 1993, Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun wrote that Rashad and her character [...] "appear to be inextricably entwined: Just as no one remembers Clair, the super-woman of The Cosby Show without thinking of the actress who played her, few think of Ms. Rashad without flashing on Clair". At the 42nd NAACP Image Awards in 2010, the organization dubbed Rashad [...] "mother" [...] of the African-American community. Rashad and Cosby's professional relationship continued beyond The Cosby Show. After The Cosby Shows conclusion, Rashad would similarly portray Cosby's wife, Ruth Lucas, on his sitcom Cosby for four years. Cosby would again recruit Rashad to voice Little Bill Glover's mother, Brenda Glover, in Cosby's animated series Little Bill. In 2016, Esquire included Rashad on their list of [...] "75 Greatest Women of All Time" [...] for portraying [...] "the perfect mother".|$|E

500|$|Clair {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest mothers in television history by several media publications. Time dubbed Clair [...] "America's favorite TV mom". Peoples Jane Hall hailed the character as America's [...] "No. 1 wife and mom" [...] while crowning Rashad [...] "TV's Reigning Mom" [...] in 1987. Hayley Krischer of Salon agreed that Clair is [...] "everyone’s favorite" [...] and [...] "undoubtedly the best TV mom", despite being [...] "too calm, too gorgeous, too successful" [...] to be realistic. The Daily Beast wrote, [...] "Clair Huxtable was not only the perfect mom, but also a great role model as someone who never sacrificed either her career as a high-power lawyer or her family life." [...] Praising the character for transcending both racial and generational barriers, Patrice Evans of Jezebel described Clair as [...] "the perfect professional mom". The author went on to claim that while other famous television mothers such as June Cleaver, Carol Brady and Edith Bunker have gradually suffered a loss in [...] "potency" [...] over time, Clair instead remains a relevant maternal figure every television mother created since can only aspire to be like. As a [...] "family-balancing professional African American woman", Clair has had a profound influence on The Cosby Shows viewers. According to Susan Douglas, author of The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women, Clair was [...] "the first African American mother on television ... with whom white women identified and wanted to emulate." [...] US Weekly recognized Clair as [...] "one of TV's first working mothers", while NewNowNext's Brian Juergens credits the character with making the 1980s a [...] "boom time for great sitcom moms" [...] by [...] "breaking the mold in an essential way". SheKnows contributor Cynthia Boris recognized Clair as a mother television audiences had [...] "never seen before -- a beautiful, successful, working <b>mom</b> <b>who</b> was an African American" [...] and [...] "a positive role model ... every young woman could aspire to." [...] Sharifa Daniels of Vibe concluded [...] "No other TV mom has left such of an effect on viewers as Clair Huxtable ... an exemplary example of a wife, mother, and friend" [...] in an article recognizing [...] "10 Life Lessons Clair Huxtable Taught You".|$|E
500|$|The show's only main {{character}} {{to have been}} spared harsh criticism, Clair has garnered very positive reviews from critics, by whom she continues to be venerated frequently. Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass {{at home and at}} work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass <b>mom</b> <b>who</b> radiates the beauty of a goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household." [...] Daisy Dumas of the Daily Mail dubbed Clair an [...] "Indomitable matriarch". AfterEllen.com's Jill Guccini called Clair [...] "divine". Including her on her list of [...] "Diverse TV Ladies That Can Help Young Girls Learn How to Kick Ass", she hailed her relationship with Cliff as [...] "something that young girls—gay or straight—really need to see", while praising her occasional use of Spanish. In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good now as it was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being too perfect and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not appreciate the fact that Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E

40|$|Encountering {{stereotypes}} {{promulgated by}} media representations {{is a daily}} occurrence. Information perpetuated in the media continually influences how people view the world.
