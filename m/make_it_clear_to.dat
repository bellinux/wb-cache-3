5|$|The most {{important}} act {{of civil disobedience}} during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going on}} for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E
5|$|After Becket's {{murder in}} December 1170 King Henry sent Barre to Rome, {{accompanied}} by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of Évreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy. The mission's objective was to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Alexander that Henry had {{had nothing to do}} with Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had taken place. Barre was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope. Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy not to impose an interdict, or ban on clerical rites, on England or to excommunicate the king. Shortly afterwards Barre was granted the office of Archdeacon of Lisieux, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome in 1171. In September he was named a royal justice. He was named chancellor to King Henry's eldest living son Henry for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile and returned to the king's service. Barre took with him the younger Henry's seal.|$|E

25|$|The Hebrew name 'Raphael' means 'God has healed'. The {{archangel}} Raphael {{has traditionally}} been linked with healing and restoration, {{and it is clear}} that Franckenberg, in subtitling his manuscript Arzt-Engel ('doctor-angel', a play on Erzengel, 'archangel'), is aware of this fact and wishes to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> his readers. The work, ostensibly a medical tract, draws on both Paracelsian alchemy and Böhmian mysticism. There is also evidence pointing to Franckenberg's interest in the Kabbalah and of links with Rosicrucianism and the ideas of Joachim of Fiore.|$|E

Saffron Walden was Harvey's birthplace and he seems to have withdrawn there to live sometime in 1593.|$|R
25|$|The Consultation's {{main purpose}} was to decide the overall goals of the revolution. Members of the War Party {{advocated}} for complete independence from Mexico, while Peace Party representatives wished for Texas to remain part of Mexico, but only under the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. Although Austin was unable to attend, he did {{send a letter to}} the consultation, asking them to follow the Constitution of 1824 and to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Mexico that the hostilities were not an attempt for independence but instead a determination to fight for their rights as Mexican citizens.|$|E
500|$|Once again, Savige {{would not}} escape controversy. In this case, {{difficulties}} {{arose from the}} fact that Herring failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Savige and Wilton exactly what was meant by [...] "threaten". What would end up being threatened by Savige's very success was Blamey's plan for the capture of Lae, which called for the Japanese defenders of Lae to be drawn away towards Salamaua. The campaign also included an acrimonious exchange between Savige and American commanders that threatened Allied harmony. This arose, ironically, because of Herring's deliberately vague instructions, which he hoped would ensure Allied harmony.|$|E
500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B. Weiss {{commented that}} the {{explicit}} style of the execution scene was selected in part to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the viewers that Eddard Stark, despite being the arguable protagonist of season one, actually was dead: [...] "It’s that rule: 'If you don't see the body then they’re not really dead.' [...] Like when we cut Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but we needed to see the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck. [...] we needed Ned's death to be totally unambiguous." ...|$|E

Artillery and anti-tank units would follow at daybreak. However, he not only decided to use unreliable short-range radios but also failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the inexperienced commander of the 21st Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Sam Allen, {{that it was not}} expected to cover the whole frontal advance. During the advance, the elements of the battalion were spread so far apart that they lost cohesion and bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact.|$|E
500|$|Selling England by the Pound was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in August 1973, the second Genesis album that Burns co-produced. Much {{of it was}} written at Una Billings School of Dance and Chessington. Gabriel contributed lyrics {{based on the idea}} of commercialism and the decline of English culture and the rise in American influences. Its title refers to a UK Labour Party slogan to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> music critics who may thought Genesis were beginning to [...] "sell out" [...] to America. [...] "Firth of Fifth" [...] features an extended electric guitar solo from Hackett. The album's cover is a modified version of a painting named The Dream by Betty Swanwick who added a lawn mower to tie the image to the lyrics of [...] "I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)".|$|E
500|$|As the pulps proliferated, they {{continued}} to carry science fiction (sf), both in the general fiction magazines such as Argosy and All-Story, and in the more specialized titles such as sports, detective fiction, and (especially) the hero pulps. [...] Science fiction also appeared outside the world of pulps: Hugo Gernsback, who had begun his career as an editor and publisher in 1908 with a radio hobbyist magazine called Modern Electrics, soon began including articles speculating about future uses of science, such as [...] "Wireless on Saturn", {{which appeared in the}} December 1908 issue. [...] The article was written with enough humour to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> his readers that it was simply an imaginative exercise, but in 1911 Modern Electrics began serializing Ralph 124C 41+, a novel set in the year 2660. [...] In 1913 Gernsback launched another magazine, The Electrical Experimenter (retitled Science and Invention in 1920), which frequently ran science fictional tales, written both by Gernsback and others.|$|E

500|$|In {{late summer}} {{he was invited}} by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> her that this could not be so. He wrote {{at this time to}} Grzymała [...] "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and {{responding}} to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was [...] "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed." [...] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Argentine ultra-nationalists, {{sympathetic}} to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, asserted Borges was secretly Jewish, and by implication, {{not a true}} Argentine. Borges responded with the essay [...] "Yo, Judío" [...] ("I, a Jew"), {{a reference to the}} old [...] "Yo, Argentino" [...] ("I, an Argentine"), a defensive phrase used during pogroms of Argentine Jews to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> attackers that an intended victim was not Jewish. In the essay he says that he would be proud to be a Jew, with a backhanded reminder that any pure Castilian might be likely to have Jewish ancestry from a millennium ago.|$|E
2500|$|The direct-action group's inaugural action {{took place}} at Flutie's Bar, a {{straight}} hangout at the South Street Sea Port on April 13, 1990.

Through parodying straight behavior (such as [...] "spin the bottle") at these events, queers refused to be invisible while publicly questioning the naturalized status of heterosexual coupling activity. [...] Visibility actions like this one became known as [...] "Queer Nights Out." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{geometry}} {{was first}} formalised by Euclid in the Elements, he defined a general line (straight or curved) to be [...] "breadthless length" [...] {{with a straight}} line being a line [...] "which lies evenly with the points on itself". These definitions serve little purpose since they use terms which are not, themselves, defined. In fact, Euclid did not use these definitions in this work and probably included them just to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the reader what was being discussed. In modern geometry, a line is simply taken as an undefined object with properties given by axioms, but is sometimes defined {{as a set of}} points obeying a linear relationship when some other fundamental concept is left undefined.|$|E
