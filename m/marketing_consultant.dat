5|$|In {{the next}} off-season, the Canucks {{announced}} they had re-signed Bure to a five-year, $24.5million contract on June 16. The deal {{was reported to}} have been signed before game three of the Stanley Cup Finals against New York. It also included Bure's marketing rights and put his father, Vladimir, on the team payroll as a fitness and <b>marketing</b> <b>consultant.</b> The average annual salary of $4.9million made Bure the league's third highest-paid player, behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. In fact, Bure and the Canucks had entered into contract negotiations {{at the beginning of the}} 1993–94 season, although two years remained in his original deal. Neither side could come to an initial agreement; one of the major factors was the Canucks' demands for the contract to be in Canadian dollars on account of the American exchange rate. Numerous accusations were made in the media during the Canucks' playoff run that Bure threatened not to play if a contract could not be agreed upon. A Toronto Star article, published before the first game of the Finals on May 31, 1994, claimed Bure had signed a five-year, $30million contract that, if the Canucks had not agreed to, would have seen him pull out of game five of the Conference Finals against the Maple Leafs. The article was followed by two additional claims in the following two days in the Vancouver-based newspaper The Province and Toronto Sun. The Toronto Sun held the contract was a five-year, $22.5 million deal, and that it was signed before either game six or seven of the opening round against the Flames after Bure's agent, Ron Salcer, told general manager Quinn that Bure would not play if the deal was not made. As the story continued well into the next season, Pat Quinn appeared in a segment on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s Hockey Night in Canada on March 27, 1995, publicly denying the claims.|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, United Artists {{president}} of worldwide marketing Dennis Rice {{was replaced by}} Michael Vollman, who was tasked to develop a marketing strategy for the [...] "troubled" [...] Valkyrie, which had been [...] "battered by constant media sniping". Under Vollman, by August 2008, the release date was changed to December 26, 2008, with reports citing commercial reasons for the move after a successful test screening. (The film was ultimately released on Christmas Day, December 25, 2008.) The release date was {{before the end of}} December, which [...] "crucially" [...] helped the film with a home distribution deal with the subscription channel Showtime. In the same month of August, Paula Wagner left her position with the studio during the film's post-production. The changing release date for Valkyrie drew criticism about the viability of United Artists, and the studio aimed to combat the criticism leading up to the film's eventual release. [...] In addition, the first theatrical trailer, released early in 2008, received [...] "mixed buzz" [...] over Tom Cruise's portraying von Stauffenberg with an American accent. The trade paper Variety described the trailer as [...] "dour and ... like it was selling a talky stage play with a cast of old British actors". Images of Tom Cruise as Colonel von Stauffenberg that surfaced during filming were widely ridiculed. Terry Press, a <b>marketing</b> <b>consultant</b> with the studio, said that Valkyrie had been wrongly labeled as [...] "the Tom Cruise eye-patch movie".|$|E
500|$|Marketing for {{the film}} {{included}} $20million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Payless ShoeSource paying $125million in tied promotions {{for the film}}. <b>Marketing</b> <b>consultant</b> Al Ries reflected on the promotion: [...] "This will be a killer deal. How can a kid, sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters, not want to own one?" [...] Despite this, Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story early on. When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of runway time and passed on the project. In February 1995, Disney took the idea to Toy Fair, a toy industry trade show in New York. There, a Toronto-based company with a factory based in China, Thinkway Toys, became interested. Although Thinkway was a small player in the industry, mainly producing toy banks {{in the form of}} film characters, it was able to scoop up the worldwide master license for Toy Story toys simply because no one else wanted it. Walt Disney Home Video put a trailer for the film on seven million copies of the VHS re-release of Cinderella; the Disney Channel ran a television special on the making of Toy Story; Walt Disney World in Florida held a daily Toy Story parade at Disney-MGM Studios.|$|E
500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by <b>marketing</b> <b>consultant</b> Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E
