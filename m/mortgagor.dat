25|$|The {{floating}} mortgage can {{be specific}} or general {{with respect to}} immovables and movables, separately or together. The mortgage is not perfected until it crystallises. Crystallisation occurs upon default of the <b>mortgagor</b> and registration of a notice of default, and the mortgage ranks from the date notice is filed. This means that a floating mortgage ranks lower than a fixed mortgage.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} mortgagee takes {{subject to the}} overdraft only at that time, that is to say, not subject to future advances, and {{the reduction of the}} overdraft correspondingly improves his security. If the overdraft is paid off, then any subsequent indebtedness will be by way of future advances and the bank mortgage will be postponed entirely in relation to the subsequent mortgage, although the bank mortgage does not cease to be effective between the bank and its customer, the <b>mortgagor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Up to 1890 {{the cattle}} {{industry}} in north Queensland struggled for profitability because {{the supply of}} cattle greatly exceeded demand, and cattle prices were depressed. This appears to be {{borne out by the}} Wairuna lease being held by the Bank of New South Wales as <b>mortgagor</b> for James Atkinson from 26 September 1887, which was still the case in 1900. However, Geoffrey Bolton states that [...] "radually between 1870 and 1890 most of the northern graziers achieved, if not prosperity, a modest standard of comfort". The usual type of homestead residence was represented by Gunnawarra, [...] "a comfortable house with slab walls and floors and a very large stone and antbed fireplace". Similarly, the Wairuna residence in 1900 was a modest slab house with a corrugated iron roof {{on the site of the}} current residence.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, in {{response}} to a large number of home foreclosures, Minnesota, like many other states at the time, extended the time available for <b>mortgagors</b> to redeem their mortgages from foreclosure.

He was bloody safe he wasn't run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.

6000|$|In vain my wife--with what {{probable}} ulterior intent will, ere long, appear--solemnly warned me, {{that unless}} something were done, and speedily, {{we should be}} burnt to the ground, owing to the holes crumbling through the aforesaid blotchy parts, where the chimney joined the roof. [...] "Wife," [...] said I, [...] "far better that my house should burn down, than that my chimney should be pulled down, though but a few feet. They call it a wax nose; very good; {{not for me to}} tweak the nose of my superior." [...] But at last the man who has a mortgage on the house dropped me a note, reminding me that, if my chimney was allowed to stand in that invalid condition, my policy of insurance would be void. This was a sort of hint not to be neglected. All the world over, the picturesque yields to the pocketesque. The <b>mortgagor</b> cared not, but the mortgagee did.|$|E
6000|$|... § 5. Among active {{states of}} mind, there is, however, one species which merits {{particular}} attention, because {{it forms a}} principal part of the connotation of some important classes of names. I mean volitions, or acts of the will. When we speak of sentient beings by relative names, {{a large portion of}} the connotation of the name usually consists of the actions of those beings; actions past, present, and possible or probable future. Take, for instance, the words Sovereign and Subject. What meaning do these words convey, but that of innumerable actions, done or to be done by the sovereign and the subjects, to or in regard to one another reciprocally? So with the words physician and patient, leader and follower, tutor and pupil. In many cases the words also connote actions which would be done under certain contingencies by persons other than those denoted: as the words <b>mortgagor</b> and mortgagee, obligor and obligee, and many other words expressive of legal relation, which connote what a court of justice would do to enforce the legal obligation if not fulfilled. There are also words which connote actions previously done by persons other than those denoted either by the name itself or by its correlative; as the word brother. From these instances, it may be seen how large a portion of the connotation of names consists of actions. Now what is an action? Not one thing, but a series of two things: the state of mind called a volition, followed by an effect. The volition or intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action. I form the purpose of instantly moving my arm; that is a state of my mind: my arm (not being tied or paralytic) moves in obedience to my purpose; that is a physical fact, consequent on a state of mind. The intention, followed by the fact, or (if we prefer the expression) the fact when preceded and caused by the intention, is called the action of moving my arm.|$|E

40|$|Whilst mortgagees do not owe <b>mortgagors</b> any general duty of care, {{they may}} come under {{specific}} duties of care, {{such as the}} duty to take reasonable steps to obtain the market price when they exercise their power of sale. This is trite law in Singapore. However, it has recently been suggested that mortgagees ought to owe <b>mortgagors</b> a general duty of care whenever there is no conflict of interest between them. This would effectively impose upon mortgagees a duty of care in deciding whether and when to sell the mortgaged asset. This article supports the status quo on grounds of precedent, principle and policy. The case for a general duty of care is flawed. This article argues that no general duty of care ought to be imposed on mortgagees; in particular, mortgagees should owe <b>mortgagors</b> no duty of care in deciding whether and when to sell...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{majority}} judgment, Harms JA held that, {{by the very}} nature of things, a <b>mortgagor,</b> being an owner, could not be an unlawful occupier. Only once the property had been sold in execution and transferred to a purchaser could the possession of the erstwhile <b>mortgagor</b> or owner become unlawful. To call a <b>mortgagor</b> an [...] "unlawful occupier" [...] was not only incongruous but also absurd.|$|E
50|$|Clauses {{not to be}} {{included}} are the forfeiture clause (pactum commissorium) and the summary execution clause (parate executie). The former provides that, if the <b>mortgagor</b> defaults, the mortgagee may keep the property for his own. The latter provides that, if the <b>mortgagor</b> defaults, the mortgagee may take possession of the mortgaged property and arrange for a private sale. However, after <b>mortgagor</b> default, the parties may agree that the mortgagee can take over the mortgaged property or sell it extrajudicially at a fair valuation.|$|E

Using the British Household Panel Study (BHPS), sequence analysis is applied to describe the housing wealth pathways of <b>mortgagors</b> as they strive to achieve outright ownership. The study pays particular attention to the risks that <b>mortgagors</b> are exposed to, and the tactics they employ as mortgage managers. A minority is trapped on the edges of ownership. Multinomial regression model estimates suggest that this new housing precariat {{is more likely to be}} female, younger, experience a relationship breakup, high mortgage-income ratios and have an additional child in the household. For this housing precariat, homeownership is not a safety net; it becomes a liability that exposes <b>mortgagors</b> to new social risks.

Drawing on survey data of Irish <b>mortgagors</b> (n = 433), this paper examines the impacts of mortgage stress upon quality of life and <b>mortgagors</b> 2 ̆ 7 coping strategies to respond to their financial difficulties.

40|$|Throughout Australia, {{regulation}} {{of the power of}} sale is highly inconsistent. In response to the uncertain nature of the mortgagee’s duty at common law, many legislatures have intervened.

This article exposes the extent of the inconsistency and provides a comparative assessment of the various provisions with reference to the policy concerns that underpin legislative intervention.
