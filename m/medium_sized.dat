25|$|In January 2008 the South African {{government}} {{announced that it}} would introduce electricity rationing. On 25 January 2008 the country's deepening power crisis was such that South Africa's (and the world's) largest gold and platinum mining companies were forced to shut down operations. Eskom (the national power supplier) and the government both apologised for the blackouts and in his next-to-last State of the Nation speech Mbeki devoted nearly three pages to the electricity crisis, repeating the apologies of Eskom and the government. Mbeki blamed the power shortages on increased demand caused by years of economic growth and the provision of electricity to black townships that were not connected in the apartheid era. But Mbeki also admitted the government had failed to heed warnings from Eskom (the earliest 10 years previously) that without new power stations Eskom {{might not be able to}} meet demand by 2007. Each year over the preceding 10 years, Eskom had produced annual Integrated Strategic Electricity Plans each setting out scenarios of future investment requirements to cope with projected increased demand, but although projections of average demand growth in the period 2001–2005 had been accurate, no investment had been forthcoming. Mbeki failed to respond to allegations that the government's black empowerment strategy had been a root cause of the problem in that small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> black entrepreneurs, in preference to large corporations, had been awarded coal supply tenders. The policy of giving preference to small suppliers had caused problems in securing reliable supplies of coal, and had also, because small suppliers did not have the capital to invest in rail or conveyor belts infrastructure but used coal trucks, accelerated the wear and tear damage to the roads around the power stations. Warnings highlighted in several of Eskom's annual reports, starting in 2003, had been ignored not only by the Eskom board but also its political masters, Mbeki's government.|$|E

They are quite similar to the Kathiawari horse, another breed from India, having much of the same history and physical features. The main difference between the Marwari and the Kathiawari is their original geographic origin– Marwaris are mainly from the Marwar region while Kathiawaris are from the Kathiawar peninsula. Kathiawaris have inward slanding ears, short back, straight and slender neck and they are more similar to arabians, but they are pure in breed.

Cobb-Douglas production, cost-benefit (C: B) and break-even ratios {{were employed to}} assess resource use efficiency and profitability and financial efficiency of cross and local breed dairy farms. The regression coefficients with respect to concentrate for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed farms are positive and significant at 10 % level. The coefficient of dry fodder for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross breed and local breed are positive and significant at 10 % level. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms, the coefficient for dry fodder is positive and significant at 5 % level and labor is positive and significant at 5 % level {{in the case of}} small size cross breed. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms, the coefficient for miscellaneous are positive and significant at 10 % level. There is difference between the present and optimum levels of inputs. The optimum levels of inputs with respect to concentrate are 30. 21 quintal and 24. 82 quintals for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed farms, respectively. For dry fodder, the optimum is 32. 70 quintals and 12. 84 quintal for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross and local breed farms, respectively. where as, 8. 88 quintals for small size local breed farms. Green fodder, the optimum level is 10. 88 quintals for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed farms. The optimum level for labor is 403. 12 man day for small size cross breed farms. For miscellaneous cost the optimum levels are 228. 54 Birr and 336. 47 Birr for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> local bred farms, respectively. The C:B results indicated that cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 02) than local breed farms (1. 0 : 2. 18). Both medium and small categories of cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 45 and 1. 0 : 2. 74, respectively). In local breed <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms were profitable (1. 0 : 2. 19). The ratio of break-even milk output from the actual milk production for cross breed and local breed cows owning farms needed 13 % of the actual milk {{production and}} 18 % additional milk production over the actual milk production to cover fixed cost, respectively. Cross breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms needed 8 % and 11 % milk output and local breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> farms requires additional 31 % and 14 % over the actual milk production. In conclusion, dairy cow's owner should be advised to use the optimum levels inputs and replace their indigenous cow with cross breed cow.
