5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
500|$|Mahmoud Makki Abutaki was a 22-year-old {{college student}} majoring in engineering, {{when he died}} on 17February after being {{shot in the back}} by police. Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot from his chest and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was in the morgue while holding his brothers' hands, {{recalled}} the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: [...] "He said, 'This is <b>my</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>to</b> have a say, so that maybe our country will do something for us.' My country did do something; it killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Vickers {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first career win {{in front of the}} crowd, earning $228,850 for the victory. Earnhardt was quick to forgive him for the last-lap accident: [...] "He didn't wreck anyone on purpose. He was trying to push the 48. I don't think he thought, 'Oh, here's <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> knock them both out.' He just got excited trying to push the 48." [...] Johnson was less sanguine: [...] "We had a great chance to make up some points and got crashed by a teammate... I was real patient until the white flag was up. I got a good run inside the 8 and got a lot of help from behind — too much help... Knowing the situation we're all in, I would hope someone would be a little more patient." [...] Johnson's crew chief, Chad Knaus, was annoyed: [...] "I just don't think [...] has the talent to understand what he has underneath him." ...|$|E
60|$|MILLIKEN.--Give me <b>my</b> second <b>chance,</b> mother, <b>to</b> be happy. You {{have had}} {{yourself}} two chances.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll take <b>my</b> <b>chance.</b> Thanks <b>to</b> Merapi's lord! A boon, O Prince, {{since you}} will not suffer that other name which comes easiest to the lips of one to whom the Present and the Future are {{sometimes}} much alike." ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>my</b> only <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> escape detection. If {{the fellow}} turned, I was lost; nor could I have {{dropped to the}} floor undetected, since he was no nearly below me that I would have struck him had I done so.|$|R
500|$|The club began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a win. Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2–1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers, and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone. They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th-minute goal from midfielder Andy King. Another home defeat, this time to Sheffield United followed, which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad, but a third consecutive 1–0 defeat at Swansea City, during which Lowry was sent off, signalled the end of Paul Sturrock's second spell as manager. Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice. [...] "It's a sad day, but obviously a happy day for me because I'm getting <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be a manager in the league," [...] said the former striker. [...] "He's a great friend of mine. The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other." [...] His first match was a 2–0 defeat at Preston North End, but he took positives from the performance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, mother, I {{will give}} myself up, and take <b>my</b> <b>chance.</b> <b>To</b> fly {{would be to}} give them reason to believe me guilty." ...|$|E
60|$|For all I could see, he {{appeared}} to be a calm and quiet man, intense beneath the surface, with an air of dignity under insult. <b>My</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> observe Wright was lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something must be done, {{and since}} you can't spare anybody {{to go to the}} poor fellow's {{assistance}} I'm ready <b>to</b> take <b>my</b> <b>chances</b> while trying <b>to</b> help him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] he said, with a deprecatory look; [...] "the truth is, {{my mind is}} apt {{to wander}} a bit in such a scene, and <b>my</b> eyes <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> light at the moment you spoke on that {{hogshead}} over there. How many emigrants, did you say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I!’ she cried, and laughed; ‘they are my destiny. <b>My</b> only <b>chance</b> was <b>to</b> die of a consumption; now I {{must die}} in a garret.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ever sence I've been here," [...] said Mose, with {{singular}} emotion, [...] "I've {{looked away}} at that range and I've been waiting <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{see what that}} cañon is like. There runs my trail--good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now these men," [...] {{thought the}} Woggle-Bug, [...] "must get money for {{shoveling}} all that earth, else they wouldn't do it. Here is <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the charming vision of {{beauty in the}} shop window!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brook, however, had no ear {{for this}} plea. [...] "And when I, coming here too and {{thinking}} only of <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> 'meet' you, do my very sweetest to catch your eye, you're entirely given up--!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> last <b>chance</b> was <b>to</b> {{write to}} Rachel. My servant took {{a letter to}} her the next day, with strict {{instructions}} to wait for an answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I!" [...] she cried, and laughed; [...] "they are my destiny. <b>My</b> only <b>chance</b> was <b>to</b> die of consumption; now I {{must die}} in a garret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lance," [...] {{she said}} passionately, [...] "can't you understand? It's <b>my</b> one <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> creep {{back to where}} I was before you came my way--and Potter's kind to me. At least, I can be {{straight}} with him, and I pray I'll never see your face, or hear your name again. Now go--go--I can't bear any more from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{watching}} <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{get into the}} ranch house unobserved," [...] continued the government official. [...] "That shot rather floored me. But I am going to get in, some way," [...] he added with determination.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, I'll do it. And {{give me that}} bundle. I'll smuggle it {{into the}} school somehow and watch <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> leave it in old Lemon's room." [...] Evidently the son of Dan Baxter was as bold as his father had ever been before him.|$|E
6000|$|MAN. Noble!--heroic! But I'm not saved yet. This {{particular}} rush {{will soon}} pass through; but the pursuit {{will go on}} all night by fits and starts. I must take <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get off during a quiet interval. You don't mind my waiting just a minute or two, do you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In truth, my lord, I {{know not}} {{how to set}} about the task, {{and it seems to}} me that <b>my</b> only <b>chance</b> is <b>to</b> run against one of her serving-men in the street." ...|$|R
50|$|In June 2016, {{one month}} after {{releasing}} his new EP, Somewhere Over <b>My</b> Head, <b>Chance</b> returned <b>to</b> Asia for a short promo tour starting in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Penang (Malaysia), and Manila, Philippines.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of what, Excellency?" [...] I asked politely, {{raising my}} eyes from <b>my</b> manuscript. They <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> meet the glance of Madonna Paola. It was riveted upon me, and its {{expression}} was one I could not understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it is bad. He do dis 'cause he hate you. Somehow you has anger him. He say he will tame you. He try to tame me," [...] {{said the}} negro, with sudden and {{tremendous}} ferocity, [...] "an' him t'ink he do it! But I only waits <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> kill him.|$|E
6000|$|My eyes cloud up for rain; {{my mouth}} [...] Will take to twitchin' roun' the corners; I pity mothers, tu, down South, [...] For all they sot among the scorners: I'd sooner take <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> stan' [...] At Jedgment where your meanest slave is, [...] 150 Than at God's bar hol' up a han' [...] Ez drippin' red ez yourn, Jeff Davis! ...|$|E
6000|$|One faltering {{word from}} pal to pal, But it found {{the heart of}} the Corporal. He had sprung to the sand, he had lent him a hand, [...] 'Up, mate! They'll be 'ere in a minute; Off with you! No palaver! Go! I'll bide be'ind and run this show. Promotion has been cursed slow, [...] And this is <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just this. Herbert Bronson {{came to town}} this {{afternoon}} and is leaving on the 10.30 train to-night. He's sent me word {{to meet him at}} his hotel this evening and talk over a mining deal I've been trying to pull off. I simply must go. It's <b>my</b> one <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> corral Bronson. If I lose him it'll be all up, and I'll be thousands out of pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|BY-ENDS. Never, never! The {{worst that}} ever I did {{to give them}} an {{occasion}} to give me this name was, that I had always the luck to jump in my judgment with the present way of the times, whatever it was, and <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> was <b>to</b> get thereby; but if things are thus cast upon me, let me count them a blessing; but let not the malicious load me therefore with reproach.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to the hotel, {{they begin}} to attack {{each other in the}} room. Steve grabs Vickie atop the bed, almost ripping her dress off. Suddenly excited, Steve tries to have sex with her, but can't undo his trouser zip. Vickie responds, [...] "My god, <b>my</b> one <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be raped, and you can't get your bloody {{trousers}} off." [...] The two collapse laughing and their relationship blossoms over the remainder of the holiday.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will be me very soon," [...] {{returned}} the runner, [...] "and you can try. I did try--twice. I was caught both times and beat near to death. But I did not die! I learn wisdom; and now I submit and wait <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> kill him. If you is wise you begin {{at once to}} submit and wait too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{can help}} it, you will do none of them. I know it well enough. I hope and believe that {{there will never be}} a shadow between us while we live. But, Morris, I take you, risks and all, because it has been <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> love you and nobody else. Otherwise, I should think twice; but love doesn't stop at risks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone at last-- I {{was afraid}} he would stay here all night!" [...] muttered the man. [...] "Now is <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get away. I didn't think they'd get here to-night. I should have gotten that key made sooner." [...] And opening the door noiselessly, he came out into the hallway. He wore a thin {{overcoat}} and a slouch hat, and a heavy beard covered his face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was, it was, it was!' cried Elsa, thumping {{the pillow}} malignantly. 'I {{believe he did}} it on purpose, {{so that he could}} read me his horrid poetry without <b>my</b> having a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> escape. I believe that's the only way he can get people to listen to it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you mean," [...] Engleton said, [...] "will I {{purchase}} my liberty {{by letting}} you two blackguards off free, {{for this and}} for your dirty card-sharping, I say no! I will take <b>my</b> <b>chances</b> of life <b>to</b> the last second. Afterwards I shall know that I am revenged. Men don't go happily through life with the little black devil sitting on their shoulders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite fair, I think. I did {{not come}} clandestinely. I am not ashamed of what I am doing,--or of what I am going to do. I may be ashamed of this,--that I should feel <b>my</b> <b>chance</b> of success <b>to</b> be so small. When I was here before I asked you to--allow me to love you. I now ask you again." ...|$|R
