Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} <b>microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, isomorphous, heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E

25|$|<b>Microelectromechanical</b> system (MEMS) {{oscillators}} are timing {{devices that}} generate highly stable reference frequencies, which can measure time. These reference frequencies {{may be used}} to sequence electronic systems, manage data transfer, define radio frequencies, and measure elapsed time. The core technologies used in MEMS oscillators have been in development since the mid-1960s, but have only been sufficiently advanced for commercial applications since 2006. MEMS oscillators incorporate MEMS resonators, which are <b>microelectromechanical</b> structures that define stable frequencies. MEMS clock generators are MEMS timing devices with multiple outputs for systems that need more than a single reference frequency. MEMS oscillators are a valid alternative to older, more established quartz crystal oscillators, offering better resilience against vibration and mechanical shock, and reliability with respect to temperature variation.|$|E

Today, SDI is a large manufacturer of MEMS gyroscopes.|$|E
25|$|Fabrication of nano-channels is {{categorized}} into top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down {{methods are}} the conventional processes utilized in the IC industry and <b>Microelectromechanical</b> systems research. It begins with photolithography on a bulk silicon wafer. Bottom-up methods, in contrast, starts with atoms or molecules with intrinsic nano-scaled dimension. By organize and combine these building blocks together, it {{is able to}} form a nanostructures as small as only a few nanometers.|$|E

Flexible electronics were first developed in 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 and 1998 Maclay et al. {{published}} the first models of a <b>microelectromechanical</b> system (MEMS) with Casimir forces. While not exploiting the Casimir force for useful work, the papers drew {{attention from the}} MEMS community due to the revelation that Casimir effect needs to {{be considered as a}} vital factor in the future design of MEMS. In particular, Casimir effect might be the critical factor in the stiction failure of MEMS.|$|E
25|$|The term {{mechatronics}} {{is typically}} {{used to refer}} to macroscopic systems but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already, such small devices, known as <b>Microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell airbags when to deploy, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve optical communication.|$|E
25|$|Microlithography and {{nanolithography}} refer {{specifically to}} lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating <b>Microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E
25|$|Small {{compasses}} {{found in}} clocks, mobile phones, and other electronic devices are solid-state <b>microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS) compasses, usually {{built out of}} two or three magnetic field sensors that provide data for a microprocessor. Often, the device is a discrete component which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation. This signal is interpreted by a controller or microprocessor and either used internally, or sent to a display unit. The sensor uses highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are {{resonant}} cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In {{addition to their}} small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads {{to a number of}} advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a <b>microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Wankel engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs. The <b>Microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS) Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, has previously undertaken research towards the development of Wankel engines of down to 1mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1cc. Materials include silicon and motive power includes compressed air. The goal of such research was to eventually develop an internal combustion engine {{with the ability to}} deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power; with the engine itself serving as the rotor of the generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor itself. Development of the miniature Wankel engine stopped at UC Berkeley {{at the end of the}} DARPA contract. Miniature Wankel engines struggled to maintain compression due to sealing problems, similar to problems observed in the large scale versions. In addition, miniature engines suffer from an adverse surface to volume ratio causing excess heat losses; the relatively large surface area of the combustion chamber walls transfers away what little heat is generated in the small combustion volume resulting in quenching and low efficiency.|$|E
25|$|SAMs are an {{inexpensive}} and versatile surface coating for applications including control of wetting and adhesion, chemical resistance, bio compatibility, sensitization, and molecular recognition for sensors and nano fabrication. Areas of application for SAMs include biology, electrochemistry and electronics, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and <b>microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS), and everyday household goods. SAMs {{can serve as}} models for studying membrane properties of cells and organelles and cell attachment on surfaces. SAMs {{can also be used}} to modify the surface properties of electrodes for electrochemistry, general electronics, and various NEMS and MEMS. For example, the properties of SAMs can be used to control electron transfer in electrochemistry. They can serve to protect metals from harsh chemicals and etchants. SAMs can also reduce sticking of NEMS and MEMS components in humid environments. In the same way, SAMs can alter the properties of glass. A common household product, Rain-X, utilizes SAMs to create a hydrophobic monolayer on car windshields to keep them clear of rain. Another application is an anti-adhesion coating on nanoimprint lithography (NIL) tools and stamps. One can also coat injection molding tools for polymer replication with a Perfluordecyltrichlorosilane SAM.|$|E

500|$|The {{theory of}} {{mechanical}} filters was first applied {{to improving the}} mechanical parts of phonographs in the 1920s. [...] By the 1950s mechanical filters were being manufactured as self-contained components for applications in radio transmitters and high-end receivers. [...] The high [...] "quality factor", Q, that mechanical resonators can attain, far {{higher than that of}} an all-electrical LC circuit, made possible the construction of mechanical filters with excellent selectivity. Good selectivity, being important in radio receivers, made such filters highly attractive. [...] Contemporary researchers are working on <b>microelectromechanical</b> filters, the mechanical devices corresponding to electronic integrated circuits.|$|E
500|$|A new {{technology}} emerging in mechanical filtering is <b>microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMS). [...] MEMS {{are very small}} micromachines with component sizes measured in micrometres (μm), but not as small as nanomachines. [...] These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. [...] These systems are mostly fabricated from silicon (Si), silicon nitride (Si3N4), or polymers. A common component used for radio frequency filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the cantilever resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, photolithography and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, <b>microelectromechanical</b> methods can be used as described below.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{piezoelectric}} {{materials to}} harvest power has already become popular. Piezoelectric materials {{have the ability}} to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge. Piezo elements are being embedded in walkways to recover the [...] "people energy" [...] of footsteps. They can also be embedded in shoes to recover [...] "walking energy". Researchers at MIT developed the first micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvester using thin film PZT in 2005. Arman Hajati and Sang-Gook Kim invented the Ultra Wide-Bandwidth micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvesting device by exploiting the nonlinear stiffness of a doubly clamped <b>microelectromechanical</b> systems (MEMSs) resonator. The stretching strain in a doubly clamped beam shows a nonlinear stiffness, which provides a passive feedback and results in amplitude-stiffened Duffing mode resonance. [...] Typically, piezoelectric cantilevers are adopted for the above-mentioned energy harvesting system. [...] One drawback is that the piezoelectric cantilever has gradient strain distribution, i.e., the piezoelectric transducer is not fully utilized. [...] To address this issue, triangle shaped and L-shaped cantilever are proposed for uniform strain distribution.|$|E
