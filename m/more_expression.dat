In 1989, he played a major part in {{creating}} a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.|$|E
500|$|According to Harrison's later recollection, Spector {{suggested}} that [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp" [...] might attract a few cover versions if {{he changed the}} lyrics. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison acknowledges that the song was [...] "a piece of personal indulgence", but [...] "those words were written because that's what it was" [...] – a tribute to Frank Crisp. A number of Crisp's homilies directly inspired other Harrison songs {{during the first half}} of the 1970s, such as [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] and [...] "The Answer's at the End". Harrison went on to identify philosophically with Crisp, of whom he writes elsewhere in I, Me, Mine: [...] "Sir Frank helped my awareness; whatever it was I felt became stronger, or found <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> by moving into that house, because everything stepped up or was heightened." [...] Leng considers that the song, along with [...] "All Things Must Pass", predicts Harrison's eventual [...] "retreat into an internal musical dialogue, set amid the woods and gardens of Friar Park", a change of perspective marked by his 1979 eponymous solo album.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} Kevin Malone {{playing the}} drums in a band, {{which had been}} an idea circulated since the first season, when allusions to him being in a Steve Miller tribute band were written; the scenes {{had to be removed}} from the series due to issues negotiating with the singer. The crew later decided to have Kevin be in a Police tribute band called Scrantonicity because he [...] "talks so low, and has very little expression, and there is no band that sings higher and with <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> than the Police." [...] While Kevin was always intended to be the band's lead singer, executive producer Greg Daniels approached Baumgartner about possibly playing an instrument, but the actor replied he could not play anything. Daniels and Baumgartner then discussed instruments that would be [...] "funny" [...] to play and brought up harmonicas, saxophones, and drums. They ultimately decided on the latter because they deemed a [...] "drumming lead singer [...] be the funniest choice," [...] regardless {{of the fact that the}} actor had [...] "absolutely no drumming experience, and it's a difficult instrument." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{popularity}} led J.C. Deagan, Inc. in 1927 to ask its Chief Tuner, Henry Schluter, {{to develop}} a similar instrument. [...] However, Schluter didn't just copy the Leedy design, he introduced several significant improvements: making the bars from aluminium instead of steel for a more [...] "mellow" [...] basic tone; adjustments to the dimensions and tuning of the bars to eliminate the dissonant harmonics in the Leedy design (further mellowing the tone); {{and the introduction of}} a foot-controlled damper bar so musicians can play it with <b>more</b> <b>expression.</b> [...] Schluter's design was more popular than the Leedy design, and has become the template for all instruments now called vibraphone.|$|E
2500|$|Crosby pursued Polly, and in May 1921, {{when she}} would not respond to his ardor, Crosby {{threatened}} suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly's husband {{was in and out}} of sanitariums several times, fighting alcoholism. Crosby pestered Polly to tell her husband of their affair and to divorce him. In May, she revealed her adultery to Dick and suggested a separation, and he offered no resistance. Polly's mother insisted that she stop seeing Crosby for six months to avoid complete rejection by her society peers, a condition she agreed to, and she left Boston for New York. Divorce was [...] "unheard of...even among Boston Episcopalians." [...] Peabody's parents were outraged that she would ask for a divorce and at her affair with Crosby. Dick's father Jacob Peabody even visited Harry's father, Stephen Crosby, on January 4, 1922 to discuss the situation, but Harry's father would not talk to him; despite his disapproval of Harry's irregular behavior, he loved his son. Stephen Crosby at first attempted to dissuade Harry from marrying Polly, and even bought him the Stutz he'd been asking for, but Harry would not be persuaded to change his mind. For her part, Polly's former friends pilloried her as an adulteress, leaving Polly stunned by the quick turn-about in their attitude towards her. Polly later described Harry's character as: [...] "He seemed to be <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> and mood, than man," [...] she wrote, [...] "yet he was the most vivid personality I've ever known, electric with rebellion." ...|$|E
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Psychiatry, Psychology and Law on 23 / 9 / 2013 available online: [URL] ecological validity is a common limitation in deception studies. The present study investigated the real life, high stake context of public appeals for help with missing or murdered relatives. Behaviours which discriminated between honest and deceptive appeals included some previously identified in research on high stakes lies (deceptive appeals contained more equivocal language, gaze aversion, head shaking, and speech errors), {{and a number of}} previously unidentified behaviours (honest appeals contained more references to norms of emotion/behaviour, <b>more</b> <b>expressions</b> of hope of finding the missing relative alive, <b>more</b> <b>expressions</b> of positive emotion towards the relative, <b>more</b> <b>expressions</b> of concern/pain, and an avoidance of brutal language). Case by case analyses yielded 78 % correct classifications. Implications are discussed with reference to the importance of using ecologically valid data in deception studies, the context specific nature of some deceptive behaviours, and social interactionist, and individual behavioural profile, accounts of cues to deception...|$|R
30|$|We found {{significant}} correlations between perceiving <b>more</b> <b>expressions</b> of anger in others {{and having the}} belief that people might be criticizing or judging negatively (Crit.Av.) and between reporting greater distrust of other people’s intentions and real motives (Distrust) and presenting fewer card turns in Rorschach (CT), which {{is associated with a}} lower expression of creativity, flexibility, and even challenge. Integrating this information, we hypothesized that subjects who perceive <b>more</b> <b>expressions</b> of anger in people tend to attribute unreal critical judgments to them and then tend to avoid such criticism, moving away from contact or even presenting less autonomous behaviour to avoid conflict, resulting in distressing feelings of isolation and loneliness.|$|R

2500|$|Juri's {{personality}} {{was proposed}} by Ono to {{be a strong}} character, and while laughing compared it to that of a protester. She was originally designed to be a nice person who happens to be consorting with bad characters, but Ono went against this, stating [...] "she can't be a good girl. Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick." [...] Her quotes were designed {{to have a lot of}} double entendres, with writer Kawasaki, citing one quote that while it appears as a compliment of their physique, her opponent may take offense to it. Initially, she was designed to be always smiling, similar to other female characters according to developer Kamei. However, it did not fit, resulting in the team working on other faces, some he describes as [...] "scary." [...] The team eventually settled on a [...] "cool-headed" [...] look. Kamei commented that one of his favourite expressions of Juri's is the one she makes when she appears to be having fun; he adds that this look made him feel like the animators had finally began to understand the character. In designing her eyes, Kamei wanted her eyes to have <b>more</b> <b>expression</b> to them than other characters, commenting that the team [...] "wanted her to tell a story with her eyes." [...] Because of the anger from Korean fans over the lack of a Korean character in Street Fighter, the team decided to make her a strong character. Juri is said to have a warlike and provocative character and enjoys playing around with her opponent while beating them. She has also been described in a similar fashion, including [...] "sex-crazed" [...] and [...] "sultry." [...] Developer Tamamura describes her as a [...] "pleasure-seeker" [...] and a [...] "character who would enjoy fighting." ...|$|E
