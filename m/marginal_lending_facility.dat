40|$|The {{volatility}} {{patterns of}} overnight interest rates differ across industrial countries {{in ways that}} existing models, designed to replicate {{the features of the}} U.

This paper presents an equilibrium model of the overnight interbank market that matches these different patterns by incorporating differences in policy execution by the world's main central banks, including differences in central banks' management of <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>facilities</b> in response to shocks. Our model is consistent with central banks' observed practice of rationing access to marginal facilities when the objective of stabilizing short-term interest rates conflicts with another high-frequency objective, such as the targeting of exchange rates.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the art of}} central banking as practised by the European Central Bank (ECB) {{through the prism of}} Goodfriend?s [2009] determination of the three policies that fall within the remit of a central bank : monetary policy, which consists in varying the size of the balance sheet, credit policy, which consists in modifying the credit structure, and interest rate policy, which consists in adjusting the interest rates of the <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> and deposit <b>facilities.</b> The theoretical literature emphasises the existence of a principle of separation between the first policy, which seeks to ensure monetary stability and the other two policies, which are intended to ensure financial stability through the smooth functioning of the interbank money market. This paper shows in particular that a central bank not only has the capacity but indeed must strive to separate the conduct of its monetary policy, which must seek to ensure medium and long-term price stability, from that of its credit policy, which is driven by short-term imperatives and consists in supplying the banking system with liquidity in the event of temporary money demand shocks. During {{the first part of the}} crisis, the ECB acted in accordance with the principle of separation. However, it became increasingly difficult to apply as interest rates approached the zero-lower-bound. In effect, the unconventional measures adopted by the ECB created interference between its monetary policy, its credit policy and its interest rate policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a unique}} data set, I study whether {{structural}} bank characteristics {{can help to}} explain a bank's propensity to take recourse to the ECB's <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> (MLF). My key finding is that besides structural measures capturing a bank's business model, indicators for its liquidity risk management have a highly significant predictive power for a bank's access to the lender-of-the-last-resort (LLR) facility. A bank with volatile reserve holdings, a lower average reserve fulfillment and a more aggressive bidding behavior in the main refinancing operations, is {{significantly more likely to}} revert to the MLF. These results suggest that the option value of having access to the ECB's LLR varies significantly across banks. Thus (i) a uniform Marginal Lending rate undermines market efficiency and (ii) structural bank characteristics could be used to adequately adjust the pricing of the MLF to bank specific structural liquidity risks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{stress in}} the unsecured overnight interbank market in the euro area {{over the course of}} the financial and sovereign debt crisis in Europe. We find that stress i) leads some banks to borrow in the market at rates that are higher than the rate of the <b>marginal</b> <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> of the ECB, ii) leads to less cross-border transactions and contributes to the fragmentation of the euro area money market. A triple-difference estimate shows that the borrowing of banks in the periphery from banks in the core almost disappears in the second half of 2011. Domestic borrowing, however, replaces the loss of cross-border borrowing. Our findings document the severe malfunctioning of the market for liquidity caused by asymmetric information problems in crisis times. We exploit euro area payments data to construct a novel dataset of interbank lending and borrowing. We verify the validity of our approach using the post-trading structure MID, maintained at Banco de Espa 1 a. Based on our results, we conclude that MID is a very high quality source of Spanish interbank market data for research and policy purposes...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Treasury {{announced}} in August 2005 {{that it is}} exploring whether to provide a backstop securities <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> for U. S. Treasury securities. This paper examines the conceptual basis for such a facility by analogizing the market for borrowing and lending Treasury securities with the market for borrowing and lending money prior to {{the founding of the}} Federal Reserve System in 1914. An inelastic supply of currency in the nineteenth century led to periodic suspensions of convertibility of bank deposits; Congress authorized a system of Federal Reserve Banks to address the problem. A similarly inelastic supply of Treasury securities has led to several recent episodes of chronic settlement fails. A backstop <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> would mitigate the fails problem by allowing the Treasury to act as a lender of last resort of Treasury securities during periods of unusual market stress. Government securities...|$|R
50|$|Attempting {{to address}} this problem, de facto President Alejandro Lanusse {{established}} the National Housing Fund (FONAVI) in 1972. An amalgam of long-standing national housing programs and <b>lending</b> <b>facilities</b> previously managed by the National Mortgage Bank, the FONAVI helped coordinate slum clearance efforts and, since then, has put up over 25,000 housing units a year (both single-family and multi-family types).|$|R
5000|$|The {{collateral}} for the Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> (TSLF) {{also has}} been expanded; eligible collateral will now include all investment-grade debt securities. Previously, only Treasury securities, agency securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities could be pledged. [...] This {{was one of many}} emergency lending programs of the Federal Reserve during the Financial crisis of 2008-2009.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, some economists, {{including}} John Geanakoplos, strongly {{argue that}} the Federal Reserve should monitor and regulate the system-wide leverage level in the economy, limiting leverage in good times and encouraging higher levels of leverage in bad times, by extending <b>lending</b> <b>facilities.</b> Moreover, {{it is more important}} to restrict leverage in ebullient times to prevent the crash from happening in the first place.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} of credit analysis {{is to look}} at both the borrower and the <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> being proposed and to assign a risk rating.

50|$|The Term Securities <b>Lending</b> <b>Facility</b> (TSLF) is a 28-day {{facility}} {{managed by}} the United States Federal Reserve that offers Treasury general collateral (GC) (i.e., Treasury bills, notes, bonds and inflation-indexed securities) to the primary dealers in exchange for other program-eligible collateral. It is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.|$|R

While lowering the rate on the <b>lending</b> <b>facility</b> has, taken for itself, an expansionary effect, lowering the rate on the deposit facility has a contractionary effect. This result has interesting implications for monetary policy implementation at the zero lower bound...|$|R
