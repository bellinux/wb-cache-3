5|$|Zito {{replaced}} {{his agent}} Arn Tellem with Scott Boras in July 2006. Zito was {{a focal point}} of the 2006 trade deadline, and was widely rumored to be headed to the Mets in a potential deal for prospect Lastings Milledge. Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that if the Mets were unwilling to trade Milledge, the Athletics <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Aaron Heilman and John Maine. However, Athletics' general manager Billy Beane decided to keep Zito {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} saw the {{departure}} of Hartwell {{and the addition of}} Cynthia Bailey and Phaedra Parks. The main lineup remained unchanged during the fourth season, although Marlo Hampton joined as a friend of the housewives. Whitfield exited the series upon the conclusion of the fourth season, and was replaced by Porsha Williams and Kenya Moore in the fifth season. Zolciak departed from the program {{in the middle of the}} fifth season. The departure of Zolciak made Leakes the only remaining original cast member as of season six; however, Zolciak commented that she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> returning to the series. In the seventh season, Williams became a friend of the housewives, alongside new cast member Demetria McKinney, while Claudia Jordan was introduced as a main housewife.|$|E

5000|$|Analysis of MMPs (matched {{molecular}} pair) can be {{very useful}} for understanding the mechanism of action. A medicinal chemist <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> particularly <b>in</b> [...] "activity cliff". Activity cliff is a minor structural modification, which changes the target activity significantly.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2006 Wisconsin–Ohio State hockey game (see below), {{newspaper}} reports said the Wisconsin football team <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> moving a non-conference road game to Lambeau Field.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} {{weight of}} provision of pensions on a government's budget is often heavy {{and is the}} reason for political debates about the retirement age. The state <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a later retirement age for economic reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} drafts {{were intended}} to be an adult novel, but after several rejections Scholastic said they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Mortal Engines as a children's story. In the refactoring the story was simplified, removing several characters and much content Reeve thought would not be interesting to children (city politics).|$|E

30|$|One <b>might</b> also <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{effects of}} elastic {{structures}} on coseismic stress change.

25|$|After being {{consulted}} by her superiors at the CIA {{about whom}} {{to send on}} the mission, Valerie E. Wilson, according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, suggested that they ask Ambassador Wilson, her husband, whom she had married in 1998, {{whether or not he}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> making such a trip.|$|E
25|$|Suzuki {{mentioned}} to So-on {{during this period}} that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> going to America to teach Zen Buddhism. So-on was adamantly opposed to the idea. Suzuki realized that his teacher felt very close to him {{and that he would}} take such a departure as an insult. He did not mention it to him again.|$|E
25|$|Shukichi's sister, Aunt Masa (Haruko Sugimura), convinces {{him that}} {{it is high time}} his {{daughter}} got married. Noriko is friendly with her father’s assistant, Hattori (Jun Usami), and Aunt Masa suggests that her brother ask Noriko if she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Hattori. When he does bring up the subject, however, Noriko laughs: Hattori has been engaged to another young woman for quite some time.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the data}} in the above table, one <b>might</b> also <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> making the desoxy-mazindol analog. The {{synthesis}} for this is facile.

60|$|For on {{the night}} that he {{returned}} and found Mara conversing with a stranger, the suspicion arose in his mind that somehow Mara <b>might</b> <b>be</b> particularly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> him, and instead of asking her, which anybody might consider the most feasible step in the case, he asked Sally Kittridge.|$|R
60|$|Rendered into intelligible English, this {{resolution}} pledged {{him to hold}} no communication with Sir Patrick--until he had first tested his success in negotiating with other persons, who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> equally <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> getting possession of the correspondence, and more liberal in giving hush-money to the thief who had stolen it.|$|R
25|$|Various 2006 {{estimates}} {{showed that}} Russia had above 200,000 {{members of the}} FSB, or one FSB employee for every 700 citizens of Russia (the exact number of the overall FSB staff is classified). The Russian Armed Forces General Staff, {{as well as its}} subordinate structures, such as the Russian Strategic Missile Troops headquarters, are not submitted to the Federal Security Service, but the FSB <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> monitoring such structures, as they intrinsically involve state secrets and various degrees of admittance to them. The Law on Federal Security Service which defines its functions and establishes its structure does not involve such tasks as managing strategic branches of national industry, controlling political groups, or infiltrating the federal government.|$|E
25|$|A bank <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{minimizing}} {{the amount of}} money it borrows overnight from a central bank. Interbank transfers must be communicated and arranged through automation by a set time each business day. The failure of any vital communication could cost the bank large sums in interest charged by the central bank. A BAM solution would be programmed to become aware of each message and await confirmation. Failure to receive confirmation within a reasonable amount of time would be grounds for the BAM solution to raise an alarm that would set in motion manual intervention to investigate the cause of the delay and to push the problem toward resolution before it becomes costly.|$|E
25|$|The new English {{language}} venture faced considerable {{regulatory and}} commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There {{were hundreds of}} millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{as well as}} {{the musical}} were criticized by some {{religious}} groups. A New York Times review said, [...] "When the stage production opened in October, 1971, it was criticized not only by some Jews as anti-Semitic, but also by some Catholics and Protestants as blasphemous in its portrayal of Jesus as a young man who <b>might</b> even <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> sex." ...|$|R

25|$|The main Ultra Energy team {{immediately}} re-formed as Ballard Research, {{taking over}} offices {{directly across the}} street from the Ultra ones. Ballard started calling old contacts in the oil industry, looking for companies that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> diversifying their energy holdings. Shell was interested and kept the company afloat for a time, but dropped their interest when one of the minority shareholders held out. In mid-1981, Amoco decided to take over the rechargeable side of the company, and paid off most of the company's local debts. Now solvent, the company quickly started looking for applications for their technology, and won contracts with the Canadian Forces to further develop their single-use long-life battery. This led to a successful production line producing thousands of cells for the U.S. and Canadian militaries.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994, CDNow {{launched}} its BuyWeb program. CDNow {{had the idea}} that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website, but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist's music page.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} websites {{are based}} on building virtual communities that allow consumers to express their needs, wants and values, online. Social media marketing then connects these consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants, and values. Through social networking sites, companies can {{keep in touch with}} individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of loyalty into followers and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites, products can reach a very narrow target audience. Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in.</b> Through the use of new semantic analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content shared by people and questions posted online. An understanding of buying signals can help sales people target relevant prospects and marketers run micro-targeted campaigns.|$|E
50|$|Curtis Hanson {{got to know}} Roger Corman {{while doing}} re-writes on The Dunwich Horror (1970). When that film was finished, Hanson told Corman he wanted to direct a film he had written and Corman said he would <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a {{motorcycle}} movie, a women in prison movie or a nurses movie. Hanson was unenthusiastic, so Corman then said he <b>might</b> also <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> a modern horror film.|$|R

25|$|In 2016, Frost and his explosive, up-tempo offense led the Knights to a 6–7 record. UCF {{began the}} Frost era with a 38-0 shutout win over FCS {{opponent}} South Carolina State. After losing its next two to Big Ten opponents #5 Michigan in a rout and Maryland in double overtime, the Knights defeated FIU and East Carolina. Central Florida then suffered a close 26-25 loss {{due to a}} late field goal to Temple on October 15. The Knights rebounded the following week to defeat UConn by a score of 24-16. UCF suffered a defeat on October 29 to Houston, then responded with wins over Tulane and Cincinnati, gaining bowl eligibility. Frost's squad concluded the regular season with losses to Tulsa and archrival South Florida. The Knights lost to Arkansas State in the 2016 Cure Bowl by a score of 31-13. After the 2016 season, Oregon fired head coach Mark Helfrich, under whom Frost served as offensive coordinator from 2013-2015. Amidst rumors that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the Ducks opening, Frost announced he {{was not interested in}} Oregon and that he would return as UCF's head coach in 2017. Ironically, the position eventually went to UCF's rival coach, South Florida head coach Willie Taggart.|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{capitalize}} on the parody's success, Yankovic attempted to get a record contract. He and Schwartz quickly began duplicating the original [...] "Another One Rides the Bus" [...] recording on cassettes, and the two then sent them to anyone who <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the spoof. Schwartz later joked, [...] "Some were cleverly targeted to record executives, others were randomly addressed. I think one went to Santa Claus, [...] the North Pole." ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 April 2017, the NHL {{announced}} that it would not participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics, stating that while it was [...] "open to hearing from any of the other parties who might have an interest in the issue (as to reasons the Board of Governors <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> re-evaluating their strongly held views on the subject", the NHLPA [...] "confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs", and that it would not schedule a break for the Olympics in the 2017-18 season.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{narrative}} {{focuses on}} the chronological order of history. It is event driven and tends to center upon individuals, action, and intention. For example, {{in regard to the}} French Revolution, a historian who works with the traditional narrative <b>might</b> <b>be</b> more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the revolution as a single entity (one revolution), centre it in Paris, and rely heavily upon major figures such as Maximilien Robespierre.|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} we examined if it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{possible that a}} client accomplishes an ad-hoc analysis of an existing building {{with the intention of}} prospective revitalization. The aim is to give a client who incidentally faces a building the possibility to run an in situ usability simulation. To accomplish this we recommend Location Based Services that can be accessed by common remote sensing devices. These devices should automatically connect to server-based applications, which compare the requirements of the client with the existing building and run remote simulations on concrete further utilization. The newly generated information will then be passed back to the clientsi device. In the paper we address a scenario of a prospective client who visits a city where he hits on an unused building he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in.</b> The client wishes to gain immediate and accurate information if the building is able to meet his demands regarding the space needed for his company. Different techniques investigated, their assets and drawbacks will be described that could accomplish suchlike tasks...|$|R
