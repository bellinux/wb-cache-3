Two substantial aspects {{are at the center of}} Marx´s analysis: (a) the <b>monetary</b> <b>determination</b> of the social process of production and circulation of capital, i. e. the fact that money-capital is a social relation determining the interaction of agents in the monetary production economy alias capitalism; and (b) the notion of the economic circuit as the key economic category for the understanding of the monetary logic of the principle of effective demand. These aspects are also at the center of Keynes´s and Kalecki´s foundation of the theory of the monetary production economy.

40|$|A {{new theory}} of price {{determination}} {{suggests that if}} primary surpluses are independent {{of the level of}} debt, the price level has to ‘jump’ to assure fiscal solvency. In this regime (which we call fiscal dominant), monetary policy has to work through seignorage to control the price level. If, on the other hand, primary surpluses are expected to respond to the level of debt in a way that assures fiscal solvency (a regime we call money dominant), then the price level is determined in more conventional ways. This paper develops testable restrictions that differentiate between the two regimes. Using post-war data, the paper presents what we think is overwhelming evidence that the United States is in a money dominant regime; even the post-Reagan data (1980 – 95) seem to support that contention.

40|$|Sraffa's {{suggestion}} {{regarding the}} <b>monetary</b> <b>determination</b> {{of the rate}} of profits raises two fundamental questions addressed by this paper: (i) can the money rates of interest be envisaged as variables set by the financial system independently of the real sector of the economy? (ii) How can they determine the general rate of profits and so allow for the determination of natural prices and income distribution? To elaborate on the intuition that the competitive process must link the rate of profits earned in the financial sector (and ruled by the intermediaries' margin) to that earned in the production sector, a long-period credit economy is constructed. Unlike previous attempts, the system of equations describing such an economy leaves Sraffa's (1960) original price equations unaffected. If certain fairly unrestrictive conditions are met, the solution of this system is shown to exist and to be economically meaningful, hence supporting Sraffa's hint that the rates of interest are free to determine the rate of profits outside {{of the system of}} production. ...|$|E
40|$|Neither {{uncertainty}} nor {{the link}} between liquidity {{and the rate of}} interest are lacking in I. Fisher's theory. The distinction between Keynes and Fisher arises less from the analysis of capital evaluation than from the introduction of the concept of the demand for money, inherited by Keynes from Hawtrey. The keynesian statement of a <b>monetary</b> <b>determination</b> of the rate of interest rests on a dichotomy between consumption goods and capital goods, which is lacking in Fisher and Hawtrey as well. Ni l'incertitude, ni le lien entre liquidité et taux d'intérêt ne sont absents de la théorie d'I. Fisher. C'est moins l'analyse de l'évaluation du capital qui distingue Keynes et Fisher que l'introduction par Keynes du concept de demande de monnaie, repris de Hawtrey.

40|$|The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 {{provided}} {{financial incentives}} for UI modernization. The financial incentive {{is the state}} share of $ 7 billion available nationwide. States can receive one-third of their allocation by having an alternate base period (ABP) for <b>monetary</b> <b>determination</b> of UI eligibility that includes the most recently completed calendar quarter. States can receive the remaining two-thirds of their allocation for having two of four additional program features: 1) UI eligibility while seeking only part-time work, 2) UI eligibility after job separations due to harassment or compelling family reasons, 3) continuation of UI benefits for at least 26 additional weeks after exhaustion of regular benefits while in approved training, and 4) dependents ’ allowances of at least $ 15 per dependent up to $ 50. This paper presents estimates of the UI benefit payment costs of these five program changes {{based on data from}} the Commonwealth of Kentucky. To date 39 states have received modernization payments for having an ABP, and 32 states have received the remaining two-thirds of funds available. The numbers of states adopting each of these additional features are as follows: 25 for seeking part-time, 18 for family reasons, 14 for exhaustee benefits while in training, and 7 for dependents ’ allowances.

40|$|ABSTRACT Using a New Keynesian macro model, {{the paper}} reconsiders the question, whether the central banks should {{directly}} respond to exchange rate movements. It {{is assumed that}} the transmission of monetary policy to output is {{carried out by the}} long-term interest rate, which is determined as a sum of expectations of short-term interest rates and a non-negligible term premium. The second key feature of the model is the assumption that the pass-through of the nominal exchange rate to consumer prices follows a slow distributed-lag process. According to the results, the central banks could gain from stabilizing the exchange rate movements more than suggested in the previous literature. The welfare gains are more clearly seen in the reduced volatility of inflation than stabilization of output, however.

40|$|We use a micro-founded macroeconometric {{modeling}} {{framework to}} investigate the design of monetary policy when the central bank faces uncertainty about the true structure of the economy. We apply Bayesian methods to estimate {{the parameters of the}} baseline specification using postwar U. S. data and then determine the policy under commitment that maximizes household welfare. We find that the performance of the optimal policy is closely matched by a simple operational rule that focuses solely on stabilizing nominal wage inflation. Furthermore, this simple wage stabilization rule is remarkably robust to uncertainty about the model parameters and to various assumptions regarding the nature and incidence of the innovations. However, the characteristics of optimal policy are very sensitive to the specification of the wage contracting mechanism, thereby highlighting the importance of additional research regarding the structure of labor markets and wage <b>determination.</b> <b>Monetary</b> policy; Macroeconomics; Microeconomics...|$|R

40|$|On March 26 and 27, 2004, the Federal Reserve Board held {{a conference}} in Washington, D. C., on the {{application}} of economic models {{to the analysis of}} monetary policy issues. The papers presented at the conference addressed several topics that, because they are of interest to central bankers, have been a prominent feature of Federal Reserve research over the years. In particular, the papers represent research in the tradition of work carried out over the past thirty-five years at the Federal Reserve by three prominent staff economists [...] Dale W. Henderson, Richard D. Porter, and Peter A. Tinsley. Thus, the conference partly served as a celebration of the contributions made by these individuals to policy-related research since the late 1960 s.; Among the specific topics addressed at the conference were the influence of uncertainty on policymaking; the design of formal rules to guide policy actions; the role of money in the transmission of <b>monetary</b> policy; the <b>determination</b> of asset prices; and econometric techniques for estimating dynamic models of the economy.

We conclude that {{a high degree of}} currency substitution argues for a more fixed exchange rate regime, while asset substitution may imply that either more rigid or more flexible regimes may be appropriate. We also ask whether the most informative monetary aggregates include dollar assets. Based on an analysis of five countries, we conclude inter alia that broader aggregates that include dollar assets perform better than those that do not.

40|$|Several studies {{this past}} decade have {{examined}} differences between holistic and decomposed approaches to determining weights in additive utility models. Some {{have argued that}} it matters little which procedure is used, whereas others strongly favored particular methods. In this paper we address this controversy experimentally by comparing five conceptually different approaches {{in terms of their}} weights and predictive ability. The five methods are (1) multiple linear and non-linear regression analyses of ten and fifteen holistic assessments, (2) direct decomposed tradeoffs as proposed by Keeney and Raiffa (Keeney, R. L., H. Raiffa. 1977. Decisions with Multiple Objectives. Wiley, New York.), (3) a recent eigen-vector technique of Saaty (Saaty, T. L. 1977. A scaling method for priorities in hierarchical structures. J. Math. Psych. 15 (3) 234 [...] 281.) involving redundant pairwise comparisons of attributes, (4) a straightforward allocation of hundred importance points, and (5) unit weighting (i. e., equal weighting after standardizing the attributes). The decision task involved college admissions. Subjects were asked to evaluate hypothetical college applicants on the basis of verbal SAT, quantitative SAT, high-school grade point average, and a measure of extra-curricular activity. Linear as well as nonlinear attribute utility functions were used in constructing the additive models. The nonlinear functions were specified graphically by the subjects through selection from five different shapes (i. e., one per attribute). To test the predictive ability of the various models, each subject made twenty separate pairwise comparisons of alternatives (including direction and strength of preference). The prediction criteria were percentage correct predictions as well as correlations (using these twenty pairs). Seventy subjects were tested, using an (order-controlled) within-subject design, in comparing the different methods of weight <b>determination.</b> <b>Monetary</b> incentives were used to enhance motivation. In terms of findings, the methods generally differed systematically concerning the weights given to the various attributes, as well as the variances of the resulting predictions. On average, however, the methods predicted about equally well, except for unit weighting which was clearly inferior. The findings differ in this regard from the general literature. Furthermore, nonlinear models were found to be inferior to linear ones. Finally, subjects judged the methods to differ significantly in difficulty and trustworthiness, which were found to correlate inversely. The overall results raise various applied and theoretical issues, which are discussed. decision making, additive utility models...|$|R
