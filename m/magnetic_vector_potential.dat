The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields E and B and the potentials V and A is given in the article Gauge fixing, along with the precise statement {{of the nature of the}} gauge transformation.

Independently of this, from 1991 to 1993 Ning Li and Douglas Torr {{published a}} number of articles about gravitational effects in superconductors. One finding they derived is the source of gravitomagnetic flux in a type II superconductor material is due to spin alignment of the lattice ions. Quoting from their third paper: [...] "It is shown that the coherent alignment of lattice ion spins will generate a detectable gravitomagnetic field, and {{in the presence of a}} time-dependent applied <b>magnetic</b> <b>vector</b> <b>potential</b> field, a detectable gravitoelectric field." [...] The claimed size of the generated force has been disputed by some but defended by others. In 1997 Li published a paper attempting to replicate Podkletnov's results and showed the effect was very small, if it existed at all. Li is reported to have left the University of Alabama in 1999 to found the company AC Gravity LLC. AC Gravity was awarded a U.S. DOD grant for $448,970 in 2001 to continue anti-gravity research.
