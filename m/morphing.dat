5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as chroma key, image warping, <b>morphing,</b> and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews and}} sales estimates ranged from subpar to par. Reviewers praised Kameo graphics as setting {{standards for the}} new console, and noted its vivid color palette. Their criticism focused on the gameplay, in particular its repetition, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overbearing tutorial. Reviewers found the story and Kameo's character lackluster, but largely liked the other characters and the core <b>morphing</b> concept. They had high praise for the orchestral score and other technical features, apart from the game's camera. Rare released several cosmetic downloadable content packs, and a free online cooperative mode upgrade.|$|E

5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include <b>morphing</b> faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the post-production phase of Cocoon in 1985. Bob Dolman was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts before finishing in late 1986. It was then set up at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and principal photography began in April 1987, finishing the following October. The majority of filming took place at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, as well as Wales and New Zealand. Industrial Light & Magic created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital <b>morphing</b> technology. The film was released in 1988 to mixed reviews from critics, but was a modest financial success, received two Academy Award nominations, and has developed a cult following amongst fantasy fans.|$|E
5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital <b>morphing</b> technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{on other}} organisms have {{provided}} evidence that foraging {{can occur in}} long runs, but this preference develops after only visiting a few <b>morphs.</b> When presented with two equally rewarding <b>morphs,</b> it has been demonstrated that an organism may select to exclusively forage on one <b>morph</b> for a variable amount of time, and then switch to the alternative <b>morph</b> and repetitively forage on this <b>morph.</b> Under this switching attention hypothesis, selectively foraging on the common <b>morph</b> can occur without invoking a learned response, as the probability of visiting a particular <b>morph</b> first increases as the relative frequency of that <b>morph</b> increases. In other words, it is likely pollinators will select common <b>morphs</b> first due to chance since they are more common {{and will continue to}} forage on these <b>morphs</b> during foraging bouts.|$|R
40|$|Seed bank is a {{plant life}} history {{strategy}} against {{the unpredictability of}} the biotic and the abiotic environment. We simulated competition between a seed banking and a non-banking <b>morph</b> of an annual plant. A constant fraction of the banker <b>morph</b> seeds was allocated to the seed bank, where they had a constant mortality and germination rate. All surviving seeds of the non-banker <b>morph</b> germinated in the next generation. The seedlings of both <b>morphs</b> experienced similar density-dependent mortality. Whether one of the <b>morphs</b> wins or the <b>morphs</b> coexist was evaluated from parameter space plots and statistically with logistic regression analysis. All parameters of the model had a significant, nonlinear effect on {{the persistence of the}} <b>morphs,</b> supporting our approach of numerically covering a wide range of parameter values. The seed production of a focal <b>morph</b> increased its survival and decreased the survival of the other <b>morph.</b> Otherwise, the <b>morphs</b> showed opposite response to changes in the model parameters. The banker <b>morph</b> was usually the winning strategy when it had a higher seed production than the non-banker <b>morph.</b> The banker <b>morph</b> benefitted from high germination probability, while the non-banker benefitted from high allocation to seed bank and high seed mortality. The coexistence of the <b>morphs</b> was inhibited by high banker <b>morph</b> seed production and seed mortality and promoted by high values of all other parameters. The system showed complex dynamics when banking was the winning strategy or the <b>morphs</b> coexisted. In addition, a part of the parameter space where the non-banker <b>morph</b> wins showed complex dynamics. Our results suggest that seed banking is a beneficial strategy if seed number is increased consequently, e. g. due to a decreased seed size. If banking decreases seed number, the non-banker <b>morph</b> wins or the two <b>morphs</b> coexist. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Riven {{combined}} the pre-rendered backgrounds with live action footage, {{in order to}} increase the player's immersion level. Riven was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was apprehensive about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of Atrus from Myst, even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by chroma key, so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with <b>morphing,</b> to allow for partial variations due to the nonlinearity of the gameplay.|$|E

Later, Mulder follows Calderon after he leaves his office. Scully has imaging tests conducted on Emily. Calderon goes to see the Dark Suited Men, one of whom kills him by stabbing him in the neck with an alien stiletto; both men then morph into Calderon. Mulder follows as one of them leaves.

5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by <b>morphing</b> together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} plumage <b>morphs</b> exists, {{with the primary}} {{distinction}} being between the pale <b>morph</b> and the dark <b>morph.</b> Both <b>morphs</b> usually have dark brown upper parts and wing coverts.

40|$|Two <b>morphs</b> of Patiriella exigua {{occur in}} South Africa. These <b>morphs</b> occur on {{opposite}} sides of a temperature divide present at Cape Point. The green <b>morph</b> occurring on the West Coast (cold temperate) and the mottled <b>morph</b> occurring on the South Coast (warm temperate). In a previous study by Katherine Dunbar these two <b>morphs</b> were shown to be the same species. This project tests if there is a physiological difference between the two <b>morphs</b> of P. exigua. This was achieved by observing the activity coefficient of righting response of the two <b>morphs</b> of P. exigua under different temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The green <b>morph</b> was collected from Green Point (West Coast) and the mottled <b>morph</b> from Kalk Bay (South Coast).

5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung <b>morphing</b> into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E

40|$|Female-limited color polymorphisms {{occur in}} a variety of animal taxa where {{excessive}} male sexual harassment may explain the coexistence of multiple female color <b>morphs.</b> In the color polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans, mature and immature female color <b>morphs</b> coexist at the mating site where males are in search for suitable mating partners. Here, we study male preference and female mating propensity for the two immature female <b>morphs.</b> As would be expected, compared to mature <b>morphs,</b> both immature female <b>morphs</b> mate much less. Within immature females, one <b>morph</b> consistently mates more frequently compared to the other <b>morph,</b> a pattern that is similar for the ontogenetically corresponding mature female <b>morphs.</b> Preference experiments with the two differently colored immature female <b>morphs,</b> however, did not indicate male mate preference for either <b>morph.</b> Low mating frequencies of immature females at natural sites in combination with relatively high attractiveness of immature models in terms of male preference indicate that female behavior influences female mating success...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The feeding {{performance}} on soft and hard prey of two <b>morphs</b> of the trophically polymorphic Neotropical cichlid fish, Cichlasoma citrinellum, {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. The molariform <b>morphs,</b> specialized to feed on hard prey, are able to crack snail shells that are twice as hard as those cracked by the papilliform <b>morphs.</b> During ecological bottlenecks in food resources this ability should allow molariform <b>morphs</b> to exploit alternate, less preferred prey sources that are not available to papilliform <b>morphs.</b> Analysis of stomach contents revealed that molariform <b>morphs</b> feed significantly more often on hard snails than do papilliform <b>morphs</b> (Meyer 1989 a). The performance advantage of the trophically specialized <b>morphs</b> when feed-ing on hard prey is countered by their less efficient perfor-mance on soft diets. The morphologically generalized papil-liform <b>morph</b> feeds more efficiently on soft prey. The abun-dance of preferred soft prey, seasonal fluctuations in prey availability {{and the frequency of}} ecological bottlenecks may determine the relative abundance of these two <b>morphs</b> in natural populations in Nicaraguan lakes...|$|R

40|$|The flight-capable <b>morph</b> of the wing-polymorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus, {{accumulated}} {{a substantially}} greater quantity of total lipid and triglyceride, {{compared with the}} obligately flightless <b>morph,</b> during the first five days of adulthood. Increased lipid accumulation in the flight-capable <b>morph</b> was genetically based, and was produced when ovarian growth is substantially reduced in that <b>morph.</b> Temporal changes in lipid levels suggest that the higher triglyceride reserves in the flight-capable <b>morph</b> fed a high-nutrient diet were produced by elevated lipid biosynthesis. By contrast, on a low-nutrient or high carbohydrate diet, increased lipid levels in the flight-capable <b>morph</b> appeared to result primarily from decreased lipid utilization. Increased biosynthesis or retention of triglyceride (the major flight fuel in Gryllus) by the flight-capable <b>morph</b> may significantly divert nutrients from egg production and hence {{may be an important}} physiological cause of its reduced ovarian growth. The obligately flightless <b>morph</b> allocated a greater proportion of total lipid to phospholipid than did the flight-capable <b>morph.</b> No functionally-significant differences in total lipid or triglyceride were produced between <b>morphs</b> during the last nymphal stadium. A second flightless <b>morph,</b> derived from the flight-capable <b>morph</b> by histolysis of flight muscles during adulthood, also had reduced amounts of total lipid and triglyceride but increased ovarian growth compared with the flight capable <b>morph</b> on the standard (high-nutrient) diet. Important qualitative and quantitative aspects of lipid metabolism differ genetically between the flight-capable and flightless <b>morphs</b> of G. firmus and likely contribute importantly to their respective adaptations for flight capability vs. reproduction.
