40|$|Abstract The {{concept of}} communicability is {{introduced}} for complex socio-economic networks. The communicability function expresses how an impact propagates {{from one place}} to another in the network. This function is used to define unambiguously the concept of socio-economic community. The concept of temperature in complex socio-economic networks is also introduced as a way of ac-counting for the external stresses to which such systems are submitted. This external stress can change dramatically the structure of the communities in a network. We analyze here a trade network of countries exporting ‘miscellaneous <b>manufactures</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> ’ We determine the community structure of this network showing that there are 27 communities with diverse degree of overlapping. When only communities with less than 80 % of overlap are considered we found five communities which are well characterized in terms of geopolitical relationships. The analysis of external stress on these communities reveals the vulnerability of the trade network in critical situations, i. e., economical crisis. The current approach adds an important tool for the analysis of socio-economic networks in the real world. ...|$|E

The communicability function expresses how an impact propagates {{from one place}} to another in the network. This function is used to define unambiguously the concept of socio-economic community. The concept of temperature in com-plex socio-economic networks is also introduced as a way of accounting for the external stresses to which such systems are submitted. This external stress can change dramatically the structure of the communities in a network. We analyze here a trade network of countries exporting ‘miscellaneous <b>manufactures</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> ’ We determine the community structure of this network showing that there are 27 communities with diverse degree of overlapping. When only communities with less than 80 % of overlap are considered we found 5 communities which are well characterized in terms of geopolitical relationships. The analysis of external stress on these communities reveals that several countries are very much influ-enced by these critical situations, i. e., economical crisis. These weakest links are clearly identified and represent countries that are isolated from the main trade as soon as the external “temperature ” of the system is increased. The current ap-proach adds an important tool for the analysis of socio-economic networks in the real-world. Acknowledgments EE thanks B. Álvarez-Pereira and K. Deegan for help with the calculations.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{detecting}} communities {{based on the}} concept of communicability between nodes in a complex network. This method, designated as N-ComBa K-means, uses a normalized version of the adjacency matrix to build the communicability matrix and then applies K-means clustering to find the communities in a graph. We analyze how this method performs for some pathological cases found in the analysis of the detection limit of communities and propose some possible solutions {{on the basis of the}} analysis of the ratio of local to global densities in graphs. We use four different quality criteria for detecting the best clustering and compare the new approach with the Girvan-Newman algorithm for the analysis of two ‘classical’ networks: karate club and bottlenose dolphins. Finally, we analyze the more challenging case of homogeneous networks with community structure, for which the Girvan-Newman completely fails in detecting any clustering. The N-ComBa K-means approach performs very well in these situations and we applied it to detect the community structure in an international trade network of miscellaneous <b>manufactures</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> having these characteristics. Some final remarks about the general philosophy of community detection are also discussed. Communities play fundamental organizational and functional roles in many networks representing complex systems. Most of the algorithms used to detect these structures use information directly contained in the topology of these networks, such as adjacency and distance relationships. This paper proposes a new technique for identifying communities using the concept of network communicability, which is based on walks on networks. Nodes are grouped into communities according to their capacity of communicating better among them than with outsiders. We analyze the problem of detection limit and propose some possible solutions for the method introduced here based on the analysis of local-to-global densities in networks. A more challenging example consisting of a super-homogeneous network with communities is presented and the advantages of using the current approach are analyzed...|$|E
