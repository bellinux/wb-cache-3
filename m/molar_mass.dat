5|$|Antibody mimetics are organic {{compounds}} that, like antibodies, can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics {{such as the}} Affimer and the DARPin have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

An optimal range of viscosities corresponding to appropriate <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> and processing temperatures is established.

40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} {{effect of}} miscellaneous xanthates RS(C=S) OZ' {{on the level}} of control of free radical polymerizations was investigated. Such polymerizations referred as to the MADIX process involve the use of xanthates as reversible chain transfer agents (CTAs). In the case of S-alkyl-O-ethyl xanthates, RS(C=S) OEt, the process involves slow degenerative transfer of xanthate end-groups between polymer chains. This leads to styrene and acrylate-derived polymers with predetermined <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> at high conversion and polydispersity index (PDI) between 1. 5 and 2. In this series, the more substituted and stabilized the R leaving group, the better the control over <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> {{as a function of the}} monomer conversion. Excellent control can be achieved in the polymerization of vinyl esters, acrylic acid and acrylamide. The reactivity of the C=S double bond of xanthates can be dramatically increased towards polystyryl and polyacrylyl radicals by incorporating electron-withdrawing substituents in the activating Z=OZ' group of S-(1 -ethoxycarbonyl) ethyl-O- alkyl xanthates, C 2 H 5 OCO(CH 3) CH-S(C=S) OZ'. This allows the preparation of polymers with controlled <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> and PDI close to unity...|$|R

25|$|In pharmacology, an {{important}} group of organic compounds is small molecules, {{also referred to}} as 'small organic compounds'. In this context, a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active, but is not a polymer.

25|$|At {{the same}} temperature, {{a column of}} dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air {{containing}} any water vapor, the <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25°C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and anticyclonic weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).|$|E
25|$|Water {{molecules}} form {{hydrogen bonds}} {{with each other}} and are strongly polar. This polarity allows it to separate ions in salts and strongly bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids, thus dissolving them. Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form, a relatively high boiling point of 100°C for its <b>molar</b> <b>mass,</b> and a high heat capacity.|$|E

The results showed that these aqueous solutions present a negative deviation from Raoult`s law. The Flory-Huggins and UNIFAC excess Gibbs energy models were employed to model the experimental data.

25|$|A {{multi-stage}} {{model for}} the formation of emeraldine base is proposed. In the first stage of the reaction the pernigraniline PS salt oxidation state is formed. In the second stage pernigraniline is reduced to the emeraldine salt as aniline monomer gets oxidized to the radical cation. In the third stage this radical cation couples with ES salt. This process can be followed by light scattering analysis which allows the determination of the absolute <b>molar</b> <b>mass.</b> According to one study in the first step a DP of 265 is reached with the DP of the final polymer at 319. Approximately 19% of the final polymer is made up of the aniline radical cation which is formed during the reaction.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
30|$|The {{molecular}} weights of {{the serial}} (PCL) 2 (PDEA-b-PPEGMA) 2 {{were determined by}} GPC and summarized in Table  1. It {{can be seen that}} the GPC curves presented in Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 appeared monomodal symmetric distribution and the values of Mw/Mn were below 1.50, which are acceptable for further application of delivering drugs. It was also found that GPC analysis for (PCL) 2 (PDEA-b-PPEGMA) 2 tended to underestimate the molecular weight (which was typically smaller) as compared to their linear counterpart due to the reduced hydrodynamic volumes. The characterization of the <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> of star polymers by GPC is not straightforward. Since standard samples with exactly the same topology and with known <b>molar</b> <b>masses</b> do not exist, the calibration with narrow standards cannot be applied [38, 39].|$|R
