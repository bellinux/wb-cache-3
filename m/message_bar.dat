When a document is opened from a potentially unsafe location {{such as the}} Internet or as an e-mail attachment, or if a document does not comply with File Block policy or if it fails the file validation process, it is opened in Protected View, which prohibits potentially unsafe documents from modifying components, files, and other resources on a system; users can also manually open documents in Protected View. When a document is opened in Protected View, users are allowed to view, copy, and paste {{the contents of the}} document, but there are no options to edit, save, or print contents, and all active document content including ActiveX controls, database connections, hyperlinks, and macros is disabled. Users can open documents outside of Protected View by clicking on the [...] "Enable Editing" [...] button that appears on a <b>message</b> <b>bar</b> within the Office user interface. As a precautionary measure, active content within a potentially unsafe document is still disabled when a user reopens it after exiting Protected View—content remains disabled until a user clicks the [...] "Enable Content" [...] button on the <b>message</b> <b>bar,</b> which designates the document as a trusted document so that users are not prompted when it is opened in the future.|$|E
30|$|In Study ‐ II, a user {{is asked}} to select the location(s) that he/she visited at a certain time. A user can select the location(s) using an {{interactive}} map that was implemented leveraging Google Maps API. We set the initial zoom level of Google Maps to 2 {{where most of the}} world is visible while there is no repetition of the map unlike zoom level 1. The rationale behind this choice is to avoid influencing users to select locations from a certain geographic area, which may also reduce overall security of the system [26]. In order to select a location on the map, the minimum required zoom level is set at zoom level 17, which gives reasonable details and higher security since an adversary has to guess a location at a finer resolution. Once a user zooms in at level 17, he is informed by displaying the following message {{at the top of the}} web page (the <b>message</b> <b>bar</b> turns from red to green): “As your current zoom level is 17 or higher, you may now choose a location by right clicking on the map”. To select a location, “Right‐clicking” functionality was chosen as left‐clicking is used for another functionality (e.g., double click zooms in). Once a location is selected, users see a marker at the selected location (e.g., like the one in Fig. 4). As zooming in from zoom level 2 to 17 or higher may slow down the user and impact the usability aspect, we provide a search box that may be used to zoom‐in on the right area/location very quickly. Specifically, we took advantage of the Google Place Autocomplete feature, which returns a list of suggestions for locations and predicted search terms. From this list, a user may select a place to zoom in quickly.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, Deutsch & Deutsch {{proposed}} a late selection model of how selective attention operates. They {{proposed a}}ll stimuli get processed in full, with the crucial difference being a filter placed {{later in the}} information processing routine, just before the entrance into working memory. The late selection process supposedly operated on the semantic characteristics of a <b>message,</b> <b>barring</b> inputs from memory and subsequent awareness {{if they did not}} possess desired content. According to this model, the depreciated awareness of unattended stimuli came from denial into working memory and the controlled generation of responses to it. The Deutsch & Deutsch model was later revised by Norman in 1968, who added that the strength of an input was also an important factor for its selection.|$|R

Karthik writes [...] "The title song Total Siyapaa along with the quirky lyrics, dialogues and sounds, is good fun. Ali Zafar fares really well in Palat Meri jaan, singing, writing and composing the lovely ballad. Palat Meri Jaan is a Chart buster. Nahi maloom has a captivating Middle-Eastern + Latino blend sound and is sung particularly well by Ali and Fariha Parvaiz. The composer-singer uses a reggae template in Asha and delivers a nice, winsome song. Chal Buleya is sufi song with a <b>message.</b> <b>Barring</b> that minor misstep, charming soundtrack overall, with Ali offering a good demonstration of his multi-facetedness." ...|$|R

Unfortunately, visually impaired individuals who use screen reader programs to navigate through such documents have limited access to the graphics. This paper presents the Interactive SIGHT (Summarizing Information GrapHics Textually) systemthatprovides visuallyimpaired individuals with the high-level knowledge that one would gain from viewing graphics in electronic documents. The current system, which is implemented as a browser extension, works on simple bar charts. Once launched by a keystroke combination, Interactive SIGHTfirstprovidesabriefinitial summarythat conveys the underlying <b>message</b> of the <b>bar</b> chart along with the chart’s most significant features. The system is then able to generate history-aware follow-up responses that provide further information upon request from the user.

50|$|Encrypting was {{introduced}} to prevent people from receiving pay content for free, and nearly every pay channel was encrypted by the mid-to-late 1980s (this did not happen without protest, such as an incident in which a Florida satellite dealer intercepted the signal of HBO during a film telecast in 1986 to transmit a text-based <b>message</b> over color <b>bars</b> objecting to the network's decision to encrypt its feed). Satellite television also began a digital transition, well before over-the-air broadcasting did the same, to increase satellite capacity and/or {{reduce the size of}} the receiving antennas; this also made it more difficult for individuals to intercept these signals. Eventually, the industry began to cater to individuals who wanted to continue to receive satellite television (and were willing to pay for it) in two ways: by authorizing the descrambling of the original satellite feeds to the cable television operators, and with new direct broadcast satellite television services using their own satellites. These latter services, which began operating in the mid-1990s, offer programming similar to cable television.|$|R

The computerized method also includes transmitting, from an authentication server, information about the plurality of virtual environments to a first computing device associated with an agent in response to user request for access to a restricted electronic messaging format associated {{with one of the}} virtual worlds. The computerized method further includes receiving, at the authentication server, an indication of authorization from the first computing device, wherein the indication of authorization includes a separate indication of authorization associated with each of the plurality of virtual environments. System and method for controlling a virtual environment of a userUnited States 11,840,647Issued August 17, 2007 A method and a system for controlling a virtual environment of a user, e.g., a child is provided. In the virtual environment, users are able to interact with other users using messages. Each message is made up of one or more items contained in a dictionary. Information is transmitted, e.g., by e mail, to an agent, e.g., a parent. The transmitted information is information that may be used to authorize the agent to control the virtual environment of the user. The virtual environment of the user is controlled by setting a level of interaction at which the user is permitted to interact with others. The messages may include pre-written messages and messages composed by a user using items contained in the dictionary. A <b>message</b> checker <b>bars</b> unsuitable combinations made up of items contained in the dictionary. Inappropriate language and personally identifiable information may be excluded from the contents of the messages.|$|R
40|$|The new {{paradigm}} for distributed computing over the Internet {{is that of}} Web services. The goal of Web services is to achieve universal interoperability between applications by using standardized protocols and languages. One of the key ideas of the Web service paradigm {{is the ability of}} building complex and value-added service-based applications by composing preexisting services. For a service-based application, in addition to its functional requirements, Quality of service (QoS) requirements are important and deserve a special attention. In this paper, we introduce a discrete-event modeling approach for service-based application. This approach is oriented towards QoS assurance through discrete-event simulation. considered as an example of service aggregators [4]. Multiple and different services such as calling services (e. g., call forwarding and call <b>barring),</b> <b>messaging</b> services (e. g., text messaging and video messaging), and internet services (e. g., chat and e-mail) are brought together and offered via telephone. For an SBA, in addition to its functional requirements, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are important and deserve a special attention. QoS requirements for SBAs include response time, throughput, availability and security [4, 5]. Being able to characterize SBAs based on QoS has three distinct advantages [6]: Keywords: Web Services, Service-based applications, QoS assurance, Discrete-event simulation...|$|R
