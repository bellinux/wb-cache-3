500|$|The {{two major}} ways {{thunderstorms}} move are via advection {{of the wind}} and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest [...] of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, the less likely other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.|$|E

40|$|From a {{viewpoint}} {{of establishing a}} rational design formula for wind loads for buildings, the reference wind pressure {{is not to be}} based on the largest instantaneous <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> experienced so far, but on analysis of an annual series of extreme <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> The paper deals with analysis of annual extreme <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> obtained at seven meteorological stations in topographically isolated islands of Okinawa, and presents a tentative discussion for the reference wind pressure. The series of annual extreme <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> at each station has shown to be well fitted by double exponential distribution. The statistically expected annual extreme <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> in 50 years of return period at each station have been calculated, and result in 53. 6, 51. 5 and 61. 0 m/s for Naha, Ishigaki and Miyako, respectively. As a consequence of this study, the reference pressures (kg/m^ 2) of 120 √^ 4, 200 √^ 4 and 260 √^ 4 (h; height in meter) have been tentatively proposed for Daitoh, main island of Okinawa and Ishigaki, and Miyako, respectively, taking the same value of 2. 0 for gust effect factor as in Canadian Code for the consideration of the effects of gusty winds...|$|R

40|$|Wind-over-wave in situ {{measurements}} are typically conducted {{in two different}} fashions: either by means of waveriding buoys, or by placing anemometers well elevated above the surface. Routinely, concept of the constant-flux layer is invoked to convert one into another as necessary. In the paper, comparisons of <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> and wind-momentum fluxes are conducted, based on measurements throughout the wave boundary layer, including wave-follower measurements very near the surface. Significant deviations from the constant-flux expectations are found. Near the surface, the fluxes are less than those obtained by extrapolation within the logarithmiclayer assumption, and the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> are correspondingly larger. Such results have significant implications for modelling the wind-generated waves and for calibrations of remotely sensed surface wind conditions...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at {{increasing}} {{our understanding of}} the regional wind climate in Sweden. Spatial and temporal patterns of the surface winds are presented for the years 1999 – 2000. Annual <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> range between 2 and 5 m/s with high values at exposed mountainous sites and on islands off the coast. Combining <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and direction into <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> velocities shows that flow conditions are stronger and more coherent in space in southern Sweden than in central and northern Sweden. The spatial scale, defined as the distance between stations when the correlation for <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> drops to ∼ 0. 37, was determined by pairwise correlations between all possible station pairs. Scales range from 38 to 530 km for <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and from 40 to 830 km for wind direction depending on the region. They tend to be smaller in central and northern Sweden, where the more pronounced relief has a larger influence on the local wind conditions. The strength and the timing of the annual and diurnal <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> cycle have been estimated for each station. Amplitudes of the annual cycle are greater at exposed sites and correlate generally well with annual <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds.</b> Monthly <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> peak in winter in southern Sweden, but peak in other seasons in the remaining regions. In winter, weaker pressure gradients over northern Sweden and surface-near temperature inversions contribute to weaker surface winds. Diurnal cycles vary in strength between summer and winter.
