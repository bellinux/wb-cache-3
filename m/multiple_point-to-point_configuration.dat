Hierarchical encoding is a newly proposed technique that {{offers a variety of}} quality levels in one encoding; a user or a switch can filter the data that will be processed further.

A lot of emerging applications are of multicast nature, and thus multicasting has become an important research area.

40|$|Multicast is an {{efficient}} transmission scheme for supporting group communication in networks. Contrasted with unicast, where <b>multiple</b> <b>point-to-point</b> connections {{must be used}} to support communications {{among a group of}} users, multicast is more efficient because each data packet is replicated in the network [...] at the branching points leading to distinguished destinations, thus reducing the transmission load on the data sources and traffic load on the network links. To implement multicast, networks need to incorporate new routing and forwarding mechanisms in addition to the existing unicast methods. Unfortunately, the necessary functions needed to realize multicast are not adequately supported in the current networks. The IP multicast solution has serious scaling and deployment limitations, and cannot be easily extended to provide more enhanced data services. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, IP multicast has ignored the economic nature of the problem, lacking incentives for service providers to deploy the service in wide area networks...|$|R

Multicast transmission may use network bandwidth {{more efficiently than}} <b>multiple</b> <b>point-to-point</b> messages, however, creating optimal multicast trees is prohibitively expensive. For this reason, heuristic methods are generally employed. These heuristics are often based on a Steiner tree approach, which is known to produce multicast trees that achieve an efficient use of network resources. Many such algorithms, both centralized and distributed, have been proposed to generate “good ” multicast trees. Even these heuristics typically have significant execution times, however, so changes to the initial group of multicast participants during generation of the tree is likely. Existing algorithms, however, either do not support changes to the multicast group during building of the tree or they impose unrealistic restrictions, such as no overlapping modifications or regeneration of the tree after every change. These restrictions prevent {{the use of such}} algorithms in many situations, e. g., networks with mobile hosts.

Preliminary results indicate that for simple single runway scenarios, changes in airport noise contour areas can be estimated with minimal uncertainty compared against grid-point calculation methods such as INM. In situations where such outputs are all that is required for preliminary strategic environmental assessment, there are considerable benefits in reduced input data and computation requirements. Further development of the noise-cylinder-based model (such as the incorporation of lateral attenuation, engine-installation-effects or horizontal track dispersion via the assumption of more complex noise surfaces formed around the flight-track) will allow for more complex assessment to be carried out.

30|$|This paper {{describes}} new methodology in {{the current}} unbalance calculations in meshed grids. The meshed grids, mainly the transmission ones, consist of more parts connected together which are formed using different conductor types, phase sequence arrangements, tower constructions, and various number of lines on the same tower. Therefore several computational challenges arise {{in comparison with the}} widely discussed <b>point-to-point</b> <b>configuration.</b> The methodology divides the grid into a number of impedance matrices respecting all the self and mutual impedances among all conductors and all parallel lines. Another challenging issue for the lines impedance description is changing the number of shield wires along the line if the line is composed of several sections with different tower configurations. For the current unbalance calculation, shield wires must also be included in the algorithms, and matrices of various dimensions can be obtained. For the overall matrix description to be used, dimensions of all matrices in final equations must be equal, and therefore the virtual shield wires are created. To compare more conductor transposition cases with each other, the line loadings caused by voltage sources should be equal. This is necessary mainly in case of meshed grids where the supplying sources on different lines can have strong mutual couplings. This can be achieved by an appropriately designed optimization of the connected voltage sources.|$|R
