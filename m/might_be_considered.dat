5|$|Jack Rozinsky, 9th dan (Jidokwan), {{founded the}} Shuto Karate Club in 1963; it {{later became the}} Melbourne Taekwondo Centre. As Rozinsky taught tang soo do there, he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> the first taekwondo school founder in Australia (again, if tang soo do were {{recognised}} as taekwondo retrospectively), and so might lay claim to the title. Rozinsky did not introduce taekwondo outside Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Chan Yong Kim, 9th dan, was {{the first}} tang soo do {{instructor}} in Australia. He arrived in the early 1960s, sponsored by the Silvertop Taxi Karate Club or the Judo Federation of Australia, and stayed {{for one or two}} years before moving overseas. Kim <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> the first taekwondo instructor in Australia if tang soo do were recognised as taekwondo retrospectively, and so might lay claim to the title. Kim did not establish a taekwondo school in Australia.|$|E

5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James to renovate the theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became an interior hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E
5|$|In melody-dominated homophony, {{accompanying}} voices provide chordal {{support for}} the lead voice, which assumes the melody. Some popular music today <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> melody-dominated homophony, voice typically taking on the lead role, while instruments like piano, guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice. In many cases, instruments also take on the lead role, and often the role switches between parts, voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos, during which the other instruments provide chordal support.|$|E

The album has sold approximately half-a-million copies, which <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> somewhat disappointing compared to Adams previous albums sales. However CD sales dropped for all artists during this time across the board.|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} the word law in Article 9(1) has a direct bearing on the scope of the Article. If law is read broadly (for example, as {{incorporating}} customary international law principles), the scope of the fundamental liberties would be wider. It would be narrower if, on the other hand, law is construed narrowly, as the Legislature would be able to curtail such rights through legislation more easily. This could lead to a watering-down of the emphasis on fundamental liberties, as any infringement <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> legitimate so long as the statute in question was validly enacted.|$|E

50|$|Concerns remain that {{a failure}} to secure a {{resolution}} favourable to Kosovo Albanian opinion might lead to violence in Kosovo, including in the period up to a possible election in November 2007.

25|$|Faraday was {{the first}} to report what later came to be called {{metallic}} nanoparticles. In 1847 he discovered that the optical properties of gold colloids differed from those of the corresponding bulk metal.
