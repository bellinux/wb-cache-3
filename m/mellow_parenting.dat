40|$|<b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> is an {{intensive}} parenting programme {{which has been}} shown to be effective in improving the psychosocial functioning of very vulnerable babies and preschool children. We used a complex interventions model to evaluate its use with school-age children with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), a serious disorder of social functioning associated with maltreatment. The programme had a positive effect on mothers ’ mental health, but had no measurable effects on symptoms of RAD or on parent–child interaction, although the variation between families after the group suggested that some had responded more than others. <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> is an effective programme for vulnerable families with younger children and may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of school-age children with RAD, but it cannot be considered a definite treatment for RAD in this age group. The search continues for safe and effective treatments for RAD in school-age children...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} policy {{initiatives}} {{have been introduced}} in Scotland {{with the aim of}} supporting families, increasing parenting capacity, and facilitating early intervention (for example, Early Years Framework; parenting programmes such as Triple P, <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> and Webster Stratton/Incredible Years). The messages promoted are that parenting is a difficult occupation requiring expertise; all parents need help at times; and it is the responsible parent that seeks support. However, explorations of how parents view and experience support are limited. This small study of six parents aimed to gain insights into how parents conceptualise, experience and manage support in their parenting role in everyday life...|$|E
40|$|Effective early {{intervention}} to prevent oppositional/conduct disorders requires early identification of children at risk. Patterns of parent-child interaction may predict oppositional/conduct disorders but large community-based prospective {{studies are needed}} to evaluate this possibility. We sought to examine whether the <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> Observational System (MPOS) used to assess parent-infant interactions at one year was associated with psychopathology at age 7. The MPOS assesses positive and negative interactions between parent and child. It examines six dimensions: anticipation of child’s needs, responsiveness, autonomy, cooperation, containment of child distress, and control/conflict; these are summed to produce measures of total positive and negative interactions. We examined videos from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) sub-cohort who attended the ‘Children in Focus’ clinic at one year of age. Our sample comprised 180 videos of parent-infant interaction: 60 from infants who received a psychiatric diagnostic categorisation at seven years and 120 randomly selected controls who were group-matched on sex. A negative association between positive interactions and oppositional/conduct disorders was found. With the exception of pervasive developmental disorders (autism), an increase of one positive interaction per minute predicted a 15 % (95 % CI: 4 % to 26 %) reduction in the odds of the infant being case diagnosed. There was no statistically significant relationship between negative parenting interactions and oppositional/conduct disorders, although negative interactions were rarely observed in this setting. The <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> Observation System, specifically low scores for positive parenting interactions (such as Responsiveness which encompasses parental warmth towards the infant), predicted later psychiatric diagnostic categorisation of oppositional/conduct disorders...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To explore {{whether the}} <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> {{assessment}} system can detect {{any difference in}} parent-child meal time interaction between children with weight faltering (failure to thrive) and normally growing children. Subjects and methods: Thirty mother-infant dyads with weight faltering and 29 healthy controls nested within the Gateshead Millennium prospective cohort study were assessed at mean age 15. 6 months (range 13 - 20). Video-tapes of two standardized meals per child by a researcher blind to infant health status were analysed using a simplified version of the <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> Coding System (MPCS), an all events measure of maternal-child interactivity. These were linked to questionnaire data on eating behaviour and growth held on the children. Results: The MPCS had good inter-rater reliability (0. 82) and coherent inter-relationships between coding domains. During case meals there were significantly fewer positive interactions overall: cases median 81. 5 (IQR 4 - 496) : controls 169. 5 (40 - 372) and within all the commonly observed domains (Anticipation (p = 0. 013), autonomy (p = 0. 003), responsiveness (p = 0. 005) and cooperation (p = 0. 016)). There were only low levels of distress and control or negative behaviours and {{no significant differences were}} found in these between the groups. The case infants had significantly lower reported appetite by the age of 4 months and higher reported avoidance of feeding at the age of 8 months than controls. Conclusions: Mothers of weight faltering infants generally showed fewer interactions with their infants at mealtimes. It is not clear whether this is causal or simply a maternal adaptive response to their child's eating behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Background Infant {{attachment}} is {{a strong}} predictor of mental health, and current measures involve placing children into a stressful situation in order to observe how the child uses their primary caregiver to assuage their distress. Objectives This study aimed to explore observational correlates of attachment patterns during immunisation. Participants and setting 18 parent–child pairs {{were included in the}} study. They were all recruited through a single general medical practice. Methods Infant immunisation videos were observed and coded for parenting behaviours as well as pain promoting and pain reducing strategies. Results were compared between different attachment groups, as measured with the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task. Results Parents of securely attached children scored higher on positive <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> Observational System behaviours, but not at a statistically significant level. Parents of securely attached children were also significantly {{more likely to engage in}} pain reducing behaviours (p < 0. 01) than parents of insecurely attached children. Conclusions Robust composite measures for attachment informative behaviours in the immunisation situation should be developed and tested in a fully powered study...|$|E

40|$|Fathers in two-parent {{families}} {{are becoming increasingly}} involved in infant care, highlighting the {{need to understand the}} determinants and influence of father-infant interactions. Paternal responsiveness is a core component of positive father-infant interactions. This study investigated associations between paternal responsiveness and infant development; and paternal low mood and paternal responsiveness. Participants were a sub-sample of father-infant dyads (n= 47) from a UK community cohort study: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> Coding System was used to measure paternal responsiveness within a video-recorded father-infant interaction at 12 months. Infant development was assessed using the Griffiths scales at 18 months and paternal low mood was measured using the Edinburgh Post-Natal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 8 months. Linear regression analysis provided no evidence for an association between paternal responsiveness and infant development. Due to methodological limitations it is unclear whether this reflects a true null relationship. Unexpectedly, lower paternal mood (indicated by higher scores on the EPDS), was found to be associated with greater paternal responsiveness. For every standard deviation increase in EPDS score, fathers displayed approximately two additional responsiveness behaviours per minute in the observed interaction; this corresponds to a standardised effect size of 0. 32 standard deviations. The mechanisms for this association are unclear, but possibilities are discussed. The finding requires replication within larger studies, but clinicians may wish to consider that fathers who achieve very low scores on measures of depressed mood may be at risk for low paternal responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} the predictors {{of positive and negative}} parenting behaviours in a United Kingdom population. The majority of previous research has focused on specific risk factors and has used a variety of outcome measures. This study used a single assessment of parenting behaviours and started {{with a wide range of}} potential pre- and post-natal variables; such an approach might be used to identify families who might benefit from parenting interventions. Methods: Using a case-control subsample of 160 subjects from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), regression analysis was undertaken to model parenting behaviours at 12 months as measured by the <b>Mellow</b> <b>Parenting</b> Observational System. Results: Positive parenting increased with maternal age at delivery, levels of education and with prenatal anxiety. More negative interactions were observed among younger mothers, mothers with male infants, with prenatal non-smokers and among mothers who perceived they had a poor support structure. Conclusions: This study indicates two factors which may be important in identifying families most at risk of negative parenting: younger maternal age at delivery and lack of social support during pregnancy. Such factors could be taken into account when planning provision of services such as parenting interventions. We also established that male children were significantly more likely to be negatively parented, a novel finding which may suggest an area for future research. However the findings have to be accepted cautiously and have to be replicated, as the measures used do not have established psychometric validity and reliability data...|$|E
