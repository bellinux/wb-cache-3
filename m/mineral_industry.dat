The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt mixture is also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>industry</b> {{corporations}} use territory {{occupied by}} indigenous populations {{to carry out}} their operations. In the process, they compromise land and water resources, taking away the community's livelihood assets and sources of cultural identity. Corporations attempt to compensate for these changes through the price they pay for using the land, offering employment to the local population, and implementing community development programs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> in Peru has exerted several adverse {{impacts on}} the environment, {{including}} reduced {{quality and quantity of}} water supplies and changes in habitat for plants and animals. According to an article in the Journal of Latin American Geography, these effects have significantly compromised the livelihoods of rural populations living in nearby communities. Mining corporations often draw water from nearby streams, canals, aquifers, and lakes, thereby reducing the quantity of water available for subsistence agriculture, farming, and personal consumption. Runoff from mining operations often contaminates local water supplies with substances such as copper, iron, zinc, manganese, mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, cyanide, and selenium, further threatening rural populations' main sources of sustenance. Beyond modifying water supplies, the <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> in Peru has also compromised natural habitat. Mining operations often produce substantial soil erosion, thus degrading the grazing lands that local populations rely on for herding and livestock activities. In addition, mining activities require considerable physical space for infrastructure, road construction, drilling, and other operations. This reduces the quantity of land available for the pastoral activities of rural communities.|$|E
25|$|In {{exchange}} for using land for mining operations, corporations pay royalties to the Peruvian government. Peruvian {{law requires that}} a portion of these royalties {{be returned to the}} communities and households that the mining operations directly affect. Due to political corruption, however, these royalties often fail to be redistributed to local communities. This lack of financial compensation has been a major source of corporate-community conflict and peasant protests in Peru's <b>mineral</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> of Africa {{is one of}} {{the largest}} mineral {{industries}} in the world. Africa is the second biggest continent, with 30 million km² of land, which implies large quantities of resources. For many African countries, mineral exploration and production constitute significant parts of their economies and remain keys to future economic growth. Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first or second in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Gold mining is Africa's main mining resource.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> {{provides}} {{a major source}} of economic growth in Peru's national development. In 2006, Peru occupied a leading position in the global production of the following mineral commodities: fourth in arsenic trioxide, third in bismuth, third in copper, fifth in gold, fourth in lead, fourth in molybdenum, fourth in rhenium, first in silver, third in tin, and third in zinc. In Latin America, Peru was the first ranked producer of, in order of value, gold, silver, zinc, lead, tin, and tellurium and the second ranked producer of copper, molybdenum, and bismuth.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} {{solutions to the}} corporate-community conflict surrounding Peru’s <b>mineral</b> <b>industry,</b> including environmental licensing, the documentation of accountability, {{and the use of}} a local legitimacy strategy. Environmental licensing refers to the authority of the Peruvian government to control the pollution generated by mineral extraction corporations. Documenting accountability refers to the process by which citizens exercise a say in the activities and decisions of the government and industrial corporations. Lastly, the local legitimacy strategy is a type of community interaction model in which corporations exercise social responsibility by prioritizing the needs of the community.|$|E

25|$|At the {{national}} level, this trend {{could reduce the}} attraction of new investments and preclude Camisea's higher output needed for the regional economic development. On the other hand, Peru continues to encourage community development and environmental protection based on social responsibility and sustainable development principles. In spite of this strategy, the <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> {{continues to be the}} target of social protest due to mining operations' impact on livelihood resources. These events have affected the image of the mining industry and caused growing concern about the regional climate for mining investments.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} {{has played a}} moderate role in responding to corporate-community conflict arising from the <b>mineral</b> <b>industry.</b> In January 2012, the Humala administration established an international commission {{with the task of}} identifying ways to reduce the environmental effects of the Newmont Mining Corporation's Conga project. Newmont was forced to comply with the revised measures before resuming operations. When government officials presented the new terms to local community members in order to gain their consent, they were faced with considerable opposition and violent protests ensued. Thus, though the national {{government has}} taken some steps towards addressing social protest, it is often unable to adequately address communities' expectations about corporate accountability and the regulation of environmental damage caused by mining activities. Another example concerns mining conflict in Peru's Piura region. Between 1998 and 2003, conflicts arose between the Canadian company Manhattan Minerals and members of the Tambogrande community. Following a local referendum in which 93% of the community voted against mining operations, Manhattan Minerals left the region. Similar conflicts ensued when another corporation, Monterrico Minerals, began conducting exploration work in Piura's highland provinces. This conflict led to the death of two farmers during violent protests and incited many national and international actors to intervene. A referendum took place once again and more than 90% of the population voted against mining. Despite such opposition, Monterrico Metals and the government of Peru insisted that the mining operations go forward. According to the Community Development Journal, such conflicts demonstrate that the government is largely absent in helping community members and corporations to reach mutual agreements. As a result, local community members often view the government as a biased mediator that favors corporate interests. With a lack of government intervention, community members resort to protest in attempt to resolve issues stemming from the <b>mineral</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peruvian {{laws have}} {{attempted}} to ensure equitable mineral, crude oil, and gas exploration and production. Owing to these terms, an increased number of domestic and foreign companies, AngloGold Ashanti, Barrick Gold Corp., BHP Billiton plc., Cambior Inc., Falconbridge Ltd., Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Mitsubishi Corp., Peñoles, Teck Cominco Ltd., and others, have expressed interest in participating in prospecting, exploration, production, and {{distribution of natural gas}} and petroleum contracts with Perupetro S.A. and mineral properties with Centromín. The structure of the Peruvian <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> continued to change as a result of privatizations and joint-venture projects. The establishment of consortia in such deregulated industries as oil and gas, and joint ventures in energy and mining projects were becoming a common practice in Peru. According to the Ministerio de Energía y Minas, Peru was the seventh most attractive area for investments in exploration after, in order of investment attractiveness ranking, Tasmania (Australia), Nevada and Alaska (USA), Northwest Territories (Canada), Western Australia, and Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|While {{corporations}} {{state that}} mining operations will provide greater employment {{opportunities for the}} local population, many of their employees come from outside of the immediate area. In many cases, the employees are drawn from outside of the region in which the mining operations take place or outside of the country. This is because the mineral corporations require individuals with advanced skills to fill their positions. Thus, while Peru's <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> allows for greater employment at the national level, it often generates corporate-community conflict on a local scale. According to the Journal of Latin American Geography, members of rural communities often report {{that there is a}} lack of employment opportunities available at the mining sites and vocalize their frustration over the fact that a large proportion of the mine's employees come from outside of the local area. Despite such frustrations, mining corporations do offer some employment to individuals from surrounding rural communities. According to the World Development Journal, this has produced community-level tensions due to growing inequalities within the middle and upper-middle classes.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, President Fujimori {{implemented}} several {{market reforms}} that {{allowed for the}} growth of Peru's mineral sector. In 1995, the Fujimori government passed a land law (Law 26505) that granted mining corporations the right to use land for their operations in exchange for monetary compensation to the landowners. In addition, the Fujimori administration installed a new tax regime that exempted mining corporations from taxation and paying royalties until they regained their initial investments. Fujimori also spearheaded other reforms that removed restrictions on profit/capital remittances, eliminated performance requirements for foreign investments, reduced tariffs on imports and removed tariffs on exports, established simpler licensing procedures, modified policies regarding indigenous land tenure, lowered taxes, liberalized capital market, and privatized state firms and financial institutions. These changes facilitated a dramatic increase in new foreign direct investment (FDI) and allowed entry into the global market. In the period from 1990 to 1998, Peru's exports increased by over 85 percent. Out of this, the <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> accounts for 50 percent of Peru's total exports and has {{played a major role in}} its national economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The new {{operating}} process, {{which was}} the result of the privatization and joint-venture projects, incorporated policies that deal with economic and societal development issues and with environmental protection in a sustainable way. Private local interests owned most of the medium- and small-sized mining operations. More than 250 foreign mining companies have been established in Peru since 1990. Crude oil was transported through 1,754km pipelines, natural gas and natural gas liquids through 983km dual pipelines, and refined products through 13km pipelines. Important <b>mineral</b> <b>industry</b> ports included Callao, Chimbote, Ilo, Matarani, Paita, Puerto Maldonado, Salaverry, San Martin, San Nicolas, and Talara on the Pacific Ocean and Iquitos Pucallpa and yurimaguas on the Amazon River and its tributaries. Peru had an installed electrical generating capacity of 5,050 megawatts (MW), about 80% of which was accounted for by hydroelectric plants. The Peruvian Government raised about $2 billion from the privatization of its electrical sector and committed to an investment of about $20 million to install an additional 1,006 MW of capacity in the immediate future. The energy mix, by source, was hydro (74.5%), fossil fuel (24.5%), and others (1.0%).|$|E
