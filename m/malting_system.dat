Hence, the complex network of controlled proteolysis which facilitates tissue homeostasis in healthy individuals is deregulated and crucially contributes to the induction and progression of gastric cancer through processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, cell surface receptors, membrane-bound cytokines, and lateral adhesion molecules. Here, we summarize the recent reports on mechanisms how H. pylori utilizes a variety of extracellular proteases, involving the proteases Hp 0169 and high temperature requirement A (HtrA) of bacterial origin, and host matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs), a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of kilning and roasting temperatures on antioxidant activity of <b>malt</b> model <b>systems</b> prepared from combinations of glucose, proline, and ferulic acid. Model systems (initial a(w) = 0. 09, 6 % moisture) were heated at 60 degrees C for up to 24 h, at 90 degrees C for up to 120 min, and at 220 degrees C for up to 15 min. The antioxidant activity of the glucose-proline-ferulic acid model system increased significantly on heating at 60 degrees C; for 24 h or at 90 degrees C for 120 min. In contrast, the glucose-proline, ferulic acid-glucose, and ferulic acid-proline systems presented either nonsignificantly increased or unchanged antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of both the glucose-proline-ferulic acid and glucose-proline model systems increased significantly after heating at 220 degrees C for 10 min, followed by a significant decrease at 15 min. The data suggest that (1) at 60 degrees C, ferulic acid reacts with Maillard reaction products, resulting in a significant increase in antioxidant activity; (2) at 90 degrees C, the antioxidant activity of the glucose-proline-ferulic system comes from both ferulic acid and Maillard reaction products; and (3) at 220 degrees C, the major contributors to antioxidant activity in glucose-proline-ferulic acid and glucose-proline systems are glucose-proline reaction products...|$|R

In healthy adult, the main control of intestinal bacterial colonization occurs through gastric acidity but also other factors can influence the intestinal microenvironment such as pH, temperature, competition among different bacterial strains, peristalsis, drugs, radiotherapy and much more. Impaired microbial homeostasis leads to an alteration of the permeability of tissue, together with the activation of the intestinal immune <b>system</b> <b>MALT</b> (mucosal associated lymphoid tissue).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ocular adnexal lymphomas (OAL) {{belong to}} the most common {{malignancies}} of the orbit and eyelids and are now classified according to the WHO classification <b>system.</b> <b>MALT</b> lymphoma {{appears to be the}} most frequent OAL. Histology type and stage of OAL have been found predictors of patient survival. PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of a cohort of patients with OAL using the WHO classification and to compare outcome predictors with those of other studies using the WHO classification. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical profile at presentation, initial complaints and findings, classification and stage, treatment and outcome of 54 patients with biopsy proven and re-analyzed OAL seen between 1 January 1992 and 1 January 2002 at the UMC Utrecht, NL, were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox-regression survival analysis were applied to assess predictors of outcome. Results: Forty nine patients were found to have primary and five secondary lymphomas. Of those with primary OAL, 27 had MALT, eight diffuse large B-cell, six mantle cell and eight follicular cell lymphoma. Histology and stage showed a significant association with survival (Log-rank test: p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 002, respectively). A multivariate Cox-regression survival analysis showed histological type to be the only significant predictor for outcome. Looking at the dichotomy full remission versus not completely cured, gender was found to be a significant predictor (Log-rank test: p = 0. 005).

40|$|Gluten {{sensitive}} {{consumers and}} {{people suffering from}} coeliac disease account for up to 6 % {{of the general population}} (Catassi et al., 2013). These consumers must avoid foods which contain gluten and related proteins found in wheat, rye or barley. Beer is produced from barley malt and therefore contains hordeins, (gluten like proteins). Beers labelled as gluten-free must contain below 10 mg/kg hordeins (10 mg/kg hordeins = 20 mg/kg gluten under current regulations) to be considered safe for gluten sensitive consumers. Currently there are a limited number of methods available for reducing beer hordeins, the studies outlined in this thesis provide a range of tools for the beverage industry to reduce the hordein content of beer It is well known, that during malting and brewing hordeins are reduced, but they still remain in beer at levels above 10 mg/kg. During malting, hordeins are broken down to form new proteins in the growing plant. Model <b>malting</b> and brewing <b>systems</b> were developed and used to test, how the modification of the malting process could be used to reduce beer hordeins. It was shown, that by using a controlled malting and brewing regime, a range of barley cultivars produced beer with significant differences in levels of hordeins. Beer hordeins ranged from 10 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg. Another study revealed that when malting was prolonged, to maximise breakdown of proteins, beer hordeins can be reduced by up to 44 %. The natural breakdown of hordein during malting enhanced in a further study, when a protease was added to support the hordein degradation during steeping and germination. The enzyme addition resulted in a 46 % reduction in beer hordeins 2 when compared to the control. All of the malt treatments had little or no impact on malt quality. The hordein levels can also be reduced during the beer stabilisation process. Levels of beer hordein were tested after stabilisation using two different concentrations of silica gel and tannic acid. Silica gel was very effective in reducing beer hordeins, 90 % of beer hordeins were removed compared to the control beer. Beer hordeins could be reduced to below 10 mg/kg and the beer qualities such as foam, colour and flavour were not affected. Tannic acid also reduced beer hordein by up to 90 %, but it reduced foam stability and affected beer flavours. A further study described treatment of beer with microbial transglutaminase (mTG), to create bonds between hordein proteins, which increased particle size and allowed removal during filtration. The addition of the mTG led to a reduction of the beer hordein by up to 96 % in beer, and the impact on the resulting beer quality was minimal. These studies provide the industry with a toolbox of methods leading to the reduction of hordein in the final beer without negatively affecting beer quality...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diarrhoea {{and other}} {{gastrointestinal}} disorders {{are some of}} the most common manifestations of HIV-infection and AIDS. The mucosa-associated immune <b>system</b> (<b>MALT)</b> pertaining to the gastrointestinal tract probably houses the largest accumulation of immunocompetent cells in the body. Previous research has shown that the loss of CD 4 +T- cells during HIV-infection is much more pronounced in the mucosa than in the peripheral blood. This may be a consequence of the high level of viral replication seen in the mucosa. The reasons for these findings have been unclear. It has been suggested that the presence of HIV antigen may trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which results in CD 4 +T-cell activation making these cells prone to HIV infection. In this scenario HIV enhances its own replication by stimulating cytokine production. Objectives: 1.) to quantitate the mRNA expression of selected proinflammatory, regulatory and HIV-inhibitory cytokines in the mucosa of HIV-infected patients and to compare it to healthy controls. 2.) to study the changes in cytokine expression in the course of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods: HIV-infected patients underwent endoscopic biopsy of colonic mucosa before and one, four and nine months after the start of HAART. Healthy volunteers, who underwent a single endoscopic biopsy served as controls. HIV-RNA and CD 4 +T-cell counts were measured in the blood and in the biopsy specimens. Quantitative real time PCR assays were developed to determine the mRNA expression of TNF-&# 945;, IFN-&# 947;, IL- 6, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 16, CCL 3 and CCL 5 in the biopsy specimens. Specific hybridisation probes were used for the detection of the amplification products. Cytokine mRNA levels were normalised to mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Results: The sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay for each cytokine and GAPDH was high with a limit of quantification of ten template copies/capillary. The calibration curve was linear over 5 orders of magnitude with R 2 values > 0, 998. For each of the cytokine PCRs the mean efficiency as expressed by the slope of the standard calibration curve was < 3, 7 showing very little inter-assay variability (C. V. 2 % - 14 %). The intra-assay precision was satisfactory with C. V. < 10 % throughout the whole calibration range. Nine HIV- 1 infected males and one female were included in the study. The median (range) age was 42 (27  53). The median (range) plasma HIV RNA and CD 4 cell count at baseline was 4, 9 log- 10 copies/ml (3, 2  6, 3) and 210 cells/µl (23  1217) respectively. The control group consisted of four males and three females with a median (range) age of 56 (48  70). The expression of the proinflammatory cytokines in the colonic mucosa was significantly higher in the HIV-infected patients as compared to the healthy controls: median (IQR) [copies cytokine mRNA/ 1000 copies GAPDH mRNA]; TNF-?: 1, 67 (0, 35  3, 21) vs. 0, 08 (0, 06  0, 11) p< 0, 05; IFN-?: 0, 11 (0, 09  0, 72) vs. 0, 02 (0, 01  0, 02) p< 0, 05; IL- 6 : 0, 24 (0, 14  0, 95) vs. 0, 01 (0, 00  0, 01) p< 0, 05. The expression level of the regulatory cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 10 was also higher in the HIV-infected study population: IL- 4 : 0, 06 (0, 03  0, 41) vs. 0, 01 (0, 01  0, 02), p< 0, 05; IL- 10 : 0, 35 (0, 11  0, 84) vs. 0, 01 (0, 01  0, 02) p< 0, 05. Accordingly the chemokines CCL 3 and CCL 5 were elevated in the HIV-infected study population: CCL 3 : 1, 02 (0, 69  3, 81) vs. 0, 11 (0, 10  0, 35) p< 0, 05; CCL 5 : 25, 68 (15, 24  132, 10) vs. 8, 80 (6, 40  10, 72); p< 0, 05. Despite a dramatic decline of virus load in both the blood and the mucosa and a rise of CD 4 +T-cells in the blood and the mucosa the high level of expression of all studied cytokines remained unchanged throughout nine months of HAART. Discussion: With the elimination of the HIV antigen from the mucosa we expected the expression of proinflammatory cytokines to fall. As cytokine production remained high despite fully suppressive antiviral therapy factors other than HIV must be responsible for causing mucosal inflammation. We suggest that the barrier of the colonic mucosa may have been disrupted earlier in the course of the infection leading to a continuous influx of luminal antigen, which maintains the inflammatory response even in the absence of the offending agent. The rapid repopulation of the mucosa with CD 4 +T-cells shown in this study could be explained by the chemotactic properties of CCL 3 and CCL 5 whose expression has been shown to be more than ten fold that of controls. Both the presence of a large number of CD 4 +T-cells and the continued high levels of inflammatory cytokines leading to T-cell activation could be the basis for the explosive virus replication often seen in the case of treatment interruption or failure...|$|R
