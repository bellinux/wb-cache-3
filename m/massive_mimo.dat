However, {{in the context of}} broadband SM transmission, the severe inter-symbol-interference (ISI) caused by the frequency-selective fading channels can not be ignored, which leads to very detrimental effects on the achievable system performance, especially for single-carrier SM (SC-SM) transmission schemes. To the best of the author's knowledge, none of the previous researchers have been able to provide a thorough analysis on the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) of the <b>massive</b> SC-SM <b>MIMO</b> uplink transmission. In this context, the uplink SE of single-cell <b>massive</b> SC-SM <b>MIMO</b> system is analyzed, and a tight closed-form lower bound is proposed to quantify the SE when the base station (BS) uses maximum ratio (MR) combining for multi-user detection. The impacts of imperfect channel estimation and transmit correlation are all considered. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the tightness of our proposed SE lower bound. Both the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the SE of uplink single-cell <b>massive</b> SC-SM <b>MIMO</b> system has the potential to outperform the uplink SE achieved by single-antenna UEs.

It empowers value creation enabled by sustainable business models. Typical use cases for 5G are high capacity / high performance outdoor and indoor broadband access in dense urban areas, higher user mobility, Internet of Things, extreme real-time communication, ultra-reliable and lifeline communication, as well as broadcast-like services.How will 5G enrich our everyday life according to the White Paper?In addition to supporting {{the evolution of the}} established prominent mobile broadband use cases, 5G will support countless emerging use cases with a high variety of applications. As already mentioned, 5G will {{allow us to}} cover use cases ranging from “Internet of Things” applications with very low bandwidth requirements to use cases with a very high demand on data rate and latency. Furthermore, NGMN envisages delay-sensitive video applications, high speed entertainment applications in vehicles, and “mobility on demand” services for connected objects. There will also be new services enabled in the health and safety area with extreme requirements in terms of system reliability. In addition, future services will be delivered across a fully heterogeneous environment and a wide range of devices such as smartphones, wearables, and Machine Type Communication.Which demands must networks of the future fulfil to manage the tremendous growth in connectivity and traffic density?The 5G use cases demand very diverse and sometimes extreme requirements. In the NGMN White Paper, requirements have been defined in six distinct areas: User experience, system performance, devices, enhanced services, business models, network deployment & operation. It is anticipated that a single solution to satisfy all the extreme requirements at the same time may lead to over-specification and high cost. Nevertheless, several use cases are anticipated to be active concurrently in the same operator network, thus requiring a high degree of flexibility and scalability of 5G networks. NGMN envisions an architecture that leverages the structural separation of hardware and software, as well as the programmability offered by SDN and NFV. As such, the 5G architecture will be a native SDN/ NFV architecture covering aspects ranging from devices, (mobile/ fixed) infrastructure, network functions, value enabling capabilities and all the management functions to orchestrate the 5G system.
