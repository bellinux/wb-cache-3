40|$|The way of {{genealogy}} to {{the library}} A study {{in the emergence of}} a <b>microfilm</b> <b>archive</b> of Växjö Diocese- and Country Library My purpose is to describe the underlying factors that influenced the growth of a <b>microfilm</b> <b>archive</b> of genealogy in Växjö Diocese- and Country Library and analysing the role of the country librarian Eric Eilert in this process. I do this by using an actor and structure analysis. The source material is mostly taken from the Municipal Archives in Växjö. To get a better preunderstanding, I describe how the microfilming of genealogical material was made available by the Mormons, but also the actions of the Swedish government. I also describe specifically what was done in the Växjö Library. My study shows that the specific underlying factors, that influenced the growth of a <b>microfilm</b> <b>archive,</b> was Mormon filming of the Swedish archives, the skills of AB Rekolid, the reorganization to a Diocese- and Country Library in Växjö, the demand of local scientists for research material, further the need of protection of the borrowed documents from abrasion damage and the decision to buy a reading unit. The role of Eric Eilert in the building up process of a <b>microfilm</b> <b>archive</b> was crucial. He was acting as an agent in several different structures such as AB Rekolid, the library board, the land archives in Vadstena, the County council in Kronoberg, the National Archives and the Library in Växjö. He was responsive for the requests and anchored each step of the process within the library board and the County council. He was also behind the financial plan where the county council and the municipalities would share the cost of <b>microfilm</b> <b>archive...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of International Relations, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 82 - 88). This thesis investigates {{the area of}} Marash from {{the eyes of the}} missionaries when the Ottoman Empire was approaching to the First World War, between 1913 and 1915. Was the crisis that the Ottomans faced an opportunity for the missionary organizations? It aims to demonstrate the demographical change, the psychology of the local population, the attitudes of the missionaries, the system in the schools and hospitals and how the local Ottoman population handled the war crises. This was done by revealing various untapped archives. Methodologically, the archival research employed in this thesis can be regarded as a qualitative, historical analysis. Some of the missionary letters, correspondences and annual meeting reports were investigated by utilizing screening method at the <b>microfilm</b> <b>archives.</b> Five main primary sources were utilized in this thesis. Firstly, letters and correspondences from Bilkent University, Library <b>microfilm</b> <b>archives</b> and online archives of the Universities were used. Secondly, The Missionary Herald was reviewed. Thirdly, the annual reports and fourthly the memoirs, diaries and books of the missionaries were utilized. Finally, Ottoman Empire archives were used. The thesis arrived at three main conclusions, firstly, the deteriorating relationship between the German Hulfbond and ABCFM indicated the complex and intermingled relationship of missionary organizations with the existing power relationships of their governments and how involved they were with the politics. Secondly, it revealed that pre-war periods or crises times were an opportunity for the missionary organizations to spread their values and beliefs and influence local populations. Finally, ABCFM has strengthened its position. by Çağla Kılıç. M. S...|$|E

40|$|This article {{consists}} of three parts. First, I will review the major themes of Quentin Meillassoux’s After Finitude. Since some of my readers will have read this book and others not, I will try {{to strike a balance}} between clear summary and fresh critique. Second, I discuss an unpublished book by Meillassoux unfamiliar to all readers of this article, except those scant few that may have gone digging in the <b>microfilm</b> <b>archives</b> of the École normale supérieure. The book in question is Meillassoux’s revised doctoral dissertation L’Inexistence divine (or The Divine Inexistence), with its seemingly bizarre vision of a God who does not yet exist but might exist in the future. Without literally accepting this view, I will claim that it is philosophically interesting in ways that even a hardened sceptic might be able to appreciate. Third and finally, I will speculate on the possible future of Meillassoux’s speculative materialism itself. And here I mean its future development not by Meillassoux, but by those readers who might be inspired by his book. Plato could never have predicted the emergence of Aristotle’s philosophy, despite the obvious debt of the latter to the former. Nor could Descartes have predicted Spinoza and Leibniz, nor Kant the German Idealists, and neither could Husserl in 1901 have foreseen the later emergence of Heidegger. How are the works of interesting philosophers transformed by later thinkers of comparable importance? While it may seem that there are countless ways to do this, I think there are only two basic ways in which this happens: you can radicalize your predecessors, or you can reverse them. I will close this article with a few words about these two methods, and try to imagine how Meillassoux might be radicalized or reversed by some future admirer. My view is that the more important thinkers are, the easier they are to radicalize or reverse. This helps explain why the great philosophers of the West have so often appeared in clusters, succeeding one another at relatively brief intervals during periods of especial ferment...|$|E
