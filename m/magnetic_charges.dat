500|$|The {{most common}} way of {{analyzing}} the global {{variations in the}} Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements {{to a set of}} spherical harmonics. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such nodal lines is the absolute value of the order [...] The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the degree ℓ. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of <b>magnetic</b> <b>charges</b> {{at the center of the}} Earth. A monopole is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A dipole is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.|$|E

Vortex-rings start to appear from the MAP and MAC configurations when the winding num-ber n = 3. The MAP configurations possess zero net <b>magnetic</b> <b>charge</b> whereas the MAC configurations possess net <b>magnetic</b> <b>charge</b> 4 pin/e. In the MAP configurations, when n = 1 and 2, the monopole-antimonopole pair is bounded by the Z 0 field flux string. When n = 1 the monopole possesses <b>magnetic</b> <b>charge</b> + 2 pie whereas the antimonopole possesses <b>magnetic</b> <b>charge</b> − 2 pie. However, in the MAC configurations there is no string connecting the monopole and the adjacent antimonopole. When n = 1 the monopole pos-sesses <b>magnetic</b> <b>charge</b> + 4 pie whereas the antimonopole possesses <b>magnetic</b> <b>charge</b> − 4 pie.
