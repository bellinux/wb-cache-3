40|$|The {{study of}} triangles in graphs is a {{standard}} tool in network analysis, leading to measures such as the transitivity, i. e., the fraction of paths of length 2 that participate in triangles. Real-world networks are often directed, {{and it can be}} difficult to "measure" this network structure meaningfully. We propose a collection of directed closure values for <b>measuring</b> <b>triangles</b> in directed graphs in a way that is analogous to transitivity in an undirected graph. Our study of these values reveals much information about directed triadic closure. For instance, we immediately see that reciprocal edges have a high propensity to participate in triangles. We also observe striking similarities between the triadic closure patterns of different web and social networks. We perform mathematical and empirical analysis showing that directed configuration models that preserve reciprocity cannot capture the triadic closure patterns of real networks.

40|$|Plant surface {{areas were}} {{measured}} from samples of two common submersed aquatics with widely diverging morphologies: Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) and water stargrass (Heteranthera dubia (Jacq.) MacM.). Measures for the highly dissected leaves of Eurasian watermilfoil involved {{development of a}} regression equation relating leaf length to direct measures of a subsample of leaf parts. Measures for the simple leaves of the stargrass were sums of <b>measured</b> <b>triangles.</b> Stem surfaces for both species were calculated as measured cylinders. Though {{the means of the}} stem length and leaf length were larger for stargrass samples, their mean surface area was 95 cm 2 which was less than the 108 cm 2 recorded for Eurasian watermilfoil samples. Relating surface area to dry weight for the stargrass was straightforward, with 1 mg of dry weight yielding an average 0. 678 cm 2 of surface area. Biomass measures for the water milfoil were confounded by the additional weight of epiphytic algae persisting on cleaned samples. The results suggest that a lesstime consuming method for surface area measures of plants with highly dissected leaves and a caveat for using biomass measures to estimate surface area in such plants...|$|R

40|$|Precise Point Positioning (PPP) is a {{technique}} {{used to determine the}} position of receiver antenna without communication with the reference station. It may be an alternative solution to differential measurements, where maintaining a connection with a single RTK station or a regional network of reference stations RTN is necessary. This situation is especially common in areas with poorly developed infrastructure of ground stations. A lot of research conducted so far {{on the use of the}} PPP technique has been concerned about the development of entire day observation sessions. However, this paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of accuracy of absolute determination of position from observations which last between 1 to 7 hours with the use of four permanent services which execute calculations with PPP technique such as: Automatic Precise Positioning Service (APPS), Canadian Spatial Reference System Precise Point Positioning (CSRS-PPP), GNSS Analysis and Positioning Software (GAPS) and magicPPP - Precise Point Positioning Solution (magicGNSS). On the basis of acquired results of measurements, it can be concluded that at least two-hour long measurements allow acquiring an absolute position with an accuracy of 2 - 4 cm.

40|$|Pauli-spin {{blockade}} (PSB) is a {{transport phenomenon}} in double quantum dots {{that allows for}} a type of spin to charge conversion often used to probe fundamental physics such as spin relaxation and singlet-triplet coupling. In this paper we theoretically explore Pauli-spin blockade {{as a function of}} magnetic field B applied parallel to the substrate. In the well-studied low magnetic field regime, where PSB occurs in the forward (1, 1) →(0, 2) tunneling direction, we highlight some aspects of PSB that are not discussed in detail in existing literature, including the change in size of both bias <b>triangles</b> <b>measured</b> in the forward and reverse biasing directions as a function of B. At higher fields we predict a crossover to PSB" in which current is blockaded in the reverse direction due to the occupation of a spin singlet as opposed to the traditional triplet blockade that occurs at low fields. The onset of reverse PSB coincides with the development of a tail like feature in the <b>measured</b> bias <b>triangles</b> and occurs when the Zeeman energy of the polarized triplet equals the exchange energy in the (0, 2) charge configuration. In Si quantum dots these fields are experimentally accessible; thus, this work suggests a way to probe singlet to triplet relaxation mechanisms in quantum dots when both electrons occupy the same quantum dot.

40|$|Many digital models used in entertainment, medical visualization, {{material}} science, architecture, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), {{and mechanical}} Computer Aided Design (CAD) are {{defined in terms}} of their boundaries. These boundaries are often approximated using triangle meshes. The complexity of models, which can be <b>measured</b> by <b>triangle</b> count, increases rapidly with the precision of scanning technologies and with the need for higher resolution. An increase in mesh complexity results in an increase of storage requirement, which in turn increases the frequency of disk access or cache misses during mesh processing, and hence decreases performance. For example, in a test application involving a mesh with 55 million triangles in a machine with 4 GB of memory versus a machine with 1 GB of memory, performance decreases by a factor of about 6000 because of memory thrashing. To help reduce memory thrashing, we focus on decreasing the average storage requirement per <b>triangle</b> <b>measured</b> in 32 -bit integer references per triangle (rpt). This thesis covers compact connectivity representation for triangle meshes and discusses four data structures: 1. Sorted Opposite Table (SOT), which uses 3 rpt and has been extended to support tetrahedral meshes. 2. Sorted Quad (SQuad), which uses about 2 rpt and has been extended to support streaming. 3. Laced Ring (LR), which uses about 1 rpt and offers an excellent compromise between storage compactness and performance of mesh traversal operators. 4. Zipper, an extension of LR, which uses about 6 bits per triangle (equivalently 0. 19 rpt), therefore is the most compact representation. The triangle mesh data structures proposed in this thesis support the standard set of mesh connectivity operators introduced by the previously proposed Corner Table at an amortized constant time complexity. They can be constructed in linear time and space from the Corner Table or any equivalent representation. If geometry is stored as 16 -bit coordinates, using Zipper instead of the Corner Table increases the size of the mesh that can be stored in core memory by a factor of about 8.
