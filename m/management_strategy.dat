5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence.

The National Park Service later followed the precedents established by the army and incorporated them into their own <b>management</b> <b>strategy.</b> During its tenure at Yellowstone, the army developed regulations that put emphasis on protection of park resources, safety of visitors, and positive but effective visitor interaction. Under the watchful eyes of the army, the geothermal features, forests and wildlife of Yellowstone were protected from vandalism, fire and poaching. These practices were adopted by the National Park Service and continue as a foundation of National Park management policy. Proactive actions by the army in stopping poaching in the park led to {{the passing of the}} Lacey Act of 1894, which established legal protection for the wildlife and remedies for dealing with violators.|$|E
5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor <b>Management</b> <b>Strategy,</b> costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a management plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E

Despite the need for forest adaptation, an overall evaluation of the efficacy of current <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> is lacking. Here we describe a theoretical framework for classifying <b>management</b> <b>strategies,</b> explicitly recognizing trade-offs with other, untargeted ecosystem components. We then use this framework to provide a quantitative synthesis of the efficacy of <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> in the Mediterranean basin. Our review shows that research has focused on strategies aimed at decreasing risk and promoting resistance in the short-term, rather than enhancing long-term resilience. In addition, <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> aiming at short-term benefits frequently have unintended consequences on other adaptation objectives and untargeted ecosystem components. Novel empirical studies and experiments focusing both on adaptation objectives and multiple responses and processes at the ecosystem level are needed. Such progress is essential to improve the scientific basis of forest <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> and support forest adaptation in the Mediterranean basin...|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, growing public {{opposition}} to the removal of feral horses prompted <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> changes, and today the herds within the Theodore Roosevelt National Park are managed {{for the purposes of}} historical demonstration. However, in 1986 the park added outside bloodlines with the aim of modifying the appearance of the Nokota. Park management felt that the horses created with the outside bloodlines would sell better at subsequent auctions. The dominant herd stallions were removed and replaced with two feral stallions from Bureau of Land Management Mustang herds, a crossbred Shire stallion, a Quarter Horse stallion and an Arabian stallion. At {{the same time that the}} stallion replacements took place, a large number of horses from the park were rounded up and sold. At the 1986 auction, concerned about the welfare of the Nokota horse, Leo and Frank Kuntz purchased 54 horses, including the dominant stallion, a blue roan. This was in addition to smaller numbers of horses purchased in 1981, 1991 and 1997. After researching the history of the breed, the Kuntzs stated that they had found evidence that the horses in the park were probably related to the remaining horses from the band of 250 Sitting Bull horses, who had been range-bred by the Marquis de Mores, who founded the town of Medora. However, the short-lived Nokota Horse Association claimed that there was no evidence for this claim.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} value level in {{learning}} oral Arabic among students at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia and its correlation {{with the use}} of resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies.</b> The concept of value and resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> is derived from the self-regulated learning framework. Value consists of three main components, namely intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and task value. Meanwhile, resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> consist of four components, namely time and study management, effort regulation, peer learning and help seeking. The purposes of this study are to investigate (1) the value level among overall students, (2) the correlation between students’ value and their use of resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies,</b> and (3) the differences in the use of resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> between students with different level of value. The sample of this study comprised of 455 students and the data were collected through a questionnaire adapted from The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The study reveals that (1) the value level of students is high; (2) there are significant correlations between value and the use of resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> among students; and (3) the high value group of student uses significantly higher in all components of resource <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> than the moderate group. This study has some classroom implications. It suggests that value components should be nurtured among students by selecting appropriate learning activities. Collaborative learning activities should also involve students of mixed value level which can be assessed through their prior learning experience and gender...|$|R
