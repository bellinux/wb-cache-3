25|$|While {{the term}} can include acts {{committed}} in the air, on land (especially across national borders or in connection with taking over and robbing a car or train), or in other major bodies of water or on a shore, {{this article focuses on}} <b>maritime</b> <b>piracy.</b> It does not normally include crimes committed against people traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). Piracy or pirating is the name of a specific crime under customary international law and also the name of a number of crimes under the municipal law of a number of states. In the early 21st century, seaborne piracy against transport vessels remains a significant issue (with estimated worldwide losses of US$16billion per year in 2007), particularly in the waters between the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and also in the Strait of Malacca and Singapore.|$|E

In the Gulf of Guinea, <b>maritime</b> <b>piracy</b> has also led to pressure on offshore oil and gas production, providing security for offshore installations and supply vessels is often paid for by oil companies rather than the respective governments. In the late 2000s, the emergence of piracy off the coast of Somalia spurred a multi-national effort led by the United States to patrol the waters near the Horn of Africa. In 2011, Brazil also created an anti-piracy unit on the Amazon River. Sir Peter Blake, a New Zealand world champion yachtsman, had been killed by pirates on the Amazon river in 2001.|$|E

40|$|There are a {{multitude}} of maritime security challenges for Asian States ranging from terrorism, drug-trafficking, gun running, people smuggling, interstate conflict over <b>maritime</b> claims, <b>piracy</b> and illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing. This paper touches upon two challenges - piracy and IUU fishing - primarily {{in the context of}} the security issues raised for Southeast Asian States. Its narrow focus has been scoped by participation in the Sino- Australian Research Program and it is acknowledged that maritime security issues in the region are significantly more complex that the discussion this paper permits. Nevertheless, the link between piracy and IUU fishing and the measures taken this century to curb both activities are worthy subjects of research...|$|R
50|$|Unarmed, the {{security}} guards attempted to repel the attackers for about 40 minutes by firing water cannon, zigzagging the skiff, and using a LRAD, a non-lethal weapon that fires focused sound beams producing excruciating pain. A distress signal was received at 0447 hours UTC by the International <b>Maritime</b> Bureau's <b>Piracy</b> Reporting Centre, in Kuala Lumpur. After the pirates boarded the ship and continued to shoot at {{the security}} force, the guards managed to escape by jumping overboard. They were rescued from the sea by a German navy helicopter, and taken first to the French light monitoring frigate Nivôse before being transferred to the Jean de Vienne, a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Marine Nationale.|$|R

50|$|The {{volume of}} {{commerce}} between Rome and India was huge since {{the conquest of}} Egypt by the Romans, according to the historian Strabo: 120 Roman vessels sailed every year from Berenice Troglodytica and many times touched Aden in southern Arabia Felix on their travel to India, while doing the Spice Route.

50|$|The Fatimids {{then sent}} a {{military}} campaign composed of Bedouin tribes of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym from Egypt to Ifriqiya. The {{invasion of the}} Bedouin (1051-1052) led to great hardship after the defeat at Jabal Haydaran, severely impacting agriculture in Ifriqiya. The conquest of Kairouan in 1057 resulted in further anarchy. The Zirids lost control over the hinterland and were only able to retain the coastal areas, the capital being moved to Mahdia. With the growth of Bedouin Emirates and the continuing insecurity inland, the economy of Ifriqiya looked increasingly towards the Mediterranean, with the result the coastal cities grew in importance through <b>maritime</b> trade and <b>piracy.</b>|$|R
