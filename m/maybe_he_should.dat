25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Hubbard {{proposed}} marriage to Northrup. According to Northrup's later recollections she repeatedly refused him but relented after {{he threatened to}} kill himself. She told him: [...] "All right, I'll marry you, if that's going to save you." [...] They were married {{in the middle of}} the night of August 10, 1946 at Chestertown, Maryland after awakening a minister and roping in his wife and housekeeper to serve as witnesses. It was not until much later that Northrup discovered that Hubbard had never been divorced from his first wife, Margaret [...] "Polly" [...] Grubb; the marriage was bigamous. Ironically, the wedding took place only 30 miles from the town where Hubbard had married his first wife thirteen years previously. The wedding attracted criticism from L. Sprague de Camp, another science fiction colleague of Hubbard's, who suggested to the Heinleins that he supposed [...] "Polly was tiresome about not giving him his divorce so he could marry six other gals who were all hot & moist over him. How many girls is a man entitled to in one lifetime, anyway? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be reincarnated as a rabbit." ...|$|E
500|$|Star Treks creator, Gene Roddenberry, who wielded {{significant}} influence despite his ill health, hated the script. Meyer's {{first meeting with}} Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming {{out of the room}} within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous Star Trek film (The Wrath of Khan), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought {{there was no evidence that}} bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century. When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of Saavik, Meyer replied that [...] "I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't like what I plan on doing with her, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say." [...] After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns. By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.|$|E
50|$|This assault convinces {{three of}} the tenants to move out. Mason's girlfriend, Pamela is tired of living in an old, {{depressing}} building with a guy whose art career is going nowhere. She dumps Mason, packs up and before leaving, advises Mason to quit being an artist and get a steady job. The Rileys' friends, Muriel and Sid Hogensin take Lacey's bribe and decide {{to move to a}} retirement home in New Jersey. Frank feels a little betrayed by the Hogensins for taking Lacey's money but they explain that the building doesn't feel like home anymore. They advise Frank that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> and Faye <b>should</b> come live with them at the retirement home. With the assault and Faye's dementia growing, Frank contemplates giving in.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{the hour}} of the feeding of the sacred lions which the Fung keep in the pit about {{the base of the}} idol," [...] {{explained}} Shadrach. Then he added, [...] "Unless <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be rescued, I believe that Black Windows will be given to the lions to-night, which is that of full moon and a festival of Harmac, though <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> will be kept till the next full moon when all the Fung come up to worship." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
2500|$|Also panned was {{the fact}} that the film was based on a bedtime story Shyamalan told to his children; Pete Vonder Haar of Film Threat commented: [...] "If Shyamalan is going to use his kids as a focus group for future projects, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> start making movies for Nickelodeon already and stop wasting our time." [...] Coincidentally, Shyamalan went on to direct a film {{adaptation}} of Nickelodeon's [...] television series, which also received overwhelmingly negative reviews.|$|E
2500|$|However, Faugheen's career took a major turn as {{just before}} the start of the Punchestown festival in late April 2014, his stablemate Vautour [...] "failed a late fitness test" [...] {{according}} to Mullins, that made them switch targets during that week with Faugheen running instead in the early Tuesday's race Herald Champion Novice Hurdle which was over the 2 miles trip. In the race he was against a couple of Vautour's former rivals of which Faugheen [...] "made light work" [...] and made Mullins to reconsider his future prospect: [...] "You'd have to consider staying hurdling with him next season. Looking at him beforehand, I thought he was a chaser, but there's no harm in having another good hurdler and that would certainly make you think that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> stay at this game".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't {{anything}} {{you had done}} to make him unhappy, but he is afraid you ain't happy in yourself; and Feemy, my dear, you should always remember, that though Thady is rough in his manners, and perhaps not at all times so gentle in his words as <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be, his heart is in the right place,--at any rate where you are concerned. Though <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> doesn't say so as often as others might, he's a very fond brother to you." ...|$|R
5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that <b>maybe</b> this means <b>he</b> <b>should</b> give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph, <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> {{sorry and}} <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> isn't," [...] muttered Stanley. [...] "I guess {{he ought to}} have a thrashing. Anyway, I am done with him," [...] and he flung back the coat Tom had offered him.|$|R
60|$|Could he borrow of any one? Had he {{nothing of}} his own to sell or exchange? Ah! {{if it had not}} been for that stupid hoard of little David's, he might have had even so much! By-the-bye, some of that {{collection}} was his own. He might quite lawfully take that back again. How much could it be? How much did he put in last week? the week before? Oh, never mind; some of it was his at all events; there was no harm in taking that. Most likely he should be able to restore it four-fold when Colonel Carey made his present; or, if not, nobody knew exactly what was in Toby Fillpot; and after all very likely they would forget all about it; people could not think about pigs when Mamma was ill; or, <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> go to join his ship, and hear no more of it. So he came home, and crossed the paddock just as the dinner-bell was ringing, opening the hall-door as the children were running across it to the dining-room.|$|E

50|$|Back at Daniel's place, Sofia {{wakes up}} beside Daniel. Worried {{that she will}} miss her flight, she says that they need a {{breather}} {{so they can see}} if what they have is real. He insists that he loves her but Sofia says it's just hormones and sex. If this is real, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> see other women while she's gone. If he doesn't get sweaty palms with them, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> does love her. He says that this is crazy but she tells him that this will convince her that he really feels this only for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor fellow! <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> {{was afraid}} {{if he came}} towards the school he would be arrested.

50|$|In the film, Manjunath {{is shown}} {{watching}} {{what happens after}} he dies. He is starting to {{feel that it is}} all pointless.

What he fought was something very big and very important.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the ending}} scene, Hashem sits weeping over his son's body and {{looking to the}} skies.
