500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 17th century, John Tradescant the elder created a wunderkammer (called Tradescant's Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a [...] "mermaid's hand". P. T. Barnum's 19th century taxidermal hoax called the Fiji mermaid has been {{mentioned}} above. Others have perpetrated similar hoaxes, which are usually papier-mâché fabrications or parts of deceased creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together for the appearance of a grotesque mermaid. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, pictures of Fiji [...] "mermaids" [...] circulated on the Internet as supposed examples of items that had washed up amid the devastation, though they were no <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> Barnum's exhibit.|$|E

In fact, it proves only {{that there is no}} onto function from the integers to the reals; by itself it says nothing about the sizes of sets. Set size measurement and comparison, like all mathematics, should be chosen to fit the needs of an application domain. Cantor's countability relation is not a useful way to compare set sizes...|$|R
500|$|Writing in the Toronto Star, Vinay Menon calls [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] "dazzling" [...] {{and writes}} of [...] "Joss Whedon's inimitable genius"; {{he goes on}} to say [...] "(f)or a show that already violates {{conventions}} and morphs between genres, its allegorical narrative zigging and zagging seamlessly across chatty comedy, drama and over-the-top horror, 'Once More, with Feeling' is a towering achievement The show may be anchored by existential weightiness, it may be painted with broad, supernatural brushstrokes, but in the end, this coming-of-age story, filled with angst and alienation, is <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> any other so-called teen drama So let's add another line of gushing praise: 'Once More, with Feeling' is rhapsodic, original, deeply affecting, and ultimately, transcendental. Quite simply, television at its best." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{change from}} full motion video to {{computer}} generated characters in End of Ages was well received. Macworld {{stated that the}} change was initially jarring, but ultimately helped increase the realism of the game. IGN's Juan Castro said that the characters felt <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the full motion video actors of previous games; one reason, the reviewer stated, was because the actors spoke their lines with real conviction. Gamezone credited each character's individualized body language as contributing to their realism. GameSpot stated that Esher moved and acted like a real person, and that the voice of David Ogden Stiers brought [...] "this interesting character to life"; the reviewer did feel that the revelation of Esher and Yeesha's motivations was a letdown, as the character's true motivations were revealed [...] "with all the unpleasant abruptness of turning on bright, fluorescent lights in a dark room." [...] Dissenting reviewers such as 1UP.com and G4tv considered the character's monologues [...] "hyper emotional", although reviewer Karen Chu admitted the characters still presented a compelling morality play.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} been called [...] "feminist", and more {{specifically}} [...] "vintage Atwood-feminist", but Atwood disagrees, saying, [...] "I wouldn't even call it feminist. Every time you write something {{from the point of}} view of a woman, people say that it's feminist." [...] The Penelopiads antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in Cat's Eye, and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship: [...] "Consider us pure symbol. We're no <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> money." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} one of two X-Files episodes to take place in real time—wherein events are {{presented}} at the same rate that the audience experiences them—the other being the sixth season episode [...] "Triangle". Due {{to the nature of the}} shooting schedule, the episode was relatively cheap to film and production moved at a quick pace. Initially, the actors struggled with the new cinéma vérité style of the episode, and several takes were needed for scenes during the first few days, but these problems receded as filming progressed. On one night, three-and-a-half pages of script were shot in only two hours; the normal rate for The X-Files was three to four pages a day. Both Watkins and Mills likened the filming of the episode to live theater. The former noted, [...] "In a sense we were doing theater: we were doing an act, or half of a whole act in one take." [...] Anderson called the performance [...] "fun" [...] to shoot, and highlighted [...] "Scully getting pissed off at the camera crew" [...] as her favorite part to play. She further noted that [...] "it was interesting to make the adjustment to playing something <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> you might play for television." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1930 Gielgud {{finished}} the season playing Hamlet. Williams's production used the complete {{text of the}} play. This {{was regarded as a}} radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. Sybil Thorndike said, [...] "I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams... I've had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the life I live in, and moved, moved beyond words." [...] The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers. Demand was so great that the cast moved to the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened. The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence. Gielgud's Hamlet was richly praised by the critics. Ivor Brown called it [...] "a tremendous performance... the best Hamlet of [...] experience." [...] James Agate wrote, [...] "I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water-mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time." ...|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

500|$|Lauer {{thought that}} the surge in {{interest}} in bacon products prior to the book's publication was [...] "media driven". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be [...] "the one thing that people are unwilling to give up". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit {{an end to the}} trend of interest in bacon. She commented, [...] "Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it— that sweet and salty combination of flavors." [...] She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. [...] "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon," [...] said Lauer. She stated that [...] "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen." [...] The book was marketed as the [...] "most comprehensive book about bacon to date". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).|$|E

2500|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "First Principles of Documentary" [...] (1932), Grierson {{argued that the}} {{principles}} of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the [...] "original" [...] actor and [...] "original" [...] scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials [...] "thus taken from the raw" [...] can be <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's views align with the Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov's contempt for dramatic fiction as [...] "bourgeois excess", though with considerably more subtlety. Grierson's definition of documentary as [...] "creative treatment of actuality" [...] has gained some acceptance, though it presents philosophical questions about documentaries containing stagings and reenactments.|$|E

2500|$|Sagan was {{a critic}} of Plato, having said of the ancient Greek philosopher: [...] "Science and {{mathematics}} were {{to be removed from}} the hands of the merchants and the artisans.

He advised the astronomers not to waste their time observing the stars and planets. It was better, he believed, just to think about them. Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by Democritus and the other Ionians.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, some scientists, like Andrei Linde, have {{considered}} that consciousness, like spacetime, might {{have its own}} intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than)</b> material objects. Hypotheses of consciousness and spacetime explain consciousness in describing a [...] "space of conscious elements", often encompassing a number of extra dimensions. Electromagnetic theories of consciousness solve the binding problem of consciousness in saying that the electromagnetic field generated by the brain is the actual carrier of conscious experience, there is however disagreement about the implementations of such a theory relating to other workings of the mind. Quantum mind theories use quantum theory in explaining certain properties of the mind. Explaining the process of free will through quantum phenomena is a popular alternative to determinism.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1965 essay [...] "Command and Compliance", which {{originated}} {{in his work}} as an expert {{witness for the prosecution}} at the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials, the German historian Hans Buchheim wrote there was no coercion to murder Jews and others, and all who committed such actions did so out of free will. Buchheim wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders [...] "were both more numerous and <b>more</b> <b>real</b> <b>than</b> those concerned are generally prepared to admit", and that he found no evidence that SS men who refused to carry out criminal orders were sent to concentration camps or executed. Moreover, SS rules prohibited acts of gratuitous sadism, as Himmler wished for his men to remain [...] "decent"; acts of sadism were carried out on the initiative of those who were either especially cruel or wished to prove themselves ardent National Socialists. Finally, he argued that those of a non-criminal bent who committed crimes did so because they wished to conform to the values of the group they had joined and were afraid of being branded [...] "weak" [...] by their colleagues if they refused.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, however, a few critics {{were willing to}} {{consider}} Marston as a writer who {{was very much in}} control of the world he creates. T. S.

[...] Marston's tragic style is Senecan and although his characters may appear, on Eliot's own admission, [...] "lifeless", they are instead used as types to convey their [...] "theoretical implications". Eliot in particular admired Sophonisba and saw how Marston's plays, with their apparently stylised characters and bitter portrayal of a world where virtue and honour only arouse [...] "dangerous envy" [...] (Sophonisba; Act 1, scene 1, line 45) in those around them, actually bring to life [...] "a pattern behind the pattern into which the characters deliberately involve themselves: the kind of pattern which we perceive in our own lives only at rare moments of inattention and detachment".|$|E
