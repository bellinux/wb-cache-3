40|$|Policymakers are relying {{heavily on}} {{mortgage}} <b>modifications</b> {{to address the}} foreclosure crisis. However, not enough is known about whether <b>modifications</b> actually help borrowers stay current over the long run, or about what kinds of <b>modifications</b> are most successful. We use logit models in a hazard framework to explain how loan, borrower, property, servicer and neighborhood characteristics, along with differences in the <b>modifications,</b> affect the likelihood of redefault. The dataset includes both HAMP and proprietary <b>modifications.</b> Our results demonstrate that borrowers who receive HAMP <b>modifications</b> have been considerably more successful in staying current than those who receive non-HAMP <b>modifications...</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this <b>modification</b> {{and the fact that}} it is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this <b>modification.</b>|$|E

Mass spectrometry (MS) has been developed into a powerful tool to identify all possible protein <b>modifications.</b> Herein, we describe our efforts to deduce the structures of two unknown <b>modifications</b> at tryptophan (Trp) residues (W + 92 Da and W + 108 Da). The two <b>modifications</b> were further confirmed by aligning the MS/MS fragmentation of synthetic peptide with in-vivo peptide identified.

50|$|Every {{nucleosome}} {{in a cell}} {{can therefore}} have {{a different set of}} <b>modifications,</b> raising the question of whether common patterns of histone <b>modifications</b> exist.

However, patterns were discovered including a set of 17 histone <b>modifications</b> that are present together at over 3000 genes. Therefore, patterns of histone <b>modifications</b> do occur but they are very intricate, and we currently have detailed biochemical understanding of the importance of {{a relatively small number of}} <b>modifications.</b>|$|R

5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate {{have focused on}} the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital <b>modification</b> such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital <b>modification</b> may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E
