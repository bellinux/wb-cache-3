50|$|Several appeals {{were brought}} before the Supreme Court {{challenging}} specific internment orders that were made under the Unlawful Combatants Law. In her leading judgment, Beinisch wrote {{that there is no}} doubt that the administrative detention of an “unlawful combatant” significantly violates the right to personal liberty. While holding the law constitutional, she held that in view of the extent of the violation of personal liberty and of the extreme nature of the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> provided in the law, an interpretive effort should be made in order to minimize, in so far as possible, the violation of the right to liberty so that it is commensurate with the need to achieve the security purpose, and not in excess thereof. Beinisch also held that the provisions of the statute should be interpreted, in so far as possible, in a manner consistent with the accepted norms of international law.|$|E
40|$|Based on ethnographic {{research}} in an immigration detention centre in Belgium the author discusses {{the evolution of}} the regime to which the detainees are subjected. In the offi cial language of the Immigration Office, this evolution is called humanisation of detention. A reconstruction of the changes shows that instead the regime was changed for the well-being of the staff. In fact, immigration detention must be understood {{as a result of the}} rise of warehousing practices of the penal state. The staff of the centres has the task of executing the punitive <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention.</b> However, this became too burdensome for the staff and so the regime was gradually humanised without change in legislation. All levels of staff were implicated in this change. The author argues that the changes were made to account to different actors: inside the Immigration Offi ce accountability was directed to the staff, while externally this process was called humanisation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

In 1918, an influenza epidemic broke out in the province, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 962,937 people or 4.77 percent of the total estimated population. In March 1919 the Rowlatt Act was passed extending emergency <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> and incarceration in response to the perceived threat of terrorism from revolutionary nationalist organisations. This led to the infamous Jallianwala Bagh massacre in April 1919 where the British colonel Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire on a group of some 10,000 unarmed protesters and Baisakhi pilgrims.|$|R
40|$|Foreigners who {{are even}} minors have a "double problem". Because they are foreigners can have {{problems}} assimilating into society and tensions are created {{between them and}} the society that welcomes them. Conflicts may arise in relation to the culture to which they must be faithful. As young people can be characterized by typical problems of adolescence (internal conflicts, peer conflict identity problems). The result of being both foreign and young often places them in the situation of having less security and less rights than their Italian peers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a look at this situation to provide data on the conditions under which minors are subjected to the justice system with particular emphasis on young foreigners. The data analysis shows an increase in the number of arrests in juvenile delinquents as well as an increase in the percentage of proceedings initiated against young foreigners. In fact, the highest percentage concerns their arrests. The analysis of other data shows that when foreign youths "meet" the law they have a higher probability of being easily placed in detention facilities than Italians of the same age. In the face of this situation, however, we believe that in the absence of forms of inequality and attitudes of discrimination against foreign minors, they should be made subject to the same treatment opportunities reserved to Italian peers. The data allow to record some changes, Especially in the context of the possibility <b>of</b> taking alternative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention.</b> The world <b>of</b> justice must avoid both the risk of double punishment and that of a double right, that is, of an unequal right between Italians and foreigners. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of multiculturalism in Slovenia, {{as well as}} in Europe, is nowadays a current topic. In this diploma thesis is multiculturalism explored {{in the context of a}} total institution. This work demonstrates how multiculturalism manifests itself, and what challenges it presents in the case of juveniles in Reeducation Home of Radeče. In the theoretical part, first the term of multiculturalism is described, followed by cultural differences and three aspects of the individual: (national) identity, language and religion. Also the term of intercultural dialogue is introduced. It continues with the description of multicultural image of Slovenia, which is manifested in multilingualism, multinational and migrations, {{as well as in}} religious landscape of population in Slovenia. Furthermore, it is focused on challenges that arise in multicultural society. It defines the terms stereotype, prejudice and discrimination. This part focuses on term juvenile delinquency. There is substantiated re-education <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> in re-education facility with the education measures in Slovenia, and finally with the description of Reeducation Home of Radeče. The empirical part of the diploma thesis is focused on juveniles themselves, and with the help of six interviews (with juvenile members of non-majority cultures) tries to gain insight into their experience of belonging to minority culture. Multiculturalism is connected with negative stereotypes and discrimination among the juvenile, by the personnel of the re-education facility and the entire legal system. In the foreground of the entire research is the experience of the juveniles as members of non-majority culture in Slovenia, especially in Reeducation Home of Radeče (minority religion, ethnicity, the fact that a person is an immigrant). The results, gathered with qualitative research demonstrate relatively high rate of intolerance among the juvenile population, especially intolerance of members of other groups towards the members of Roma population. The Roma juveniles are the most excluded and stigmatized ethnic group in the re-education facility, as well as in the Republic of Slovenia. Quite often with the juveniles, the problems of closed institution, and consequently of forced contact of various cultures and their members also emerge. Interviewed report occasional, exceptional occurrences of discrimination by the professional stuff. Talking about discrimination within justice system, injustice and inequality is often inflicted upon the members of Roma culture. ...|$|E
50|$|The Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act, 1919, {{popularly known}} as the Rowlatt Act, was a {{legislative}} act passed by the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi on March 18, 1919, indefinitely extending the emergency <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> preventive indefinite <b>detention,</b> incarceration without trial and judicial review enacted in the Defence of India Act 1915 during the First World War. It was enacted in light of a perceived threat from revolutionary nationalist organisations of re-engaging in similar conspiracies as during the war which the Government felt the lapse of the DIRA regulations would enable. Passed on {{the recommendations of the}} Rowlatt Committee and named after its president, British judge Sir Sidney Rowlatt, this act effectively authorized the government to imprison any person suspected of terrorism living in the Raj for up to two years without a trial, and gave the imperial authorities power to deal with all revolutionary activities.|$|R

Traditionally, criminal justice and punishment presupposes evidence of a crime being committed. This time-honored principle is violated once punishment is meted out [...] "for crimes never committed" [...] (Anttila 1975, who criticised the <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> security <b>detention).</b> Today, a clear example of this trend is [...] "nachträgliche Sicherungsverwahrung" [...] (retrospective security detention), which became an option in German criminal law in 2004. This [...] "measure of security" [...] can be decided upon {{at the end of a}} prison sentence on a purely prognostic basis (Boetticher/Feest 2008, 263 sq.). In France, a similarly retrospective measure was introduced in 2008 as [...] "rétention de sûreté" [...] (security detention). The German measure was viewed as violating the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union by the European Court of Human Rights in 2009. It was, however, never completely abolished in Germany and new legislation is envisaged to continue this practice under the new name [...] "Therapieunterbringung" [...] (detention for therapy).. A similar provision for indefinite administrative detention was found in Finnish law, but it was not enforced after mid-1970s. Pre-crime is most obvious and advanced in the context of counter-terrorism, though it is argued that far from countering terrorism, pre-crime produces the futures it purports to preempt (McCulloch/Pickering 2009).|$|R

It further examines the experiences of how juveniles have been dealt with historically in the pre- colonial era and colonial era. It then follows to examine the experiences of how juveniles are dealt with, the barriers within the Kenya Juvenile Justice System and effects <b>of</b> <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> juveniles. In doing so it seeks to identify the gaps between the legal provisions and the practices in relation to the <b>detention</b> <b>of</b> juveniles.

In doing so it provides a platform through which Kenya can adopt some of the practices from these states which will enable Kenya to have a comprehensive juvenile justice system that enables juveniles to be reintegrated back into the society and reduce recidivism. In this study, it is the peer role model. It finally concludes by giving recommendations to various state actors and stakeholders on the way forward that can be put into consideration. Some of the recommendations include, entrenchment of diversion programmes in the Constitution and Children Act, training of child protecting stakeholders and developing legal and policy guidelines on alternative care systems...|$|R
