40|$|A key {{determinant}} {{of the success}} of influenza containment is the transmission rate of the novel strain. C. Fraser et al. [“Pandemic potential of a strain of influenza A (H 1 N 1) : Early findings,” Reports, 19 June, p. 1557] estimated the basic reproduction number (R₀) of the <b>Mexican</b> outbreak of <b>influenza</b> A (H 1 N 1) to be in the range of 1. 2 to 1. 6. The value of R₀ is a key measure of transmissibility and estimates the number of secondary cases in a completely susceptible population. Their findings were comparable to lower estimates for the 1918 pandemic, where R₀ ranged from 2 to 3...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFirst {{generation}} Latinos {{often have}} better health behaviors and outcomes than {{second and third}} generation Latinos. This study examined the correlates of seasonal influenza vaccinations among Mexican-identified (Mexican) adults, {{who make up the}} largest Latino subgroup in California. A sample of Mexican adults (N= 7493) from the 2011 – 12 California Interview Health Survey was used to compare the odds of first, second, and third generation <b>Mexicans</b> receiving <b>influenza</b> vaccinations in the past year. We performed a logistic regression taking into account socio-demographic characteristics, health status, and access to care. We repeated the analysis after stratifying for nativity, and then age. Being a second (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 74, confidence interval (CI) : 0. 59, 0. 92) and third generation or higher (OR= 0. 66, CI: 0. 51, 0. 86) Mexican was associated with lower odds of getting an influenza vaccination compared to first generation Mexicans. Having a chronic disease, and access to care was associated with higher odds of vaccination, while lower age was associated with lower odds of vaccination among both US-, and foreign-born Mexicans. Given that the majority of Mexicans in California are US-born, the fact that being second- and third-generation Mexicans was associated with lower influenza vaccination rates is of significant concern...|$|R
