500|$|Although Wollstonecraft {{appears as}} only a tourist in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, during her travels she was {{actually}} conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of Imlay. For almost two hundred years, it was unclear why she had travelled to Scandinavia, but in the 1980s historian Per Nyström uncovered documents in local Swedish and Norwegian archives that {{shed light on the}} purpose of her trip. He revealed that Wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and cargo that had been stolen from Imlay. Imlay had authorized her to conduct his business dealings, referring to her in legal documents as [...] "Mrs. Mary Imlay, <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> wife", although the two were not married.|$|E

50|$|When I was 15, <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> I {{were reading}} Frank Miller comics, like Batman: Year One. (...) We were so into it, {{we should have}} been {{studying}} for exams at the time. We wanted to become superheroes like Batman. It was pathetic. We were five years too old really to be doing this. The story was really about {{what would have happened if}} we hadn't come to our senses and actually gone out and done this.|$|R

6000|$|... “That is true,” {{the little}} Indian replied. “The Englishman’s eyes must be quick indeed, and his nerve steady. It was seeing him catch up his gun that first called my {{attention}} to it. You have laid us both under a great obligation, señor, for Pita is <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>and</b> were aught to befall him I should feel that I had lost part of myself. Perhaps before the journey {{comes to an end}} {{we may be able to}} show you how grateful we are.” ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{considered}} as a tolerable subject of speculation by some, and I could not be burdensome to any. I was therefore, according to the ordinary rule of Edinburgh hospitality, a welcome guest in several respectable families. But I found no one who could replace the loss I had sustained in <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> benefactor. I wanted something more than mere companionship could give me, and where was I to look for it? Among the scattered remnants of those that had been my gay friends of yore? Alas! ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Leaving Anorexia Nervosa was {{definitely}} not the easiest thing to do as we've shared so much during our time together as this band had become a vivid part of my daily life. For seven years, the band has been giving me so many opportunities on a musical and human level and has heavily contributed to become the person I'm today. Still, I honestly thought I had {{reached the end of}} a personal era with the album 'Redemption Process' and I now feel the need to take a different path.

6000|$|One of {{the young}} gentlemen, who {{sometimes}} smoked a cigar and sometimes tasted a lobster in their parlour, and who seemed alike and equally devoted to Mrs. Rodney and her sister, insisted upon taking them to Epsom in his drag, and they themselves were to select the party to accompany them. That was not difficult, for they were naturally all friends of their munificent host with one exception. Imogene stipulated that Endymion should be asked, and Mr. Rodney supported the suggestion.

6000|$|At {{the present}} time Raymond evidently wished to appear amiable. Wit, hilarity, and deep {{observation}} were mingled in his talk, rendering every sentence that he uttered as a flash of light. He soon conquered my latent distaste; I endeavoured to watch him and Perdita, and {{to keep in mind}} every thing I had heard to his disadvantage. But all appeared so ingenuous, and all was so fascinating, that I forgot everything except the pleasure his society afforded me. Under the idea of initiating me in the scene of English politics and society, of which I was soon to become a part, he narrated a number of anecdotes, and sketched many characters; his discourse, rich and varied, flowed on, pervading all my senses with pleasure. But for one thing he would have been completely triumphant. He alluded to Adrian, and spoke of him with that disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm. He perceived the cloud gathering, and tried to dissipate it; but the strength of my feelings would not permit me to pass thus lightly over this sacred subject; so I said emphatically, [...] "Permit me to remark, that I am devotedly attached to the Earl of Windsor; he is <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> benefactor. I reverence his goodness, I accord with his opinions, and bitterly lament his present, and I trust temporary, illness. That illness, from its peculiarity, makes it painful to me beyond words to hear him mentioned, unless in terms of respect and affection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please tell me," [...] she said, [...] "did papa, in Rome, {{go to see}} Madame Catherine? He told me {{he would}} if he had time. Perhaps he had not time. Papa likes {{a great deal of}} time. He wished to speak about my education; it isn't {{finished}} yet, you know. I don't know what they can do with me more; but it appears it's far from finished. Papa told me one day he thought he would finish it himself; for the last year or two, at the convent, the masters that teach the tall girls are so very dear. Papa's not rich, and I should be very sorry if he were to pay much money for me, because I don't think I'm worth it. I don't learn quickly enough, and I have no memory. For what I'm told, yes--especially when it's pleasant; but not for what I learn in a book. There was a young girl who was <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>and</b> they took her away from the convent, when she was fourteen, to make--how do you say it in English?--to make a dot. You don't say it in English? I hope it isn't wrong; I only mean they wished to keep the money to marry her. I don't know whether it is for that that papa wishes to keep the money--to marry me. It costs so much to marry!" [...] Pansy went on with a sigh; [...] "I think papa might make that economy. At any rate I'm too young to think about it yet, and I don't care for any gentleman; I mean for any but him. If he were not my papa I should like to marry him; I would rather be his daughter than the wife of--of some strange person. I miss him very much, but not so much as you might think, for I've been so much away from him. Papa has always been principally for holidays. I miss Madame Catherine almost more; but you must not tell him that. You shall not see him again? I'm very sorry, and he'll be sorry too. Of everyone who comes here I like you the best. That's not a great compliment, for there are not many people. It was very kind of you to come to-day--so far from your house; for I'm really as yet only a child. Oh, yes, I've only the occupations of a child. When did YOU give them up, the occupations of a child? I should like to know how old you are, but I don't know whether it's right to ask. At the convent they told us that we must never ask the age. I don't like to do anything that's not expected; it looks as if one had not been properly taught. I myself--I should never like to be taken by surprise. Papa left directions for everything. I go to bed very early. When the sun goes off that side I go into the garden. Papa left strict orders that I was not to get scorched. I always enjoy the view; the mountains are so graceful. In Rome, from the convent, we saw nothing but roofs and bell-towers. I practise three hours. I don't play very well. You play yourself? I wish very much you'd play something for me; papa has the idea that I should hear good music. Madame Merle has played for me several times; that's what I like best about Madame Merle; she has great facility. I shall never have facility. And I've no voice--just a small sound like the squeak of a slate-pencil making flourishes." ...|$|E
