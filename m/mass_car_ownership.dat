Data for individuals are linked to members of the same household, allowing us to estimate models of households. Multinomial ordered probit models for households’ private <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> in Sweden are estimated and used to compare {{urban and rural}} households with respect to sensitivity of <b>car</b> <b>ownership.</b> The central result from comparing urban and rural households is that rural households are less likely to exit from <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> and more likely to increase <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> than comparable urban households. This supports the notion that rural households are more dependent on their cars than urban households. Rural <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is also more sensitive to fuel price changes and the number of adults in the household. Compared with other countries, our results indicate that Swedish households’ <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is very resistant to change. The status of the previous year’s <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> as well as <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> status in 1999 is dominant factors for household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> in 2008.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a panel data model of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> and mobility. Unobserved heterogeneity is controlled for by including correlated random effects in the equations describing <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> and mobility. A mass-points approach is adopted to control for unobserved heterogeneity. The results show that decisions concerning the first car in the household are difficult to affect; a large number of households are inclined to keep one <b>car.</b> Second <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> may be more sensitive to changes in the observed contributing factors. This suggests that in The Netherlands policies aimed at changing second <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> will be more successful than those aimed at influencing decisions concerning the first car in households. A major part of the correlation between the unobservables in the <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> and the mobility equations is attributable to random effects. The time-variant errors of the mobility equations are not significantly correlated to <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> decisions.

40|$|Based on {{changing}} everyday technology {{such as the}} tramway {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, and Undergrounds later, this article focuses on what difference gender has made in using and providing public transport systems. Noticeable differences between the travel patterns of men and women were already established in the nineteenth century (`Women give conductors twice as much trouble as men', 1897); they changed in the 1920 s (`Modern women go by tram') and again with the advent of <b>mass</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> in the 1950 s. The supply side of urban public transport was always dominated by men. They planned the systems, ran the undertakings, yet drove cars.

And in the making of decisions about public transport women have always been sadly underrepresented.

40|$|Social epidemiologists {{have drawn}} {{attention}} to health inequalities as avoidable and inequitable, encouraging thinking beyond proximal risk factors to {{the causes of}} the causes. However, key debates remain unresolved including the contribution of material and psychosocial pathways to health inequalities. Tools to operationalise social factors have not developed in tandem with conceptual frameworks, and research has often remained focused on the disadvantaged rather than on forces shaping population health across the distribution. Using the example of transport, we argue that closer attention to social processes (capital accumulation and motorisation) and social forms (commodity, corporation, and car) offers a way forward. Corporations tied to the car, primarily oil and vehicle manufacturers, are central to the world economy. Key drivers in establishing this hegemony are the threat of violence from motor vehicles and the creation of distance through the restructuring of place. Transport matters for epidemiology because the growth of <b>mass</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is environmentally unsustainable and affects population health through a myriad of pathways. Starting from social forms and processes, rather than their embodiment as individual health outcomes and inequalities, makes visible connections between road traffic injuries, obesity, climate change, underdevelopment of oil producing countries, and the huge opportunity cost of the car economy. Methodological implications include a movement-based understanding of how place affects health and a process-orientated integration of material and psychosocial explanations that, while materially based, contests assumptions of automatic benefits from economic growth. Finally, we identify car and oil corporations as anti-health forces and suggest collaboration with them creates conflicts of interest...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the response of}} British urban planners {{to the rise of}} private motoring in the 1950 s, 1960 s and 1970 s. The examination begins with an exploration of important planning documents and events of the 1950 s and 1960 s, relating to the issue of rising car ownership. It is followed by an exploration of the response of urban planners to rising car ownership in Leicester and Milton Keynes. This research covers an important stage in the rise of car culture in Britain and an important stage in the evolution of urban planning. From 1950 to 1960, the number of cars on Britain’s roads rose nearly two-and-a-half times to 5. 5 million, which was seen as the beginning of <b>mass</b> <b>car</b> <b>ownership.</b> Although this prospect was often welcomed as a sign of affluence, it was also deemed to require a robust response from physical planners to prevent widespread traffic congestion and environmental nuisance. In this thesis I make four arguments. I argue, firstly, that it was in the 1950 s and 1960 s that a durable framework for approaching questions of urban transport in a motorised Britain was first worked out. Secondly, the prospect of motorisation posed fresh questions about the type of urban society that planning should be employed to support. The planners elected to encourage automobility and consumerism, but were also obliged to give more recognition to the importance of building conservation, urban environmental quality, and public transport. Thirdly, urban planners were directed by a powerful set of economic and social forces to plan in the car’s favour. Fourthly and finally, I argue that the decision to accommodate motorisation helped to provoke a backlash against sweeping redevelopment and top-down planning that altered planners’ relationship with the public, giving rise to a greater appreciation for the value of the existing urban fabric...|$|E
40|$|The PhD study {{presented}} in this thesis sets out to address the question: How and why does household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> change over time? This question is justified {{on the basis that}} the study of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> has traditionally been dominated by cross-sectional, quantitative analyses. It is argued that complementary qualitative, longitudinal methods have the potential to generate explanatory insights into the underlying process through which household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> states arise and change over time. Accordingly, the study employed a novel flexible two stage research design. Stage one involved 15 in-depth retrospective biographical interviews with members of zero, one and two car owning households. An inductive thematic analysis {{led to the development of}} a new dynamic framework for understanding the general process of household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> change. <b>Car</b> <b>ownership</b> changes are triggered by life events which alter roles/relationships, spatial contexts and lifestyle preferences. Life events lead to travel behaviour adaptation and consideration of whether the current <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> state is satisfactory. This can create a latent propensity to change <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> state. Given the ‘costs’ and effort involved in taking action, households tend to resist changes to their <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> state. In some cases, action may be prompted by another external stimulus such as the receipt of a maintenance bill, or the opportunity to acquire a car from a trusted friend or family member. The dynamic framework was tested in a neighbourhood survey involving a self-completion questionnaire and follow-up telephone call to establish a wider set of accounts of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level changes. The life event driven nature of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level changes is confirmed and it is found that <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level changes are also strongly dependent on life stage. Younger households have a tendency to increase <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level from zero to one or more cars as they move towards middle age. Vehicle relinquishments are more likely to occur in older age following retirement in association with health and income constraints. Over 70 percent of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level changes recorded by the survey were associated with either a change in working circumstances, cohabitation, an adult joining or leaving the household, residential relocation, child birth or offspring reaching driving age. The thesis provides specific insights into the circumstances when such events are associated with a change in <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level.

However, much less has been discovered about the time dependent processes through which household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> states arise. Accordingly, this paper presents a study which addressed how and why household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> changes over time. Noting the lack of an agreed theory relating to the dynamics of household <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> the paper first puts forward a new framework depicting a life event driven process of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> change. The framework emerged through a qualitative analysis of 15 biographical interviews and was tested through a survey of 248 households located in one inner-urban and one outer-urban neighbourhood in Bristol. The results confirm the importance of life events and life stage to <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level change. Younger households have a tendency to increase <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level from zero to one or more cars as they move towards middle age. Vehicle relinquishments are more likely to occur in older age following retirement in association with health and income constraints. Over 70 percent of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level changes recorded by the survey were associated with either a change in working circumstances, cohabitation, an adult joining or leaving the household, residential relocation, child birth or offspring reaching driving age.

40|$|This {{discussion}} paper {{arises from the}} first year of a PhD study into household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> decisions. It begins by summarising explanations for the past (aggregate) increases in <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> reviewing research from the fields of economics, urban and transport planning, and social psychology. <b>Car</b> <b>ownership</b> trends have been examined in terms of consumer behaviour; changing land use patterns; changing social norms and the life-course. Though there are convincing explanations for past increases in <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> at the aggregate level, the paper goes on to draw together evidence suggesting that there are significant and perhaps counter-intuitive underlying variations. Previous analysis of the British Household Panel Survey by Dargay and Hanly has revealed that there are only a slightly larger number of households increasing <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> (8. 2 per cent) than there are households reducing <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> (7. 6 per cent) each year. Similarly, at the local level, a comparison for this present paper, of the 1991 and 2001 censuses reveals that <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> levels per capita were either maintained or reduced in 8. 6 per cent (688) of the electoral wards in England. Indeed, a significant minority – 6. 2 million households in Great Britain, either choose, or are constrained to continue living without a car. This underlying variation in (changing) <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> levels has important implications for transport policy, and the paper concludes by posing a series of questions which may benefit from further research. While it seems that <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> levels naturally tend to increase, are there (predictable) conditions under which the demand for privately owned cars might be reduced? If so, do these relate to macro or micro-level factors, to spatial planning or the transport system, or to the physical or the social environment? The paper explores such questions...|$|R

However, as a private car is increasingly becoming a household necessity rather than a luxury product, the power of economic factors in determining household’s ability to purchase a car is declining over time [53]. Additionally, household size {{and the presence of}} children significantly increase the attractiveness of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> [42, 53], while seniors heavily rely on cars for travels in the western countries [55, 56]. It is also worth noting that mode choice and <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> are closely related in nature [57], <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is determined by self-selection, rather than explained by other observable factors [57, 58].|$|R
40|$|While it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that income is the major drive for private <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> the <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> levels do not match the income levels across regions in China. This paper explores this “car ownership divergence” phenomenon from various aspects. It is found that income effect is strong at both national levels and within regions. However, even if per capita income may still {{be an important factor}} to explain <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> difference across the regions, its explanatory power dropped considerably. Further discussion reveals that charges and fees imposed on private car owners by authorities at different levels may have a strong influence on <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> level. The paper concludes with discussions on implications of this study...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of {{household}} <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> and mode use is developed {{and applied to}} demand forecasting. The model system consists of three interrelated components: <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> mechanized trip generation, and modal split. The level of household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is represented {{as a function of}} household attributes and mobility measures from the preceding observation time point using an ordered-response probit model. The trip generation model predicts the weekly number of trips made by household members using car or public transit, and the modal split model predicts the fraction of trips that are made by public transit. Household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is a major determinant in the latter two model components. A simulation experiment is conducted using sample households from the Dutch National Mobility Panel data set and applying the model system to predict household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> and mode use under different scenarios on future household income, employment, and drivers’ license holding. Policy implications of the simulation results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} household <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> in Ireland, using longitudinal data for the period 1995 - 2001. This {{was a period of}} rapid economic and social change in Ireland, with the proportion of households with one or more cars growing from 74. 6 per cent to 80. 8 per cent over the period. Understanding the determinants of household <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> a key determinant of household travel behaviour more generally, is particularly important in the context of current policy developments which seek to encourage more sustainable means of travel. In this paper, we exploit the availability of longitudinal data to estimate dynamic models of household <b>car</b> <b>ownership,</b> controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. We find income and previous <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> to be the strongest determinants of differences in household <b>car</b> <b>ownership.</b> Other important influences include household composition (in particular, the presence of young children) and lifecycle effects, which create further challenges for policymakers in seeking to change travel behaviour...|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of highways and motor vehicles, which carry 13.5% of cargo and 49.1% of passengers, was growing {{rapidly in the}} mid-2000s. Automobile usage has increased significantly in urban areas as incomes rise. However, <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> is still low {{in comparison to the}} other members of the BRIC group of countries, being exceeded by Russia and Brazil. Indeed, the rate of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> in China is only expected to meet the 1960s level of <b>car</b> <b>ownership</b> of some developed countries in 2015.|$|R
