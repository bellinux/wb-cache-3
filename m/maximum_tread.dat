5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{history of the}} site is in the mid 14th century in the [...] "Record of Caernarvon".The core element of Bodysgallen Hall is the late 13th century watchtower, intended to assist in defense of Conwy Castle. This five-storey tower is made of on site quarried pink sandstone with grit dressings and has a slate roof. The square tower has a five storey ascending anti-clockwise (non defensive) spiral staircase with one small room on each floor. Independent masonry analysis of this staircase dates it to the late 13th century. The staircase becomes narrower with height. The treads are 60 cm (2 feet) wide at the top with <b>maximum</b> <b>tread</b> depth of 31 cm (12 inches). The core tower has later additions of global wings, with consistent vernacular style:.|$|E
40|$|Wheel treads {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding. Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in tread profile which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale tread braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel tread profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and tread braking. The presented results show that the <b>maximum</b> <b>tread</b> depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel tread induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from tread braking. This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the tread near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other tread area...|$|E
50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the wheel tread. Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels. This diameter is also not sacrosanct and is changed depending upon the supply position of the wheels. The maximum variation in the wheels on the same axle is permitted up to 0.5 mm, between two wheels of the same bogie up to 5 mm and among the four wheel sets of the same coach up to 13 mm. The diameter of a new wheel is 915 mm. Hence <b>maximum</b> wheel <b>tread</b> wear allowed is (915 mm - 819mm) = 96 mm. In order to adjust for {{the difference in the}} wheel tread, a packing is placed under the flange of the lower spring seat. This packing ring is generally made up of NFTC(Natural Fiber Thermosetting COMPOSITE) or UHMWPE (Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) material. The thickness of the NFTC packing ring is equal to 50% of the difference between the dia of a new wheel and the wheel in question.|$|R
40|$|Thirty seven workers {{employed}} {{for at least}} three years in oil impregnation of cables during 1963 - 83 were followed up in 1990 to study the development of pulmonary fibrosis and consequences for lung function. They had been exposed to concentrations of mineral oil vapours of 50 - 100 mg/m 3, and concentrations of oil mist of 0. 5 - 1. 5 mg/m 3. All 29 living persons were traced. For each person one control matched for age, height, and smoking habits was selected. Among 25 workers followed up with radiographic studies, 10 cases of pulmonary fibrosis were found, by contrast with one case in the control group (p less than 0. 01). Chest radiographs from 1979 - 80 and 1989 - 90 were reviewed. The profusion of small opacities increased in seven of 16 persons during 10 years without exposure. Seventeen workers had lung function tests. The bellows function (VC, FEV 1, MVV) and lung volumes (TLC, RV) did not differ from those in the matched controls (p greater than 0. 05), but the carbon monoxide transfer factor (TLCO) was decreased. The largest reduction of TLCO (1. 5 mmol/kPa/min) was found among workers exposed for 10 years or more (p less than 0. 05). Arterial blood gases were not affected at rest, but during <b>maximum</b> <b>tread</b> mill exercise, PO 2 and HbO 2 were reduced in exposed workers compared with controls, particularly among those exposed for at least 10 years (p less than 0. 05). Exposure to low viscosity oil mist and vapour is the most plausible cause of the fibrosis. Unaffected bellows function, reduced TLCO, and decreased arterial blood oxygen during exercise is compatible with peribronchiolar fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Tread (block) braking {{is still}} one of the most common braking systems on railway vehicles. The action is carried out by {{pressing}} brake blocks against the tread of a wheel, which is also in rolling contact with the rail. The extensive use of tread brakes in metro and suburban applications has created a need for design guidelines or standards for wheels exposed to repeated stop braking. The thermal capacity of the wheels puts a limit to railway tread braking systems. With the exception of the drag braking cases described in the European standard EN 13979 - 1, there are no known standards or guidelines regarding the thermal capacity limits for wheels. In the present work, an extensive literature survey has been made with special focus on the braking capacity of wheels. Several aspects of the tread braking system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher <b>maximum</b> <b>tread</b> temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|E
