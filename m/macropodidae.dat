25|$|Kangaroos and {{wallabies}} {{belong to}} the same taxonomic family (<b>Macropodidae)</b> and often the same genera, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the six largest species of the family. The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The kangaroos, <b>Macropodidae,</b> of New Guinea {{are highly}} varied in their ecology and behaviour. Those {{closely related to}} the Australian kangaroos, such as the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis), inhabit the open grasslands of New Guinea. However, the tree-kangaroos, which are mostly endemic to New Guinea, are {{different}} in appearance and behaviour. As suggested by their name, they are arboreal. They have long, thick tails which enable them to balance in trees, and large, strong forearms for gripping to trees. Two species of tree kangaroos are also found in Australia, they are believed to have migrated from New Guinea during the Pleistocene.|$|E
25|$|The macropods {{are divided}} into three families: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member; the Potoroidae, with 11 species; and the <b>Macropodidae,</b> with 45 species. Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant {{material}} with their tails. The Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet, with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled tails, which they use to hop around. The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal, while the male red kangaroo is the largest, reaching a height of about 2m and weighing up to 85kg.|$|E
2500|$|The {{kangaroo}} is a marsupial {{from the}} family <b>Macropodidae</b> (macropods, meaning [...] "large foot"). In common use the term is {{used to describe the}} largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus: the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} terms [...] "wallaroo" [...] and [...] "wallaby", [...] "kangaroo" [...] {{refers to a}} polyphyletic {{grouping}} of species. [...] All three refer {{to members of the}} same taxonomic family, <b>Macropodidae,</b> and are distinguished according to size. The largest species in the family are called [...] "kangaroos" [...] and the smallest are generally called [...] "wallabies". [...] The term [...] "wallaroos" [...] refers to species of an intermediate size. There is also the tree-kangaroo, another genus of macropod, which inhabits the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region. A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be: ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{there are}} about 50 smaller macropods {{closely related to the}} {{kangaroo}} in the family <b>Macropodidae.</b> Kangaroos and other macropods share a common ancestor with Phalangeridae from the mid-Miocene. This ancestor was likely arboreal and lived in the canopies of the extensive forests that covered most of Australia at that time, when the climate was much wetter, and fed on leaves and stems. From the late Miocene though the Pliocene and into the Pleistocene the climate got drier which led to a decline of forests and expansion of grasslands. At this time there was a radiation of macropodids characterised by enlarged body size and adaptation to the low quality grass diet with the development of foregut fermentation. [...] The most numerous early macropods, the Balbaridae and Bulungmayinae, became extinct in the late Miocene around 5–10 mya. There is dispute over the relationships of the two groups to modern kangaroos and rat kangaroos. Some argue that the balbarines were the ancestors of rat kangaroos and the bulungmayines were the ancestors of kangaroos. while others hold the contrary view.|$|E
50|$|The genus Ganguroo is {{a species}} of early to middle to late Miocene {{kangaroo}} found in Riversleigh, in Australia. The relationship within the <b>Macropodidae</b> is in dispute, though it is phylogenetically proposed to be a sister taxon with the <b>Macropodidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|Macropodinae is a {{subfamily}} of marsupials in {{the family}} <b>Macropodidae,</b> which includes the kangaroos, wallabies, and related species.
