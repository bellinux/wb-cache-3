500|$|The {{earthquake}} and tsunami {{came on a}} <b>Monday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> a day after many more people were present on the beach, due to a major national holiday. The waves came a few tens of minutes after the shock (and were a surprise, even to lifeguards) and occurred when the sea level was approaching low tide which, along with the wind waves, masked the initial withdrawal of the sea as the tsunami drew near. Most portions of the south Java coast saw runup heights of , but evidence {{on the island of}} Nusa Kambangan indicated that a peak surge measuring [...] had occurred there, suggesting to researchers that the possibility of a submarine landslide had contributed to the magnitude of the tsunami in that area.|$|E
500|$|The fire's {{spread to}} the north reached the {{financial}} heart of the City. The houses of the bankers in Lombard Street began to burn on <b>Monday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> prompting a rush to get their stacks of gold coins to safety before they melted away, so crucial to {{the wealth of the}} city and the nation. Several observers emphasise the despair and helplessness which seemed to seize Londoners on this second day, and the lack of efforts to save the wealthy, fashionable districts which were now menaced by the flames, such as the Royal Exchange—combined bourse and shopping centre – and the opulent consumer goods shops in Cheapside. The Royal Exchange caught fire in the late afternoon, and was a smoking shell within a few hours. John Evelyn, courtier and diarist, wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, {{he became}} a Baptist {{minister}} and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture {{was published in the}} Confederate Veteran as the [...] "True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth." [...] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3p.m. on <b>Monday</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Confederate mail delivery had ceased {{with the collapse of the}} Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt had failed to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, [...] "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him." [...] Garrett was present at the time and was more likely to know the facts than later biographers.|$|E

[...] After {{five days of}} silence, talks began again on August 14 under the personal supervision of Labor Secretary Herman at the Hyatt Regency Washington hotel {{across the street from}} the Teamsters' headquarters. After two days of nearly continuous bargaining, UPS withdrew its pension demand. President Clinton personally spoke to both parties over the weekend to encourage them to continue bargaining, and a final tentative contract emerged on <b>Monday</b> <b>afternoon,</b> August 18. The pact included several major concessions by the employer: [...] Starting pay of part-time workers would increase for the first time since 1982, 10,000 part-time jobs would be converted into full-time jobs, UPS would stay in the union's multi-employer pension plan, most workers would see significant benefit increases, and five-sixths of all new full-time jobs would be filled by existing part-timers. The union agreed to a five-year contract rather than the proposed four-year deal. The company had lost more than $600 million in business during the strike, and fears of even larger losses had finally led it to concede. The 50-person Teamsters bargaining committee and conference of 200 UPS locals ratified the agreement on August 19.|$|E

[...] May was quick to admit that her remarks at the annual press gallery dinner in Gatineau, Que., were a poor attempt at comedy.
