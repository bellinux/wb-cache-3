5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C,</b> species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} antibiotics are {{a varied}} group {{of drugs that}} have various mechanisms of action. The common theme that they share in their chemotherapy indication is that they interrupt cell division. The most important subgroup is the anthracyclines and the bleomycins; other prominent examples include <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C,</b> mitoxantrone, and actinomycin.|$|E
25|$|Scarring {{can occur}} around {{or over the}} flap opening, causing it to become less {{effective}} or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods prompt {{production}} with UV radiation, <b>Mitomycin</b> <b>C,</b> or heat shock. [...] UV {{radiation and}} <b>Mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> are used because the DNA damage they produce stimulates the SOS response. [...] Cross streaking {{may be substituted}} for lawns. [...] Similarly, production in broth may be followed by dripping the broth on a nascent bacterial lawn, or even filtering it. [...] Precipitation (ammonium sulfate) and some purification (e.g. column or HPLC) may help exclude lysogenic and lytic phage from the assay.|$|E
2500|$|Competence in S. pneumoniae is {{induced by}} DNA-damaging agents such as <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C,</b> {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotics (norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors. Transformation protects S. pneumoniae against the bactericidal effect of <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C.</b> [...] Michod et al. summarized evidence that induction of competence in S. pneumoniae {{is associated with}} increased resistance to oxidative stress and increased expression of the RecA protein, {{a key component of}} the recombinational repair machinery for removing DNA damages. On the basis of these findings they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative DNA damages. S. pneumoniae infection stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an oxidative burst that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. The ability of S. pneumoniae to repair the oxidative DNA damages in its genome, caused by this host defense, likely contributes to this pathogenâ€™s virulence. Consistent with this premise Li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable S. pneumoniae isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depend on an intact competence system.|$|E
2500|$|Competence is {{specifically}} induced by DNA damaging conditions. [...] For instance, transformation is induced in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the DNA damaging agents <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> (a DNA crosslinking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). [...] In B. subtilis, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In Helicobacter pylori, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing {{the frequency of}} transformation Using Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. [...] Of these only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. [...] These DNA damaging agents were <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), norfloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (induces DNA base oxidation). [...] UV light also induced competence in L. pneumophila. [...] Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperthermia {{has also}} been shown to help prevent or reverse [...] "chemo-{{resistance}}." [...] Chemotherapy resistance sometimes develops over time as the tumors adapt and can overcome the toxicity of the chemo medication. [...] "Overcoming chemoresistance has been extensively studied within the past, especially using CDDP-resistant cells. In regard to the potential benefit that drug-resistant cells can be recruited for effective therapy by combining chemotherapy with hyperthermia, it was important to show that chemoresistance against several anticancer drugs (e.g. <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C,</b> anthracyclines, BCNU, melphalan) including CDDP could be reversed at least partially by the addition of heat.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> {{has also}} been used topically rather than {{intravenously}} in several areas. The first is cancers, particularly bladder cancers and intraperitoneal tumours. It is now well known that a single instillation of this agent within 6 hours of bladder tumor resection can prevent recurrence. The second is in eye surgery where <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> 0.02% is applied topically to prevent scarring during glaucoma filtering surgery and to prevent haze after PRK or LASIK; <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> {{has also been}} shown to reduce fibrosis in strabismus surgery. The third is in esophageal and tracheal stenosis where application of <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> onto the mucosa immediately following dilatation will decrease re-stenosis by decreasing the production of fibroblasts and scar tissue.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{bacterium}} Legionella pneumophila, <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> induces competence for transformation. [...] Natural transformation {{is a process}} of DNA transfer between cells, and is regarded as a form of bacterial sexual interaction. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, exposure to <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> increases recombination during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle. [...] In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, mutant strains defective in genes necessary for recombination during meiosis and mitosis are hypersensitive to killing by <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C.</b> [...] It has been suggested that these, and other related findings, {{can be explained by the}} idea that during sexual processes in prokaryotes (transformation) and eukaryotes (meiosis) DNA crosslinks and other damages introduced by <b>mitomycin</b> <b>C</b> are removed by recombinational repair.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{demonstrate}} bacteriocin production, depending on the sensitivity and labor intensiveness desired.To demonstrate their production, technicians stab inoculate multiple strains on separate multiple nutrient agar Petri dishes, incubate at 30 Â°C for 24 h., overlay each plate with one of the strains (in soft agar), incubate again at 30 Â°C for 24 h. After this process, the presence of bacteriocins can be inferred if there are zones of growth inhibition around stabs. This is the simplest and least sensitive way.
