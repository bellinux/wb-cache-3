This paper presents the experimental results on the lean operational limits of Recardo E 6 engine using gasoline, LPG, NG and hydrogen as fuels. The first appearance of almost <b>motoring</b> <b>cycle</b> was used to define the engine lean limit after the fuel flow was reduced gradually. The effects of compression ratio, engine speed and spark timing on the engine operational limits are presented and discussed in detailed. Increasing compression ratio (CR) extend the lean limits, this appears obviously with hydrogen, which has {{a wide range of}} equivalence ratios, while for hydrocarbon fuel octane number affect gasoline, so it can' t work above CR= 9 : 1, and for LPG it reaches CR= 12 : 1, NG reaches CR= 15 : 1 at lean limit operation. Movement from low speeds to medium speeds extended lean misfire limits, while moving from medium to high speeds contracted the lean misfiring limits. NOx, CO and UBHC concentrations increased with CR increase for all fuels, while CO 2 concentrations reduced with this increment. NOx concentration increased for medium speeds and reduced for high speeds, but the resulted concentrations were inconcedrable for these lean limits. CO and CO 2 increased with engine speed increase, while UBHC reduced with this increment. The hydrogen engine runs with zero CO, CO 2 and UNHC concentrations, and altra low levels of NOx concentrations at studied lean misfire limit...|$|E
40|$|At {{the moment}} the main impetus to move towards {{alternative}} fuels produced from renewable resources is legislation and market forces, which push the automotive industry to limit pollutant emissions. One way of reducing these hannful emissions is to replace the conventional fossil fuel totally with syngas or partially with alcohols and/or their ethers. The bending of alcohols to gasoline has been attempted since the mid of 1970 's and recently it is in practice in some countries. Interestingly, alcohols are more competitive among the other alternatives such as syngas because they are compatible with existing fuelling distribution infrastructure and are easily stored in a vehicle. However, this blending may change the burning rate which consequently changes the level of cyclic variations. Cycle-to-cycle variability is {{the main cause of}} reduction in power output and efficiency and deterioration in the vehicle driveabiIity. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of employing renewable fuels in spark ignition engine on the cycle-to-cycle variations. The employed fuels involved synthetic gas mixture of 2 H 2 +CO, blends of Ethyl Tert Butyl Ether (ETBE) with primary reference fuel (PRF), and a commercial gasoline fuel (EOS) containing 5 % by volume of ethanol. In the first stage of this work, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) techniques were employed to characterise the in-cylinder turbulent flow at different engine speed during <b>motoring</b> <b>cycles.</b> In the main stage of the current study, PlY and LDV was also employed to monitor the in-cylinder flow during firing experiments simultaneously with natural light video photography for recording the flame propagation and pressure recordings methods. Results verified that, there was a slight increase in the cyclic variability of the indicated mean effective pressure with increasing the percentage of ETBE in the mixture. The cyclic variability has decreased when using E 05 in comparison with PRF or its blends with ETBE. On the other hand, it was possible to run the engine at an equivalence ratio of 0. 3 with 2 H 2 +CO due to the extended flammability limit of hydrogen containing mixtures. Spatial and temporal analysis of flow field parameters for individual cycles was adopted in the current study. The analysis showed that there is a high degree of connection between early flame kernel development, RMS turbulent velocity and global burning rate of a cycle, such that a cycle that start fast will remain fast throughout the cycle in most cases.

All rights reserved. Investigation of direct injection charge cooling effects is indispensable {{in design and}} development of new combustion systems for Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines. The charge cooling can be utilized to increase engine volumetric efficiency or compression ratio. It can be employed to suppress pre-ignition of highly boosted downsized engines or knocking combustion of naturally aspirated engines. The main purpose of this work was to develop an experimental setup for quantitative measurements of charge cooling during fuel injection process inside the combustion chamber of a GDI engine with optical access. For this purpose a tracer-based two-line Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique was implemented for the measurements. A specially designed Constant Volume Chamber (CVC) was utilized for quasi in situ calibration measurement so in-cylinder charge temperature measurements can be achieved independent of the photophysical model of dopant tracer. The thermometry technique was evaluated by measurements of average in-cylinder charge temperature during compression stroke for both <b>motoring</b> and firing <b>cycles</b> and comparing the results with temperature values calculated from in-cylinder pressure data assuming a polytropic compression. The PLIF technique was successfully utilized to quantify the extend of global temperature decrease {{as a result of}} direct injection charge cooling of two injection timings of 90 and 250 CA ATDC and two injection quantities of 10 and 30 mg/cycle.

Design and development of new combustion system for Spark Ignition Direct Injection (DISI) engines requires thorough understanding of the flame as it develops from electric discharge and propagates across the combustion chamber. The main purpose of this work was to develop an experimental setup capable of investigating premixed and partially-premixed turbulent flame boundary and structure inside combustion chamber of a DISI engine. For this purpose the tracer-based two-line Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) technique was set up. In {{order to have a}} thermometry technique independent of photophysical models of dopant tracer, a specially designed Constant Volume Chamber (CVC) was utilized for quasi in situ calibration measurements. The thermometry technique was evaluated by measurements of average in-cylinder charge temperature during compression stroke for both <b>motoring</b> and firing <b>cycles</b> and comparing the results with temperature values calculated from in-cylinder pressure data. The developed technique was successfully employed to detect flame boundary and structure during combustion process in the optical engine. The present study demonstrated that as the two-line PLIF thermal images are independent of species concentration and flame luminosity they can be utilized as accurate means for flame segmentation. The proposed technique {{has the potential to be}} utilized for study of turbulent flames in non-homogeneously mixed systems...|$|R
