500|$|A {{favourite}} walk {{took the}} Darwin family {{to a spot}} above the quiet Cudham valley, teeming with orchids including Cephalanthera, Neottia, Fly <b>Orchids</b> and <b>Musk</b> <b>Orchids.</b> They called this place [...] "Orchis Bank", and the whole family became involved in Darwin's researches. Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies [...] "sucking O. pyramidalis and Gymnadenia") did he see insects visiting flowers.|$|R
50|$|Fantasy {{was created}} by Jim Krivda. Its notes are red lychee, golden quince, kiwi, cupcake accord, jasmine petals, white chocolate, <b>orchid,</b> <b>musk,</b> orris root and woods. The Fuchsia bottle once {{featured}} real Swarovski crystals embedded into the glass and the plastic collar until 2008. The believed reasoning behind the omission is because the glue of the crystal top would melt in higher temperatures, which many buyers realized a considerable time after purchase.|$|R
50|$|Several {{scarce and}} notable species occur {{including}} Round-headed Rampion (Phyteuma tenerum), Bastard-toadflax (Thesium humifusum), Fly Orchid (Ophrys insectifera), Fragrant Orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea), Lesser Butterfly Orchid (Platanthera bifolia), Frog orchid(Coeloglossum viride), <b>Musk</b> <b>orchid</b> (Herminium monorchis) and unusually, for a downland site, Marsh Helleborine (Epipactis palustris).|$|E
50|$|Chamorchis is a genus of {{flowering}} plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It contains only one known species, Chamorchis alpina, {{known as the}} false orchid or false <b>musk</b> <b>orchid,</b> and found in subarctic and subalpine parts of Europe: Scandinavia, the Alps, the Carpathians, northern European Russia.|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{several types}} of grassland and the turf contains many lime-loving herbs. There are several species of orchid recorded such as Early purple orchid, Bee Orchid, and <b>Musk</b> <b>Orchid.</b> Viper's Bugloss flowers in abundance.

Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies [...] "sucking O. pyramidalis and Gymnadenia") did he see insects visiting flowers.In 1854, Darwin began to work full-time {{on the origin of}} species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both pollinia (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as Fabaceae, they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in The Gardeners' Chronicle in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to empirical research on orchids. Despite delays caused by recurring illness, he made progress on writing his planned [...] "Big Book" [...] on evolution, but when Alfred Russel Wallace's letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of natural selection in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote On the Origin of Species as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of [...] "intercrossing", and noted: [...] "Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them". He introduced his new concept, the process of coevolution, describing the co-adaptation of bumblebees and red clover, and speculating [...] "how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.|$|R

500|$|Lavigne {{released}} her first fragrance, Black Star, created by Procter & Gamble Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, {{was released in}} summer 2009 in Europe, {{and later in the}} US and Canada. When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, [...] "I wanted [...] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are." [...] Black Star won the 2010 Best [...] "Women's Scent Mass" [...] by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW). Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, Forbidden Rose, which took two years to develop. It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla. Its message is an extension of Black Star's [...] "follow your dreams", though the tagline for the new perfume is [...] "Dare to Discover". The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting, where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose. Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010. The tagline for the fragrance is [...] "Dare to discover more". It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue <b>orchid,</b> <b>musk,</b> sandalwood and crème brûlée.|$|R
50|$|A {{nature reserve}} {{will be created}} at Rospuda Valley. It will protect the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid,</b> the woodgrouse, sea eagle, and lesser spotted eagle, which nest in the area. The reserve will {{be a part of}} Augustów-Druskienniki Protected Area, which is being created with the {{cooperation}} of Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} is semi-natural and {{the dominant}} species is upright brome. Also recorded are quaking grass, cock's foot, cowslip and other limestone herbs. Significant numbers of orchids flourish {{on the site}} including <b>musk</b> <b>orchid,</b> but these are threatened by invasion of scrub such as hawthorn. Yew, whitebeam and juniper are scattered on the site.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{an example}} of {{unimproved}} limestone grassland. Among the more notable plants species are bastard-toadflax (Thesium humifusum), Dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), and <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> (Herminium monorchis). Other species present include yellow-wort (Blackstonia perfoliata), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), bee orchid (Ophrys apifera), tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum) and upright brome (Bromus erectus).|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} has been formed to protect {{an area of}} old-growth forest, springs, coastal meadows and a karst area. It is notable for its {{abundance}} of different species of orchid; around 15 are known {{to grow in the}} nature reserve, including lesser twayblade, lady’s slipper, fly orchid and <b>musk</b> <b>orchid.</b> It is also known as a breeding spot and stopover for migratory birds.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{grassland}} within the site and their origination is dependent upon aspect, soil, grazing intensity and how areas of the common have been managed. The site supports several species of rare orchid such as the bee orchid, the frog orchid and the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid.</b> Spoil and scree from disused quarries provide conditions for plants which grow in more open habitats.|$|E
50|$|The chalk {{grassland}} {{are used as}} grazing for farm animals, but some were left to naturalise into wildflower meadows after the park was formed, these grasslands were cleared of scrub to allow the rare chalk land plants and animals to re-establish including the <b>Musk</b> <b>Orchid,</b> and Chalkhill Blue butterfly. This {{is one of the}} only three sites within Kent, that Watling Street Thistle, Eryngium campestre can be found.|$|E
50|$|Rospuda Valley {{is under}} {{protection}} {{because of its}} rare animals and plants. For example, there are 19 kinds of Orchidaceae (all of which are under strict protection), including <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> (Herminium monorchis), and white variety of early marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza majalis). The former has been recorded in the Polish Red Data Book of Plants, and Rospuda Valley is its only Polish locality. The latter exists {{in a few more}} places in Poland.|$|E
5000|$|... "Over quite {{extensive}} areas dwarf sedge Carex humilis becomes dominant, {{a species}} largely {{restricted to the}} downs of south west Wiltshire and Dorset. Two other species with a localised national distribution are early gentian Gentianella anglica and <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> Herminium monorchis. The latter is found in an area particularly rich in orchids including pyramidal Anacamptis pyramidalis, bee Ophrys apifera, common spotted Dactylorhiza fuchsii, fragrant Gymnadenia conopsea and twayblade Listera ovata." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} plateau supports tor-grass, upright brome, sheep's fescue and quaking grass. This area {{is relatively}} short {{as it is}} grazed and there is recreational use. The slopes support a higher sward {{and this is the}} area for insect life. Herbs recorded include chalk milkwort, clustered bellflower, kidney vetch and autumn gentian. There are several species of orchid which include frog orchid, bee orchid and <b>musk</b> <b>orchid.</b> The rare pasqueflower is recorded at this site.|$|E
50|$|Ham Hill {{is an area}} {{of chalk}} downland in Wiltshire, England, on the steep banks running {{alongside}} the road from the village of Ham to Buttermere, close to the Berkshire border. A biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, notified in 1971, covers 1.5 hectares of the site; this designation is due to the site's species-rich plant and insect communities, which include some rare species. Notable among these is the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> (Herminium monorchis), which has been confirmed at only one other site in Wiltshire.|$|E
50|$|On {{the summit}} of the cliffs between Deal and Folkestone the early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes) occurs in large numbers, as well as the rare {{oxtongue}} broomrape (Orobanche artemisae-campestris). Naturally exposed chalk is rare inland {{with the exception of the}} river cliffs formed by the River Mole on the west face of Box Hill and at Ham Bank in Norbury Park. However, quarry lakes within chalk pits provide habitat for great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). The scarce <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> (Herminium monorchis) has colonised disused chalk pits near Hollingbourne in Kent.|$|E
50|$|It is {{situated}} on the North Downs and the chalk grassland slopes of the park are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. These slopes were formerly used as grazing for farm animals, but were left to naturalise after the farms moved to the lower and more productive wealdland pastures. After the park was formed, these grasslands were cleared of scrub to allow the rare chalk land plants and animals to re-establish including the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid,</b> and chalkhill blue butterfly. Other meadow insects found include the dark green fritillary.|$|E
50|$|The site {{supports}} {{a range of}} habitats which include unimproved calcareous grassland, woodland and scrub, cliff faces and scree slopes. The grassland is of major importance and it comprises a tall ungrazed sward. This is dominated by tor-grass, upright brome, meadow oat-grass, sweet vernal-grass and quaking grass. It is noted for its range of herbs which include salad burnet, common rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil. The quarry floors support wild thyme, dwarf thistle, yellow-wort and autumn gentian. The site supports many plants which are scarce at a national or county level. These include fly orchid, <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> and purple milk-vetch. It {{is one of a}} small number of sites which support meadow clary in the county.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} {{of abandonment and}} intensification of agriculture has changed the agricultural landscape, especially the semi-natural nature types. This {{has led to a}} loss and endangerment of species linked to these nature types. The <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> is one of these species. In Norway, the species is now only found in Hvaler municipality, South-East Norway, and is listed as critical endangered (CR) in the Norwegian red list. My master’s thesis is a part of an ongoing project that started in 2014 by a former master student, where I collected data in 2016 and analysed the datasets from 2014 to 2016. The purpose of this thesis is to get {{a better understanding of how}} the last populations of <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> in Norway are performing, which the management authorities can use in further management. To answer this I had three main questions; i. e. (1) how the environmental factors are differing between the three locations and through the three years, (2) how the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> population performance at the three locations differed over the three years, and (3) how grazing affects the two sub-populations, at one of the locations, three years after grazing ended. My results suggest that both the abiotic and biotic environmental factors are impacting the three locations differently, and the performance of the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> are correlating this. The smallest individuals and lowest fertile proportion of <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> are found at the driest location, which also had the lowest surrounding vegetation. At the wettest location, the trend is the opposite. It also seems like grazing influences the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> even three years after the area has been grazed the last. The <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> in the grazed sub-population is larger and have a higher proportion of fertile plants. In further management of the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> at Hvaler it is crucial to continue the monitoring, to detect the whole population ant its dynamics. Another important management mean is to either hay or have grazing that will open and keep the surrounding vegetation down. But before any reintroduction of grazing at the locations which are not currently grazed, it is important to find a livestock density, size or race that will not hurt the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> populations, as well as excluding grazing when the <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> is in the fertile stage...|$|E
40|$|The <b>musk</b> <b>orchid</b> Herminium monorchis (L.) R. Br. {{is one of}} Norway’s rarest {{vascular}} plants, {{listed as}} Critically Endangered in the Red-list for species. Since 2011 the species has also been listed as a Priority Species under the Norwegian Nature Diversity Act. Its distribution in Norway is restricted to three populations at Asmaløy, Hvaler municipality, Østfold county. In 2014 we established 80 permanent plots to monitor the populations, and to increase our understanding of important population processes. The three localities differed widely, one being a rich fen, one a salt meadow and the third a dry, short-statured meadow. Flowering was strongly correlated with plant size, and plant size varied among the three localities. The population size varied between 2014 and 2015, but not synchronously among the localities, due to a certain {{proportion of the population}} being dormant (i. e. without aboveground biomass) each year. A long-term monitoring of individual ramets will provide {{a better understanding of the}} key processes affecting population viability, so that management actions can be better targeted...|$|E
