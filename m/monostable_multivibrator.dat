40|$|Abstract — A {{new digital}} {{transceiver}} circuit for asynchronous frame detection is proposed where both the {{transmitter and receiver}} contain all digital components, thereby avoiding possible use of conventional devices like <b>monostable</b> <b>multivibrators</b> with unstable external components such as resistances and capacitances. The proposed receiver circuit, in particular, uses a combinational logic block yielding an output which changes its state {{as soon as the}} start bit of a new frame is detected. This, in turn, helps in generating an efficient receiver sampling clock. A data latching circuit is also used in the receiver to latch the recovered data bits in any new frame. The proposed receiver structure is also extended from 4 -bit information to any general n data bits within a frame with a common expression for the output of the combinational logic block. Performance of the proposed hardware design is evaluated in terms of time delay, reliability and robustness in comparison with the standard schemes using <b>monostable</b> <b>multivibrators.</b> It is observed from hardware implementation that the proposed circuit achieves almost 33 percent speed up over any conventional circuit...|$|R

The time period <b>monostable</b> <b>multivibrator</b> remains in unstable state is given by t = ln(2)R2C1. If repeated application of the input pulse maintains the circuit in the unstable state, it is called a retriggerable monostable. If further trigger pulses do not affect the period, the circuit is a non-retriggerable multivibrator.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the design, principles of operation, and calibration of a five-IC network {{intended to give}} a rapid, precise, and automatic determination of the flatband voltage of MOS capacitors. The basic principle of measurement is to compare the analog output voltage of a capacitance meter - which is directly proportional to the capacitance being measured - with a preset or dialed-in voltage proportional to the calculated flatband capacitance {{by means of a}} comparator circuit. The bias to the MOS capacitor supplied through the capacitance meter is provided by a ramp voltage going from a negative toward a positive voltage level and vice versa. The network employs two <b>monostable</b> <b>multivibrators</b> for reading and recording the flatband voltage and for resetting the initial conditions and restarting the ramp.

50|$|<b>Monostable</b> <b>multivibrator</b> - is {{a circuit}} with one {{unstable}} state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse {{is applied to}} the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it {{for a period of time}} dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monostable</b> <b>multivibrator,</b> {{in which}} one of the states is stable, but the other state is {{unstable}} (transient). A trigger pulse causes the circuit to enter the unstable state.

5000|$|The KG-13 {{employed}} [...] "FLYBALL" [...] modules. These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, <b>monostables,</b> <b>multivibrators,</b> etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|R

One area of current research in this field is on the solid-state Si:P-based quantum computer (QC). In this machine, each qubit requires an individually addressed fast control-pulse for non-adiabatic drive and measure operations. Additionally, it is increasingly becoming important to be able to interface nanoelectronics with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In this work, I have designed and demonstrated full-custom mixed-mode and full-digital fast control-pulse generators fabricated in a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS commercial foundry process  a radio-frequency (RF) CMOS technology. These circuits are, fundamentally, fast <b>monostable</b> <b>multivibrators.</b> Initially, after the design specifications were decided upon, I characterized NFET and PFET devices and a n+-diffusion resistor from 500 nm and 250 nm commercial SOS-CMOS processes. Measuring their conductance curves at 300 300 K, 4. 2 2 K, and sub-K (30 30 mK base to 1000 1000 mK) showed that they function with desirable behaviour although exhibiting some deviations from their 300 300 K characteristics. The mixed-mode first generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing that it produced dwell-time adjustable pulses with 100 100 ps rise-times at 300 K, 4. 2 2 K, and sub-K with a power dissipation of 12 12 uW at 100 100 MHz. The full-digital second generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing accurately adjustable dwell-times settable via a control-word streamed synchronously to a shift-register. The design was based on a ripple-counter with provisions for internal or external clocking. This research has demonstrated that SOS-CMOS technology is highly feasible for the fabrication of control microelectronics for a Si:P-based QC.
