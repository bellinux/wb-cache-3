50|$|Over time engine {{development}} has continually advanced {{in almost all}} areas from <b>material,</b> <b>operation</b> and function. Many of the advances were led by the Japanese manufacturers as they have made quality and durability the cornerstone of their programs. The Japanese advanced the proliferation of forged crankshafts with rotating assemblies at 0 gram balance. Forged crankshafts are much stronger, significantly less apt to exhibit detrimental torsional crankshaft movement which also mitigates harmonic frequencies. This progression has also seen the addition of forged rods and pistons initially in forced induction engines and more recently in normally aspirated engines. Adding these additional forged components ramps the engines rigidity reducing concern about crankshaft damage even further. With the advent of computer aided design and finite element analysis manufacturers can now find and re-engineer weaker areas. Regardless {{of some of these}} improvements certain engines like the traditional V8 which has a firing order by nature prone to excessive harmonics necessitating the use of this device. The flat plane V8, traditionally used in more exotic engines, does not suffer from the excessive harmonics and therefore may use a solid undampened device. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC Flat 4, I4, Flat 6, I6, V6, Flat 8, Flat Plane V8 have no need for this device. Over the years many of these engines use solid cast iron or aluminum crank pulley or audible NVH damper (reducing engine noise heard in the occupant compartment). Audible NVH has been the biggest factor in OE manufacturer decisions throughout the vehicle. In addition the pulleys on these engines are mounted loosely with a location fit negating any potential to act as an engine protective damper. Continental has recently provided detailed information on the maximum acceptable noise (NVH) that should be heard from under the hood from the engine in their Elite Belt program http://www.thequietbelt.com/#the-art-of-silence.|$|E

Triethyl orthosilicate (TRIES) {{was used as}} source <b>material.</b> <b>Operation</b> conditions: pressure: 1 ～ 100 Torr at outlet of the reactor, temperature: 600 ～ 900 ℃. The experimental {{results showed that the}} high reaction temperature and high source gas concentration lead to higher growth rate of SiO_ 2, and better step coverage on micro scale trenches. We propose a reaction model in which the source gas polymerizes and produces origomers (dimer, trimer, tetramer etc.), the origomers diffuse and condense on the solid surface. The condensed origomers flow into the trenches and then reaction takes place to realize good step coverage films. The chemical species in gas phase at the outlet of reactor tube were analyzed by quadrapole mass spectrometer. The peaks, assigned to be monomer, dimer of source gas and heavier molecules, were observed at 650 ℃ or 700 ℃. At higher temperature (900 ℃), the peaks of heavy molecules disappear, because the almost all of source gas and intermediate (highly polymerized origomer) molecules are oxidized or condensed on colder tube walls...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{technology}} of {{thin film transistor}} liquid crystal display (LCD) has become more popular due to great demand for worldwide consumer electronic products. Driver integrated circuit (IC) is a critical device that is embedded sophisticated circuits to drive panels. Since narrow border design on display products is current trend, dimensions of driver ICs are shrunken. In the high-density LCD driver ICs, the operation of wafer sawing is essential and needs accurate yield assessment. However, inevitable process variance changes could arise from sawing machine, <b>material,</b> <b>operation,</b> and workmanship, {{and may not be}} detected within short time. Conventionally, manufacturing yield is evaluated applying typical yield measure index method under the assumptions that the processes are stable and normal. To assess manufacturing yield for Gamma wafer sawing processes more accurately, we present a modified yield measure index method. Using the proposed method, the magnitudes of the undetected variance change, which are functions of the detection power of the S 2 chart, are incorporated into the evaluation of manufacturing yield. In addition, we demonstrate, mathemati-cally, that the accommodation would not be affected by the scale parameter of Gamma distribution. For illustration purpose, a real-world case in a wafer sawing factory which is located on th...|$|E

40|$|Resulting from {{elevated}} temperatures {{the major}} structural problem foreseen with planar SOFCs is their thermal stress. Due to the brittle nature of ceramic <b>material,</b> <b>operation</b> {{in or near}} the material plastic limit can be very critical. Therefore stress levels must always be kept below the tensile and shear limits. The analysis is focused on determination of the stress caused by the difference in thermal expansion coefficients when high temperature gradients occur in the SOFC layers during steady state and transient operation (heat-up, start-up and shut-down). Utilizing an in-house developed tool for assessment of the electrochemical and thermal performance of a bipolar planar cell the input temperature profiles are generated for a finite element analysis code to predict thermal component of the stress. The failure criterion adopted is based on the strength of the cell materials and the principal stresses developed by the thermal loading. To visualize the stress concentration in the fuel cell layers, maximum principal stress is calculated and compared with the yield strength of the SOFC materials found in the literature. The in-house code is capable to predict both steady state and dynamic temperature profiles. Of particular importance is the knowledge gained of the transient stress in the cell, which can be used to establish control parameters during transient operations...|$|E

Specifically, we sought {{to determine whether the}} choice of mitral valve procedure affected survival, and discover which patients were predicted to benefit from mitral valve repair and which from replacement. Methods A total of 218 consecutive patients underwent either mitral valve repair (MVP, n = 112) or mitral valve replacement (MVR, n = 106). We retrospectively reviewed the clinical <b>material,</b> <b>operation</b> methods, echocardiography check during operation and follow-up. Patients details and follow-up outcomes were compared using multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results No statistical difference was found between the two groups in term of intraoperative data. Early mortality was 3. 2 % (MVP 2. 7 % and MVR 3. 8 %). At discharge, Left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were improved more in the MVP group than MVR group (P 0. 05). Follow-up mitral regurgitation grade was significantly improved in the MVR group compared with the MVP group (P Conclusion Mitral valve repair is the procedure of choice in the majority of patients having surgery for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction. Early results of MVP treatment seem to be satisfactory, but several lines of data indicate that mitral valve repair provided less long-term benefit than mitral valve replacement in the LVD patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an image deformation algorithm and constructs an automatic facial expression generation system to generate new facial expressions in neutral state. After the users input the face image {{in a neutral}} state into the system, the system separates the possible facial areas and the image background by skin color segmentation. It then uses the morphological operation to remove noise and to capture the organs of facial expression, such as the eyes, mouth, eyebrow, and nose. The feature control points are labeled according to the feature points (FPs) defined by MPEG- 4. After the designation of the deformation expression, the system also increases the image correction points based on the obtained FP coordinates. The FPs are utilized as image deformation units by triangular segmentation. The triangle is split into two vectors. The triangle points are regarded as linear combinations of two vectors, and the coefficients of the linear combinations correspond to the triangular vectors of the original image. Next, the corresponding coordinates are obtained to complete the image correction by image interpolation technology to generate the new expression. As for the proposed deformation algorithm, 10 additional correction points are generated in the positions corresponding to the FPs obtained according to MPEG- 4. Obtaining the correction points within a very short operation time is easy. Using a particular triangulation for deformation can extend the material area without narrowing the unwanted material area, thus saving the filling <b>material</b> <b>operation</b> in some areas...|$|E

40|$|Construction Sustainability {{has been}} the focus of debate ever since the Brundtland {{commission}} report ‘Our Common Future’ defined Sustainable Development. Kyoto Protocol and subsequent climate change conferences leading up to the Paris submit this year has put still more emphasis on this agenda. Construction of heavy traffic unpaved access roads require huge amount of aggregate mining and long haulage in the areas of scarce virgin aggregate. Conventional practices in these road constructions seek structural adequacy but never specifically address the sustainability issue. Innovative technology that can reduce the volume of aggregate material while maintaining the structural integrity is required to address the sustainability issue of these roads construction. This paper discusses the construction of these roads with high strength Geocell (Neoloy) reinforcement giving special reference to Oil Sand region of Alberta. These Geocells improve the modulus and strength of the reinforced composite and durability of the road structure by drastically reducing the required quantity of aggregate <b>material.</b> <b>Operation</b> of these access roads has also demonstrated saving on running cost, maintenance and down time. Neoloy Geocells also make it possible to use recycled and locally available cheaper materials for road construction still exceeding the overall performance of conventional construction. In terms of sustainability the benefit will be more visible when the carbon footprint is analyzed for the virgin material mining and haulage to the construction site. A basic analysis of CO 2 emission reduction and how it is applied to new emission standards in Alberta industry with this innovative method is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|The Directly heated {{supercritical}} oxy-fuel {{gas turbines}} {{have the potential}} to become an important addition to current power generation systems. They provide a higher thermal efficiency and more effective carbon capture techniques than existing gas turbines. Due to the higher density of the working fluids, the turbomachinery size in these systems can be reduced significantly; this will facilitate to minimize the operational cost. To achieve supercritical working fluid at the turbine inlet combustion needs to be conducted under enormous amounts of pressure; these values are is about 10 times those found in the present gas turbines. Additionally, existing material operational constraints limits the maximum temperature that can be produced during the oxy-combustion process. Therefore, designing a directly heated supercritical gas turbine poses an immense amount of challenge. Motivated by the advantages of a supercritical power generation system, this study focuses on development of the conceptual layout of a ? 300 MW supercritical power generation system. The investigation has been performed incorporating two different types of combustor feed system: Gaseous and Liquid. The thermodynamic cycle analysis has been performed using ASPEN HYSYS® simulation package based on the proposed conceptual design. Furthermore, the entropy generation during the combustion process has been estimated numerically. The investigation contains the analysis of the net plant efficiency as well as the development of the P-v diagram and T-s for the gas turbines of the power generation systems. The study reveal that, although the gaseous feed system driven gas turbine generates more entropy than the liquid feed system driven gas turbine; more net work can be extracted while using the liquid feed system.
