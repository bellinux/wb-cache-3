5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than <b>mated</b> males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than <b>mated</b> males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the <b>mated</b> male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, <b>mated</b> males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E

5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the <b>mated</b> female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the <b>mated</b> male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E

50|$|Assortative <b>mating</b> is a <b>mating</b> {{pattern and}} {{a form of}} sexual {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes <b>mate</b> with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random <b>mating</b> pattern. Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. Assortative <b>mating,</b> also referred to as positive assortative <b>mating</b> or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative <b>mating</b> can be contrasted with disassortative <b>mating</b> (also known as negative assortative <b>mating</b> or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes <b>mate</b> with one another more frequently than would be expected under random <b>mating.</b> Disassortative <b>mating</b> reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative <b>mating</b> occurs more frequently than negative assortative <b>mating.</b> In both cases, due to the nonrandom <b>mating</b> pattern, there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|R

5000|$|Research has {{proposed}} that <b>mate</b> value will influence the strategies used by individuals, stating that an individuals with high <b>mate</b> value {{are able to}} implement their preferred sexual strategy in comparison to those with lower <b>mate</b> value. For example, men demonstrate preferences for short-term mates; those of higher <b>mate</b> value will be perceived as more desirable, associated with preferred traits such as status and resources. Thus, males of greater perceived <b>mate</b> value {{are more likely to}} fulfil the evolutionary preference for multiple short-term <b>mates,</b> Muehlenbein (2010) states that [...] "men of high-mate value and women of low mate-value will pursue short-term <b>mating</b> strategies". In essence, those of lower <b>mate</b> value are perceived as less attractive by potential <b>mates,</b> and as a result are less successful in <b>mate</b> selection and retaining <b>mates.</b> Both males and females wish to obtain the highest quality of <b>mate,</b> as such, strategies such as <b>mate</b> guarding are often implemented to ensure investment and interest of <b>mate</b> is continued.|$|R
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has <b>mated,</b> it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
