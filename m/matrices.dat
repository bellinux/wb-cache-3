5|$|The LU {{decomposition}} factors <b>matrices</b> as {{a product}} of lower (L) and an upper triangular <b>matrices</b> (U). Once this decomposition is calculated, linear systems can be solved more efficiently, by a simple technique called forward and back substitution. Likewise, inverses of triangular <b>matrices</b> are algorithmically easier to calculate. The Gaussian elimination is a similar algorithm; it transforms any matrix to row echelon form. Both methods proceed by multiplying the matrix by suitable elementary <b>matrices,</b> which correspond to permuting rows or columns and adding multiples of one row to another row.

In probability theory and statistics, stochastic <b>matrices</b> are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the PageRank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search.

If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square <b>matrices</b> over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible. <b>Matrices</b> over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
