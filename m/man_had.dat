5|$|In November 2012 it was {{revealed}} that EA 32751 (Gebelein <b>Man)</b> <b>had</b> probably been murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> been aged about 18 to 20 {{at the time of his}} death and had been well muscled. Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury had been caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12cm in length and 2cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the station}} was subject of a {{terrorist}} attack. A non-Norwegian <b>man</b> <b>had</b> called the Norwegian police 7.49 in the morning, claiming that he had planted a bomb on the station which would detonate 8.00, eleven minutes later. All traffic on the Østfold Line was stopped, and the station investigated, but no bombs were found.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 2015 at the long-delayed {{inquiry into}} Alexander Litvinenko's fatal {{poisoning}} Bukovsky gave his views {{as to why}} the former FSB <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been murdered. Interviewed on BBC TV eight years before, Bukovsky expressed no doubt that the Russian authorities were responsible for the London death of Litvinenko on 23 November 2006.|$|E

5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the <b>man</b> <b>had</b> also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
5|$|Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, {{delivering}} what {{proved to}} be a fatal wound. Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Neither of the seconds, Pendleton nor Van Ness, could determine who fired first, as each claimed that the other <b>man</b> <b>had</b> fired first.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that he could no longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each <b>man</b> <b>had</b> no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a <b>man</b> <b>had</b> fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud's first {{substantial}} engagement {{came through}} his family. In 1922 his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry {{invited him to}} tour in J.B. Fagan's The Wheel, as understudy, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted. A colleague, recognising that the young <b>man</b> <b>had</b> talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under Kenneth Barnes, Helen Haye and Claude Rains.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} determinants of the wage is probably the amount of formal education. Women in our sample have on average more formal education than men. For example, 17.9  % of women and 13.7  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> a high school degree; 8.7  % of women and 7.8  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> a university degree. However, there are relatively more women who have only compulsory education than men. In particular, 19.1  % of women and 13.8  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> compulsory schooling only, whereas 28.0  % of women and 48.7  % of <b>men</b> <b>have</b> completed an apprenticeship.|$|R

5|$|On 9 June 2016, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that a <b>man</b> <b>had</b> found what could possibly be debris from the aircraft at a location on Kangaroo Island, southern Australia. South Australian police collected the shoebox-sized piece and {{it was to be}} delivered to the ATSB for further investigation. The examination found out it was not from the missing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club {{wanted to run}} an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted {{to use the same}} route as had been used for the trials. In order to make the event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, though there were complaints that the rules were too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{reports that}} the Crew Cut <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> no records on file with the FBI or other agencies.

Scully declares the case open and unsolved.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} Muḥammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians {{in order to establish}} a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful. According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and jinn. Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which <b>man</b> <b>had</b> no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{understood}} logistics and its {{paramount importance}} in modern warfare, and he spared {{no effort to}} ensure that the American fighting <b>man</b> <b>had</b> all he needed for victory. Near the end of the war, Somervell was promoted to general on March 9, 1945. He was the very few officers to be promoted to that rank during the war who had not commanded combat forces overseas.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosive}} lenses {{required by}} the Fat <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill. Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park {{did not intend}} for it to become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the <b>man</b> <b>had</b> come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|Training started {{immediately}} {{and concentrated on}} physical fitness, weapons training, movement across country including cliff climbing, obstacle crossing and raiding operations. Weapons training was limited {{by the lack of}} anything other than the personal weapons (rifles and pistols) that each <b>man</b> <b>had</b> brought with him. Machine guns or anything heavier were not available at the time. In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.|$|E
