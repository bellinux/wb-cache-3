They also lacked criteria [...] "to select appropriate families for the study of a putative X-linked locus" [...] — as they did not select families based on the presence of <b>maternal</b> <b>transmission</b> of homosexuality, the Xq28 contribution to male sexual orientation may have been hidden.

2500|$|Two {{further studies}} in the 1990s gave mixed results. One was an X {{chromosome}} linkage analysis of 54 pairs of gay brothers {{carried out by the}} independent research group of Sanders et al. in 1998. The results of the study were indistinguishable from {{the results of the study}} by Hu et al.: both reported that the chromosomal location of maximum sharing was locus DXS1108 and both reported similar degrees of allele sharing (66% versus 67%). The second study by Rice et al. in 1999 studied 52 pairs of Canadian gay brothers and found no statistically significant linkage in alleles and haplotypes. Consequently, they concluded against the possibility of any gene in the Xq28 region having a large genetic influence on male sexual orientation (though they could not rule out the possibility of a gene in this region having a small influence). Rice et al. also asserted that their results do not exclude the possibility of finding male homosexuality genes elsewhere in the genome. Hamer criticized the study for not selecting families for their study population based on <b>maternal</b> <b>transmission</b> as selecting only families that show an excess of maternal gay relatives is necessary to detect the Xq28 linkage.

40|$|Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant {{disorder}} of mid-life onset characterized by chorea, dementia, and oculomotor disturbances. Anticipation is commonly seen in HD families, {{particularly when the}} disease is inherited through the father. The dis-order is associated with an expanded (CAG) n repeat in the IT 15 gene that is unstable and tends to increase in size during meiotic transmissions, particularly of paternal origin. We have detected an unusual form of HD {{on the island of}} Crete which has distinctly different characteristics. Data from eight families encom-passing 48 HD patients, showed a median age at onset 15 - 20 years later than that for HD occurring worldwide. There were no juvenile cases and no anticipation. DNA analysis in 12 HD patients showed expansion of the (CAG) n repeat the size of which was identical among members of each family or varied by only one unit.

We also analyzed molecular features of the disease, including CAG mutation length and GluR 6 gene polymorphism, according to the affected parent's gender. The mutation length was longer in paternally than in maternally transmitted HD juvenile patients (P = 0. 025), nevertheless a similar mean early onset in the two groups (P > 0. 05). This data was even enforced by that obtained from the whole cohort of patients included in the databank (n = 600) where, in the presence of increased mean parent-child CAG repeat change in paternal vs. <b>maternal</b> meiotic <b>transmissions</b> (+ 7. 3 vs. + 0. 7 CAG, P = 0. 0002), the mean parent-child year-of-onset change was similar in the two groups (- 10. 4 and - 7. 0 years, P > 0. 05). A lower TAA-triplet in GluR 6 was associated with an earlier age at onset in juvenile patients (P = 0. 031, R 2 = 0. 10).

This effect in addition to the expanded CAG repeat number, found in juvenile and not in adult patients, was slightly enforced by paternal compared to <b>maternal</b> <b>transmissions</b> (R 2 = 0. 82).

40|$|In myotonic {{dystrophy}} (DM), {{the size of}} a CTG repeat in the DM kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation. However, there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat. We examined 1, 489 DM parent-offspring pairs, of which 95 (6. 4 %) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). In 56 of the 95 pairs, clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status. It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 (48 %) of these 56 pairs, while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring. The contraction occurred in 76 (10 %) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 (3 %) of 736 <b>maternal</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal (85 %) than in paternal (37 %) transmissions (P <. 001).

Sixteen DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions. This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions (6. 4 %) and the size of DM sib population (1. 54 DM offspring per DM parent, in 968 DM parents).

The largest repeat sizes (1. 5 - 6. 0 kb) are seen in patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy, while the minimally affected patients have repeat sizes of < 0. 5 kb. Comparison of parent-child pairs has shown that most offspring have an earlier age at onset and a larger repeat size than their parents, with only 4 of 182 showing a definite decrease in repeat size, accompanied by a later age at onset or less severe phenotype.

40|$|A highly {{polymorphic}} CAG repeat locus, ERDA 1, {{was recently}} described on human chromosome 17 q 21. 3, with alleles {{as large as}} 50 - 90 repeats and without any disease association in the general population. We have studied allelic distribution at this locus in five human populations and have characterized the mutational patterns by direct observation of 731 meioses. The data show that large alleles (>/= 40 CAG repeats) are generally most common in Asian populations, less common in populations of European ancestry, and least common among Africans. We have observed a high intergenerational instability (46. 3 %+/- 5. 1 %) of the large alleles. Although the mutation rate is not dependent on parental sex, paternal transmissions have predominantly resulted in contractions, whereas <b>maternal</b> <b>transmissions</b> have yielded expansions. Within this class of large alleles, the mutation rate increases concomitantly with increasing allele size, but the magnitude of repeat size change {{does not depend on}} the size of the progenitor allele.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Myoclonus {{dystonia}} syndrome (MDS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} movement disorder caused by mutations in the epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SGCE) on chromosome 7 q 21. METHODS: We have screened for SGCE mutations in index cases from 76 French patients with myoclonic syndromes, including myoclonus dystonia (M-D), essential myoclonus (E-M), primary myoclonic dystonia, generalised dystonia, dystonia with tremor, and benign hereditary chorea. All coding exons of the SGCE gene were analysed. The DYT 1 mutation was also tested. RESULTS: Sixteen index cases had SGCE mutations while one case with primary myoclonic dystonia carried the DYT 1 mutation. Thirteen different mutations were found: three nonsense mutations, three missense mutations, three splice site mutations, three deletions, and one insertion. Eleven of the SGCE index cases had M-D and five E-M. No SGCE mutations were detected {{in patients with}} other phenotypes. The total number of mutation carriers in the families was 38, six of whom were asymptomatic. Penetrance was complete in paternal transmissions and null in <b>maternal</b> <b>transmissions.</b> MDS patients with SGCE mutation had a significantly earlier onset than the non-carriers.

The rationales are as follows: in quantitative genetic studies using either crosses (quantitative trait loci, QTL) or natural populations (genome-wide-associations studies, GWAS), {{we are aware of}} the fact that the similarity of a trait could be due to overall relatedness. For instance, mice from the same breeding pair share largely the same growth environment and could have a shared microbiome from <b>maternal</b> <b>transmissions</b> (Benson et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015). Related human individuals might also share a similar microbiome for the same reasons (Goodrich et al., 2016). Conversely, if the populations we study are not well-mixed, but subpopulations exist, thus providing a distinct population structure, the traits we find to be different between individuals might not be due to the effects of a few genes but rather longer term history of evolution, separation, drifts and so on (Yatsunenko et al., 2012). It is essential to account for kinship in QTL studies and GWAS analysis, and to thoroughly determine if there is distinctive population structure. Usually, all but one related individual are removed in a GWAS, and many try to keep the studied population as homogeneous as possible; however, there are also mathematical solutions that take kinship into account, or population structure via the genetic principle components (Kang et al., 2008; Price et al., 2010).|$|R
