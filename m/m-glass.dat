30|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to overcome the above restrictions of bond-redistribution schemes activated in host-guest systems is to explore nanostructurization under non-disturbed bond balance in a host glassy matrix. This resolution can be well illustrated by glass deposition in MNP initially formed at a surface of dielectric substrate, when upper film plays only a rope of covering layer ensuring necessary difference in optical refractive index n with these MNPs [11, 30 â€“ 32]. <b>M-glass</b> interaction in such system is essentially suppressed because of the absence of unfettered atoms supplied from covering glass layer.|$|E
