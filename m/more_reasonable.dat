5|$|Barnard Castle School (colloquially Barney School or locally the County School) is a co-educational {{independent}} day and {{boarding school}} in the market town of Barnard Castle, County Durham, in the North East of England. It {{is a member of}} The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). It was founded in 1883 with funding from a 13th-century endowment of John I de Balliol and the bequest of the local industrialist Benjamin Flounders. The ambition was to create a school {{of the quality of the}} ancient public schools at a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> cost, whilst accepting pupils regardless of their faith.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, it is <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> to suspect the Coptic, {{the version of}} the country in which it was written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E
5|$|Neither he nor Greenfield had {{run as a}} {{candidate}} in the election, and neither {{was a member of}} the legislature. Percival Baker, the UFA member elected for Ponoka, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, Peace River, became available when incumbent Donald MacBeth Kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election. Greenfield seemed a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was acclaimed as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.|$|E
60|$|Sam Barney {{was known}} to all his acquaintances as a boy opposed to rising very early, or working very hard, {{and it had been}} no <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> to suppose Jip would be warned in time.|$|R
5000|$|But M. Andrew Holowchak's 2013 book, [...] "Framing a Legend" [...] {{critically}} and exhaustively examines that {{scholarship and}} establishes <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> doubt that elderly Jefferson {{had a secret}} affair of long duration with his young domestic.|$|R
60|$|This {{seemed no}} <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable,</b> and hope once more filled my heart as I {{led the way}} along the bank, now moving with greater caution because it was more {{probable}} we might come upon the enemy.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|Stafford repaid the king's {{generosity}} {{by serving}} him faithfully {{as a local}} commissioner, {{in a part of}} the country that had up until that point been fiercely Lancastrian. Throughout the 1460s he presided at Quarter Sessions and other courts all over the West Country. His activities were not limited to legal commissions; in 1461–2 he performed military service against the Scots, and in 1468 he conducted diplomacy with Brittany. In 1469 he was admitted to the Royal Council, and served on the commission that convicted Henry Courtenay, Thomas Courtenay's brother, for treason. According to the chronicler John Warkworth, Henry's downfall was due to the machinations of Stafford, who was rewarded with further land and the earldom of Devon on 17 May 1469. However, the king himself took great interest in the trial against Courtenay, and it is <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> to see the decision as a result of Edward's need for a loyal agent in the region.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted {{to him as a}} reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or if it had been the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> to assume that he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E
50|$|Object Evaluation: Acquiring {{through one}} or <b>more</b> {{appraisers}} <b>reasonable</b> {{evaluations of the}} work would be helpful especially if the work is to be disposed of via sale, auction, transfer or exchange for value in kind with another institution.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. What was {{looked for}} was <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> satisfaction--ye have no {{come up to}} expectations. Forby, it's my opinion that {{damaging}} reports have somehow leaked out from the mine. Just now I see clouds on the horizon." ...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though it}} is <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> to argue that this huge amount of crustal {{shortening}} most probably results {{from a combination of}} these three mechanisms, it is nevertheless the last mechanism which created the high topographic relief of the Himalaya.|$|R
5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E
25|$|A {{compromise}} between the two, following {{the most direct}} route and crossing major rivers at <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> places than the coastal route.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, the {{management}} have regained what the supporters consider <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> an attitude by concentrating back on SM-Liiga, but the line-ups {{have had a}} notable turnover rate between seasons – a distinct core has not developed or been preserved.|$|E
30|$|As may be noted, the Ukrainian {{community}} {{is the most}} numerous in Campania, which justifies the choice to analyze it. By combining the official data about immigrants and their ventures, the choice to focus on Ukrainian entrepreneurs in Caserta appears much <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{landlord}} cannot {{charge a}} Section 8 tenant <b>more</b> than a <b>reasonable</b> rent and cannot accept payments outside the contract.|$|R
50|$|He {{maintained}} a <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> strike rate {{on his return}} to the club, netting 21 goals in his 59 appearances over the next three years, but he was troubled by a knee injury for much of this time and was forced to retire in 1978.|$|R
25|$|George Westinghouse's company bought Philip Diehl's {{competing}} induction lamp {{patent rights}} (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the Edison patent to charge a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{rate for the}} use of the Edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.|$|E
25|$|Conflicts {{were usually}} {{resolved}} with the antagonists persuaded to adapt <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> methods {{to achieve their}} aims (with {{the assistance of the}} heroes). Natural disasters triggered by human (or alien) activity were often shown, and environmental themes featured strongly in the program. Three other DC Comics superheroes were featured as guest stars during this season: the Flash, Plastic Man, and Green Arrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{worsening}} {{crisis in}} Bosnia commanded attention and demanded {{some kind of}} U.S. response. Aspin did not favor using ground forces {{to intervene in the}} civil war involving the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs, and Croats, but thought that the use of sophisticated weapons was a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> option. Eventually the administration decided on an airdrop of humanitarian aid, even though Aspin did not favor the plan.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked into}} town with J------ this morning, and, meeting a monk in the Via Furnace, I thought it no <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable,</b> {{as the good}} father fixed his eyes on me, to provide against the worst by putting both hands behind me, with the forefingers and little fingers stuck out.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the more}} rare models of this time was the 1979 to 1980 Century Turbo Coupe, powered by a {{turbocharged}} version of the 3.8L V6, which offered V8-like performance with <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The Turbo Coupe {{was not nearly as}} popular as the similar Regal Turbo Sport Coupe of the time, and total production is estimated to be less than 2,500.|$|E
25|$|Several false myths accrued in {{the lore}} of the All American, {{some of which}} were refuted in a 2012 {{interview}} of her bombardier Ralph Burbridge. Burbridge explained that the aircraft returned to her base in North Africa, and could not have made a long trip back to England as widely recounted. The base near Biskra, Algeria, was a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> 300 miles from the bombing target.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{election}} pitting Paul Garrett against Morgan Wendell in the novel. Wendell {{is elected}} Commissioner of Resources, and Garrett reluctantly accepts his offer {{to be his}} principal deputy. The novel also portrays Morgan Wendell as a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> and balanced man than what is depicted in the miniseries. It is he, not Paul Garrett, who makes the reference to Warren G. Harding as the anti-standard by which all politicians should be judged.|$|E
25|$|In a <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> {{campaign}} Santos finished {{eighth in}} the regular season and thus qualified for the play-offs. Eliminating São Paulo (and its young duo Kaká and Luís Fabiano) in the quarter-finals, the club faced Grêmio in the semi-finals. After a 3–0 victory at the Vila Belmiro, they went through the final even after a 0–1 away loss.|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, {{after the}} {{lump-sum}} payment period, when subjects get no income at all, {{participants in the}} experiment performed relatively well adjusting their behaviour to the optimal path. Rather to consume their available income immediately after the lump-sum period, they keep on smoothing their consumption and adjust it to the optimal path in a <b>more</b> than <b>reasonable</b> way.|$|R

25|$|The Law on Presidential Elections {{accepted}} {{and put into}} effect on 20 January 2012 decided that presidential elections {{will be held in}} 2014 instead of 2012; within 60 days {{before the end of the}} seven-year term of incumbent President of Turkey Abdullah Gül, who will be the last indirectly elected President of Turkey. As Gül took office on 28 August 2007, the first possible day could be 29 June, but a date between 10 and 17 August is considered <b>more</b> <b>reasonable.</b>|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 2015, Watts {{announced}} {{the reversal of}} the decision to end UAB football due to the large public opinion against the decision and the public fundraising of more than $27 million towards the program. The Blazers football program will resume play as early as 2016, and that rifle and bowling would also be reinstated. On June 4, 2015, Athletic Director Mark Ingram indicated that the 2017 season was a <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> timeline to field a football team for play.|$|E
25|$|Critique by Fritz Lehman: Given {{that this}} book is {{intended}} as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates, Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief preserver of separate Islamic identity in India, yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given. Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the most revealing. The tone of the book in general is <b>more</b> <b>reasonable</b> and moderate than such earlier publications. Assessment of the Marathas, for example, while unsympathetic is fair to the facts.|$|E
