40|$|The Zinifex Century Zinc mine, in the {{southern}} Gulf of northwest Queensland is expected to operate until 2017. The mine is a major regional economic driver and the closure will be significant for the Gulf communities. Accordingly it is now timely to consider the post <b>mine</b> <b>economy</b> for the region and to consider how best to lever off the existing and planned activity of the mine. This study analyses the economic contribution of the Zinifex Mine to {{the southern}} Gulf, assesses the likely impacts and provides some suggested pathways forward to capitalise on the existing investment window the mine has to offer as well capturing any development opportunities the mine {{will have on the}} region. While the primary goal is the post <b>mine</b> <b>economy,</b> underpinning the future economic development options identified for the southern Gulf are a range of social, cultural and attitudinal issues. These include cultural differences between indigenous and non indigenous Australians as well as the will, interest, skill and or capacity and business acumen of many non-indigenous and indigenous groups required to achieve self reliance. An integrated model is proposed to provide a framework to foster the post <b>mine</b> <b>economy.</b> The model provided emphasises three areas (a) underpinning prerequisites, (b) development of specific business opportunities, and (c) fostering individual and community capacity. These need to be considered holistically. The dynamics of the area and the support systems required are discussed in terms of achieving “on the ground” change.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. After several decades of economic decline, mining's growing importance in many African economies has been welcomed, but {{the rate of}} sectoral transformation from rural agrarian to more urbanised <b>mining</b> <b>economies,</b> has not afforded sufficient time for policymakers to fully appreciate {{the nature of the}} developmental processes underway. This study focuses on the economic, social and cultural change associated with rapid and/or erratic rates of urban growth propelled by mining expansion in three contrasting countries: Angola (diamonds) Ghana (gold) Tanzania (gold/diamonds) As a prelude to field studies, an international conference will be held to overview the impact of mining on urbanisation in Africa's major emergent <b>mining</b> <b>economies.</b> Phase 2 encompasses key informant interviews, focus group discussions and surveys in small and large-scale mining settlements to probe miners' migration, earnings, work and living conditions. Phase 3 involves interviews with national policymakers about their perceptions of mining's influence on urbanization and poverty. Phase 4 concentrates on dissemination of research findings. A 'Digging Deeper' participatory programme involving youth groups expressing their perceptions of life in mining settlements in various art forms explores the local population's consciousness of their cultural and social identity transformation. The overall aim is to disseminate knowledge of actual as opposed to rumoured outcomes of mining livelihoods to facilitate the formulation of policies tailored to current realities...|$|R
40|$|The Zinifex Century Zinc mine, {{located in}} the {{southern}} Gulf of northwest Queensland has fourteen years of operation remaining. The mine is a major economic driver in the region. Accordingly it is now timely to consider the post <b>mine</b> <b>economy</b> for the region and to consider how best to lever off the existing and planned activity of the mine during its remaining period of operation. As such, this pending closure provides an ideal case study for understanding issues associated with developing post <b>mine</b> <b>economies.</b> The Zinifex Century Mine provides direct employment for over 600 people at the site. A further 1500 people {{are estimated to be}} indirectly employed. Since 1997 the revenue to the state from Zinifex’s activities has been of the order of $ 155 m. The potential benefit of the mine to the State and the region is approximated at $ 520 m of minimum guaranteed revenue. This study assesses the economic contribution of the Zinfex Mine to the communities of the southern Gulf, explores the likely impacts of its closure. In addition, the study provides some suggested pathways to capitalise on the existing investment window the mine has to offer. Many of the strategies identified for the economic transition to a post <b>mine</b> <b>economy</b> for the southern Gulf are interrelated. The successful progress on a particular activity is dependent on the progress of other activity. Furthermore, the southern Gulf region has a number of socio-economic characteristics that make the region less well off than the rest of Queensland. The area is disadvantaged in comparison to other regions of Queensland by low income families, residents with little formal training and non-school qualifications, {{a large portion of the}} labour force employed as unskilled labour and significant unemployment. Zinfex Century Zinc Mine has contributed to the southern Gulf communities in three significant areas: Altering the population, industry employment, training and occupational characteristics of the southern Gulf communities; Sponsoring programs attempting to improve the health, employment, education and social welfare of indigenous communities through the Gulf Communities Agreement (GCA); and Through direct and indirect economic impacts flowing from mine employment and the purchase of mining goods and services from businesses operating within the southern Gulf...|$|R
