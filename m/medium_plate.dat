In study A, 2, 000 urine specimens were processed and 511 cultures were found positive. The DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 and CLED medium plates gave the same detection rate, 99. 7 %. For the direct identification of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus sp. isolates, the DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 <b>medium</b> <b>plate</b> showed overall sensitivities of 97 and 93. 4 %, respectively. In study B, 3, 000 urine specimens were processed and 714 cultures were found positive. The DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 and CLED medium plates gave detection rates of 99. 4, 99. 9, and 99. 2 %, respectively. For the direct identification of E. coli, P. mirabilis, and Enterococcus sp. isolates, the DipStreak device and the UriSelect 3 <b>medium</b> <b>plate</b> showed overall sensitivities of 88 and 94. 4 %, respectively. In conclusion, the DipStreak device with both medium formulations represents an attractive and excellent screening method for the reliable detection, counting, and presumptive identification of urinary tract pathogens.

This kind of vector relies on lethal genes, lethal sites, dominant functions conferring cell sensitivity on metabolites or repressors of antibiotic resistance to exert such selection pressure (Bernard 1995). Several positive selection system-based vectors have been considered efficient tools to date for simplifying in vitro DNA recombination procedures (Liu et al. 2011). The ccdB killing gene has been widely used in constructing positive selection vectors as it has become a highly efficient lethal selection gene for DNA cloning (Weibel et al. 2013).|$|E
