This approach is based on synthesizing a positive-real admittance or impedance function using springs, dampers and inerters. This paper solves the following problem: {{what is the most}} general class of <b>mechanical</b> <b>admittances</b> which can be realized if the number of dampers and inerters is restricted to one in each case, while allowing an arbitrary number of springs and no transformers (levers) ? The solution uses element extraction of the damper and inerter followed by the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for the one-element-kind (transformerless) realization of an associated three-port network. This involves the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for a third-order non-negative definite matrix to be reducible to a paramount matrix using a diagonal transformation.

40|$|Open AccessThis paper {{proposes a}} novel inerter-based {{electromagnetic}} device and investigates its {{performance as a}} vehicle suspension strut. The inerter-based electromagnetic device is obtained by placing the flywheel employed in an existing inerter prototype into a constant magnetic field. During rotation of the flywheel, the flywheel is doing the magnetic line cutting motion, which makes the flywheel perform as a Faraday generator. The influences {{of different types of}} loads on the behaviour of the inerter-based electromagnetic device are analyzed, and it is shown that the resistive, capacitive and inductive loads can contribute to the damping, the inertance, and the stiffness of the whole device, respectively. Moreover, the proposed device {{can also be used to}} realize higher-order <b>mechanical</b> <b>admittances</b> by using electrical circuits. The performance of the device as a suspension strut is also studied. Numerical simulations show that the proposed device can not only provide improvements on the suspension performance (ride comfort and road holding) compared with the conventional strut, but also generate an amount of electric energy that can be utilized by other parts of the vehicle. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with passive network synthesis in a mechanical context and applications to vehicle suspensions. This dissertation first presents a modified test for positive-realness of real-rational functions which appears only subtly different from a known condition. The test allows existing results to be derived more simply and allows more general results to be established. We then consider a realisation problem of restricted complexity where the number of dampers and inerters is restricted to one in each case, while allowing an arbitrary number of springs and no transformers (levers). The solution uses element extraction of the damper and inerter followed by the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for the one-element-kind (transformerless) realisation of an associated three-port network. This involves the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for a third-order non-negative definite matrix to be reducible to a paramount matrix using a diagonal transformation. It is shown that the relevant class of <b>mechanical</b> <b>admittances</b> can be parametrised in terms of five circuit arrangements each containing four springs. We investigate and compare the performances of the five circuit arrangements proposed when applied to suspension systems. One of the five circuits {{has appeared in the}} literature and therefore serves as the benchmark. One or more circuit arrangements appear to outperform the benchmark in terms of each individual performance measure among the three of interest and a multi-objective performance measure incorporating two of the three individual performance measures. Finally, we consider the minimum reactance synthesis of a class of biquadratic functions by reactance extraction. We show that at most four dampers are needed to synthesise the remaining resistive 3 -port network when explicit conditions are met. The results are an advancement on an equivalent problem studied in the electrical network case. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{vibrational}} coupling between the strings, the bridge and the soundboard of the piano in its treble register is presented. Each one of these vibrating structures is separately described by its <b>mechanical</b> input <b>admittance</b> matrix in which the nine terms represent impulse responses or frequency responses to a vectorial input force. The total admittance matrix is analytical and is calculated by assembling the latter in accordance with classical mechanical continuity equations.

Simulations show that the two perpendicular polarisations of bending motion of a single string influence each other due to the elastic response of the bridge. Similar to this is the coupling between unison strings. These interactions give rise to beats and double decay phenomena, which are of particular interest to professional piano makers and tuners.

40|$|In many {{everyday}} {{activities such}} as steering a bicycle, unpredictable mechanical disturbances trigger quick involuntary and situation-specific reactions via neural loops generally referred to as reflexes. Research investigating reflexes via transient perturbations elicit muscle activations typically observed as two distinct responses in an electromyography with the short-latency response M 1 viewed as stereotyped and task-independent and the long-latency response M 2 seen as task-dependent. In contrast, task-dependency of short-latency pathways (specifically velocity and force feedback) was demonstrated by studies using continuous perturbations and system identification techniques to separate reflex from voluntary contributions. This study addressed the opposing experimental findings by isolating reflex contributions in the human wrist joint using both the transient and the continuous approach simultaneously in conditions where reflex modulation is expected. Subjects (n = 11) held a manipulator handle which applied mechanical perturbations and imposed a virtual mechanical environment to the wrist. Increasing damping {{of the environment and}} reduced continuous perturbation bandwidth in a "maintain position" task (PT) decreased the subject’s <b>mechanical</b> joint <b>admittance,</b> increased excitatory velocity and force feedback obtained from a neuromuscular model, increased M 2 but did not affect M 1. Instructing subjects to "maintain force" increased the joint admittance, decreased M 2 and counterproductive to the task increased M 1 with respect to the PT. Results from this study indicate that the continuous approach does not condition M 1 and that the reflexive feedback from short-latency pathways obtained via the presented neuromuscular model does not directly map to the M 1 elicited by transient perturbations.

Two alternative realization schemes are described that are capable of implementing this class (under ideal assumptions). The first scheme incorporates an interconnected multilever arrangement consisting of four separate hydraulic circuits, which transforms the separate wheel station displacements to bounce, pitch, roll, and warp motions. Four separate mechanical admittances are connected across the transformed terminals of the multilever. The second scheme is kinematically equivalent to the first but the multilever part consists of four modular subsystems to achieve the same kinematic transformation. The purpose of the class is to allow a high degree of independence between the modes of vehicle motion, e. g. low warp stiffness independent of front and rear anti-roll stiffness. Practical issues that might be involved in implementing the realization schemes are discussed, as well as generalizations to two- and six-wheeled vehicles.

Continuous random force disturbances were applied at the hand while the subjects were instructed to minimize the devia-tion resulting from the force disturbances. The results were ana-lyzed in the frequency domain with frequency response functions (FRFs). Two FRFs were evaluated: 1) the <b>mechanical</b> <b>admittance</b> and 2) the reflexive impedance, expressing the dynamic relation between position and muscle activation (assessed via electromyog-raphy, EMG). The reflexive impedance is a direct measure of the proprioceptive reflexes. To record all relevant dynamical charac-teristics of the arm, wide bandwidth signals were used as force disturbance. Distributing {{the power of the}} signal over fewer fre-quencies within the bandwidth improved the signal-to-noise-ratio SNR of the EMG recordings, facilitating reliable estimation of the reflexive impedance. The coherence indicated that the rela-tion between force disturbance and EMG is linear under the given conditions and improved with the SNR. The method of designing disturbance signals and the estimation of the reflexive impedance are useful for studies aiming to quantify proprioceptive reflexes and to investigate its functionality.
