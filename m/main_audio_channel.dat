5000|$|WGVU-FM 88.5 {{broadcasts}} in HD Radio {{and operates}} two side channels. WGVU-HD2 is a simulcast of [...] "Real Oldies" [...] 1480 WGVU-AM/850 WGVS, and WGVU-HD3 is all jazz. Additionally the station's audio simulcasts on the digital subchannels of WGVU/WGVK-TV on channel 35.4/52.4 via the secondary audio program of that station (WGVU/WGVS {{is on the}} <b>main</b> <b>audio</b> <b>channel),</b> which features scrolling television schedules along with visual song/artist information for the radio audio.|$|E
50|$|TV Japan airs various {{programs}} from Japan including news coverage from NHK, dramas, movies, children's programs, and entertainment shows. Programming is provided mainly by NHK, but some entertainment programs originate from commercial Japanese broadcasters including Tokyo Broadcasting System, Nippon TV, Fuji Television and TV Asahi. Some programming is subtitled or dubbed into English, while NHK's main news programs {{are available with}} English translation on SAP, with the original Japanese presentation on the <b>main</b> <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b> TV Japan also features extensive sports coverage including coverage of the Grand Sumo tournaments, Nippon Professional Baseball games and J-League soccer matches.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, at {{the behest}} of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, CPAC and its {{carriers}} started to allow television viewers to choose which language they can hear the service in, putting the feed of one language on the service's <b>main</b> <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> and the feed of the other language on its second audio program channel. Some cable systems also offer the two feeds on separate channels for easier access. CPAC has also offered a [...] "floor" [...] feed, a feed that does not carry any simultaneous translation, although due to the changes noted above, it may not remain in use over cable or satellite television.|$|E
50|$|Second audio {{programs}} {{are also available}} in other media. On analog television receive-only satellite television systems, audio {{programs are}} manually tuned by their subcarrier frequency, commonly around 6 MHz, often as low as 5.8 or as high as 7.2. These travel {{the same way as}} the discrete left and right <b>main</b> <b>audio</b> <b>channels,</b> and ATIS station ID, which is heard as Morse code. On FM radio, radio reading services and other audio programs can be heard on subcarriers; however, these are generally prohibited from public listening. On digital television systems, selection is done through a menu as with analog television, though some provide easier access rather than having to dig down to find the option. Stations may also choose to transmit audio-only programs by assigning them to separate digital subchannels with an optional screen of title and artist information; however, this prevents the viewer from watching the main video in the case of television stations.|$|R
5000|$|These FM {{multiplex}} transmissions {{started in}} November 1934 {{and consisted of}} the <b>main</b> <b>channel</b> <b>audio</b> program and three subcarriers: a fax program, a synchronizing signal for the fax program and a telegraph [...] "order" [...] channel. These original FM multiplex subcarriers were amplitude modulated.|$|R
50|$|Nickelodeon is {{available}} on Astro Channel 612. English is the primary <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> with dub in Malay on secondary <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b> In 2008, a third <b>audio</b> <b>channel,</b> Mandarin, was added. However the Malay and Mandarin <b>audio</b> <b>channels</b> are only available on selected programming blocks. Attempts to access them on blocks where they are not transmitted yields the English primary <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|R
50|$|WMHE, {{with its}} unique blend {{of rock and}} roll, became a very popular Toledo station {{garnishing}} the highest Toledo ratings during middays, {{and because of the}} large coverage area, it became very popular throughout a good portion of Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. The station gained in popularity when many of the stores that carried Muzak, would switch over to the <b>main</b> <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> in order to pull in WMHE. Its primary competition was WIOT, and some of the WIOT jocks joined the WMHE airstaff over the next few years. They included Dorien Pastor (founder of WIOT), John Fisher as the new morning man and program director (now at KHTP-Seattle), and Bob Thomas. Toledo jock Buddy Carr was also part of the airstaff in 1976. Rick Bird was news director for a time with other news personalities Tom Waniewski and Chris O'Connor both from the University of Toledo.niewskiBecause of Mr. Hillebrand’s fascination with new radio technology, WMHE was partially automated. The automation consisted of a bank of six cartridge “carousels” each holding 24 tape cartridges. All of the music was on these cartridges or “carts” (similar to 8-track tapes), but only one item (a song, a voicetrack, or a commercial) was on each cart. The jocks would record their announcements on individual carts, usually introducing a song or back-announcing a few songs that had just played in the carousel. Portions of the morning and evening shows were performed ‘live'.|$|E

40|$|An {{audio signal}} having {{at least one}} <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> and {{associated}} direction parameters indicating a direction of origin of {{a portion of the}} <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> with respect to a recording position is reconstructed to derive a reconstructed audio signal. A desired direction of origin with respect to the recording position is selected. The portion of the <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> is modified for deriving a reconstructed portion of the reconstructed audio signal, wherein the modifying comprises increasing an intensity of the portion of the <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> having direction parameters indicating a direction of origin close to the desired direction of origin with respect to another portion of the <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> having direction parameters indicating a direction of origin further away from the desired direction of origin...|$|R
50|$|In 1958, WFMT and {{television}} station WTTW collaborated on a pioneering stereo music project in which WTTW broadcast a left <b>audio</b> <b>channel,</b> and WFMT broadcast the right <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|In addition, the {{baseband}} {{characteristics of}} the <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> provided by voice radios are often quite {{different from those of}} telephone <b>audio</b> <b>channels.</b> This led to the need in some cases to enable or disable pre-emphasis or de-emphasis circuits in the radios and/or modems.|$|R

25|$|VCDs {{are often}} bilingual. Because they feature stereo audio, disc players have {{an option to}} play only {{the left or right}} <b>audio</b> <b>channel.</b> On some films, they feature English on the left <b>audio</b> <b>channel</b> and Cantonese on the right; more {{commonly}} Hong Kong VCDs will feature Mandarin on one channel and Cantonese on the other. This is similar to selecting a language track on a DVD, except it's limited to 2 languages, due to there being only two <b>audio</b> <b>channels</b> (left and right).

The device comprises automatic level adjustment means (12, 13) for adjusting the sound level of the at least one auxiliary channel relative to the main channel.

5000|$|D-MAC (used by British Satellite Broadcasting) but {{not used}} on cable systems. This is a {{satellite}} only MAC format. Also used by NRK.
