2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed in the doorway and joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he laughed. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a <b>movement</b> <b>backwards</b> and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point she knelt down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside and when she did, Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, I wanted that fellow." [...] Ellen Barry said that she responded [...] "Well, Joe, I never heard Aaron say anything against you." [...] And he replied [...] "He would do me harm if he could; he did his best." ...|$|E

5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their <b>movements</b> <b>backwards,</b> as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|R

When this happens the player is left with something like 200 or 500 credits, the game becomes next to impossible, and the player has to start all over again.|$|R

Vibration of the tendon causes <b>movement</b> <b>backwards</b> and the illusion of a forward body tilt in standing subjects. This is because vibrations stimulate muscle spindles in the calf muscles.

Then, soft tissue of the mandible is detached from the bone; done by stripping attaching tissues. A horizontal incision is then made inferior to the first bicuspids, bilaterally, where bone cuts (osteotomies) are made vertically inferior, extending to the inferior border of the mandible, thereby detaching the bony segments of the mandible. The bony segments are stabilized with titanium plates; no fixation (binding of the jaw) necessary. If advancement is indicated for the chin, there are inert products available to implant onto the mandible, utilizing titanium screws, bypassing bone cuts.|$|E

50|$|For his 1986 fantasy film Highlander, {{director}} Russell Mulcahy employs multiple match cuts {{to indicate}} <b>movements</b> <b>backwards</b> {{in time and}} forwards again to the present day, {{telling the story of}} an immortal who relives episodes from his past in the ancient Highlands of Scotland (and later across Europe), as he faces his final challenge in modern New York City. Examples include a World Wrestling Federation match cutting back to the bloody clan battles of his youth, a fish tank cutting back to an experience in a boat on a loch, and an emotional face in the past dissolving into a giant NYC advertising hoarding showing the impassive Mona Lisa. In the case of this film, the match cut is integral to the storytelling, as a potentially confusing back-and-forth narrative is thus held together; with the denouement's final cut to Scotland cleverly revealed to be not a jump in time, as previously, through the inclusion of a modern fighter jet in flight over the Highlands.|$|R

40|$|The essay explores {{nationalism}} {{in the curriculum}} of the swedish school from 1878 to 1994. The text has been undertaken an analysis in three levels of discourse based on Norman Faircloughs critical language analysis. The first level is the text, the second is types of discourses {{and the third is}} order of discourse. The {{nationalism in}} the curriculum has been related to three nationalistic types of discourses, derived from earlier studies on Swedish nationalism. They are conservative nationalism, “folkhemsnationalism” and contemporary nationalism. These discourses are related to Antonio Gramscis theory on hegemony and power in the capitalist society witch covers the order of discourse level of the analysis. Nationalism is then viewed as an ideology to maintain status quo and that the discursive changes are the result of an hegemonic negotiation between dominant and subaltern.  The study shows how an conservative nationalism dominates in the curriculum from 1878 and 1919. There is some signs of the “folkhemsnationalism” in 1919 but it is not until 1955 that it becomes dominant. The contemporary nationalism is a less clear category than the earlier kinds. It is existing in 1969, then there is a <b>movement</b> <b>backwards</b> in the 1980 before the contemporary nationalism becomes dominant in 1994. ...|$|E

40|$|It is only {{possible}} to pivot (horizontally rotate) conventional harvester cranes at the crane pillar. A {{new type of}} harvester crane has an extra pivoting point on the outer boom, which {{makes it possible to}} reach behind residual trees and thus probably ease thinning work. This paper quantifies differences in harvester time consumption between a conventional crane and a pivoting outer boom (POB) crane in thinning by the use of a simulation study and a field study. Simulations were made in two mapped stands. A harvester equipped with a POB crane was used in the field study. The work of a conventional crane was performed with the same machine by not using the pivoting function. Six blocks were created with densities ranging from 1230 to 3100 trees per hectare and the tree choice was restricted. The POB crane required 4 - 8 % less time compared to the conventional crane in the simulation study and 7 - 15 % less in the field study. In the field study, the POB crane’s mean time consumption was significantly lower for the work elements machine <b>movement</b> <b>backwards</b> and crane out. The number of machine movements backward was significantly lower for the POB crane, and 17 % more trees could be cut per machine position by the POB crane. The pivoting function was used on 29 % of the cut trees. Based on the consistent results from the simulation and the field study, it is concluded that the pivoting function significantly increased productivity in thinning...|$|E
40|$|Since World War II, {{state support}} for {{scientific}} {{research has been}} assumed crucial to technological and economic progress. Governments accordingly spent tremendous sums to that end. Nothing epitomizes the alleged fruits of that involvement better than the electronic digital computer. The first such computer has been widely reputed to be the ENIAC, financed by the U. S. Army for the war but finished afterwards. Vastly improved computers followed, initially paid for in good share by the Federal Government of the United States, but {{with the private sector}} then dominating, both in development and use, and computers are of major significance.;Despite the supposed success of public-supported science, evidence is that computers would have evolved much the same without it but at less expense. Indeed, the foundations of modern computer theory and technology were articulated before World War II, both as a tool of applied mathematics and for information processing, and the computer was itself on the cusp of reality. Contrary to popular understanding, the ENIAC actually represented a <b>movement</b> <b>backwards</b> and a dead end.;Rather, modern computation derived more directly, for example, from the prewar work of John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford Berry, a physics professor and graduate student, respectively, at Iowa State College (now University) in Ames, Iowa. They built the Atanasoff Berry Computer (ABC), which, although special purpose and inexpensive, heralded the efficient and elegant design of modern computers. Moreover, while no one foresaw commercialization of computers based on the ungainly and costly ENIAC, the commercial possibilities of the ABC were immediately evident, although unrealized due to war. Evidence indicates, furthermore, that the private sector was willing and able to develop computers beyond the ABC and could have done so more effectively than government, to the most sophisticated machines.;A full and inclusive history of computers suggests that Adam Smith, the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher, had it right. He believed that minimal and aloof government best served society, and that the inherent genius of citizens was itself enough to ensure the general prosperity...|$|E
