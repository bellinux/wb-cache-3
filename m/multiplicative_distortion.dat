This paper {{describes}} the continuous speech recognition {{performance in the}} car environments. Especially various kinds of phoneme models are evaluated. Since the speech recognition performance considerably degrades in the noisy environments, we must cope with this problem in the car environments. There are two primary factors which cause the degradation of the recognition performance. One is the additive noises such as the background noises, {{and the other is}} the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> such as the reverberation in the car cabin which is emphasized by the distance between a speaker and a microphone. In this paper, the phoneme models which take the additive noises and the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> into account are trained from the simulated speech data. When the car engine is off, the best word recognition rate is 98. 8 % for the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> phoneme model which is trained with the speech data generated by the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> simulation. When the car is in the running condition, the best recognition rate is 97. 2 % for the phoneme model which considers the <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> and the additive noises. These results show the effectiveness of the phoneme models which are trained from the simulated speech database in the car environments...|$|E

This paper {{investigates the}} Cepstrum Mean Normalization(CMN) {{which has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} useful for compensation of multiplicative distortions. However, the performance of usual CMN is limited because the normalization by a single cepstrum mean vector {{is not enough to}} compensate many factors of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> in real environments. To solve this problem, a new method E-CMN is proposed. The method estimates two cepstrum mean vectors, one for speech and the other for non-speech for each speaker and subtracts them from an input cepstrum This method is capable of compensating various kinds of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> collectively to normalize input spectra. Furthermore, a new model-adaptive approach E-CMN/PMC, based on E- CMN and HMM composition, is proposed for environments with additive noise and multiplicative distortions. This method is simplified in a sense {{that it is possible to}} add speech models and an additive noise model without any iterative operations. Matching gains for all frequency bands of speech models to the noise model are uniquely estimated as a cepstrum mean vector for speech.

A fundamental problem in its own right, it has also drawn {{a great deal of}} interest from applied communities interested in empirical analysis of large-scale graphs. In this paper, we establish a connection between distortion and quasi-cyclicity of graphs, and use it to derive lower and upper bounds on metric distortion. Two particularly simple and natural graphs with large quasi-cyclicity are n-node cycles and n × n square lattices, and our lower bound shows that any hyperbolic-space embedding of these graphs incurs a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion</b> of at least O(n/log n). This is in sharp contrast to Euclidean space, where both of these graphs can be embedded with only constant <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortion.</b> We also establish a relation between quasi-cyclicity and d-hyperbolicity of a graph as a way to prove upper bounds on the distortion. Using this relation, we show that graphs with small quasi-cyclicity can be embedded into hyperbolic space with only constant additive distortion. Finally, we also present an efficient (linear-time) randomized algorithm for embedding a graph with small quasi-cyclicity into hyperbolic space, so that with high probability at least a (1 - 2 ̆ 6 amp;epsis;) fraction of the node-pairs has only constant additive distortion.

In this work, we show that the solution to this problem, and its generalization to $N$ dimensions, allows us to discover a quantized form of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma, i. e., one that combines a linear dimensionality reduction procedure with a uniform quantization of precision $delta> 0 $. In particular, given a finite set $mathcal S subset mathbb R^N$ of $S$ points and a distortion level $epsilon> 0 $, as soon as $M > M_ 0 = O(epsilon^{- 2 } log S) $, we can (randomly) construct a mapping from $(mathcal S, ell_ 2) $ to $(deltamathbb Z^M, ell_ 1) $ that approximately preserves the pairwise distances between the points of $mathcal S$. Interestingly, compared to the common JL Lemma, the mapping is quasi-isometric and we observe both an additive and a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>distortions</b> on the embedded distances. These two distortions, however, decay as $O(sqrt{(log S) /M}) $ when $M$ increases. Moreover, for coarse quantization, i. e., for high $delta$ compared to the set radius, the distortion is mainly additive, while for small $delta$ we tend to a Lipschitz isometric embedding. Finally, we prove the existence of a "nearly" quasi-isometric embedding of $(mathcal S, ell_ 2) $ into $(deltamathbb Z^M, ell_ 2) $. This one involves a non-linear distortion of the $ell_ 2 $-distance in $mathcal S$ that vanishes for distant points in this set.

40|$|Abstract- In OFDM {{transmission}} over an FIR channel, {{an accepted}} method for combating the resultant IS 1 is via {{addition of a}} cyclic prefix whose length exceeds the the FIR channel duration, to each transmitted data block. This converts the time-domain linear convolution of the FIR channel to cyclic convolution, or effectively, to a <b>multiplicative</b> channel <b>distortion</b> in the frequency domain. The (frequency-domain) multiplicative channel is easily estimated by use of a training sequence thereby greatly reducing channel equalization complexity {{at the cost of}} reduction in spectral efficiency due to the cyclic prefix. This paper explores OFDM systems without cyclic prefix and training sequence. By adopting virtual carriers and exploiting the finite alphabet property of the input symbols, a blind technique for joint estimation of channel and data symbols is developed. While this restores the spectral efficiency, it is achieved at the expense of increased processing complexity at the receiver. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Linear {{regression}} models are often useful tools {{for exploring the}} relationship between a response and a set of explanatory (predictor) variables. When both the observed response and the predictor variables are contaminated/distorted by unknown functions of an observable confounder, inferring the underlying relationship between the latent (unobserved) variables is more challenging. Recently, S¸entürk and Müller (2005) proposed the method of covariate-adjusted regression (CAR) analysis for this distorted data setting. In this paper, we describe graphical techniques for assessing departures from or violations of specific assumptions regarding the type and form of the data distortion. The type of data <b>distortion</b> consists of <b>multiplicative,</b> additive or no-distortion. The form of the distortion encompasses a class of general smooth distorting functions. However, common confounding adjustment methods in regression analysis implicitly make distortion assumptions, such as assuming additive or <b>multiplicative</b> linear <b>distortions.</b> We illustrate graphical detection of departures from such assumptions on the distortion. The graphical diagnostic techniques are illustrated with numerical and real data examples. The proposed graphical assessment of distortion assumptions is feasible due to the CAR estimation method, which utilizes a local regression technique to estimate a set of transformed distorting functions (S¸entürk and Nguyen, 2006).

We show that the released statistics are analytically valid along several critical dimensions [...] measures are unbiased and time series properties are preserved. We provide an analysis {{of the degree to which}} con dentiality is protected. Furthermore, we show how the judicious use of synthetic data, injected into the tabulation process, can completely eliminate suppressions, maintain analytical validity, and increase the protection of the underlying con dential data...|$|R

Such large antenna arrays offer huge spatial degrees-of-freedom for transmission optimization; in partic-ular, great signal gains, resilience to imperfect channel knowledge, and small inter-user interference are all achievable without exten-sive inter-cell coordination.
