40|$|Increasing fuel prices, stricter {{government}} policies, {{and technological}} developments {{made it possible}} to seek for renewable alternatives, called biofuels, to petroleum fuel. Biodiesel, a biofuel that is produced from chemically <b>mixing</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat,</b> vegetable oils, or recycled restaurant grease with alcohol and catalyst, is gaining popularity in recent years as a substitute for petroleum diesel. Ninety percent (90 %) of U. S. biodiesel industry makes use of soybean oil as its feedstock. However, soybean oil alone cannot meet such a huge demand on biofuel production. Hence, it is important to identify and get more information about other feedstocks, specifically on its effects on the performance and exhaust emissions of diesel engines. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the performance and emissions of two diesel engines operating on different biodiesel fuels (i. e. canola oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, and chicken fat) and compare them to the performance and emissions when the engine is operated on soybean oil-based biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel. Results indicated that an engine operating on biodiesel generates a little less power and torque at any given speed than one running on diesel. Such power and torque loss were attributed to the biodiesel's lower energy content. The lower heating value (energy content) of biodiesel can be reflected in the specific fuel consumption, i. e., to generate the same power, more biodiesel is needed. The reduction in torque and power of less than 10 % indicates that in some cases biodiesel has better combustion than diesel. Unfortunately, the high efficiency of combustion may give rise to increased combustion temperature which may lead to higher exhaust emissions. The gradual decrease in the total hydrocarbon and CO 2 emissions, as blends were increased from B 20 to B 100, was also found to be an indication of better combustion using biodiesel fuels than petroleum diesel. However, NOx emissions were higher, predominantly at low speeds for most biodiesel and blends and therefore may require some additives or engine modifications/or adjustments to equalize the NOx emissions of diesel. Other emissions particularly SO 2 were lower than standards require...|$|R
5000|$|Thechikkottukavu Ramachandran An {{elephant}} named Nayarambalam Balakrishnan, one of {{the elephants}} in the first batch of tuskers brought from Bihar in the 1970s, died in that decade, after it was attacked. Although the autopsy showed that the elephant had been wounded before its death, no one was arrested. In another incident in 1977, another jumbo named Kattakkada Vishnu, owned by Rahul Timbers, died succumbed from unusual wounds. According to Thrissur-based NGO Heritage Animal Task Force (HATF) which works {{for the welfare of}} elephants, these two deaths were not the only cases, and that elephants have become victims to petty rivalries. “Take Ramachandran's case. There is so much inside politics involved in this, mainly ego clashes between the temple committee members, elephant owners and many other committees related to temple festivals and elephants,” says VK Venkitachalam, HATF Secretary. He cautions that if at least one person is not caught, such attacks will continue, and most would occur without people even realising it. “In the name of fan associations many people visit this elephant regularly and the temple committee promotes it, but this should be avoided. An elephant is not an artifact on display,” he adds. HATF claims that the sexual drives of elephants in captivity in Kerala is controlled by adding additives in the rice feed and is called ‘Sukha Chikithsa’. “Elephants are basically wild animals, cooked rice is not their (natural) food, so that was the first fault. And I know that they used to <b>mix</b> <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> in the rice feed to suppress ‘musth’ (in males). All this is against nature’s laws,” he said. (Musth is an annual phenomenon, in which the male elephants experience heightened sexual instinct for a short period) HATF also said that temple committees replace mahouts from time to time, which creates friction between the mahouts, and could also cause a disgruntled person to inflict settle scores by infliciting harm on the animals. “An elephant is not something that humans should take care of. The forest is their habitat, and we shouldn’t be feeding them what we want them to eat. (With all this) they become a show piece for hundreds of people who visit the elephant, and may engage in cruelty to the animal,” he says. HATF is demanding that everyone connected with the temple including all the mahouts who looked after Ramachandran should be questioned, but the temple committee is dismissive. Vasudevan said that temple staff would “obviously not have a role in such a mean act as Ramachandran is the favourite”. But he also said that the temple committee would pursue the complaint until the culprit is caught.|$|R

After the construction of the fort, Jack and Frank began trading with the natives. They were able to trade all of their goods for valuable furs. The first year proved the profitability of the fort. Fort Reliance would become a major trading hub in the region until it was abandoned by the traders in 1877 due to the theft of their goods by some of the Han natives. Jack McQuesten returned to the fort in 1879 in order to avoid the competition with other trading post down river. He was discouraged from going back to Fort Reliance by a chief of a neighboring tribe because, after the fort had been abandoned, some of the native women were killed by rat poison <b>mixed</b> with <b>animal</b> <b>fat</b> that was left behind by the traders. The chief feared for Jack's safety if he were to return to the fort. Jack decided to continue on to Fort Reliance and found that he was actually welcomed by the Han natives upon his return.

The fort continued to be operated as a fur trading post, but eventually became a supply stop for gold prospectors on the Yukon. When gold was found on the Stewart River, a tributary of the Yukon river downstream from Fort Reliance, trade was diverted away from the fort and it was abandoned.|$|R

In experiment I, a digestibility assay was conducted using 32 crossbred piglets (19. 20 ± 1. 52 kg). The experimental unit consisted of one pig, {{with a total of}} four experimental units per diet. The glycerine levels used in the digestibility assay were 4, 8, and 12 % of the basal diet (corn + soybean based). The digestible (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) values of glycerine were estimated by regression of DE and ME intake (kcal/kg) vs. glycerine intake (kg). The values (as-fed basis) of DE and ME (kcal/kg) obtained were: CGS = 5, 070 and 4, 556; CGA = 5, 143 and 4, 488, respectively. The results indicate that these two types of glycerine are a highly-available energy source for the feeding of piglets (15 - 30 kg). In experiment II, 90 piglets (BW = 15. 18 ± 0. 67 to 30. 28 ± 1. 68 kg), were allotted in a completely randomized design in 2 × 4 factorial arrangement, with of two types of crude glycerine (CGS and CGA) and four inclusion levels (3, 6, 9, and 12 %). Five experimental units (pens with two pigs) were used for each level of crude glycerine, resulting in five replicates per treatment in the diet. Additionally, a control diet containing no glycerine (0 %) was formulated. There was no interaction between levels of CG and types of crude glycerine, and the regression analysis indicates no effects of crude glycerine inclusion on performance and plasma variables.
