50|$|Parking is {{available}} at the Government Center Garage at variable rates and there are several gravel and paved lots nearby that charge a flat rate between $5-$10. Parking {{is available}} on the street and payable through meters or the PayByPhone app. Be aware that Fort Lauderdale Parking Enforcement strictly enforces <b>metered</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} <b>spot</b> <b>{{metering}}</b> usage {{would be when}} photographing the moon. Due to the very dark nature of the scene, other metering methods tend to overexpose the moon. <b>Spot</b> <b>metering</b> will allow for more detail to be brought out in the moon while underexposing {{the rest of the}} scene. More commonly, <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> is used in theatre photography, where the brightly lit actors stand before a dark or even black curtain or scrim. <b>Spot</b> <b>metering</b> only considers the actors in this case, while ignoring the overall darkness of the scene.|$|R
50|$|Olympus 35SP is a 35 mm {{rangefinder}} camera made by Olympus in Japan. It is {{the only}} 35mm rangefinder with a dual center-weighted average <b>metering</b> and <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> system. Metering is also available in manual mode, which is quite unusual amongst Japanese rangefinder cameras of this era.|$|R
50|$|This mode meters {{a larger}} area than <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> (around 10-15% {{of the entire}} frame), and is {{generally}} used when very bright or very dark areas {{on the edges of}} the frame would otherwise influence the <b>metering</b> unduly. Like <b>spot</b> <b>metering,</b> some cameras can use variable points to take readings from, (in general autofocus points), or have a fixed point in the centre of the viewfinder. Partial metering is found mostly on Canon cameras.|$|R
50|$|With <b>spot</b> <b>metering,</b> {{the camera}} will only measure {{a very small}} area of the scene (between 1-5% of the {{viewfinder}} area). This will by default be the very centre of the scene. The user can select a different off-centre spot, or to recompose by moving the camera after <b>metering.</b> The first <b>spot</b> <b>meter</b> was built by Arthur James Dalladay, editor of The British Journal of Photography in about 1935 and described it in the BJP Almanac of 1937 on pages 127 to 138.|$|R

50|$|Since 1986 the SPOT {{family of}} {{satellites}} has been orbiting the Earth {{and has already}} taken more than 10 million high quality images. SPOT 1 was launched with the last Ariane 1 rocket on February 22, 1986. Two days later, the 1800 kg SPOT 1 transmitted its first image with a spatial resolution of 10 or 20 <b>meters.</b> <b>SPOT</b> 2 joined SPOT 1 in orbit on January 22, 1990, on the Ariane 4 maiden flight, and SPOT 3 followed on September 26, 1993, also on an Ariane 4.|$|R

50|$|Some light <b>meters</b> (e.g., Pentax <b>spot</b> <b>meters)</b> {{indicate}} {{directly in}} EV at ISO 100. Some other meters, especially digital models, can indicate EV for the selected ISO speed. In most cases, {{this difference is}} irrelevant; with the Pentax meters, camera settings usually are determined using the exposure calculator, and most digital meters directly display shutter speeds and -numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Manual" [...] mode metered in {{the central}} microprism collar area only (roughly 2% of the field) - giving the <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> in the camera's model name. Information on the <b>spot</b> <b>metered</b> value was {{provided}} on an LCD bar-graph version of the older match-needle system used on the OM2n MD. Both shutter speed and aperture were under the photographer's control.|$|R

50|$|For the T90, Canon {{developed}} their most sophisticated light-metering system yet. Although it introduced no novel metering techniques, it assembled {{the majority of}} the metering techniques then developed into one easy-to-use system. First, it took the metering options from the New F-1—center-weighted average metering, partial area <b>metering,</b> and <b>spot</b> metering—and makes them available with a press of a button and a turn of the command dial. The New F-1 requires a focusing screen change to switch metering patterns. On the T90, partial area metering uses the center 13% of the picture area, while <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> uses the center 2.7%.|$|R
5000|$|Exposure information: Shutter speed, {{aperture}} value, ISO speed (always displayed), AE lock, exposure level/compensation, <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> circle, exposure warning, AEB.|$|R
25|$|Parking Days {{started in}} 2005 when REBAR, a {{collaborative}} group of creators, designers and activists based in San Francisco, transformed a <b>metered</b> parking <b>spot</b> {{into a small}} park complete with turf, seating, and shade and by 2007 there were 180 parks in 27 cities around the world.|$|R
50|$|The New F-1 {{system also}} has 13 {{different}} focusing screens, {{in a variety}} of metering modes (center-weighted averaging, selective-area, and spot, though not all are available with <b>spot</b> <b>metering),</b> for a total of 32 different screens. The screens are named with a two-letter designation, the first indicating the metering type (A for averaging, P for area metering, and S for <b>spot</b> <b>metering),</b> and the second indicating the style of screen, as listed below.|$|R

50|$|He {{played for}} the German club SG Flensburg-Handewitt, and {{was part of the}} team when the club won the German {{championship}} in 2004, and won the EHF Cup in 1997. In his 14 years with SG Flensburg-Handewitt he scored 3996 times, 1623 of these was scored from the 7 <b>meter</b> penalty <b>spot.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 3D Color Matrix Metering II, using a 1005-pixel RGB sensor. Including matrix, center-weight, and <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> with AI and AIS manual focus lenses {{produced}} since 1977 ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{built-in}} sensors {{are used}} to implement all these metering options. Center-weighted and partial area metering are performed by a double-area silicon photocell (SPC) in Canon's standard location above the eyepiece, while <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> is performed by another SPC located {{at the bottom of}} the mirror box. Light reaches that sensor via a half-silvered area of the main mirror and a secondary mirror located beneath it. The <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> cell also allows for automatic TTL [...] "off-the-film" [...] flash metering, again borrowed from Olympus.|$|R
50|$|In many {{advanced}} modern cameras multiple 'segments' {{are used}} to acquire the amount of light in different places of the picture. Depending on the mode the photographer has selected, this information is then used to correctly set the exposure. With a simple <b>spot</b> <b>meter,</b> a single <b>spot</b> on the picture is selected. The camera sets the exposure {{in order to get}} that particular spot properly exposed. On some modern SLR systems the <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> area or zone can be coupled to the actual focusing area selected offering more flexibility and less need to use exposure lock systems. With multiple segment metering (also known as matrix or honeycomb metering), the values of the different segments are combined and weighted to set the correct exposure. Implementations of these metering modes vary between cameras and manufacturers, making it difficult to predict how a scene will be exposed when switching cameras.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{advances}} with {{parking meters}} include vehicle detection technology, {{which allows the}} pay by space meters to know {{when there is a}} car parked in a space. This opens the door for benefits for parking managers, including providing way-finding (directing drivers to unoccupied spaces via the web or via street signs), enabling remote violation detection, and gathering vital statistics about parking supply and demand. Some meters allow payment for additional time by phone, and notify drivers when they are about to expire. Parking meters in Santa Monica use vehicle detectors to prevent drivers from [...] "feeding the meter" [...] indefinitely, and to delete remaining time when a car departs so the next car cannot take any time without paying. Meters in Madrid give discounted and free parking to drivers of hybrid and electric vehicles, respectively. Drivers can reserve <b>meters</b> <b>spots</b> in Los Angeles by cellphone.|$|R
50|$|The D2Hs, {{like the}} D2X, offers {{compatibility}} with Non-CPU AI Nikkor lenses, which are usable in aperture-priority or manual exposure mode with Matrix-Metering, Center-Weighted and <b>Spot</b> <b>metering</b> available.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Spot</b> <b>metering</b> is very {{accurate}} {{and is not}} influenced by other areas in the frame. It is commonly used to shoot very high contrast scenes. For example, if the subject's back is being hit by the rising sun and the face is a lot darker than the bright halo around the subject's back and hairline (the subject is [...] "backlit"), <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> allows the photographer to measure the light bouncing off the subject's face and expose properly for that, instead of the much brighter light around the hairline. The area around the back and hairline will then become over-exposed. <b>Spot</b> <b>metering</b> is a method upon which the Zone System depends. In many cases the camera will over or underexpose, when using the spot mode. Modern cameras tend to find the correct exposure precisely. In complex light situations though, professional photographers tend to switch to manual mode, {{in order to ensure}} the same exposure in every photograph.|$|R
25|$|China's second lunar probe, Chang'e 2, {{which was}} {{launched}} in 2010, can photograph the lunar surface with a resolution of up to 1.3 <b>meters</b> (4.3ft). It <b>spotted</b> traces of the Apollo landings.|$|R
50|$|Metering modes {{include a}} 16-zone evaluative, center-weighted average, partial, {{selectable}} spot, and fine central <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> mode. Film speeds {{can be set}} from ISO 6-6400 either manually or automatically by DX codes on the film canisters.|$|R
50|$|It is autofocusing {{and has an}} {{electronically}} controlled {{focal plane}} shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec. with x-flash synchronization at shutter speeds up to 1/180 sec. It has built-in exposure <b>metering</b> with <b>spot,</b> center weighted and evaluative modes and also features a pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 through 125, 160, 200, 400, 800 and 1600. The camera is discontinued and no longer in production.|$|R
50|$|Many small- and medium-format cameras include {{provision}} for exposure compensation; this feature {{works well with}} the Zone System, especially if the camera includes <b>spot</b> <b>metering,</b> but obtaining proper results requires careful metering of individual scene elements and making appropriate adjustments.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{calibration standards}} were developed for use withwide-angle averaging reflected-light meters(Jones and Condit 1941). Although wide-angle averagemetering has largely {{given way to}} other <b>metering</b> sensitivity patterns(e.g., <b>spot,</b> center-weighted, and multi-segment), the values for determined for wide-angle averaging meters have remained.|$|R
50|$|Pentax was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} to show a prototype camera with a behind-the-lens <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> CdS meter system in 1961, the Pentax Spotmatic. Production Spotmatics, however, didn't appear until mid-to late 1964, and these models were featured with an averaging meter system.|$|R
5000|$|The S2 and S2b were {{deliberately}} designed without exposure automation, {{and only}} required a battery {{for the light}} metering system. The S2 had a <b>spot</b> <b>meter,</b> and was popular with some Zone System photographers, while the S2b had a centerweighted meter favored by some photojournalists.|$|R
50|$|A {{pre-flash}} is {{also used}} in FE Lock mode (flash exposure lock). In this mode, the pre-flash is {{used in conjunction with}} <b>spot</b> <b>metering</b> to determine the correct exposure in advance of taking the picture. Thus, the camera can be moved to reframe the main subject off-center and still expose correctly.|$|R
