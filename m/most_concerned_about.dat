A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were <b>most</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has.

It is for this reason in 2001 that for {{one of the}} first times ever the public demonstrated an approval of government intervention in their private lives.|$|E

They will all be housed in a special sector of the stadium, segregated from the Milan fans. What we're <b>most</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> is how our fans behave." [...] 15,800 tickets were sold the night before the match, 13,600 of which were purchased by Milan supporters.

30|$|Although {{there is}} a {{consensus}} in all three countries of policy support for renewable energy as a viable CC mitigation mechanism, country differences remain. The Mexican survey sample shows (1) the most support in terms of increasing the share of renewable energy; (2) the <b>most</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> CC; and (3) that {{two out of three}} respondents feel informed or very informed about the ways to reduce CC. Respondents from Canada and the United States feel informed at about the same level, but less so than their Mexican counterparts. Canada is both more supportive of renewable energy policies and demonstrates a greater <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> CC than the United States. Generally, the U.S. public is most skeptical toward new renewable energy policies as well as government involvement and is the least <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> CC, relative to the other two countries, but {{there is a}}mple support for renewable energy sources to at least discuss a North American strategy.|$|R

Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was <b>most</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nuclear power}} debate is a long-running {{controversy}} {{about the risks}} and benefits of using nuclear reactors to generate electricity for civilian purposes. [...] The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, as more and more reactors were built and came online, and [...] "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies" [...] in some countries. [...] Thereafter, the nuclear industry created jobs, focused on safety and public concerns [...] mostly waned. In the last decade, however, with growing public awareness about climate change and the critical role that carbon dioxide and methane emissions plays in causing the heating of the earth's atmosphere, there's been a resurgence in the intensity nuclear power debate once again. [...] Nuclear power advocates and those who are <b>most</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> climate change point to nuclear power's reliable, emission-free, high-density energy and a generation of young physicists and engineers working to bring a new generation of nuclear technology into existence to replace fossil fuels. On the other hand, skeptics can point to two frightening nuclear accidents, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and subsequently the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, combined with escalating acts of global terrorism, to argue against continuing use of the technology. The debate continues today between those who fear the power of nuclear and those who fear {{what will happen to the}} earth if we don't use nuclear power. At the 1963 ground-breaking for what would become the world's largest nuclear power plant, President John F. Kennedy declared that nuclear power was a [...] "step on the long road to peace," [...] and that by using [...] "science and technology to achieve significant breakthroughs" [...] that we could [...] "conserve the resources" [...] to leave the world in better shape.

This study finds that several commonly held perceptions regarding integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies are not valid. Among fmdings of the study are the following: (1) hardware and system design advances have eliminated <b>most</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> interface, (2) cost penalties have not occurred at low to moderate penetration levels (and high levels am feasible); and (3) intermittent renewable energy technologies can have capacity values.
