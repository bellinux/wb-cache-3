5|$|Despite the ceasefire {{agreement}} {{signed on}} 22 September between the JNA and Croatia, which {{provided for the}} resumption of supplies to the JNA barracks, the authorities in Bjelovar refused to restore utilities, claiming that the agreement allowed for the supply of JNA officers and soldiers only, {{but there were also}} civilians sheltering in the barracks. On 27 September, the Croatian General Staff directed that the garrison be captured on 28–30 September. Tus, acting as the Chief of the General Staff, ordered the clandestine killing of extremists before they caused mass killing of civilians or great <b>material</b> <b>damage.</b> According to Tus, this order was based on an assessment that there were extremist JNA officers present in Bjelovar, intent on carrying out such acts.|$|E
5|$|Official {{figures on}} wartime damage {{published}} in Croatia in 1996 specify 180,000 destroyed housing units, 25% of the Croatian economy destroyed, and US$27billion of <b>material</b> <b>damage.</b> Europe Review 2003/04 estimated the war damage at US$37billion in damaged infrastructure, lost economic output, and refugee-related costs, while GDP dropped 21% in the period. 15 percent of housing units and 2,423 cultural heritage structures, including 495 sacral structures, were destroyed or damaged. The war imposed an additional economic burden {{of very high}} military expenditures. By 1994, as Croatia rapidly developed into a de facto war economy, the military consumed as much as 60 percent of total government spending.|$|E

The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten {{by a small}} garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little <b>material</b> <b>damage,</b> but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was.|$|E
40|$|<b>Damage</b> to <b>materials</b> {{from air}} {{pollution}} {{is considered to}} be an important economic factor in society. For this reason, it was decided as part of the 1988 Young Scientists Summer Program at IIASA to explore the possibility of including a submodel for <b>materials</b> <b>damage</b> in IIASA's Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation (RAINS) model. This Working Paper is the result of this investigation. Although the conclusion of the author is that it is at the present time premature to include <b>materials</b> <b>damage</b> in RAINS, {{due to a lack of}} input data, this report contains a wealth of information on existing background data (such as damage functions) and possible analytic approaches once the input data are available. As such, therefore, this paper represents a very important first step in a possible future inclusion of <b>materials</b> <b>damage</b> in a model of transboundary air pollution...|$|R

5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little <b>material</b> <b>damage</b> resulted, three men were injured. Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.|$|E
5|$|Under {{threat from}} the {{hurricane}}, all of Cape Verde was placed under a hurricane warning {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August31, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70percent of the houses in Povoação Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; São Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. <b>Material</b> <b>damage</b> across Cape Verde totaled US$2.5million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and Cape Verde, maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths.|$|E

The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or Molotov cocktails for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.|$|E

5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little <b>material</b> <b>damage,</b> except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a scientific {{basis for the}} description of the causes of damage within an irreversible thermodynamic framework and the effects of damage as observable variables that signify degradation of structural integrity. The approach relies on the fundamentals of irreversible thermodynamics and specifically the notion of entropy generation as a measure of degradation and damage. We first review the state-of-the-art advances in entropic treatment of damage followed by a discussion on generalization of the entropic concept to damage characterization that may offers a better definition of damage metric commonly used for structural integrity assessment. In general, this approach provides the opportunity to described reliability and risk of structures in terms of fundamental science concepts. Over the years, many studies have focused on <b>materials</b> <b>damage</b> assessment by determining physics-based cause and affect relationships, the goal {{of this paper is to}} put this work in perspective and encourage future work of <b>materials</b> <b>damage</b> based on the entropy concept...|$|R
