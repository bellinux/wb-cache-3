Understanding processes driving bacterial diversity, colonization and dispersal is of prime importance for deep-sea microbial ecology. This study provides a detailed characterization of bacterial assemblages colonizing plant-derived substrates using a standardized approach over a geographic area spanning the NorthEast Atlantic and <b>Mediterranean.</b> <b>Wood</b> and alfalfa substrates in colonization devices were deployed for different periods at 8 deep-sea chemosynthesis-based sites in four distinct geographic areas. Pyrosequencing of a fragment of the 16 S rRNA-encoding gene was used to describe bacterial communities. Colonization occurred within the first 14 days. The diversity was higher in samples deployed for more than 289 days. After 289 days, no relation was observed between community richness and deployment duration, suggesting that diversity may have reached saturation sometime in between. Communities in long-term deployments were different, and their composition was mainly influenced by the geographical location where devices were deployed. Numerous sequences related to horizontally-transmitted chemosynthetic symbionts of metazoans were identified. Their potential status as free-living forms of these symbionts was evaluated based on sequence similarity with demonstrated symbionts. Results suggest that some free-living forms of metazoan symbionts or their close relatives, such as Epsilonproteobacteria associated with the shrimp Rimicaris exoculata, are efficient colonizers of plant substrates at vents and seeps...|$|E

All {{of these processes}} can modify the property and performance of wood products influencing, as in case of thermo-treatment, some structural compounds and also the secondary metabolites, such as extractives. Extractives are the predominant contributors to color, fragrance, durability, pulping, drying, adhesion, hydrophobicity, and acoustic properties of wood. Many extractives have specific biological activities, and various woods {{have been used as}} source of crude drugs and medicines for centuries. Extractives ofen are extracted with chemical solvents, however the need of the green extraction techniques is growing up. In addition the researcher’s interest versus the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>wood</b> species is rising respect to chemotaxonomy of woody plants respect to tropical woods. However, incomplete information on the green extraction techniques and on the potential use of extractives as value-added chemical products are up to now available to native wood species. The main goals of this research was: (i) to use water as solvents to extract secondary metabolites from some wood species (Cedrus deodara Roxb., Alnus cordata Desf., Qercus cerris L., Fagus sylvatica L., Castanea sativa Mill.); (ii) to analyze the extractives content and composition; (iii) to explore the efect of thermo vacuum process on the extractives content and composition. The composition of extractives was determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatographic in combination with mass spectrometry technique (GC-MS). Interestingly, our results revealed a specie-specific efect in the quali-quantitative extractive composition and how the thermo vacuum pro - cess conditioned the chemical composition of extractive of wood species. Further inspection highlighted that the most representative extractive compounds belong to diferent class of chemical compounds and they can be used commonly employed in the biology and biotechnology industries, such as a flavoring agent in foods, pharmaceuticals products or in the perfume essences...|$|E

40|$|The {{recent decades}} have seen large {{increases}} in the extent of urban and built-up land use. It is predicted that 60 %- 90 % of the world population will live in cities in 2030. The loss of green areas (urban parks, avenue tree-lines, woods, hedges, private gardens and public green spaces) {{as a result of}} the increasing urbanization is a serious threat to the overall biodiversity and calls for considerations of their role, provision and management. Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services, such as offsetting carbon emission, removing air pollution and reducing noise. In particular, green areas act as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) via photosynthesis and storing excess carbon as biomass. Moreover, they are places for physical recreation which have positive effects on human health. When exposed to green areas people show a greater well-being and physical and psychological benefits. Among the urban green areas, the Botanical Gardens have a key role in biodiversity conservation. Nevertheless, they provide environmental benefits contributing to air amelioration quality. In this context, we analyzed the CO 2 sequestration capability of plant collections growing in the Botanical Garden of Rome and their influence on microclimate. The Botanical Garden covers an area of 12 ha in the city centre, between Lungara Street and the Gianicolo hill. The lower area is enriched with tree species, including many palms, while the hill is occupied by the ferns collection, Bamboos, Rose garden, Australian species, Japanese garden, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>woods</b> and Conifers collection.

Very little is known of the spatial and temporal activity of this animal in the Iberian peninsula. The area studied is situated in the NE of the Iberian peninsula (41 ° 47 'N, 233 'E). The altitude is between 160 m and 610 m. The bottom of the valley is cut by the river Arbúcies, which has an average width of 10 m. A local road runs close {{to the river and}} crosses it at some points. The habitat is composed largely of <b>mediterranean</b> <b>woods</b> of Quercus suber (Quercetum ilicis galloprovinciale suberatum) with some patches of Pinus halepensis.

40|$|Mediterranean tree {{rings are}} {{characterized}} by intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) due to partly climate-driven cambial activity. IADFs are used as structural signals to gain information on relations between environmental conditions and eco-physiological processes during xylogenesis, with intra-annual resolution. To reach an unbiased synchronization of the IADF position within tree rings and seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions, {{it is necessary to}} know the timing of cambial activity and wood formation, which are species- and site-specific processes. We applied the microcoring technique to analyze xylogenesis in Pinus halepensis and Arbutus unedo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study xylogenesis in a hardwood species forming frequent IADFs. Both species co-occur at a site in southern Italy characterized by a Mediterranean climate. To facilitate tree-ring dating and identification of IADFs, we performed traditional dendroecological analysis. We analyzed xylogenesis during summer, which is considered a constraint for xylogenesis and a trigger for IADF formation. We followed the different phases of cell development in the current wood increment with the aim of evaluating whether and which type of IADFs were formed. We additionally analyzed the same phases again in September and in winter to verify the possible formation of IADFs in fall and whether cell production and differentiation was completed {{by the end of the}} calendar year. Both species formed the same type of IADFs (earlywood-like cells within latewood), due to temporary growth restoration triggered by rain events during the period of summer drought. At the end of the calendar year, no cells in the phases of enlargement and secondary cell wall deposition occurred. A. unedo was more sensitive than P. halepensis because IADFs were formed earlier in the season and were more frequent in the tree-ring series. The dendro-anatomical approach, combining analysis of tree-ring series and of xylogenesis, helped to detect the period of IADF formation in the two species. Results are discussed in functional terms, highlighting the environmental conditions triggering IADFs, and also in methodological terms, evaluating the applicability of xylogenesis analysis in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>woods,</b> especially when the formation of IADFs is not uniform around the stem...|$|R

Detailed observations on stained roots and on fresh root sections showed that, after forming the appressorium, the fungus colonized the root by penetrating individual cells, growing intracellularly from cell to cell, and producing many coils and terminal arbuscules. S. aspera seedlings inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae and G. viscosum, which are known to form Arum-type mycorrhizas in many plant species, produced the same Paris-type-like mycorrhizas found in nature. This confirms {{that the type of}} arbuscular mycorrhizal infection is largely governed by the plant host genotype.

The species, that occupies {{a wide range of}} altitudes from 50 to 1, 550 m a. s. l., but prefers to live from 800 to 1200 m a. s. l., was found to be the dominating tree in mesophylous forests, here described as new associations: 1) Cyclamino repandi-Taxetum baccatae ass. nova, at the top of Sardinian mountains, with 4 subassociations corresponding to local variation of geological substratum; 2) Polysticho setiferi-Taxetum baccatae ass. nova, at intermediate altitudes, near streams, in northern slopes of central Sardinian mountains. Moreover, in contact with mountain oak forests, the new sub-associations Saniculo europaeae-Quercetum ilicis taxetosum baccatae subass. nova and Glechomo sardoae-Quercetum congestae taxetosum baccatae subass. nova have been described. The multivariate analysis of plant assemblages showed a significant separation among the four different communities. Contrary to previous studies, our findings support the evidence for the presence of pure or yew-dominated woods in Sardinia. In particular, the Cyclamino repandi-Taxetum baccatae, has a relic character and a great biogeographic importance. The scattered distribution of the two habitats suitable for the yew in Sardinia can be considered the main current ecological trait that plays a fundamental role in the process of population isolation.

40|$|Microbes are {{considered}} to have a global distribution due to their high dispersal capabilities. However, {{our knowledge of the}} way geographically distant microbial communities assemble after dispersal in a new environment is limited. In this study, we examined whether communities would converge because similar taxa would be selected under the same environmental conditions, or would diverge because of initial community composition, after artificial dispersal. To this aim, a microcosm experiment was performed, in which the temporal changes in the composition and diversity of different prokaryoplankton assemblages from three distant geographic coastal areas (Banyuls-sur-Mer in northwest Mediterranean Sea, Pagasitikos Gulf in northeast <b>Mediterranean</b> and <b>Woods</b> Hole, MA, USA in the northwest Atlantic), were studied. Diversity was investigated using amplicon pyrosequencing of the V 1 -V 3 hypervariable regions of the 16 S rRNA. The three assemblages were grown separately in particle free and autoclaved Banyuls-sur-mer seawater at 18 °C in the dark. We found that the variability of prokaryoplankton community diversity (expressed as richness, evenness and dominance) as well as the composition were driven by patterns observed in Bacteria. Regarding community composition, similarities were found between treatments at family level. However, at the OTU level microbial communities from the three different original locations diverge rather than converge during incubation. It is suggested that slight differences in the composition of the initial prokaryoplankton communities, resulted in separate clusters the following days even when growth took place under identical abiotic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Diversity may be {{evaluated}} by adopting different hierarchical approaches. In this study, we analyzed the breeding bird communities of five habitats spatially distributed along a gradient of landscape vegetation in central Italy. We highlighted their structural differences at three hierarchical diversity metrics (α-, β- and γ-diversity). The beech forest showed the highest averaged values {{in terms of}} both abundance and species richness (α–diversity), as well as in terms of Shannon index, while chestnut and oak woods showed the lowest values. Along the vegetation gradient we observed an inverse pattern of spatial diversity from the <b>Mediterranean</b> sclerophilic <b>wood</b> to the temperate and mesophilic beech forest. The beech forest was very rich at the point count scale (higher α-diversity) but had the lower value both in β- and γ-diversity; in contrast, the sclerophilic wood had a low α-diversity (point-scale) and the higher β- and γ-diversity values. The beech forest showed a low β-diversity (low habitat heterogeneity at the vegetation patch level), but due to the higher tree diameter and the related niche availability, it showed a high α-diversity (at point-scale). The sclerophilic wood, which was more simply structured, had a low α-diversity at point-scale, but a high β-diversity at the vegetation patch level, due to a high heterogeneity. This study demonstrates that patterns of diversity may be complex at different hierarchic levels. If conservation and landscape planning strategies are promoted at landscape scale, objectives should be carefully specified in terms of component of species diversity (α-, β-, γ-level).

Aims To explore relationships between habitat characteristics at the breeding territory level and reproductive timing and success of Blue Tits Parus caeruleus in Pyrenean Oak Quercus pyrenaica woods in central Spain. Methods Habitat structure of the breeding territories was measured in a sampling plot centred on a nestbox, with a radius of 25 m. A principal component analysis was performed to obtain a factor of ‘territory vegetation maturity’ summarizing {{the characteristics of the}} territory. Reproductive parameters were obtained by frequent visits to the nests during the breeding season. Adults were captured at the nest to obtain morphological measurements, and nestling tarsus length and body mass were measured on day 15 after hatching. Results Habitat effects on reproductive performance seem to operate at the beginning of reproduction in these montane oak woods and through female body condition during the first stages of breeding. Female Blue Tits in breeding territories with immature and degraded vegetation started reproduction later and had lower hatching and breeding success. Laying date was strongly related to female body condition. Total reproductive failure occurred mainly during the incubation period and was associated with immature breeding territories. However, nestlings raised in mature forest territories did not differ in size and mass from those in degraded, immature territories.

To verify in the field the PSII re-activation promptness induced by water availability, chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured on the epiphytic lichen Flavoparmelia soredians after two months without rainfall events in a <b>Mediterranean</b> cork oak <b>wood</b> (Bosco Santo Pietro, Sicily, Italy). Measurements were carried out at dawn and sunset on north- and south-exposed populations under different regimes of hydration and dark-adaptation.

40|$|Geology, {{geomorphology}} and wines in the Cinque TerreNational Park (Liguria, Italy) - The {{study area}} occupies {{a good deal}} of the National Park (Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre) in eastern Liguria and is covered almost completely by vineyards of the famous denomination DOC Cinque Terre (150 ha). The name «Cinque Terre» is from the five villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, Monterosso al Mare, in the La Spezia province. The landscape is characterized by a narrow strip of coastline that continues for about 15 km, bounded to the Northeast by the drainage divide which, running parallel to the coast and reaching altitudes of 600 to 800 m, separates the park from the Vara Valley (Val di Vara). Seventy percent of the area faces between west and southeast, with strong preference to the southwest. Five tectonic units are present in the area, the most represented being the sandstones of the Macigno. This youngest Tuscan Unit, represented to the southeast by a stratigraphic succession of Oligocene age, crops out along the promontory between La Spezia and Portovenere as part of an overturned limb of a large SW-verging anticline. Three geologic sections (see the geologic map in fig. 1) illustrate the bedding attitudes of the sandstones between Scoglio Ferale to the south-east and Vernazza to the north-west. The Macigno turbiditic sandstones, nearly vertical from Capo Persico to Manarola, are overthrusted by the Canetolo Unit between Manarola and Corniglia, which is mostly made up of claystone intercalated with carbonates, with ages ranging from Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Near Monterosso, the Monte Veri, Bracco, and Monte Gottero Units overlie the Macigno Unit. Extensive blankets of debris are found across the entire area considered, mostly organized as terraces constructed by man over the centuries and are now partly abandoned and demolished by natural agents or overgrown by shrubby vegetation, pines and other <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>woods.</b> Since about 1100 A. D., cultivation of grapes and also olives was developed upon these man-made terraces; narrow terraces were sustained by drystone walls that run for a total linear distance of nearly 6000 km calculated on an area of ca. 2000 ha. The vineyards are only found on the terraces built on the Macigno, Canetolo, and Monte Veri Units, but are absent on the serpentines and gabbros of the Bracco Unit. However, they are found on the associated Argille a palombini. Furthermore, vineyards are also found on the Scisti Zonati but not on the overlying Monte Gottero sandstones. The total natural nitrogen resulted sufficient in the whole area; the natural phosphorous is well represented in the area of Corniglia, and insufficient in the areas of Vernazza, Manarola, Riomaggiore and Campiglia; it is scarce at Monterosso; the potassium oxide resulted barely sufficient in the area of Corniglia and Manarola, while magnesium oxide is uniform across the entire district. All these informations are of great importance for the sake of vineyard planting, but still they give us very general indications on the correlation between terroir and wine; in fact, the tastings performed on the wines currently available on the market, although highlight some vague indications on the connection between soil type and wine flavours, cannot be considered as an ultimate answer to this problem. Thus, a proposal for an experiment is outlined here. The aim is to understand the correlation between type of soil and wine taste in the area of Cinque Terre. We point out the input and output variables to be considered and analyzed. We suggest the method to be used to design the experiments and to analyze the data, and we outline the steps to be accomplished for the definition of the project...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean {{catchments}} and {{in particular}} terraced landscapes are sensitive to temperature oscillations, rainfall intensity and human activities; {{all of these factors}} imply significant environmental problems in terms of soil erosion and control of the meteoric waters. The aim of this research is to assess the hydro-geomorphological effects of different land cover scenarios in Vernazza catchment (Cinque Terre National Park, Italy). It shows typical characteristics present in most of the Ligurian coastal terraced catchments: small catchment area, very steep slopes and particular land-use pattern. The slopes have been almost completely terraced for vineyards during the past millennium. Due to socio-economic changes, the traditional cultivations have been progressively abandoned over the last decades. Subsequently, Mediterranean scrub and pine vegetation succession replaced the former cultivated areas. The climate is Mediterranean, with hot and dry summers and mild winters. In particular, on October, 25 th 2011 a heavy rainfall affected the area, with a cumulative daily rainfall of 539 mm recorded. This event triggered several slope movements and floods, causing 13 death casualties, as well as severe structural and economic damages. To evaluate the hydrological and geomorphological consequences of different land cover, we applied a simple Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method (SCS, 1956) which was implemented in a GIS. To assess the SCS-CN model scenario, four different land use scenarios under the recent flood were simulated: 1) The landscape under present conditions; 2) The re-cultivation of all abandoned terraced vineyards; 3) The landscape covered by garrigue and pine (recent abandoned terraces); 4) The landscape completely covered with <b>Mediterranean</b> scrub and <b>woods</b> (long time abandoned terraces). From this preliminary study it seems that the recultivation of all abandoned terraces is not a good strategy to contrast runoff, while our model results enhance that forests with an excellent leaf cover reduce rainfall impact to soil and so runoff.

40|$|La biodiversitat que observem resulta d'una complexa història evolutiva d'interaccions entre els organismes. Les interaccions planta-animal en son un cas paradigmàtic, des de relacions antagòniques a mutualistes, però determinar-ne el resultat pot ser complicat, com en el cas de la dispersió de llavors per rosegadors. Moltes especies de rosegadors son àvids consumidors de llavors, però també actius dispersors, inclús emmagatzemant-ne per al {{posterior}} consum, potencialment afavorint la dispersió i regeneració de l’espècie amb la que interactuen. Per això molts estudis s'han centrat en aquesta interacció, tot i que poques vegades s'ha considerat la influència que pot tenir la gran variabilitat temporal i espacial del context on es dóna. 	L'objectiu principal d'aquesta tesi és estudiar com els patrons de dispersió/depredació d'aglans per rosegadors poden estar influïts per la variabilitat del context en el que té lloc i determinar com pot afectar el reclutament de les espècies sobre les que actuen. Amb aquest fi hem utilitzat un model d'estudi paradigmàtic dels ambients Mediterranis: el ratolí de bosc, Apodemus sylvaticus, com a dispersor i depredador d'aglans en un bosc mixte de roure (Quercus pubescens) i alzina (Quercus ilex) al Parc Natural de Collserola. Hem mostrejat intensivament la població de rosegadors a la zona d'estudi i altres variables ambientals (producció i abundància d'aglans, coberta de vegetació, furgades de senglar), així com el reclutament de plàntules de Quercus. També hem analitzat els patrons de dispersió/depredació d'aglans per rosegadors mitjançant l'enregistrament del seu comportament i el seguiment d'aglans marcats. 	Els nostres resultats indiquen que les dinàmiques demogràfiques d' A. sylvaticus estan condicionades per la disponibilitat d'aglans, amb importants davallades estivals en l'abundància degut a la sequera i l'escassetat d'aliment. A més, les diferències fenològiques en la producció d'aglans entre roure i alzina també afecten les decisions dels rosegadors, que canvien les seves preferències per l'espècie més abundant. Per altra banda, hem documentat l'efecte de nivells tròfics superiors (carnívors) en el destí de les llavors mitjançant canvis en el comportament dels rosegadors, així com efectes de competidors per aquest recurs (senglars i conspecifics) en els patrons de dispersió/depredació d'aglans. L'activitat dels rosegadors també juga un paper important en l'establiment de plàntules de Quercus, com a dispersors, movent principalment aglans de sota els arbusts cap a zones mes obertes en aquests boscos d’elevada densitat, però també com a "lladres" d'aglans, reduint les oportunitats de reclutament per a la planta. De fet, la distribució espacial de plàntules en la zona d'estudi està determinada principalment per la disponibilitat d'aglans, mentre que el possible efecte protector dels arbusts no té tanta importància com esperàvem prèviament, degut a les característiques del bosc (coberta arbòrea densa). 	Aquesta tesi documenta que la interacció entre planta i rosegadors pot ser molt variable depenent del context on es dóna, de manera que el paper dels rosegadors com a dispersors i depredadors d'aglans en boscos Mediterranis de Quercus pot diferir en funció de l'estructura del bosc (per exemple deveses vs. boscos tancats). Aquesta variabilitat temporal i espaial es deu principalment a la flexibilitat comportamental dels rosegadors, que adapten les seves decisions al context de cada lloc i moment. En canvi, hem documentat altres comportaments amb una tendència més fixa, com la preferència per llavors grans. En aquest sentit, aquests comportaments més fixes poden exercir pressions selectives importants sobre els trets vitals de la planta, mentre que comportaments més variables no tindran un efecte tant clar. Estudis futurs centrats en aquesta interacció entre planta i rosegadors haurien de tenir en compte aquesta variabilitat temporal i espacial, així com les interaccions assenyalades en el nostre estudi amb altres animals de la xarxa tròfica (carnívors i competidors). Earth's biodiversity {{results from}} a complex evolutionary history of interactions among organisms. Plant-animal interactions are a paradigmatic example of such ecological relationships, from antagonistic to mutualistic relationships, although determining its result might be difficult, like {{in the case of}} seed dispersal by rodents. Many rodent species are avid seed consumers, but also active dispersers, caching seeds in burrows for further consumption, potentially contributing to the dispersion and regeneration of the species with which they interact. Thus, many studies have focused on this interaction, although the influence of the great spatial and temporal variability of the context where it occurs has not been generally considered. 	The main objective of this thesis is to assess how the acorn predation/dispersal patterns by rodents may be influenced by the contextual variability, and to determine how this variability might affect the recruitment of the species with whom they interact. To that end we have used a well-known study model paradigmatic of <b>Mediterranean</b> environments: the <b>wood</b> mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, as seed predator and disperser of acorns in a mixed oak forest of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) and Downy oak (Quercus pubescens) in the Collserola Natural Park. We have intensively monitored the rodent population in the study area, some environmental factors (acorn production and abundance, vegetation cover, wild boar rooting), and oak’s seedling emergence. We have also analyzed the acorn predation/dispersal patterns of rodents by recording their foraging behaviour and monitoring tagged acorns. 	Our results show that the demographic dynamics of A. Sylvaticus are conditioned by the availability of acorns, with important population declines in the summers, due to the effects of drought and food scarcity. Moreover, the differences in seeding phenology between Q. ilex and Q. pubescens also affect rodent’s foraging decisions, as they change their seed preferences for the most abundant species. We have also documented an effect of upper trophic levels (carnivores) on seed’s fate by influencing rodent’s behaviour, as well as effects from competitors for that resource (wild boars and conspecifics) on the acorn predation/dispersal patterns. Rodent’s activity also {{plays an important role in}} oak’s seedling establishment, as seed dispersers, removing many acorns from under shrubs towards open sites in these close canopy forests, but also as seed pilferers, reducing the recruitment opportunities of oaks. In fact, the spatial distribution of oak seedlings in the study area is mainly determined by the availability of acorns, while the potential nursing effect of shrubs does not have such an important effect as we had previously anticipated, due to the forest characteristics (dense tree canopy). 	This thesis documents the great context dependent variability in the interaction among plants and rodents, so that rodent’s role as acorn predators and dispersers in Mediterranean oak forests may be very different according to the forest structure (e. g. savanah-like forests vs. close canopy forests). This spatial and temporal variability occurs mainly due to the behavioural plasticity of rodents, which adapt their foraging choices to the context of every place and moment. On the other hand, we have also documented other behaviours that show a rather fixed trend, such as the preference for bigger and sound acorns. In this sense, these more fixed behaviours might represent important selective pressures on the life history traits of the plants they interact with, while more variable behaviours will not have such clear effect. Further studies focussed on this interaction among plants and rodents should consider this great temporal and spatial variability, as well as the interactions with other animals of the trophic web shown in our study (carnivores and competitors) ...|$|R
