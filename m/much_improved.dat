5|$|In {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} France during the Napoleonic Wars, Lieutenant Colonel John Brown surveyed the castle in 1804 to examine whether the central keep could be turned into a Martello tower, a type of circular gun tower popular during this period.

Since its release, the game has appeared on several critics' top lists for its story and use of metaphors, psychological horror and taboo topics as well as its soundtrack/sound design. Because of the success of Silent Hill 2, a sequel titled Silent Hill 3 was released in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are <b>much</b> <b>improved</b> over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

Playing 49 games, Crozier had his first winning record with the Sabres and he posted a <b>much</b> <b>improved</b> 2.76 GAA. In the first round, the Sabres were matched up against the Canadiens. Crozier played four games and won two, but his team was ultimately dispatched in six games.|$|E
5|$|Vice-President Millard Fillmore {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now <b>much</b> <b>improved,</b> he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on {{the constitutionality of the}} fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in the Compromise of 1850. Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.|$|E
5|$|Some H-3 and H-4s were {{equipped}} with barrage balloon cable-cutting {{equipment in the}} shape of cutter installations forward of the engines and cockpit. They were designated H-8, but later named H8/R2. These aircraft were difficult to fly and production stopped. The H-6 initiated some overall improvements in design. The Jumo 211 F-1 engine of 1,007kW (1,350hp) increased its speed while the defensive armament was upgraded with one 20mm MG FF cannon in the nose position, one MG 15 in the ventral turret, and in each of the fuselage side windows (optional). Some H-6 variants carried tail-mounted MG 17 defensive armament. The performance of the H-6 was <b>much</b> <b>improved.</b> The climb rate was higher and the machine could reach a slightly higher ceiling of 8,500 m (27,200ft). When heavy bomb loads were added, this ceiling was reduced to 6,500 m (20,800ft). The weight of the H-6 increased to 14,000kg (30,600lb). Some H-6s received Jumo 211F-2s which improved a low-level speed of 226mph (365km/h). At an altitude of 6,000 m (19,200ft) the maximum speed was 270mph (435km/h). If heavy external loads were added, the speed was reduced by 21.75mph (35km/h).|$|E
