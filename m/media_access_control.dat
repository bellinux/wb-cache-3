25|$|The {{link layer}} {{is used to}} move packets between the Internet layer {{interfaces}} of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, {{as well as on}} firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as <b>Media</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly defined.|$|E

40|$|Clock {{synchronization}} in {{a wireless}} sensor network (WSN) is quite essential as it provides a consistent and a coherent time frame for all the nodes across the network. Typically, clock synchronization is achieved by message passing using a contention-based scheme for <b>media</b> <b>access,</b> like {{carrier sense multiple access}} (CSMA). The nodes try to synchronize with each other, by sending synchronization request messages. If many nodes try to send messages simultaneously, contention-based schemes cannot efficiently avoid collisions. In such a situation, there are chances of collisions, and hence, message losses, which, in turn, affects the convergence of the synchronization algorithms. However, the number of collisions can be reduced with a frame based approach like time division multiple access (TDMA) for message passing. In this paper, we propose a design to utilize TDMA-based <b>media</b> <b>access</b> and <b>control</b> (MAC) protocol for the performance improvement of clock synchronization protocols. The basic idea is to use TDMA-based transmissions when the degree of synchronization improves among the sensor nodes during the execution of the clock synchronization algorithm. The design significantly reduces the collisions among the synchronization protocol messages. We have simulated the proposed protocol in Castalia network simulator. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol significantly reduces the time required for synchronization and also improves the accuracy of the synchronization algorithm...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 62 - 64). When the wireless communications {{is coming to the}} offices and the homes, there are some new security issues to be taken care of. Today we have continuously growing markets for the wireless LANs, but there is big black hole in the security of this kind of networks. Companies without controlled doors cannot ensure the security and safety of their employees, nor can they prevent piracy and theft. Networks without <b>controlled</b> <b>access</b> cannot guarantee the security or privacy of stored data, nor can they keep network resources from being exploited by hackers. In our thesis we are giving an overview of the security functions and threats specified in one wireless LAN standard, namely in the IEEE 802. 11. The IEEE 802. 11 is one of the very first wireless local area network standards that is currently widely deployed. Much research has been done on the IEEE 802. 11 wireless network standard and the standard is known for its insecurity. Several reports have addressed the 802. 11 -based network vulnerabilities mainly for its lack of authentication. This thesis aims to improve the IEEE 802. 11 standard by analyzing the security mechanisms the standard provides. The IEEE 802. 11 standard provides basic security mechanisms such as the wired equivalent protocol, an encryption protocol, and the <b>media</b> <b>access</b> based <b>access</b> <b>control</b> list, which is essentially a list of legitimate clients. Attackers may easily penetrate these IEEE 802. 11 basic security mechanisms. I did not perform any testing of the attack solutions. Successors of this thesis project should implement the attack and test out solutions. Hasan–Al–BannaRiaz Mahmood RajibB. Computer Science and Engineerin...|$|R

This paper provides an overview of an enhanced version of INSYDE that can be app lied to distributed network systems. The model description method and a number of application examples are also presented. A major challenge in simulating distributed network systems that interconnect multiple computer systems over a network is how to describe the intricate, complex model conditions of computer systems including task processing and interrupts on the one hand, and network-related model conditions (e. g., specifying protocol, <b>media</b> <b>access</b> method, congestion <b>control,</b> broadcast communication, and so on) on the other in the most parsimonious fashion with the least amount of modeI description.

40|$|Multicast in {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) is {{an efficient}} way to spread the same data to multiple sensor nodes. It becomes more effective due to the broadcast nature of wireless link, where a message transmitted from one source is inherently received by all one-hop receivers, and therefore, {{there is no need to}} transmit the message one by one. Reliable multicast in WSNs is desirable for critical tasks like code updation and query based data collection. The erroneous nature of wireless medium coupled with limited resource of sensor nodes, makes the design of reliable multicast protocol a challenging task. In this work, we propose a time division multiple access (TDMA) based energy aware <b>media</b> <b>access</b> and <b>control</b> (TEA-MAC) protocol for reliable multicast in WSNs. The TDMA eliminates collisions, overhearing and idle listening, which are the main sources of reliability degradation and energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is parametric in the sense that it can be used to trade-off reliability with energy and delay as per the requirement of the underlying applications. The performance of TEA-MAC has been evaluated by simulating it using Castalia network simulator. Simulation results show that TEA-MAC is able to considerably improve the performance of multicast communication in WSNs...|$|R
