The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E
25|$|As raw {{material}} prices {{fall through the}} global recession, the negotiating position of African countries is sharply weakened, while expected profits intended to repay Chinese loans are collapsing.

25|$|The {{house of}} Austria showed a wish for {{supremacy}} in Europe, giving {{an impression of}} a militant bastion of Catholicism faced with the emergent Protestant states. The French monarchy was <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> that this claim would find echoes in Catholic circles in France. Besides, Habsburg possessions encircled its territory: Spain, the Netherlands, Franche-Comté and more distantly, Milan. Until the Spanish Armada was defeated in 1588, {{it was not clear}} that England would not become part of this encirclement.|$|E

25|$|The Ixcanha Maya {{community}} had {{a population of}} some 1,000 people, who refused the Cruzob's break with traditional Catholicism. In the years of stalemate, Ixcanha agreed to nominal recognition {{of the government of}} Mexico in exchange for some guns to defend themselves from Cruzob raids and the promise that the Mexican government would otherwise leave them alone. Mexico City gave Ixcanha autonomy to govern itself through 1894 (following a treaty with the United Kingdom that recognized Mexico's rule over the Yucatan), as it was <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about the Chan Santa Cruz.|$|E

He was caught on camera apparently snorting class A drugs, lines of cocaine, in a Manchester hotel room. Doctors said they were <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about his depression and alcohol abuse than drug use. Hatton sought medical help two weeks prior after news emerged about a night out where he drank 11 pints of Guinness, vodka and sambuca during the night out with Emma Bowe, 29, the Irish national senior women's boxing champion.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{issues have}} brought {{criticism}} to missionary activity. This has included concerns that missionaries have a perceived {{lack of respect}} for other cultures. Potential destruction of social structure among the converts has also been a concern. The Akha people of South East Asia are an example of those who believe that missionaries are only converting others for personal gain. The Akha people have complained the missionaries are <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about building a church than building a clinic in a village that is very unhealthy. Many traditional values of the Akha have been lost {{as a result of these}} conversions. The Huaorani people of Amazonian Ecuador have had a well-documented mixed relation with Evangelical Christian missionaries and the contacts they brought to their communities, criticized by outsiders.|$|E
25|$|At long last, the {{youthful}} Chinese are today <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about more extensive issues that go past mutual interests. Break even with circumstances in instruction,work and business {{are issues that}} are as yet essential to them. Be that as it may, {{the youthful}} Chinese set these inside the bigger national structure of between ethnic collaboration, equity and human rights, and defending of nature (Lee,2011). Thus numerous youthful Chinese experts are attracted to NGOs and common society developments. Also, {{in the event that}} they take part in legislative issues they join multi-ethnic parties. Moreover, a few supporters of PR battle that the three gatherings of DAP, PKR and PAS offer a superior similarity of political equality and that each heads a Pakatan-drove government in Pulau Pinang, Selangor and Kelantan.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about spoilage than {{the effect of}} corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than sodium nitrate or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|E

25|$|Tywin Lannister calls {{a meeting}} of the Small Council. He demands {{knowledge}} of Jaime's location, which the spymaster, Lord Varys, is unable to provide. Tywin then announces plans to have Lord Petyr Baelish wed Lysa Arryn to deprive Robb Stark of more allies in the war. Tywin names his son Tyrion as Baelish's replacement as Master of Coin (treasurer), despite Tyrion's pointing out his lack of expertise. Later, while retrieving the ledgers for his new appointment, Lord Baelish advises Tyrion on the job. Tyrion then rewards his virgin squire Podrick Payne with the services of three prostitutes for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater; Tyrion is later surprised to discover that they refuse payment due to Podrick's skill in lovemaking. While going over the books, Tyrion discovers that as treasurer Baelish has borrowed millions in gold from Tywin, as well as tens of millions from the Iron Bank of Braavos. A debt to Tywin is a problem since, regardless of his familial relationship with the king, Tyrion fears he will not forgive the debt despite the crown's dire straits. However, he is <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about the Iron Bank, since if they are not paid back in due time they may very well begin funding the Crown's enemies.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was {{able to get out of}} the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|E
25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E

40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{that there is a}} {{significant}} gender difference in the worry report of women and men, with women consistently reporting <b>more</b> <b>worry</b> than men (Stavosky & Borkovec, 1988). This study investigated this phenomenon by looking at gender differences in cognitive variables associated with excessive worry. Intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, positive beliefs about worry, and cognitive avoidance have been linked with the generation and maintenance of worry (Dugas et al., 1998). Two-hundred and twenty-one female and 103 male university students completed six questionnaires assessing trait worry, intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, positive beliefs about worry, and cognitive avoidance. The results showed that women reported significantly <b>more</b> <b>worry</b> than men on two trait worry scales, as well as significantly <b>more</b> <b>worries</b> about lack of confidence issues. In relation to cognitive variables associated with worry, women also reported engaging in significantly more thought suppression and negative problem orientation than men. A non-significant trend emerged for a closer relationship between positive beliefs about worry and trait worry for men. It is postulated that thought suppression and negative problem orientation may account for women's increased reporting of worry, and that positive beliefs about worry may have a closer relationship to worry in men. Hypotheses accounting for the observed gender effects in the cognitive variables used in this study are discussed...|$|R

500|$|Russell {{was driven}} by [...] "a {{neurotic}} need to win", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; {{early in his career}} it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> when it did not happen. Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so [...] "when it's an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting.

500|$|Josh and Naomi {{had sex in}} a hotel {{elevator}} and O'Reilly said the scenes were not awkward to film, as Bonner's sense of humour made the shoot fun. She also said that Naomi was not worried about taking advantage of Josh, as she was <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about Sheila's reaction if she found out. Naomi {{was trying to get}} her life back under control and {{she did not want to}} ruin her relationship with her mother again. The relationship was almost discovered by Sheila when she returned home unexpectedly and interrupted Naomi and Josh. Naomi forced Josh to hide outside in the garden wearing nothing but his underwear. Naomi ended the affair after Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), found out about it and confronted Naomi. O'Reilly thought Naomi was well suited to Josh as they had [...] "similar energies", but ultimately he was too young for her.|$|E
500|$|Slovak and Kiedis became {{addicted}} to heroin {{early in their}} careers, and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family.

[...] During the tour in support of Freaky Styley, Slovak's health began to deteriorate. Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour, but Slovak became too weak to participate. [...] Kiedis commented on the situation: [...] "I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force {{that allows you to}} at least defend yourself. [...] It was a sad moment." [...] A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovak's health contacted his brother, James, who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin.|$|E
30|$|These {{geographical}} and demographical features {{apply to}} smaller towns as well, stemming {{on the one}} hand from common factors, such as the presence of disused and deteriorated property.

500|$|Brown's acrimonious {{departure}} from Cleveland was {{another source of}} criticism. His teams' winning ways had helped obscure his harsh methods and need for control, but Modell's active involvement in the team exposed them. Despite that Modell owned the team, Brown refused to cede any authority or be diplomatic in his relationship with Modell. Modell felt Brown was unwilling {{to adapt to the}} way football was played in the early 1960s. Many players from that time agreed. [...] "Paul didn't adjust to the changes in the game", former Browns cornerback Bernie Parrish said in 1997. [...] "By 1962, he was <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> about protecting his reputation as the Greatest Coach Who Ever Lived than he was about winning a title. ... By the end of the 1962 season, a lot of us wanted to be traded because we were convinced that we'd never win a title with Paul Brown – and we never believed Paul Brown was going anywhere." [...] After his firing, Brown held a grudge against Modell {{for the rest of his}} life. He never forgave Collier for taking over as coach when he left, even though Collier had asked for and received his blessing.|$|E

500|$|Players at both clubs {{received}} {{the news with}} apprehension. As Ley put it, [...] "When you merge two clubs into one, you cannot have a squad of 45." [...] The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith {{in the dressing room}} at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April. Mark Jones, one of the Oxford midfielders, recalled that the room [...] "went totally quiet", and that his first thought was that it might be hard to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading's players also on the books. According to Jones, Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players' fears by telling them that [...] "we're only doing it so we can buy Kerry Dixon. All your places are safe". Alan Judge, the Reading goalkeeper, reported his team reacting in a similar way—indeed, he described the Reading players as even <b>more</b> <b>worried</b> as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season. Ley, who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game, recalled that the players were almost silent, their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by [...] "a feeling of incredulity, confusion, worry and fear".|$|E
