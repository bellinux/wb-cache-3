50|$|If {{diagnosed}} {{prior to}} time of gut closure (foal {{is less than}} 24 hours of age), the foal should be given an alternative nutrient source via nasogastric tube. The mare should be stripped of <b>milk</b> and the <b>foal</b> muzzled during the time to prevent additional ingestion of colostrum. However, this disease is usually diagnosed in foals greater than 24 hours of age, {{in which case the}} foal is safe to continue to ingest the mother's <b>milk.</b> <b>Foals</b> are supported with fluids, which are used to maintain hydration, correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and help perfuse the stressed kidneys which can be damaged by the circulating hemoglobin. Foals are kept warm and as quiet as possible, and exercise is limited. Intranasal oxygen may be used to improve blood oxygen levels. Antimicrobials are also sometimes given to help prevent sepsis, which is more likely to occur in a compromised foal.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>foal</b> at the <b>milking</b> and the {{extra virgin olive oil}} supplementation in the diet, on the milk {{obtained}} by 12 Ragusana jennets were studied. The jennets were each fed 3. 5 + 1. 5 kg/d of concentrate+bran, and hay ad libitum. They were divided into 2 equal groups with one group receiving an additional dietary supplement of 100 ml/d of olive oil. Milk was collected at day 20 post foal- ing and every 15 - 18 d for 5 times. At each collection period jennets were milked 4 -times per day. At 07 : 30 h foals were separated from the jennets and after a 4 hour interval were milked manually (1 MNF; 1 st <b>milking,</b> <b>foal</b> absent). At the end of the 1 MNF, each jennet was milked again, with the foals kept near the udder, but prevented from suckling (2 MYF; 2 nd <b>milking,</b> <b>foal</b> present). After 2 MYF, foals were removed a second time and the sequence repeated after another 4 hour interval for the 3 rd (3 MNF) and 4 th (4 MYF) milkings. Milk yield was recorded at each milking and samples analyzed for qualitative variables. The milk yield was 26 % higher than that reported by Giosuè et al. (2008) in similar conditions. The milk fat content were positively influenced by the presence of the <b>foal</b> at the <b>milking</b> but was not effect by the dietary supplement of olive oil...|$|R
40|$|In {{their first}} 150 days of lactation, nine Ragusana jennets were {{investigated}} at the ‘Istituto Sperimentale Zootecnico per la Sicilia’ (ISZS) in Palermo, {{to study the}} effects of different milking typologies on milk production. The jennets were kept in a paddock and were fed hay ad libitum and concentrate (3. 5 kg jennet/day). From post-foaling day 21, every 3 weeks individual milk amounts were recorded, and individual milk samples were collected and analyzed for the main qualitative parameters. The compared theses were: two daily milking times with 6 - and 3 -h intervals; and two, three and eight daily milking times with 3 -h interval. The jennets were manually <b>milked.</b> The <b>foals</b> were separated from the jennets at 0800 h, and after the last <b>milking</b> the <b>foals</b> were housed with the jennets.

40|$|Limited {{information}} is available about the actual management characteristics of dairy donkeys in Southern Europe. The aim {{of the present study}} is to describe animal management of dairy donkey farms in Italy. Twelve farmers were asked to answer a questionnaire on the management of their animals and their farms distributed over the Italian territory. Six farms grouped their animals in paddocks according to the production characteristics (e. g. lactating, dry, stallions); three farms housed the stallions in single boxes. Most of the visited farms were family run and the number of animals cared for by a single person varied from five to 103 animals. All the farms but one performed mechanical milking with a modified goat milkmaid. Vaccinations were regularly performed only on two farms. All the foals received colostrum and suckled from their own mothers. Foals were nursed by their mother until 6 - 12 months old.

50|$|Foals develop rapidly, {{and within}} a few hours a wild foal can travel with the herd. In {{domestic}} breeding, the foal and dam are usually separated from the herd for a while, but within a few weeks are typically pastured with the other horses. A foal will begin to eat hay, grass and grain alongside the mare at about 4 weeks old; by 10-12 weeks the foal requires more nutrition than the mare's <b>milk</b> can supply. <b>Foals</b> are typically weaned at 4-8 months of age, although in the wild a foal may nurse for a year.|$|R
50|$|Healthy foals grow {{quickly and}} {{can put on}} up to three pounds or over a kilo a day. A sound diet {{improves}} growth and leads to a healthier adult animal, although genetics also plays a part. In the first weeks of life the foal gets everything it needs from the mare's milk. Like a human infant, it receives nourishment and antibodies from the colostrum in milk that is produced within the first few hours or days following parturition. The mare needs additional water to help her produce <b>milk</b> for the <b>foal</b> and may benefit from supplementary nutrition.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of machine milking on behaviour, milk production and milk quality of jennies. Four Martina Franca and four Ragusana jennies were used. Five jennies had no experience of machine milking (group NE), whereas other three had (group E). Milking was performed by a portable milking unit once a week from 20 to 140 days in milk and residual milk was dripped by hand. Before <b>milking</b> <b>foals</b> were separated from the mothers at different time intervals. The behaviours, recorded from the attachment to the removal of milking cluster, were step (foot lifted less than 15 cm off of the ground) and kick (raised more than 15 cm off of the ground, even if a clear kick was not visible). In addition, defecation, urination and vocalisation were recorded as a single behavioural activity, but this activity was observed so rarely that {{was not included in}} the statistical analysis. Duration of milking, milk yield and quantity of dripped milk were also registered. Data were analysed by using the mixed procedure of SAS with day of lactation as repeated factor, experience as non repeated factor and time of separation of foal as covariate. The jenny was considered random. In addition, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to determine the correlation between variables. The number of steps (1. 29 ± 0. 56 vs 1. 61 ± 0. 43 n/min; for groups E and NE, respectively) and kicks (0. 34 ± 0. 26 vs 0. 56 ± 0. 20 n/min; for groups E and NE, respectively) expressed by jennies during machine milking was very low. These variables along with duration of milking were not affected by experience (2. 87 ± 0. 29 vs 2. 94 ± 0. 22 min; for groups E and NE, respectively). Conversely, time of separation from foals had a significant influence on duration of milking and number of kicks (P< 0. 01). Duration of milking increased with the time of separation (r= 0. 294; P< 0. 01), whereas, even if not significantly, the number of kicks decreased as the time of separation from foals increased (r=- 0. 147). It can be concluded that jennies rapidly habituate to machine milking, although their behavioural response may be affected by the time of separation from foals...|$|R
40|$|Six {{lactating}} mares {{were fed}} either a low protein diet {{or the same}} diet with added urea ad libitum over 71 days. The quantity consumed by the mares, milk intakes of their <b>foals,</b> <b>milk</b> composition, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), mare liveweight changes and foal growth rates were measured. The mares were unable to consume sufficient quantities of either diet to meet their nitrogen requirements and all lost weight. Adding urea to the diet significantly increased PUN in mares and foals, raised urea concentrations in the milk, decreased the mares 2 ̆ 7 feed intake and significantly increased their weight loss. Low concentrations of protein were measured in milk from mares on both diets. Milk intakes of all the foals were reduced and they showed poor growth rates...|$|R
40|$|Ongulates {{are born}} agammaglobulinaemic; their {{survival}} {{depends on the}} passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins (IgG 1) by colostrum ingestion. Currently, there is still 10 to 12 % of neonatal mortality, half is a the consequence of the failure in IgG 1 absorption through the immature gut. During the 24 first hours the gut is able to transfer a wide proportion of native IgG 1 by micropinocytosis. This transport should be enhanced by molecules present in the aqueous phase of the colostrum (serocolostrum). Hence, four serocolostrums, were produced by membrane fractionation with modification in soluble molecules composition except for IgG 1 concentration. They were expected to contain factors enhancer of the IgG 1 intestinal absorption {{in order to be}} used as a colostrum replacer for foals and calves. Two serocolostrums were freeze-dried to be used in addition to whole and skimmed <b>milk</b> (<b>foals</b> and calves) or to IgG 1 deficient equine colostrum (DEC, foals). Animals were fed in the 7 first hours after birth with 4. 1 g of IgG 1 /kg body weight. Control groups received equine (foals) or bovine (calves) colostrum by tube feeding. Serum samples were taken versus time and serum concentration in equine and bovine IgG 1 was measured by single radial immunodiffusion. The half life and the absorption coefficient (AC) of the IgG 1 were calculated. The maximal IgG 1 concentration in animals’ serum was systematically at 18 hours after feeding. Regardless the composition of the serocolostrums, when given as a substitute, it was observed exactly the same failure in IgG 1 absorption with an IgG 1 serum concentration 2. 4 times (~ 8 gkg- 1, AC = 16 ± 5 %) and 3. 5 times (~ 5 gkg- 1, AC = 25 ± 7 %) lower in calves and foals respectively, when compared to the control groups. When serocolostrum was mixed with whole or skimmed bovine milk, IgG 1 serum concentration was only increased by ~ 1. 5 - 1. 8 for both species. When It was mixed to the DEC, the bovine IgG 1 concentration in foal serum was increased by 3 ([IgG 1] ~ 15 gkg- 1 (AC = 45 ± 5 %). Hence, it seems that molecular fractions (caseins and/or fat) present in colostrum but lacking in serocolostrum are involved in IgG absorption either by transfer activation or by avoiding a transfer limitation. Additional experiments are ongoing to test this assumption. The identification of these factors should permit to better understand the cellular mechanism of absorption in immature enterocytes. Our results also showed that bovine serocolostrum was efficient enough to compensate the failure in passive immunization in calves and foals even if the half time of bovine IgG 1 is reduced in foals...|$|R

40|$|Till {{today there}} is no exact {{explanation}} of the phenomenon of first diarrhoea called “heat diarrhoea” in foals. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the traits of first foal diarrhoea (occurrence, its duration and intensity) and mares’ milk composition during first month after parturition. The research was carried out on 30 Arabian mares and their <b>foals.</b> <b>Milk</b> samples were collected to evaluate the main components and macroelements. Observations were made on the term of occurrence, length and intensity of first heat diarrhoea of foal. The close connection between mares’ milk composition and characteristics of diarrhoeas was observed in Arabian foals. Young animals characterised by lack of any diarrhoea signs have drunk milk with higher level of most studied components except lactose and magnesium. Foals with later scours drunk milk with higher level of P and Na; foals with longer diarrhoeas obtained milk with higher lactose, P and Na concentration; higher intensity was influenced by higher lactose level. This problem definitely needs further studies...|$|R
40|$|Effects of milk {{replacer}} composition and intake {{on the growth}} of orphan foals were evaluated. Twenty foals were assigned to four treatments: 1) mare-nursed, 2) commercial <b>foal</b> <b>milk</b> replacer at recommended intakes (standard), 3) commercial <b>foal</b> <b>milk</b> replacer at high intakes (high), and 4) acidified replacer at recommended intakes (acidified). <b>Foals</b> fed <b>milk</b> replacer diets were weaned at 12 - 24 hours postpartum and fed {{milk replacer}} for 50 days. Mare-nursed foals were weaned between 52 and 56 days of age. Foals fed replacer diets gained 12 % to 28 % less weight than mare-nursed foals up to two weeks of age. However, by four months of age, weights of replacer-fed foals {{were similar to those}} of mare-nursed foals and 32 other mare-nursed foals at the farm weaned between three and four months postparium. Foals drank 10 to 12 L/ 100 kg body weight (BW) in fluid replacer daily over the trial period. During the first week, high intake foals consumed 26 % more replacer (p< 0. 05) than foals fed acidified or standard diets. This higher intake resulted in diarrhea earlier (6 - 11 days vs 11 - 22 days) and for a longer time (6. 3 days vs 2. 5 - 3. 6 days) than in foals fed recommended amounts. Mare-nursed foals developed “foal heat scours” in the second week postpartum. After the first week, foals fed high replacer diet voluntarily consumed the same volume of fluid replacer as foals fed the standard intake. Foals ate less than 1 kg grain mix/ 100 kg BW daily to one month of age, then increased intake to 1. 5 - 2 kg/ 100 kg BW to weaning. Water intake was 20 - 40 % of daily fluid intake and was correlated (r = 0. 85) to dry matter intake. Foals in the high intake group ate less (p< 0. 05) solid feed and drank less water than foals fed the standard and acidified diets. The foal's stomach capacity appears to limit meal size and thus replacer intake. If recommended feeding intervals are used, replacer intakes by foals are less than 15 % BW daily. High volume intakes appeared to prolong diarrhea. Normal growth rates occur when replacer and good-quality feeds are fed concurrently...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest on donkey milk production, on its characteristics, and also on breeding techniques. Donkey milk is characterized by high economic value, although the productive level of jennies is poor. During the <b>milking</b> process, <b>foals</b> are usually separated from their dams, allowing the milk collection in the mammary gland of jennies before milking session. This takes 8  h per day of fastening period for lactating donkey foals. During this period, it could be possible to apply a partial artificial suckling system (artificial suckling during daytime and natural suckling during the night). The aim of the work is the evaluation of the effect of this innovative technique on in vivo performances and on meat production traits of Martina Franca donkey foals. Forty Martina Franca jennies with their foals were used for the trial. After colostrum assumption, 20 foals were partially artificially suckled (AS) during each day, and 20 foals were naturally suckled (NS). From 8. 00 to 20. 00, both groups were separated from their mothers in order to allow the milking procedures of the jennies. The AS group was in a stall equipped with an automatic calf-suckling machine. For each group, 10 foals were slaughtered at 12  months and 10 foals at 18  months. Artificial suckling system positively affected the growth rate of donkey foals, particularly in the first 6  months from birth, with higher weekly weight gain (P[*] [*] 0. 05). Artificial suckling system permitted to extend the time of foal separation from their mothers increasing milk collection time per day, awarding fastening periods in foals...|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} sexual dimorphism, {{activity}} budgets, and group cohesion: {{the case of}} the plains zebra (Equus burchelli) P. Neuhaus and K. E. Ruckstuhl Abstract: Animals that differ in reproductive status and body size have different needs in terms of foraging and rest-ing. In most social ungulates this leads to sexual segregation, probably because of incompatibilities between the activ-ity budgets of males and females. Since most studies on behavioural differences between the sexes have been done on sexually dimorphic species, we decided to look at a system in which males and females are similar in body size. We studied time budgets, synchrony of behaviour, and bite rates of plains zebras (Equus burchelli) to evaluate the factors that enable these extremely social ungulates to stay in stable mixed-sex family groups throughout the year. As we predicted, time budgets were similar among males, lactating females, pregnant females, and non-reproductive females. Furthermore, we observed close synchronization of behaviours between females that differed in reproductive status and males. Lactating females, however, did take more bites per minute when foraging than either pregnant or non-reproducing females or males. We assume that the higher bite rates of lactating females were due to the extra costs of producing <b>milk</b> for their <b>foal.</b> We concluded that the special harem mating system, and for females the year-round pos...|$|R
