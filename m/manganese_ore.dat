5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the <b>manganese</b> <b>ore</b> is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching <b>manganese</b> <b>ore</b> with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing <b>manganese</b> <b>ore</b> {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the <b>manganese</b> <b>ore</b> to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

40|$|At Tokushima Plant of Nippon Denko Co., Ltd. {{high-carbon}} ferromanganese {{is produced}} by the electric furnace method using lump <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> and sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> manufactured from fine <b>manganese</b> <b>ores.</b> However, the distribution of <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> is significantly uneven on earth, and their characteristics considerably vary by ore type. It is known from experience that the production of high-carbon ferromanganese by the electric furnace method depends greatly on material ores. Therefore, to maintain stable operation in the electric furnace-smelting field, {{it is important to}} identify the characteristics of each type of material ores in advance. Thus, we evaluated the high-temperature electric characteristics of <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> using the electrical conductivity measuring system developed by ourselves and provided the standards for determining ores and blending ratio necessary for stable operation of the electric furnace based on the evaluation results. This time we worked for optimisation of the high-temperature electric characteristics of sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> through modification of the characteristics because the blending ratio of sintered <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> in the electric furnace is high.

40|$|The chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) {{process is}} a novel solution for efficient combustion with direct capture of carbon dioxide. The process uses a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier to transfer oxygen from an air to a fuel reactor, where the fuel reacts with the solid oxygen carrier. In this work, six different <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> are investigated as oxygen carriers for CLC application. The chemical-looping characteristics of the oxygen carriers were evaluated in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed reactor in the temperature range of 900 - 970 oC during alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions. Three of the <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> showed a small oxygen release in inert environment between 850 and 950 oC. During reactivity tests, the gas yield with methane increased with the temperature and complete conversion of 50 % CO in H 2 was obtained {{for all of the}} ores. The rates of char gasification of two fuels, namely Mexican petroleum coke and Swedish wood char, were compared for the different <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> at 970 oC and with 50 % H 2 O in N 2 as fluidizing gas. Ilmenite and a manufactured Mn-oxide oxygen carrier consisting of Mn 3 O 4 and MgO-stabilized ZrO 2 as support were also included for comparison. The char gasification rate and the gas conversion were higher with the <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> and the Mn-oxide oxygen carrier compared to ilmenite. However, the higher reactivity of the <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> with H 2 and the ensuing decrease in H 2 inhibition for <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> is not sufficient to explain their higher rate of char gasification. Surface analysis of partially gasified petcoke particles in the presence of <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> showed formation of cavities and channels as well as a uniform distribution of potassium and sodium elements. The rate of char gasification also increased with the concentration of potassium and sodium impurities in the <b>manganese</b> <b>ores.</b> Thus the results suggest that the increased rate of char conversion for <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> is due to alkali-catalyzed steam gasification. The increase in rate of char gasification, in combination with potentially low costs of these materials suggests that <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> could be interesting materials for CLC with solid fuels...|$|R

40|$|Metal-oxide and {{sulphide}} deposits, chemically {{similar to}} the hydrothermal deposits of modern and ancient oceanic spreading axes, occur of the two areas of the Argolis Peninsula of the Peloponnesus, Greece. In the first, in northeastern and central Argolis, <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> immediately overlie MORB-type extrusives of mid-Jurassic age. After Triassic rifting this oceanic crust formed during Jurassic time and was then tectonically emplaced over the adjacent continental margin in the Late Jurassic. The <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> (Palea Epidavros) were precipitated from low-temperature hydrothermal vent waters on the axis of a relatively unrifted ocean ridge, which was possibly slow-spreading. The deep-sea sediment cover comprises pelagic carbonate accumulated on the ridge flanks, then ribbon radiolarites deposited on the abyssal plain below the CCD, located close enough to a continental margin to allow deposition of shallow water-derived calciturbidites. In the second area, Ermioni, in the southern Argolis Peninsula (Adheres), massive sulphides and metalliferous oxide sediments occur with mafic extrusives and terrigenous turbidites. Although previously regarded as a single stratigraphical succession (""Shale-sandstone Formation""), the mafic lavas and metal deposits are interpreted here as ophiolitic slices that were incorporated into the turbidites by thrusting, possibly as a trench-accretionary complex. The massive sulphides were precipatated from high-temperature vents sited near the axis of a relatively unrifted spreading ridge which was possibly fast-spreading.

40|$|Abstract Analytical data {{of primary}} {{oxidized}} <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> were processed by statistical methods. Six hundred and twenty-one samples were measured (Mn, Fe, Si, and P); thus 2, 426 assay data were available. The statistical pointer numbers, {{the distribution of}} the elements and the results of the correlational analysis showed the heterogeneity of the ore samples where the measured elements correlated weakly. The samples were grouped by the 4 elements to decrease the heterogeneity and the concentration of elements, and these relationships in the groups were examined. Very few and weak relationships were proved in the groups by the results of the correlational and regressional analysis. It is possible that not the heterogeneity of the samples but one or more syngenetic or postgenetic processes caused the absence of relationships. The multivariate statistical processes (principal component analysis, discriminance analysis) allow the determination of the background factors, namely which are the effects that produced the ore. Consequently — with high probability — the ore was formed by two processes. The most likely are hydrothermal and microbial ones (on the basis of geochemical results), but supergene enrichment processes can also be taken into consideration. Both hydrothermal and microbial processes {{played a significant role in}} the majority of the samples (81 %), which are the ferruginous <b>manganese</b> <b>ores.</b> In the smaller group of samples (19 %) the hydrothermal process predominates but the microbial one is also influential, namely for the low iron-bearing <b>manganese</b> <b>ores</b> of excellent quality...|$|R
