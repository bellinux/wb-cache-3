The project attracted the attention of producer Christine Vachon, who had seen a short film Peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 about the case. IFC Films, Hart Sharp Entertainment, and Killer Films, Vachon and Eva Kolodner's production company, provided financing for the project. IFC contributed roughly $1 million, but the film's eventual budget remained under $2 million. Peirce co-wrote the screenplay with Andy Bienen. They worked together for 18 months on the final drafts and were careful not to [...] "mythologize" [...] Brandon; the aim was to keep him as human as possible. In the editing stage of the script, Peirce sent the draft to Fox Searchlight Pictures, which agreed to produce and distribute the film while giving Peirce artistic license.|$|E

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{expected}} regular behaviour, we identified other properties that {{are characteristic of}} any continuous near-Earth geomagnetic recording. For example, even on exceptionally quiet days, one can find examples of residual disturbances still causing certain variations, thereby contaminating the average regular variation obtained from such days. This variation is usually negative and occurs in the late evening (Mayaud, 1980). When these short-term (1 – 2 h) disturbances of magnetospheric origin occur around— or close to—local <b>midnight,</b> they can <b>shift</b> the local <b>midnight</b> levels from which the baseline of the daily variation is computed.|$|R
