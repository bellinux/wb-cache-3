5|$|Due to {{the gradual}} {{evolution}} of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively; this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as prime ministers. Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days, and Waldegrave after three. Modern academic consensus does not consider either <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> held office as Prime Minister, {{and they are not}} listed.|$|E

Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam, but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles, the Monte-Carlo Masters and Italian Open. Djokovic, as the only <b>man</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> won eight of the nine Masters events, is a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters, as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally.

When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights.

40|$|Increasing the {{probability}} of paying child support, in addition to increasing resources available for investment in children, also may alter the incentives faced by <b>men</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children out of wedlock.
