40|$|Acute stroke {{is often}} a treatable condition; however, {{intervention}} is time dependent and typically should ensue within 3 hr from onset of symptoms. The ability of individuals to understand stroke risk factors to reduce individual risk and to recognize warning {{signs and symptoms of}} stroke as signals to initiate medical care is paramount to decreasing stroke-related morbidity and mortality. This descriptive study presents ethnic and racial differences of baseline stroke knowledge among residents (n = 1, 904) of two North Carolina counties situ-ated in the Stroke Belt. Findings suggest a global stroke knowledge deficit that is more pronounced among Hispanics. Future community stroke education cam-paigns need to consider various educational <b>mediums</b> and <b>outlets</b> to ensure inclusion of persons at highest risk for stroke. Suggestions are provided for possible content of future stroke knowledge and prevention campaigns...|$|R
50|$|Sexuality is not {{apparent}} in her works {{and a lack}} of association with morality leaves viewers at the free will of her humorous narratives. Lucas takes on the role as a source of reflecting sexism, but not overtly commenting on it. She has stated that, “I am not trying to solve the problem. I’m exploring the moral dilemma by incorporating it”. Her works are both literal and conceptual evidence of Lucas searching for meaning. Whether its through recognizable forms or her own mythologized fantasies, her ideas constantly build and transform. She appears to never be satisfied with her outcome and scours every imaginable <b>medium</b> for an <b>outlet</b> that is fitting. To her, the artworks she make “…carry on talking and thinking with other people”. Lucas’s practice is then not compulsive ramblings or automatic depictions, but a conscious yearning for a personal sense of happiness.|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{analysis of a}} particle distribution at the outlet of a 2 D-channel is presented. A convection-diffusion equation is used to represent the distribution of particles in a flow. The flow is governed by the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The particles follow the <b>medium</b> to the <b>outlet,</b> where {{the goal is to}} obtain uniform distribution of the particles. A goal function for the particle distribution at the outlet is presented, and the gradient of the goal function with respect to the normal motion of the surface is calculated. The calculation of the gradient is performed by applying the so-called adjoint method. For this, the adjoint scalar transport equation and the relevant adjoint RANS equations are implemented. The calculation cost of the entire sensitivity field is roughly twice the cost of a standard convection-diffusion particle simulation. This results in computationally cheap gradients compared to traditional methods. The results are validated by comparing the gradients calculated using the adjoint method to gradients obtained using numerical differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The purpose o f {{this study}} is to {{determine}} a link between environmental, health and safety awareness and management within small to <b>medium</b> sized retail <b>outlets.</b> The retail sector was chosen specifically due to the potential influence it has over manufacturers and consumers alike. The study assesses the approaches taken by national and international bodies to encourage the uptake o f environmental, health and safety management. The survey focused on the levels o f environmental, health and safety management within the retail sector in Mullingar. The results o f the study showed a low level o f awareness with regard to the environmental issues o f water consumption and quality, energy consumption and the environmental impacts associated with purchasing. However, high levels o f awareness o f waste management were present. One possible reason for this is the “Race against Waste” mentoring programme. The study has identified the need for further collaboration between business, regulatory and advisory groups, in providing sustainable sector specific mentoring programmes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Textural {{analysis}} {{carried out}} for the sediments of the Nayakkankuppam coast revealed that inlet part is dominated by fine sand, central part is dominated by <b>medium</b> sand and <b>outlet</b> part is dominated by coarse sand. The grain size parameters namely Mean size (MZ), standard deviation (σ 1), skewness(Ski), and kurtosis (KG) of percentile values derived from the cumulative curves following Folk and Ward and the moment technique based upon grouped data are most widely used. It is observed that in Nayakkankuppam, most of the samples were fallen in the moderately well sorted to well sorted nature. Skewness measures asymmetry of frequency distribution and marks the position of mean with respect to median. The fine skewed nature of the sediments clearly exhibits sediment input from various sources of tributaries. The finely skewed nature is also implies a low velocity than normal, this skewness data indicated that the sediments are nearly symmetrical to fine skewed, the median class of the sediments dominate almost throughout their distribution. The kurtosis data indicated Mesokurtic to platykurtic. The CM pattern divulged that the sediments were transported bottom suspension and rolling as well as graded suspension. The comparison with the tractive current diagram, the berm samples fall in beach environment, the remaining samples fall in beach and tractive current environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work {{three-dimensional}} steady and unsteady numerical simulations {{of the flow}} field and chemical reactions within aNOx Storage Converter (NSC) diesel catalyst have been made. In {{the first part of}} the paper, only the flow characteristics within a catalyst have been investigated by mean of a steady three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach and a transport equation for each of the incoming chemical species. For flow simulations, the catalyst volume has been split in three zones: inlet, catalytic monolith, treated as porous media, and <b>outlet,</b> <b>medium.</b> The results have been reported in three different working points. Evidences on how the non-uniform flow distribution affects the catalyst efficiency have been described. In the second part, the fluid-dynamic solver has been coupled with a chemical reaction mechanism in order to catch the chemical surface reaction within a NSC catalyst. This coupled model has been validated according to the literature. Volumetric and superficial species concentration have been calculated imposing the site density and the kinetic of the reactions on a substrate Ba/Al 2 O 3. NOx spatial distributions within the catalyst during a dsorption phase are reported. The model represent a reliable tool to investigate in detail the complex flow/chemistry interaction within the modern diesel engine catalysts...|$|R
30|$|The {{pattern of}} ventriculomegaly in FVOO is termed as panventriculomegaly (Mohanty et al. 2008) or tetra-ventricular {{hydrocephalus}} (Longatti et al. 2009; Takami et al. 2010), as dilatation occurs in both lateral ventricles {{as well as}} in the third and fourth ventricles (Huang et al. 2001; Karachi et al. 2003; Oertel et al. 2010; Roth et al. 2012; Suehiro et al. 2000). Dilatation or large CSF collection of the foramina of Magendie and Luschka is a characteristic radiological finding in cases of FVOO (Huang et al. 2001; Karachi et al. 2003; Roth et al. 2012; Takami et al. 2010). However, it is difficult to confirm the presence of a membranous obstruction via conventional MRI (Dincer et al. 2009). High-resolution three-dimensional constructive interference with steady state sequence on 3 T MRI may be able to detect obstructive membranes (Dincer et al. 2009), although this may not be possible in all cases (Oertel et al. 2010). The most sensitive diagnostic method is CT ventriculography, with the injection of contrast medium through a ventricular catheter (Rifkinson-Mann et al. 1987; Roth et al. 2012). Serial CT images after injection will show collected contrast <b>medium</b> in the <b>outlets</b> of the fourth ventricle and subsequent blockage of its diffusion to the pre-pontine cistern. One concern about this method is radiation exposure of the brain, particularly in younger children. Joseph et al. (2003) recommended the use of MRI instead of CT as the diagnostic modality for FVOO in order to avoid exposure to radiation. As alternative examination to access the dynamics of CSF, efficacy of phase-contrast MRI (Choi et al. 1999; Huang et al. 2001), cine-MRI (Carpentier et al. 2001; Choi et al. 1999; Hashimoto et al. 2014; Inamura et al. 2002; Karachi et al. 2003; Longatti et al. 2009; Suehiro et al. 2000) or radioisotope cisternogram (Choi et al. 1999; Suehiro et al. 2000) is also reported.|$|R
