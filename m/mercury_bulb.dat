5000|$|Wet-bulb {{temperature}} is measured using a thermometer {{that has its}} bulb wrapped in cloth—called a sock—that is kept wet with distilled water via wicking action. Such an instrument is called a wet-bulb thermometer. A widely used device for measuring wet and dry bulb {{temperature is}} a sling psychrometer, which consists {{of a pair of}} <b>mercury</b> <b>bulb</b> thermometers, one with a wet [...] "sock" [...] to measure the wet-bulb temperature and the other with the bulb exposed and dry for the dry-bulb temperature. The thermometers are attached to a swivelling handle which allows them to be whirled around so that water evaporates from the sock and cools the wet bulb until it reaches thermal equilibrium.|$|E
30|$|From the 21 samples collected, 17 were {{prepared}} for thin sections. Fluorescent epoxy was impregnated under vacuum into the sample, which was then polished. The microstructure was characterised using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i epifluorescence microscope. The epifluorescent microscope uses a high-pressure mercury lamp that radiates ultraviolet light, which interacts with the fluorescent epoxy resin impregnated within the sample. Areas where the resin has accumulated (pores, vugs, fractures, etc.), glow under the light emitted by the <b>mercury</b> <b>bulb</b> (as in Heap et al. 2014). The advantage of this method of impregnation is the fluorescent dye only accumulates in the connected void spaces. The Nikon Eclipse 80 i also has a standard microscope bulb, so features can be compared in fluorescent light and plane-polarised light. This allows areas that {{have been identified as}} void spaces in fluorescent light to be confirmed using plane-polarised light.|$|E

5000|$|Mercury vapor lamps {{are more}} energy {{efficient}} than incandescent and most fluorescent lights, with luminous efficacies of 35 to 65 lumens/watt. [...] Their other advantages {{are a long}} bulb lifetime {{in the range of}} 24,000 hours and a high intensity, clear white light output. [...] For these reasons, they are used for large area overhead lighting, such as in factories, warehouses, and sports arenas as well as for streetlights. Clear mercury lamps produce white light with a bluish-green tint due to mercury's combination of spectral lines. [...] This is not flattering to human skin color, so such lamps are typically not used in retail stores.

40|$|In a {{preceding}} paper (Marshall and Meader') {{we reported}} {{a study of}} base-line bio-electric potentials in normal unanesthetized mice, preliminary to {{the investigation of the}} effects of altered external and internal environmental factors. In the present communication are presented the records of electrical potentials obtained during the depression of body temperature and its return to higher levels, together with observations on some physiological concomitants of the process. Material and Methods The methods used in securing and recording the data on potentials were, in general, similar to those described in the previous paper. Leads were taken from the nape of the neck and the dorsum of the sacrum of the mice by means of saline bridges connected with silver-silver chloride electrodes. The magnitudes of the potential differences were continuously and automatically indicated by a Burr, Lane, Nims microvoltmeter operating a photo-electric recording galvanometer. On a second similar recording galvanometer were obtained simultaneous, continuous, graphic readings of the internal temperature of the mouse as detected by a copper-constantin thermocouple. The thermocouple was inserted into the rectum of the mouse for a distance of 2 to 3 centimeters, so that only the insulated portions of the wires were exposed. Environmental temperatures were observed by means of a suspended <b>mercury</b> <b>bulb</b> thermometer with the bulb resting on the cork platform with the mouse.

The aim {{of this study was to}} validate real-time rectal temperature (RT) data of radio frequency based digital (RFD) thermometer with RT data of <b>mercury</b> <b>bulb</b> (MB) thermometer in dairy cattle. Materials and Methods: Two experiments were conducted. In experiment I, six female Jersey crossbred cattle with a mean (±standard error of the mean) body weight of 534. 83 ± 13. 90 kg at the age of 12 ± 0. 52 years were used to record RT for 2 h on empty stomach and 2 h after feeding at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min using a RFD thermometer as well as a MB thermometer. In experiment II, six female Jersey crossbred cattle were further used to record RT for 2 h before exercise and 2 h after exercise at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons by Bonferroni test was done. Results: Real-time RT data recorded by RFD thermometer as well as MB thermometer did not differ (p> 0. 05) before and after feeding/exercise. An increase (p< 0. 05) in RT after feeding/exercise in experimental crossbred cattle was recorded by both RFD thermometer and MB thermometer. Conclusion: The results obtained in the present study suggest that the body temperature recordings from RFD thermometer would be acceptable and thus RFD thermometer could work well for monitoring real-time RT in cattle...|$|E

5000|$|In 1948, {{the first}} regular {{production}} mercury vapor (MV) streetlight assembly was developed. It was deemed a major {{improvement over the}} incandescent light bulb, and shone much brighter than incandescent or fluorescent lights. Initially people disliked them because their bluish-green light made people look like they had the blood drained from them. Other disadvantages are that {{a significant portion of}} their light output is ultraviolet, and they [...] "depreciate"; that is, they get steadily dimmer and dimmer with age while using the same amount of energy, and in a few rare instances, they also cycle {{at the end of their}} life cycles. Even rarer is they can burn out, especially when the light is being burned while dim (usually at the end of the life cycle). Mercury lamps developed in the mid-1960s were coated with a special material made of phosphors inside the bulb to help correct the lack of orange/red light from mercury vapor lamps (increasing the color rendering index(CRI)). The UV light excites the phosphor, producing a more [...] "white" [...] light. These are known as [...] "color corrected" [...] lamps. Most go by the deluxe (DX) designation on the lamp and have a white appearance to the <b>bulb.</b> <b>Mercury</b> Vapor <b>Bulbs</b> come in either clear or coated with powers of 50, 75, 100, 175, 250, 400, 700 or 1,000 Watts.

The approximate cost of this project was $150,000, paid for by the ministry and B.C. Hydro. [...] "The average replacement time of one of the traditional light bulbs was about 72 hours," [...] said the ministry's Jeff Knight.

2500|$|Fluorescent lamps contain mercury, {{which is}} {{released}} when <b>bulbs</b> break. <b>Mercury</b> in <b>bulbs</b> is typically present as either elemental mercury liquid, vapor, or both, since the liquid evaporates at ambient temperature.

Breakage of multiple bulbs presents a greater concern. A 1987 report described a 23-month-old toddler who suffered anorexia, weight loss, irritability, profuse sweating, and peeling and redness of fingers and toes.

Migration from the current gas bulbs to the LED light results yielded about 60 % energy savings, while capital gains due to the generation of wind energy returned about 80 % savings per month which recovered initial investments on the assets. The environmental impact of this study cannot be neglected and it also provided opportunity for STEM education in colleges and wind energy awareness in the society in Iowa by showing benefits from current experiments. Details of the methods and analyses should be particularly useful to urban planners because they show how standard references on investment in automobile parking should be modified to include efficient energy management.

40|$|Light {{trapping}} is {{a common}} method for collecting flying insects, particularly Lepidoptera. Many trap designs are employed for this purpose and it is therefore important {{to know how they}} differ in their sampling of the flying insect fauna. Here we compare three Robinson-type trap designs, each of which employs a 125 W <b>mercury</b> vapour <b>bulb.</b> The first uses a standard bulb; the second uses the same bulb {{with the addition of a}} Pyrex beaker, often deployed to prevent bulbs from cracking in the rain, and the third uses a bulb coated with a substance that absorbs visible wavelengths of light (also known as a black light). The black light trap caught fewer moths than either of the other traps, and had lower macromoth species richness and diversity than the standard + beaker trap. This lower species richness could be accounted for by the smaller number of moths caught by the black light trap. Furthermore the black light caught a different composition of both species and families to the other two trap types. Electromagnetic spectra of the three trap types showed the black light trap lacked peaks in the visible spectrum present in both of the other traps. We therefore conclude that the addition of a beaker to a Robinson-type trap does not make catches incomparable, but use of a black light does. These differences are probably due to lower total emission of radiation in the black light trap, thus catching fewer moths overall, and the lack of visible radiation produced, meaning that moths most sensitive to visible wavelengths are not attracted...|$|R
