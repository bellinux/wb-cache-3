The algorithm and the stages of cash flows transformation in the system of insurance, services reproduction and the GRP forming have been considered. It has been found that value added, which is formed at the stage of creating the insurance product, is quantitatively formed in the process of value distribution. Certain suggestions have been formulated to improve the methodology of contribution assessment of the “Financial Corporations” sector and the “Insurance Corporations and Pension Funds” subsection. The following main trends of increasing “the share of insurance in GRP” have been marked out: creating conditions for contributions {{to increase the number of}} resident <b>insurance</b> companies, <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>societies</b> and <b>insurance</b> mediators (insurance agents and brokers); making the techniques of more accurate GRP working out while combining these with perfecting statistical, accounting and tax reporting by the subjects of insurance; creating attractive investment conditions in the regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} aimed, {{proceeding}} from the theoretical research and studies, at analyzing {{the content of}} the concept of «insurance system» and its structure, providing characterizations of the elements included in it. In the working process, the methodological approach to the structural analysis of insurance system was used and the system method was applied in order to define its essence and elements, which allowed studying the insurance system as a whole. The system method was applied for the generalizing, systematizing, and interpretation of results of the study on the insurance system of Ukraine, in combination with critical analysis. The obtained results allow to submit that an insurance system is a complex, which includes five main elements (insurance companies, reinsurance companies, branches of the non-resident insurers, <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>societies,</b> <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance pools). A methodology of determining the essence and structure of an insurance system has been elaborated that has provided the basic criteria (legislative origin, operating in the insurance market and purchasing risks with the subsequent insurance of these, «production» of the insurance products that can be sold to the insurance intermediaries), using of which can be reasonable in the assigning elements to an insurance system. Further theoretical studies of insurance system and its elements will contribute to the harmonization of the existing concepts and actualization of the new scientific issues, as well as development of new approaches in terms of the methodology of studying the insurance activity...|$|R

50|$|The National Farmers Union <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Society</b> Limited, trading as NFU Mutual, is a UK {{registered}} {{mutual insurance}} composite. It underwrites more than £1 billion (2008) in annual premium {{in life and}} general insurance lines for rural communities within the UK. NFU Mutual is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. In contrast to insurance companies owned by their shareholders, NFU Mutual is owned by its policyholders. Unlike most other UK insurers, NFU Mutual sells its policies predominantly through a network of tied agents which are located mainly in rural areas. At the end of 2014 NFU Mutual had 639 (2013: 655) NFU Mutual Agents working out of 319 (2013: 323) offices. NFU Mutual employs around 3,800 people throughout the UK. This network enjoys {{a close relationship with}} the National Farmers Union (NFU). In 1909 the NFU Mutual was formed to offer insurance as an inducement for farmers to join the NFU. Many of the agents double as local union representatives. Many agents are self-employed and all are tied to NFU Mutual products.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, the Royal London <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Society</b> {{decided to}} {{establish}} its investment department {{as a separate}} investment management subsidiary, in order to offer products and services to a wider marketplace. Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) was formed in 1988, won its first external client in 1990 and continued to attract new business through the 1990s. The {{early part of the}} following decade was a period of more rapid growth. The acquisitions of United Assurance, Scottish Life and the cash management business of Union Discount (subsequently renamed Royal London Cash Management) led to an increase in assets under management to around £25 billion by the end of 2004. Further expansion, including the acquisition of The Co-operative Asset Management in 2014, has seen this rise to over £87.9 billion (as at 31 March 2016). RLAM has retained its mutual status since its formation in the late 1980s, as such accountability is to the RLAM members instead of external shareholders and profits are only distributed amongst members or reinvested for better returns.|$|E
50|$|On July 25, 2007, Resolution agreed {{a merger}} with Friends Provident {{to create a}} new entity, Friends Financial, with a market cap of circa £8.6Bn, however by September 2007 it was {{announced}} that Hugh Osmond's Pearl Group, a critic of the proposed merger with Friends Provident, had undergone talks with Swiss Re about a potential deal to take over Resolution, but talks broke down. On 10 October 2007, Pearl made a formal offer of 660 pence per share, worth approximately £4.5 billion, in conjunction with the Royal London <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Society.</b> Standard Life and Swiss Re also entered the bidding for Resolution, and for a brief period on October 26, 2007 their cash and shares bid, worth £4.9 billion was recommended by the board, which called off any deal with Friends Provident. Within a short space of time, Pearl came back with an all-cash offer of 720 pence per share. In addition, Hugh Osmond, chief executive of Pearl, now controlled a stake of 24.1% of Resolution's ordinary shares, which would have effectively blocked any planned merger from Standard Life as it would have required 75% approval from shareholders. In mid-November 2007, Standard Life pulled out of the merger and the offer from Pearl was recommended by the board to shareholders.|$|E

40|$|Incluye 4 ficheros de datosBackground: Work-related {{injuries}} of {{the shoulder}} complex represent a challenge for clinicians {{because of the large}} variety of clinical entities involved and the broad anatomic structures that can be affected. Furthermore, commonly performed orthopedic tests have demonstrated limited accuracy for diagnosing the injury despite considerable research efforts. The aim of this study protocol is therefore to describe a comprehensive approach integrating both a clinical- and functional status-based pathology and an adapted rehabilitation prescription. Methods/Design: A longitudinal cohort study will be performed at the Department of Rehabilitation and Medical Assistance of a <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>society</b> for work-related injury management in Spain (Mutua Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra Spain). Patients will be attended by an occupational physician who specializes in work-related injuries and is part of the project team that will systematically visit all the participants. After the medical diagnosis and any requested supplementary evaluations (i. e., radiological examinations), the patients will be referred to the rehabilitation service. Before the physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program is initiated, the patients will undergo a comprehensive functional screening at the biomechanics laboratory. Using a decision-making scheme, the identified functional deficits will be used to customize the individual rehabilitation plan. Discussion: The proposed objective criteria-based shoulder diagnosis and rehabilitation model could be a new effective strategy for minimizing the time required to regain functional capacity and recover from symptoms among patients with work-related shoulder injuries...|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom Combined Code {{is today}} the most {{fundamental}} corporate governance code applicable in United Kingdom. The nation of United Kingdom encourages governance practices by implementing the Directive 2006 / 46 /EC {{on a voluntary basis}} before being mandatory. While corporate governance is applicable to many corporations, pension providers may be seen as one of the ideal market sector for governing, since they act as institutional investors representing a major shareholder group. Institutional investors may even improve corporate governance practices as they represent a major part of public sector capital. Owning large amount of shares, their function is to supervise in the firms’ corporate governance activities in order to monitor the transparency and disclosure procedures. To be able to monitor other companies' activities, pension providers must set up an example for enforcing corporate governance practices themselves and follow them respectively.   This descriptive case study observes the corporate governance structures represented in annual reports of five large chosen pension providers during the years 2007 to 2009 capturing the financial crisis occurring in 2008, in United Kingdom. The purpose of the study is to examine if strong corporate governance is incorporated in the following pension providers, Aberdeen Asset Management plc, Aviva plc, Prudential plc, Royal London <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Society</b> Limited and Standard Life plc. The focus is on board composition and established committees. The scope of this study answers the following research question: How do the five pension providers, Aberdeen, Prudential, Royal London, Standard Life and Aviva, comply with or explain deviations found in their respectively annual reports from 2007 - 2009 in accordance with the Combined Code 2008 and the Annotated Combined Code 2005 ?   Fundamental for pension providers is to work on a long-term basis with value creation as goal. Still the core focus of corporate governance remains, to create a system offering protection for all stakeholders. As the result shows, all of the five chosen corporations strongly implement national corporate governance practices throughout 2007 - 2009 on both board composition and established committees. Still, they suffered short-term negative fluctuations from the United Kingdom financial crises in 2008, but recovered shortly afterwards. Even though these fluctuations occurred, all of the corporations have long-term value as one of their main objectives. The long-term value can partly be sustained by strong corporate governance practices as it a main objective in corporate governance...|$|E
