500|$|Following {{the death}} of Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain in April 1994, drummer Dave Grohl entered a state of depression, and {{found it difficult to}} both listen to music and play instruments. He was uncertain of what to do next, even considering abandoning his musical career despite a few invitations by bands such as Danzig or Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to become their drummer, because [...] "it would just remind <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in Nirvana; every time I sat down at a drum set, I would think of that." ...|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{a member of the}} Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a member of the Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what {{is referred to as the}} Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E
500|$|Pope Pius IX's {{determination}} to keep Edgardo {{developed into a}} strong paternal attachment. According to Edgardo's memoirs, the pontiff regularly spent time with him and played with him; the Pope would amuse the child by hiding him under his cassock and calling out: [...] "Where's the boy?" [...] At one of their meetings, Pope Pius told Edgardo: [...] "My son, you have cost me dearly, and I have suffered a great deal because of you." [...] He then said to others present: [...] "Both the powerful and the powerless tried to steal this boy from me, and accused <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> barbarous and pitiless. They cried for his parents, but they failed to recognise that I, too, am his father." ...|$|E

500|$|So far, {{changes to}} the {{original}} had been of a minor nature, but when the opera reappeared in June 1869 it had been entirely restructured. Although the musical numbers were still linked by dialogue, the first act had been divided in two, to create a three-act opera. Various numbers, including the drinking song and the new polka, were repositioned, and the polka was now followed by a furiant. A [...] "March of the Comedians" [...] was added, to introduce the strolling players in what was now Act III. A short duet for Esmeralda and the Principal Comedian was dropped. In September 1870 The Bartered Bride reached its final form, when all the dialogue was replaced by recitative. Smetana's own opinion of the finished work, given much later, was largely dismissive: he described it as [...] "a toy ... composing it was mere child's play". It was written, he said [...] "to spite those who accused <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> Wagnerian and incapable of doing anything in a lighter vein." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Partition" [...] {{was written}} by Terius Nash, Justin Timberlake, [...] Timothy Mosley, Beyoncé, [...] Jerome Harmon, Dwane Weir, Charisse Hill and Mike Dean. The {{production}} was handled by Timberlake, Beyoncé, Dean, Jordy [...] "Boots" [...] Asher as well as Mosley, Harmon and Wane under their stage names Timbaland, J-Roc and Key Wane respectively. [...] "Partition" [...] was conceived as a two-part song, {{the first part of}} which is called [...] "Yoncé". The latter's original drumbeat was created by Timberlake on a bucket. Mike Dean then added the dropping 808's lead synths, claps and strings. Beyoncé described the sound that he created as [...] "organic" [...] and said, [...] "It reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in middle school during the lunch breaks, when you just start free-styling." [...] The trio decided to keep the buckets as Beyoncé wanted an organic production. Then The-Dream started writing some of the lyrics including, [...] "Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor". Beyoncé found it awkward at the beginning but she soon loved the phrase, which lead to the birth of her new alter ego, Yoncé. The singer revealed that she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] after she recorded [...] "Partition" [...] because of its overtly sexual lyrics. Speaking about how {{the other part of the}} song materialized, Beyoncé said: ...|$|E

In addition, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that [...] "Jews are respected by everyone, by all human beings... some people think if they accuse <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> anti-Jew they can solve the problem. No, I am not anti-Jew... I respect them very much... We love everyone in the world– Jews, Christians, Muslims, non-Muslims, non-Jews, non-Christians".|$|E

2500|$|Some people accused <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> pro-Muslim in Bosnia, but I {{realised}} {{that our}} job is to give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide you can't just be neutral. You can't just say, [...] "Well, this little boy {{was shot in the head}} and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he had an argument with his wife." [...] No, there is no equality there, and we had to tell the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Olbermann has {{addressed}} the assertions of liberal bias {{by stating that}} he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: [...] "I mean, no one in 1998, no one accused <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same thing. And {{now all of a sudden}} I’m a screaming liberal." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{running for}} mayor in 1993, Coleman {{wrote in a}} letter to the City Convention Delegates: [...] "I have never sought any other {{political}} office.

Some accuse <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the fiscal conservative in this race—I plead guilty! I'm not afraid to be tight with your tax dollars. Yet, my fiscal conservatism does not mean I am any less progressive in my Democratic ideals. From Bobby Kennedy to George McGovern to Warren Spannaus to Hubert Humphrey to Walter Mondale—my commitment to the great values of our party has remained solid.|$|E

6000|$|... "But, Amos," [...] Hardy continued, imploringly, [...] "when {{poor little}} Chris Snyder was killed through {{what we did}} to Master Lillie, and you were as much {{concerned}} in the matter as I, you didn't accuse <b>me</b> then <b>of</b> <b>being</b> at fault." ...|$|R
60|$|The great {{silence of}} the forest flowed in over us, as it were; {{for quite a while}} no one did or said anything.

2500|$|Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber {{attributed}} the {{good relations with}} Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: [...] "We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race." [...] According to a village elder interviewed by the Toronto Globe and Mail: [...] "Perhaps because {{of the history of}} feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews...against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here...During the first truce of the War of Independence, I {{was on my way to}} Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers.

6000|$|MATT. Then said Matthew, [...] "Fear was {{one thing}} that made me think that I was far from having that within me which makes <b>me</b> sure <b>of</b> <b>being</b> saved. But if it were so with such a good man as he, why may it not also go well with me?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nonsense, Lily. I never snubbed you yet, and I don't {{think it}} likely that I shall begin. But you ought not to accuse <b>me</b> <b>of</b> not <b>being</b> civil to your friends.

6000|$|... "No. It is {{four years}} since we met, and I have so greatly changed, in that time, that I have no fear he would {{recognize}} me. At any rate, not here in London, which is the last place he would suspect <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in." ...|$|E
