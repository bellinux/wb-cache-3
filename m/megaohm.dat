5000|$|One of {{them was}} a [...] "hand dynamo", which allowed {{generation}} of voltages high enough to measure resistance in the megohm range and thus construction of a first portable insulation tester. The <b>MEGaohm</b> metER was then named as Megger and the word became a trademark name registered on 25 May 1903.|$|E
5000|$|Static dischargers, {{commonly}} known as static wicks or static discharge wicks, are installed on the trailing edges of aircraft, including (electrically grounded) ailerons, elevators, rudder, wing, horizontal and vertical stabilizer tips. Fitted on almost all civilian aircraft today, they are high electrical resistance (6-200 <b>megaohm)</b> devices with a lower corona voltage than the surrounding aircraft structure. They control the corona discharge into the atmosphere, isolating noise and preventing it from interfering with aircraft communication equipment. They are used on aircraft to allow the continuous satisfactory operation of onboard navigation and radio communication systems during precipitation (p-static) conditions. Precipitation static is an electrical charge on an airplane caused by flying through rain, snow, ice, or dust particles. When the aircraft charge is great enough, it discharges into the surrounding air. The discharge path is through pointed aircraft extremities, such as antennas, wing tips, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and other protrusions. The discharge creates a broad-band radio frequency noise from DC to 1000 MHz. This RF noise can affect aircraft communication. During adverse charging conditions (air friction), static dischargers limit the potential static buildup on the aircraft and control interference generated by static charge. Static dischargers are not lightning arrestors and do not reduce or {{increase the likelihood of}} an aircraft being struck by lightning. Static dischargers are subject to damage as a result of lightning strike to the aircraft, and should be inspected after a lightning strike to ensure proper static discharge operation. Static dischargers will not function if they are not properly bonded to the aircraft. There must be a conductive path {{from all parts of the}} airplane to the dischargers, otherwise they will be useless. Access panels, doors, cowls, navigation lights, antenna mounting hardware, control surfaces, etc., can create static noise if they cannot discharge through the static wick.|$|E
50|$|The E3 {{series is}} defined as three numbers {{consisting}} of 1.00, 2.20, 4.70. If a manufacturer sold resistors with E3 series values {{in a range of}} 1 ohm to 10 <b>megaohms,</b> then the available resistance values (in ohm (Ω)) would be: 1, 2.2, 4.7, 10, 22, 47, 100, 220, 470, 1K, 2.2K, 4.7K, 10K, 22K, 47K, 100K, 220K, 470K, 1M, 2.2M, 4.7M, 10M.|$|R
40|$|Extremely high {{sensitivity}} detectors, such as silicon bolometers {{are required}} in many NASA missions for detection of photons from the x-ray {{to the far}} infrared regions. Typically, these detectors are cooled to well below the liquid helium (LHe) temperature (4. 2 K) to achieve the maximum detection performance. As photoconductors, they are generally operated with a load resistor and a pre-set bias voltage, which is then coupled to the input gate of a source-follower Field Effect Transistor (FET) circuit. It is imperative that the detector system signal to noise performance be limited by {{the noise of the}} detector and not by the noise of the external components. The load resistor value is selected to optimize the detector performance. These two criteria tend to be contradictory in that these detectors require load resistors in the hundreds of <b>megaohms,</b> which leads to a higher Johnson noise. Additionally, the physical size of the resistor must be small for device integration as required by such missions as the NASA High Resolution Airborne Wide-Band Camera (HAWC) instrument and the Submillimeter High Angular Resolution Camera (SHARC) for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). We have designed, fabricated and characterized thin film resistors using a CrSi/TiW/Al metal system on optical quality quartz substrates. The resistor values range from 100 <b>megaohms</b> to over 650 <b>megaohms</b> and are Johnson noise limited at LHe temperatures. The resistor film is sputtered with a sheet resistance ranging from 300 ohms to 1600 ohms and the processing sequence developed for these devices allows for chemically fine tuning the sheet resistance in-situ. The wafer fabrication process was of sufficiently high yield (> 80 %) providing clusters of good resistors for integrated multiple detector channels, a very important feature in the assembly of these two instruments...|$|R
30|$|By deducing the {{resistance}} values {{before and after}} oxidation, we can obtain the amount of increased resistance by annealing which is about 3.79 Ω m− 2. However, {{the resistance}} values in Table  1 are in <b>megaohms,</b> so this value is negligible for samples with such barrier layer thickness. Now, for ZnO nanowires with this approximation, we obtained the resistance of parallel array of the existing nanowires in the template to be 1.86 MΩ (difference between two values before and after oxidation).|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} transport {{properties of}} organic heterointerfaces formed by single-crystals of two organic donor-acceptor molecules, tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF) and 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ). Whereas the individual crystals have un-measurably high resistance, the interface exhibits a resistivity of few tens of <b>MegaOhm</b> with a temperature dependence {{characteristic of a}} small gap semiconductor. We analyze the transport properties based on a simple band-diagram that naturally accounts for our observations in terms of charge transfer between two crystals. Together with the recently discovered tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) -TCNQ interfaces, {{these results indicate that}} single-crystal organic heterostructures create new electronic systems with properties relevant to both fundamental and applied fields...|$|E
40|$|Gigaohm {{recordings}} {{have been}} made from glutamate receptor channels in excised, outside-out patches of collagenase-treated locust muscle membrane. The channels in the excised patches exhibit the kinetic state switching first seen in <b>megaohm</b> recordings from intact muscle fibers. Analysis of channel dwell time distributions reveals that the gating mechanism contains at least four open states and at least four closed states. Dwell time autocorrelation function analysis shows that {{there are at least}} three gateways linking the open states of the channel with the closed states. A maximum likelihood procedure has been used to fit six different gating models to the single channel data. Of these models, a cooperative model yields the best fit, and accurately predicts most features of the observed channel gating kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This work {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of working conditions and reliability of metal oxide arresters using dielectric response techniques. Varistors are polycrystalline ceramics in which the conduction {{is controlled by the}} Schottky barriers existing in the grain-boundary region. The resulting insulation resistance values are in the range of several <b>Megaohms</b> in the non-conducting region of the VxI characteristic curve. Nevertheless, the degradation process of the components changes the microstructure in the ZnO varistors and/or the insulation properties, affecting the conduction mechanism. Measurements of polarization/depolarization currents and DC conductivity using very sensitive equipment can reveal the evolution of this process. The aim of this work is to analyze different test techniques to assess the insulation condition of surge arresters subjected to lightning discharges. Thus, test samples were submitted to a degradation process up to fail. Throughout of this stressing procedure electric tests were carried out using techniques frequently applied for diagnosis (reference and residual voltage, resistive current) in addition with the new ones, based in direct current measurements. Results are compared and commented...|$|R
40|$|MnO/C {{composite}} coatings {{were grown}} by the metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} process on ceramic alumina in argon ambient. Characterization by various techniques confirms that these coatings are homogeneous composites comprising nanometer-sized MnO particles embedded in a matrix of nanometer-sized graphite. Components of the MnO/C composite coating crystalline disordered, but are electrically quite conductive. Resistance vs. temperature measurements show that coating resistance increases exponentially from a few hundred ohms at room temperature to a few <b>megaohms</b> at 30 K. Logarithmic plots of reduced activation energy vs. temperature show that the coating material undergoes a metal-insulator transition. The reduced activation energy exponent for the film under zero magnetic field was 2. 1, which is unusually high, implying that conduction is suppressed at much faster rate than the Mott or the Efros-Shklovskii hopping mechanism. Magnetoconductance us. magnetic field plots obtained at various temperatures show a high magnetoconductance (similar to 28. 8 %) at 100 K, which is unusually large for a disordered system, wherein magnetoresistance is attributed typically to weak localization. A plausible explanation for the unusual behavior observed in the carbonaceous disordered composite material is proposed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments have created new devices that could improve and simplify {{the construction of}} stimulus isolators. HEXFET transistors can switch large currents and hundreds of volts in nanoseconds. The newer opto-isolators can give a pulse rise time of a few nanoseconds, with output compatible with MOSFET devices, in which delays are reduced to nanoseconds. Integrated DC/DC converters are now available. Using these new resources we developed a new electrical stimulus isolator circuit with selectable constant-current and constant-voltage modes, which are precise and easy to construct. The circuit works like a regulated power supply in both modes with output switched to zero or to free mode through an opto-isolator device. The isolator analyses showed good practical performance. The output to ground resistance was 1011 ohms and capacitance 35 picofarads. The rise time and fall time were identical (5 µs) and constant. The selectable voltage or current output mode made it very convenient to use. The current mode, with higher output resistance values in low current ranges, permits intracellular stimulation even with tip resistances close to 100 <b>megaohms.</b> The high compliance of 200 V guarantees {{the value of the}} current stimulus. The very low output resistance in the voltage mode made the device highly suitable for extracellular stimulation with low impedance electrodes. Most importantly, these characteristics were achieved with a circuit that was easy to build and modify and assembled with components available in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Microchannel plate (MCP) {{dynamic range}} has {{recently}} been enhanced for both very low and very high input flux conditions. Improvements in MCP manufacturing technology reported earlier have led to MCPs with substantially reduced radioisotope levels, giving dramatically lower internal background-counting rates. An update is given on the Galileo low noise MCP. Also, new results in increasing the MCP linear counting range for high input flux densities are presented. By bonding the active face of a very low resistance MCP (less than 1 <b>megaohm)</b> to a substrate providing a conductive path for heat transport, the bias current limit (hence, MCP output count rate limit) can be increased up to two orders of magnitude. Normal pulse-counting MCP operation was observed at bias currents of several mA when a curved-channel MCP (80 : 1) was bonded to a ceramic multianode substrate; the MCP temperature rise above ambient was less than 40 C...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} single- (SLG) and bi-layer (BLG) {{graphene}} on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are investigated {{by means of}} Raman spectroscopy and transport experiments. The hBN-graphene heterostructures are fabricated by a state-of-the-art transfer process of exfoliated graphene on exfoliated hBN. The high quality structures feature low residual charge carrier densities of n∗ ≈ 5 × 10 $^{ 10 }$ cm$^{− 2 }$ and high carrier mobilities of μ ≈ 70, 000 cm$^ 2 $/Vs. Thermal annealing experiments show that these superior sample characteristics can even be maintained after substantial heat treatments. A subsequent experiment investigates the scattering mechanism limiting the carrier mobility in SLG. By correlating Raman spectroscopy to transport measurements we find new evidence that strain variations are the scattering source for charge carriers in SLG. The limits of carrier mobility are further investigated in case of BLG. A thorough analysis of the weak localization effect leads {{to the conclusion that}} intravalley scattering originating from nanometer-scale strain variations is the most likely source for the mobility limiting scattering events. To obtain direct evidence for this hypothesis we further investigate the relation of n∗ to μ for a large number of samplesand observe the predicted dependence for strain variations as the main scattering source. In consequence, we conclude that strain fluctuations are the most probable source for carrier scattering in both SLG and BLG. In a following set of experiments the opening of the band gap in BLG in dependence of the applied perpendicular electric field is investigated. The investigation particularly focuses on the origin of the sub gap conductance which leads to a maximum resistance on the order of ten <b>megaohm.</b> Temperature dependent transport and bias spectroscopy measurements show that this non-vanishing conductance is mediated by variable range hopping through a low number of hopping states. By developing a simple model we can unambiguously rule out long range potential disorder as the origin of the hopping states. Further measurements of a ”corbino-like” device suggest the presence of AB/BA stacking domain walls in the bulk of the investigated BLG. A final experiment investigates the influence of the rough edges in graphene nanostructures i. e. quantum dots (QDs). The obtained results show that edge roughness is the dominant source of disorder in QDs on hBN with diameters below 100 nm...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} add long period {{seismograph}}s to our radio tele-recording seismograph system we {{are developing a}} long period seismograph system as shown in Table 1. In this paper, {{we report on the}} long period seismograph designated as No. 2 in Table 1. The maximum magnification of the seismograph is approximately 1000 at the period of 30 sec. The response curve covers the period range 10 to 100 sec. The design of the pendulum is shown in Fig. 1. The brass boom is 45 cm long and the mass is 5000. gr. The axis of rotation is obtained by a knife edge at the point (5) and a steel ribbon at the point (13) as shown in Fig. 1. The pendulum period is adjustable for a range of 10 to 65 sec with good stabilty. The transducer of the seismograph is a moving coil which has a winding of 100, 000 turns with a mean diameter of 4. 2 cm and a resistance of 1 <b>Megaohms.</b> The magnet is made of MK- 5 with pole pieces arranged to produce a radial magnetic field of 3500. gauss. A shunt capacitance is used to lengthen the period of pendulum. The theory for the period lengthener was given by Coulomb (1952). The output of transducer is then put into an integrator with the time constant of 63 sec (2 πRC). The function of this network is that of a double integrator having identical time constant. (See Fig. 2 and 3) The D. C. amplifier which is used to amplify the output of the integrator is the chopper type. Its amplification is 20 Volts per 100 micro-volts at the load resistance of 4 Kilo-ohms and the drift is less than ± 20 micro-volts in 24 hours. The recorder is an ink-writing galvanometer with period of 0. 03 sec and sensitivity of 5 mm per 1 m amp. The seismograph was constructed in February 1962, and has been operated at Yasuda Hall in the campus of Tokyo University. A typical record is shown in Fig. 8, where the upper traces 1 and 2 are the record of Press-Ewing seismograph (To = 30 sec. Tg = 90 sec 3) and the lower trace is that of our seismograph...|$|R
