5000|$|The {{keyboard}} instruments collected by Benton Fletcher include six English harpsichords {{from the second}} half of the eighteenth century. Two are from Burkat Shudi's workshop in Soho. One is a single manual model dated 1761 and the other is a double manual harpsichord, naming both Burkat Shudi and John Broadwood as makers, dated 1770. The later instrument is faced with amboyna burl wood and is among the most elaborate of late English harpsichords, featuring the Venetian swell patented by Shudi in the same year, a <b>machine</b> <b>stop,</b> six hand-stops and a pedal action, with five notes below FF. Three instruments from Kirckman in London include a single manual harpsichord by Jacob Kirckman of 1752, a simple instrument with only 2 sets of 8' strings, a double manual harpsichord by Jacob Kirckman of 1762 with [...] "book-matched" [...] walnut veneer panels, and a double manual instrument by Jacob and Abraham Kirckman of 1777. A Longman and Broderip, a single manual harpsichord, made by Thomas Culliford dated 1783, which was the first harpsichord acquired by Benton Fletcher, includes a buff stop and a pedal <b>machine</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E
50|$|He made a {{great many}} {{innovations}} in the harpsichord: from c.1765 he introduced the <b>machine</b> <b>stop,</b> a mechanism engaged by a handstop and operated by a foot pedal which gradually reduces the registration on each manual; from c.1765 he extended the range down to CC; from c.1769 he introduced the Venetian swell: a contraption nearly identical in mechanism and purpose to the expression pedal found on the organ, operated with a foot pedal and placed above the strings. He used leather plectra in some registers; {{it is not known}} whether he ever built an instrument with a 16' stop, though none survives with one. He also made claviorgans (a joint harpsichord and organ) though none of those instruments remain.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{innovations}} {{were made}} in later years; the buff stop was introduced c.1760, and was sometimes activated by a pedal on single manual instruments. The <b>machine</b> <b>stop,</b> dating from after 1765, was a mechanism worked by a hand stop and a foot pedal which caused various changes in registration, rather like the arrangements on an organ. The 'nag's head swell' was {{a segment of the}} top lid shaped like an elongated horse's head, which opened along the bentside when a foot pedal was pressed; this was later superseded by Schudi's Venetian swell, which worked similarly but was more like a modern organ swell mechanism (and named after its similarity in appearance to a Venetian blind). Extensions in range were also made, as high as [...] upwards; this was perhaps due to musical demands or rivalry with Shudi, who had extended his harpsichords down to CC. Jacob Kirkman made an experimental enharmonic harpsichord for Robert Smith of Trinity College, Cambridge, around 1757.|$|E

50|$|The APEXC is an {{incredibly}} simple machine.Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, {{for a total of}} 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.One oddity {{is that there is no}} program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, <b>machine</b> <b>stop,</b> and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 differentvalues).|$|E

40|$|Three studies {{investigated}} whether {{young children}} make accurate causal inferences {{on the basis}} of patterns of variation and covariation. Children were presented with a new causal relation by means of a machine called the "blicket detector. " Some objects, but not others, made the machine light up and play music. In the first 2 experiments, children were told that "blickets make the machine go " and were then asked to identify which objects were "blickets. " Two-, 3 -, and 4 -year-old children were shown various patterns of variation and covariation between two different objects and the activation of the machine. All 3 age groups took this information into account in their causal judgments about which objects were blickets.

30|$|Most of the {{manufacturing}} organizations try to implement {{some of the ideas}} adopted by Just in Time (JIT) philosophy, like on time delivery or minimum inventory (Salameh and Ghattas 2001). In this paper we introduce and formulate a JIT single machine scheduling problem with a periodic preventive maintenance on the machine. In most of the scheduling problems it is assumed that the machine is available interruptedly while, in practice, it may be unavailable due to causes like breakdown or preventive maintenance. According to the British Standard Institute (BSI), “Maintenance is a combination of any actions to retain an item in, or restore it to an acceptable condition” (BSI 1984). Periodic preventive maintenance, which is a fundamental part of JIT production, consists of regular preventive measures to increase machine reliability and to decrease breakdown probability during manufacturing process. In some of {{the manufacturing}} processes, overuse of the tool might decrease quality of the work piece. Therefore, when the work piece is expensive or when the accuracy is necessary, we change the tool before it is amortized. A well-known example is the printed circuit board manufacturing process in which the drilling machine {{is one of the most}} important devices. Thus not only should the <b>machine</b> <b>stop</b> to maintain after a period of processing time, but also the machine should stop to change the micro-drill after fixed times of using. Accordingly, the proposed model holds a limitation on the maximum number of processed jobs during each period. The objective of the proposed bi-objective mixed integer model is minimizing total earliness-tardiness costs and makespan simultaneously.|$|E

It is desirable the use of simulation before using formal verification in the analysis of a system control program because with the simulation of some possible system behaviors it is possible to eliminate a set of program errors in reduced intervals of time and that would not happen if these errors were detected only through the use of formal verification techniques. Conciliating these two techniques it can be substantially reduced the time necessary for the attainment of results through the use of the formal verification technique.
