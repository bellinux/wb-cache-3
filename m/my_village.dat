25|$|On March 16, 1968, Thompson and his Hiller OH-23 Raven {{observation}} helicopter crew, Larry Colburn (gunner) and Glenn Andreotta (crew chief), {{were ordered to}} support Task Force Barker's search and destroy operations in Sơn Mỹ, Quảng Ngãi Province, South Vietnam. Song <b>My</b> <b>Village</b> was composed of four hamlets, Mỹ Lai, Mỹ Khê, Cổ Lũy and Tư Cung, and was suspected by the United States Army Military Intelligence Corps to be a Viet Cong stronghold.|$|E
25|$|In February and March 1968, the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam was aggressively {{trying to}} regain the {{strategic}} initiative in South Vietnam after the Tet Offensive, and the search-and-destroy operation against the 48th NLF Battalion thought to be located in Sơn Mỹ became {{a small part of}} America's grand strategy. Task Force Barker (TF Barker), a battalion-sized ad hoc unit of 11th Brigade, was to be employed for the job. It was formed in January 1968, composed of three rifle companies of the 11th Brigade, including Company C from the 20th Infantry, led by Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Frank A. Barker. Sơn <b>Mỹ</b> <b>village</b> was included in the area of operations of TF Barker codenamed Muscatine AO. (Muscatine County, Iowa was the home county of the 23rd Division's commander, Major General (MG) Samuel W. Koster.) In February 1968, TF Barker had already tried to secure Sơn Mỹ, with limited success. After that, the village area began to be called Pinkville by TF Barker troops.|$|E

40|$|<b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> is a {{personal}} documentary response to The Sri Lanka Series (1980), a series of ethnographic films produced by the author's anthropologist mother, Sharon Bell, and filmmaker father, Geoff Burton. Four women, a community of fishermen, and a dance instructor were the 'subjects' of their three films. The feature length film <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> revisits the same participants in Sri Lanka and pursues the original themes and issues, such as economic conditions, the status of women, colonialism, religion, ritual, and inter-generational change. <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> explores how both the filmmaker and participants are navigating heredity and inheritance. Supplementing the film, the exegesis component, Provenance in Personal Documentary interrogates the conceptual underpinnings of the creative research. 'Provenance', the key concept informing the production of <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> is a fine art term specifically ârepractisedâ and retheorised here. It is hypothesised that cross-disciplinary personal documentary production is a fertile environment that responds to increasingly accessible technologies and progressive interpretations of what contemporary âdocumentaryâ means. This research project responds {{to the lack of}} a critical framework for interpreting and developing inter-disciplinary documentary praxis. The experimental methods employed in the provenance of <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> extend to the adoption of an auto-ethnographic and autobiographical mode of storytelling in this exegesis. This marriage of creativity and scholarly research is further reflected in the relationship between the exegesis and corresponding personal documentary film production. The provenance of <b>My</b> Mother's <b>Village</b> reveals an historical convergence of 20 th century documentary traditions of photography, cinema, and visual ethnography. The convergence of these traditions in the contemporary art context echoes Walter Benjamin's observations of the shifting nature of art in the 20 th century. Provenance, in Benjamin's revolutionary context, transgresses the 'aura', market valuation, and ownership of art objects to a dynamic understanding of processes, intentions, and storytelling throughout artistic production. This investigation finds that personal documentary modes account for this shifting paradigm in visual arts and offer ethical and creative methodologies for inter-disciplinary visual research. In the current global technological landscape of data-streams and personal media devices, provenance encourages a sensuous topography of encounter, contingency, boredom, and experiment...|$|R

2500|$|On March 16–18, TF Barker {{planned to}} engage {{and destroy the}} {{remnants}} of the 48th NLF Battalion, allegedly hiding in the Sơn <b>Mỹ</b> <b>village</b> area.

In turn, LTC Barker reportedly ordered the 1st Battalion commanders to burn the houses, kill the livestock, destroy food supplies, and destroy the wells.|$|E
2500|$|The massacre, {{which was}} later called [...] "the most {{shocking}} {{episode of the}} Vietnam War", took place in two hamlets of Sơn <b>Mỹ</b> <b>village</b> in Quảng Ngãi Province. These hamlets were marked on the U.S. Army topographic maps as My Lai and My Khe. The U.S. Army slang name for the hamlets and sub-hamlets in that area was Pinkville, and the carnage was initially {{referred to as the}} Pinkville Massacre. Later, when the U.S. Army started its investigation, the media changed it to the Massacre at Songmy.

2500|$|These {{differences}} were perceived by Mazakmat who returned home and promulgated the religion despite {{resistance from the}} Catholic and Methodist missions. He met up with an old friend, Michael Homerang, who was a highly respected malanggan carver and clan leader (maimai) {{in the village of}} Madina, on the north shore of New Ireland Province in the far north east. Momerang later said [...] "I saw a white man and woman come to <b>my</b> <b>village</b> and sit down to eat and talk with us.

2500|$|On {{the eve of}} the attack, at the Charlie Company briefing, Captain (CPT) Ernest Medina {{told his}} men that nearly all the {{civilian}} residents of the hamlets in Sơn <b>Mỹ</b> <b>village</b> would have left for the market by 07:00, and that any who remained would be NLF or NLF sympathizers. He was asked whether the order included the killing of women and children. Those present later gave differing accounts of Medina's response. Some, including platoon leaders, testified that the orders as they understood them were to kill all guerrilla and North Vietnamese combatants and [...] "suspects" [...] (including women and children, as well as all animals), to burn the village, and pollute the wells. He was also quoted as saying, [...] "They're all VC, now go and get them", and was heard to reply to the question [...] "Who is my enemy?" [...] by saying, [...] "Anybody that was running from us, hiding from us, or appeared to be the enemy. If a man was running, shoot him, sometimes even if a woman with a rifle was running, shoot her." [...] At Calley's trial, one defense witness testified that he remembered Medina instructing to destroy everything in the village that was [...] "walking, crawling or growing".|$|E
2500|$|Women in Arab {{societies}} experience discrimination {{from the}} western world based upon many misconceptions {{and a lack of}} knowledge about the realities of their lives. As described previously, the themes of invisibility, lacking accurate representation in media that {{other parts of the world}} absorb, and conflation of identities, be it Arab/Muslim, anti-Zionist/anti-Semite, etc. The conflict occurring Israel and Palestine is a prime example of how these misconceptions create an incorrect understanding of the circumstances and experiences that women in this area encounter in their daily lives. In the article “Arabiya Made Invisible” [...] by Noura Erakat, Ms. Erakat illustrates how the concepts of anti-zionism and antisemitism are conflated to vilify and silence Arab women who support Palestine or denounce the occupation. She says,“The equation of anti-Semitism to anti-Zionism is systematically used as a silencing tactic. Anti-Semitism refers to the historic oppression and vilification of Jews that led to such tragedies as the Nazi-engineered Holocaust. Zionism is the theoretical notion that global Jewry should have a homeland, and in its practical application, Zionism has meant the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.”Erakat goes on to discuss one protest that was hosted by a group of women of color at the Boalt Law School at UC Berkeley, a silent vigil protesting the occupation of Palestine, Iraq, and Haiti. A Jewish student wrote an op-ed for the school paper complaining that people should not be protesting Israel because Israel is accepting of homosexuals and gives women equal rights. She pointed out that it was ironic that women and gay men were at this vigil, while the places they were showing support of do not respect their rights as much as Israel does. At this point, Erkat gets to the meat of her argument. She says, “This student asserts that misogyny and gender inequality are inherent to Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular. According to her, “the Israeli occupation has nothing to do with Arab oppression of women and gays.” She fails to consider that structural violence waged on women in the context of war and occupation is the most extreme of its form. Moreover, she swiftly disregards the nexus of colonial occupation and patriarchy....when a nationalist movement becomes militarized [...] [...] [...] male privilege in the community usually becomes more entrenched...”The denial of the reality that the occupation and the threat it poses to women and gender equality in this opinion shows a prime example of how the incorrect characterization of Arab women can lead to further misconceptions and false justifications for situations of oppression. In a critique of Erakat's Students for Justice in Palestine group, a fellow student claims to be concerned as to whether his Palestinian peers at Berkeley would be comfortable exercising the freedoms they enjoy in Berkeley on the streets of Ramallah or Jerico. Erakat illustrates how this critique uses false concern to invalidate the real concerns that Palestinians living outside the occupied territories hold for their homeland, despite their differences in living situations and freedoms. She writes in response, “whereas the author wonders whether I would be able to comfortably walk around in tight jeans in Palestine, I wonder, if this man is truly concerned with my personal freedom, then why isn’t he protesting the twenty-five-foot Apartheid Wall built between <b>my</b> <b>village</b> of Abu-Dis and Jerusalem? If he really cares whether I can read Lolita comfortably, then shouldn’t he be more concerned that Palestinian children are denied a roof over their heads because of consistent home demolitions? His concern with my personal liberation seems disingenuous in light of the fact that he fails to mention Israeli military occupation as a significant, if not the most significant, factor contributing to the subjugation of Palestinian women’s rights. Instead, he uses the lack of gender equality in Palestine as a justification for its continued colonization.” ...|$|E
