40|$|Exposure of {{isolated}} photosystem I (PSI) complexes to illumination (2300 mE m 22 s 21) for various {{periods of time}} resulted in striking changes in their absorption spec-tra. A 6 nm blueshift of the absorption maximum in the red was detected after 100 <b>min</b> <b>illumination.</b> The fourth derivative of the absorption spectra verifies that the main change of the red peak was attributed to the 682 nm absorption band. Further, it was also shown that a shoul-der in the absorption spectra located around 470 nm de-creased after the first 5 min of illumination and almost disappeared after 40 <b>min</b> <b>illumination,</b> suggesting that chlorophyll b bound to light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) is also sensitive to excess light. A maximum in-hibitory effect on the oxygen uptake rates and a strong stimulation were observed when the PSI complexes were exposed to illumination for about 20 and 40 min, respec-tively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-trophoresis shows that LHCI- 680 started to degrade dur-ing the first 5 min of illumination and almost completely disappeared after 40 min of illumination. These obser-vations demonstrated that LHCI was more sensitive to illumination than the PsaA/B subunits which also pre-sented some degradation signs after 40 <b>min</b> <b>illumination.</b> In addition, insoluble–cohesive-denatured proteins also appeared between the stacking and resolving gel after prolonged illumination (100 min).

40|$|Activation of {{plasminogen}} to its active form plasmin {{is essential}} for several key mecha-nisms, including the dissolution of blood clots. Activation occurs naturally via enzymatic pro-teolysis. We report that activation can be achieved with 280 nm light. A 2. 6 fold increase in proteolytic activity was observed after 10 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> of human plasminogen. Irradiance levels used {{are in the same}} order of magnitude of the UVB solar irradiance. Activation is correlated with light induced disruption of disulphide bridges upon UVB excitation of the aro-matic residues and with the formation of photochemical products, e. g. dityrosine and N-formylkynurenine. Most of the protein fold is maintained after 10 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> since no major changes are observed in the near-UV CD spectrum. Far-UV CD shows loss of sec-ondary structure after illumination (33. 4 % signal loss at 206 nm). Thermal unfolding CD studies show that plasminogen retains a native like cooperative transition at ~ 70 °C after UV-illumination. We propose that UVB activation of plasminogen occurs upon photo-cleavage of a functional allosteric disulphide bond, Cys 737 -Cys 765, located in the catalytic domain and in van der Waals contact with Trp 761 (4. 3 Å).

Intermediates and acute toxicity of the photoproducts generated were also studied. Degradation efficiency by heterogeneous photocatalysis with TiO(2) was similar for NXA and FLU, which were completely degraded after 25 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination.</b> Less NXA mineralisation was reached after 80 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination.</b> Photo-Fenton {{degradation of}} both substances was very quick (< 25 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination</b> time), {{and the same}} mineralisation was reached in both cases. The kinetic parameters of the two substances were calculated for comparison of their photocatalytic degradation. In all cases, photocatalytic processes were associated with a reduction in toxicity, as evaluated by Vibrio fischeri bioassay. Furthermore, a sharp decrease in inhibition was observed {{from the beginning of}} the treatment, even when FLU and NXA were still present in the reaction solution (first samples). These results demonstrate that in both photocatalytic processes studied, toxicity decreases significantly, producing a phototreated sample within safe toxicity limits.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of the “steady-state” fluorescence of “aerobic” Anacystis nidulans is variable under prolonged illumination with orange (590 mμ) or blue (440 mμ) light for both normally photosynthesizing and DCMU-poisoned cells. In general, orange light illumination causes an increase of the fluorescence intensity followed by a decrease, while blue light causes an increase until a steady level is reached. Poisoned Anacystis cells show four to eight times larger changes in fluorescence intensity than the normal cells; the detailed time course of fluorescence changes is also different in poisoned and normal cells. When algae are cooled to - 196 °C in light, the light-induced changes in the “steady-state” fluorescence disappear in both types of cells.

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} shows a novel method for hazard {{identification of a}} chemical and UV light on a single cell level with a laser probe beam. The laser probe beam was passed through interface of cell membrane/culture medium of a cultured human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG 2. Deflection of the laser probe beam, which was induced by changes in concentration gradients due to the active materials movement across the cell membrane, was monitored. When a toxic hazard existed, a living cell {{was expected to be}} killed or injured, or cellular behaviors to be changed greatly. Then, the changing deflection signal from the living cell would become unchanged or altered in a different way. This was successfully demonstrated with cytotoxity of UV light and H 2 O 2. Most of the cultured HepG 2 cells showed changing deflection signals after 10 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> of UV-visible light longer than 370 nm, while almost all HepG 2 cells showed unchanged deflection signal after 10 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> of UV-visible light with wavelength longer than 330 nm. The results suggested that UV light between 330 – 370 nm could kill the cells. Additions of H 2 O 2 solution with different concentrations to the cell cultures caused the changing deflection signal from a living cell either unchanged or changed in different trend, suggesting toxicity of H 2 O 2 to the cells. The results from the beam deflection detection agreed well with those obtained by the conventional trypane blue method...|$|E

40|$|The {{xanthophyll}} {{cycle in}} pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Kleine Rheinlanderin) plants {{has been investigated}} in vivo. Control plants were compared with those grown under intermittent light (IML plants). IML plants are particularly characterized {{by the absence of}} nearly all chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins. The rates of de-epoxidation during 30 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination</b> and their dependence on the incident photon flux density (PFD) have been determined. They were very similar in both types of plants, with the exception that IML plants contained, at any PFD, much higher zeaxanthin concentrations in the steady state (reached after about 15 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination)</b> than control plants. This indicates that the amount of convertible violaxanthin under illumination is dependent on the presence of chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins. The epoxidation rate (examined at a PFD of 15 [mu]E m- 2 s- 1, after 15 min of preillumination with different PFDs) showed {{significant differences between the two}} types of plants. It was about 5 -fold slower in IML plants. On the other hand, in both types of plants, the epoxidation rate decreased with increasing PFD during preillumination. Prolonged preillumination at high PFDs resulted in a decrease of the epoxidation rate without a further increase of the zeaxanthin concentration in both continuous light and IML plants. This result argues against a permanent turnover of the xanthophylls under illumination, at least at high PFDs...|$|R

In addition, the potential of continuous agitation of colostrum during illumination to affect viral kill was investigated. This experiment was designed to more closely approximate on-farm use than a previous pilot study performed by the same investigators. Bovine viral diarrhea virus was used as a model for caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus. Goat colostrum containing BVDV was illuminated for 60 min following the addition of either methylene blue (MB) or methylene violet (MV). Four different concentrations of each dye were evaluated. Illumination was performed in a small, portable chesttype freezer equipped on the inside with white fluorescent lights. Some samples were continuously rocked during illumination, while others remained stationary. Virus levels were determined before and after illumination. Immunoglobulin concentrations were determined for time 0 and 60 min. One μM MB reduced virus to undetectable levels following 60 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination.</b> A concentration of 20 μM MV was required to reduce virus levels to zero.

Au@Ag NRs, first being applied for PTT, exhibited excellent stability, cost-effectivity, biocompatibility and tunable NIR absorption.

After SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, more than 15 labelled polypeptides of stromal origin were observed. A polypeptide with an Mr of approx. 70 000 had the highest specific activity of labelling. Both the large and small subunits of the ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase were phosphorylated. The level of phosphorylation of stromal protein was increased by CO 2 fixation in intact chloroplasts. This increase was not observed in the absence of NaHCO 3 or {{in the presence of the}} phosphoribulokinase inhibitor DL-glyceraldehyde. These effects appeared to be largely due to changes in the phosphorylation state of the large and small subunits of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase. Studies with the reconstituted chloroplast system showed that the thylakoid protein kinase(s) played no part in the phosphorylation of stromal protein. The rate and level of phosphorylation of stromal protein was unaffected by the activation state of the thylakoid protein kinase and was unchanged when thylakoids were omitted from the reaction medium.

The {{aim was to}} modify photothrombosis methods thereby producing both a minor stroke (with adjacent mild damage) or a minor recurrent stroke. New methodA minor stroke, as detected using magnetic resonance imaging and histology, was produced using a low intensity {{beam of white light}} with a bright centre, a low dose of Rose Bengal and a short 5 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> of thinned skull. A recurrent minor stroke was produced by repeating the procedure two days later except the cortical mask was positioned 1. 5 mm posteriorly. ResultsThe minor photothrombosis procedure produced a small superficial infarct surrounded by a region of scattered necrosis detected histologically. Marked hyperintensities in diffusion weighted and T 2 images identified the infarct. Peri-infarct regions with modest T 2 increases corresponded to regions of scattered cell death. A recurrent minor photothrombosis produced additional damage in regions with overlapping mild injury. Comparison with existing methodsPrevious photothrombosis methods usually produce large cortical infarcts with little penumbra. The current method produces small infarcts with diffuse mild peri-infarct ischemic injury that can be diagnosed using T 2 imaging. ConclusionsThe modified photothrombotic procedure will produce a minor stroke consisting of a small infarct in a region with marked diffusion and T 2 hyperintensities and a peri-infarct region of selective necrosis with modest T 2 changes.

40|$|Caging of bovine {{haemoglobin}} {{with increasing}} amounts of 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl (NPE) and uncaging after a 366 nm irradiation was examined. Caged and photolysed conjugates were characterised by enzymatic assay of the ABTS oxidation, UV/Vis absorbance, and electrospray mass ionisation. Modification of haemoglobin with 50, 75, and 100 equivalents of 1 -(2 -nitrophenyl) diazoethane led to a progressive decrease of enzymatic activity. Photolysis at 366 nm during 5, 15, and 30 min induced the recovery of {{a part of the}} enzymatic activity. ESI analyses showed that a reversible binding of up to 6 NPE groups per ?-chain and that the removal of most of the photolabile groups occurred rapidly after 5 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination</b> at 366 nm and reached near completion after 15 min. A variable alteration of haemoglobin after labelling could explain that the complete removal of NPE groups did not restore its full oxidative activity...|$|R
40|$|Dark-adapted, single photoreceptors {{isolated}} from the frog retina produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) after about 1 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination</b> with saturating light that we verified by their oxidation of preloaded dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) into the fluorescent rhodamine 123 (RHO). In this preparation we tested the antioxidant effects of vitamin E and of melatonin. Melatonin at picomolar and low nanomolar concentrations {{was determined to be}} 100 times more potent in inhibiting the light-induced oxidative processes than was vitamin E. On the contrary, both compounds exerted potent prooxidant effects at micromolar concentrations that is above the physiological levels of melatonin. This provides evidence that physiological concentrations of melatonin in a living cell may exert protective actions against a natural oxidant stimulus (light). This helps to define the functional role of endogenous melatonin in photoreceptors, which by their physiological characteristics, are among the marked producers of ROS in the organism...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLight-induced {{chlorophyll}} a (Chl a) fluorescence quenching was {{studied in}} light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII). Fluorescence intensity decreased by ca. 20 % {{in the course}} of 20 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> (412 nm, 36 μmol m− 2 s− 1) and was totally reversible within 30 min dark adaptation. The pronounced quenching was observed only in LHCII in an aggregated form and exclusively in the presence of molecular oxygen. Structural rearrangement of LHCII correlated to the quenching was monitored by measuring changes in UV–Visible light absorption spectra, and by measuring Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in the Amide I region of the protein (1600 – 1700 cm− 1). The light-induced structural rearrangement of LHCII was interpreted as a partial disaggregation of the complex based on the decrease in the light scattering signal and the characteristic features observed in the FTIR spectra: the relative increase in the intensity of the band at 1653 cm− 1, corresponding to a protein in the α-helical structure {{at the expense of the}} band centered at 1621 cm− 1, characteristic of aggregated forms. The fact that the light-driven isomerization of the all-trans violaxanthin to the 13 -cis form was not observed under the non-oxygenic conditions coincided with the lack of large-scale conformational reorganization of LHCII. The kinetics of this large-scale structural effect does not correspond to the light-induced fluorescence quenching, in contrast to the kinetics of structural changes in LHCII observable at low oxygen concentrations. Photo-conversion of 5 % of the pool of all-trans violaxanthin to 9 -cis isomer was observed under such conditions. Possible involvement of the violaxanthin isomerization in the process of structural rearrangements and excitation quenching in LHCII is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rotifer resting eggs {{often have}} to endure harsh {{environmental}} conditions during the diapause phase. They are stimulated by light to hatch. In order to study the hatching mechanism, we observed resting eggs and measured their transcriptional expression under different light exposure periods (total darkness, and after 30. min, and 4. h light). By using differential-display reverse transcription PCR (DDRT-PCR), we isolated 80 genes that displayed different expression patterns {{in response to the}} three light treatments: 20 genes were expressed in total darkness, 40 different genes were differentially expressed under 30. min light, and 20 further genes were expressed after 4. h of light. The resting eggs showed no phenotypic differences in embryonic development during the 4. h illumination period. In general, the expression patterns of the analyzed genes in resting eggs were differentially modulated by light exposure time. In total darkness, resting eggs mainly expressed genes encoding cell defense and homeostasis functions. In the 30. <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> group, we found enriched expression of genes encoding fatty acid metabolism-related components, including Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD). Genes encoding cellular and embryonic developmental functions were highly observed in the 30. min-illuminated group but were not observed in the 4. h-illuminated group. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that several transcripts such as encoding V-type H(+) -translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) and Meckelin had prolonged expression levels when exposed to light for 4. h. In the 4. h illuminated group, the RecQ protein-like 5 (RECQL 5) gene was enriched. This RECQL 5 gene may be expressed to protect the developing embryo from continuous light exposure. The data presented in this study indicate that DDRT-PCR-aided gene screening can be helpful to isolate candidate genes involved in the hatching process...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence and the {{dynamics of}} xanthophyll conversion under different actinic light conditions were studied in intact leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana. NPQ induction was investigated during up to 180 <b>min</b> <b>illumination</b> at 450, 900, and 1, 800 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1 (μE) and NPQ relaxation after 5, 30, 90, or 180 min of pre-illumination at the same light intensities. The comparison of wild-type plants with mutants affected either in xanthophyll conversion (npq 1 and npq 2) or PsbS expression (npq 4 and L 17) or lumen acidification (pgr 1) indicated that NPQ states with similar, but not identical characteristics are induced at longer time range (15 – 60 min) in wild-type and mutant plants. In genotypes with an active xanthophyll conversion, {{the dynamics of}} two slowly (10 – 60 min) inducible and relaxing NPQ components {{were found to be}} kinetically correlated with zeaxanthin formation and epoxidation, respectively. However, the extent of NPQ was independent of the amount of zeaxanthin, since higher NPQ values were inducible with increasing actinic light intensities without pronounced changes in the zeaxanthin amount. These data support an indirect role of zeaxanthin in pH-independent NPQ states rather than a specific direct function of zeaxanthin as quencher in long-lasting NPQ processes. Such an indirect function might be related to an allosteric regulation of NPQ processes by zeaxanthin (e. g., through interaction of zeaxanthin at the surface of proteins) or a general photoprotective function of zeaxanthin in the lipid phase of the membrane (e. g., by modulation of the membrane fluidity or by acting as antioxidant). The found concomitant down-regulation of zeaxanthin epoxidation and recovery of photosystem II activity ensures that zeaxanthin is retained in the thylakoid membrane as long as photosystem II activity is inhibited or down-regulated. This regulation supports the view that zeaxanthin can be considered as a kind of light stress memory in chloroplasts, allowing a rapid reactivation of photoprotective NPQ processes in case of recurrent light stress periods...|$|E
40|$|A g S T RA C w We made {{simultaneous}} {{measurements of}} light-induced {{changes in the}} rate of oxygen consumption (QO 2) and transmembrane current of single salamander rod photoreceptors. Since the change of PO 2 was suppressed by 2 mM Amytal, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, we conclude that it is mitochondrial in origin. To identify the cause of the change of QO 2, we measured, in batches of rods, the concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr). After 3 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination,</b> when the QO 2 had decreased ~ 25 %, ATP levels did not change significantly; in contrast, the amount of PCr had decreased ~ 40 %. We conclude that either the light-induced decrease of QO 2 is not caused by an increase in [ATP] or [PCr], or that the light-induced change of [PCr] is highly heterogenous in the rod cell.

40|$|The {{modifications}} {{of the room}} temperature fluorescence spectrum during the photoactivation of the water-splitting system by continuous illumination were investigated in flashed barley leaves. A blue shift of the chlorophyll fluorescence band was detected during the first 2 <b>min</b> of <b>illumination.</b> During this shift, a decrease of the fluorescence intensity around 693 nm could be demonstrated in difference spectra and in second derivative spectra. This decrease is interpreted as a quenching of PS II fluorescence during the photoactivation. A relative fluorescence increase around 672 nm also occurred {{during the same period}} and is thought to reflect rapid light-induced chlorophyll formation. The flashed leaves contained small amounts of photoactive photochlorophyllide which could be removed by a short flash of intense white light given before continuous illumination. The fact that such flash had only weak effect on the 693 nm fluorescence decrease, whereas it strongly reduced the amplitude of the 672 nm fluorescence increase, favours the above interpretations.

40|$|Abstract Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{thin films}} having anatase (1 0 1) crystal {{structure}} were prepared on non-alkali glass substrates by rf (13. 56 MHz) magnetron sput-tering using a TiO 2 ceramic target under various oxygen partial pressures. At a fixed substrate temperature of 400 C and total gas pressure of 1 Pa after 3 h deposition. Effects of oxygen partial {{pressure on the}} structural, surface morphology, and photocatalytic activities of the TiO 2 thin films were investigated. We performed both photoinduced decomposition of methylene blue (MB) and photoinduced hydrophilicity under UV light illumination. The XRD patterns exhibited a broad-hump shape indicating the amorphous structure of TiO 2 thin films. The results showed that when the [O 2 /(Ar? O 2) ] flow rate increased to 50 %, the photoinduced decomposition of MB and photoinduced hydrophilicity were enhanced. The water contact angle after 9 <b>min</b> UV <b>illumination</b> was approximately 4. 5, and the methylene blue (MB) solution decomposition from 12 down to 3. 34 l mol/L for 240 min UV irradiation. ...|$|R
