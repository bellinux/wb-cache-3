40|$|The goal of {{learning}} interventions {{is to prepare}} an individual to acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes that will enable him/her to perform better {{and to be able}} to handle all the challenges posed by the continuous changing world of work. Transfer {{of learning}} to the workplace provides a yardstick to determine whether the goal has been attained or not. This study was conducted to answer the following questions; what is transfer of learning, what constraints have been identified in the existing research on transfer of learning, and what constraining factors prevent <b>management</b> <b>trainees</b> to transfer learning to the workplace in a private sector case study. To answer these questions a mixed research approach (qualitative and quantitative) was used. Triangulation of data was done to ensure reliability. The questionnaire was designed using the Likert rating scale and was used as a quantitative data collection tool for this study. The data was displayed through line and pie graphs for graphical illustrations. The questionnaire was analysed using a hand tabulation data coding table. The questionnaire was distributed to all 34 <b>management</b> <b>trainees</b> and only 17 completed the questionnaires. The qualitative data collection tools consisted of semi-structured and focus group interviews. The literature study pointed out that various researchers identified factors that prevent transfer of learning. The factors are; lack of organisational support, course content that is dissociated from the trainees’ roles and responsibilities in the workplace, trainees’ willingness and readiness. The empirical research findings revealed that organisational factors such as lack of coaching, feedback, mentoring as well as creating an opportunity for trainees to implement the skills and knowledge play a leading role while training and learner factors play a contributing role as constraints to transfer of learning to the workplace.
