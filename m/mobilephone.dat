Emergency services, tracking, navigation, advertisingand social networking are examples of them. As the majority of today’s <b>mobilephones</b> are equipped with GPS receivers, GPS positioning has become one ofthe primary methods for obtaining users’ location. Moreover, GPS providesaccurate time service and many applications specially for time synchronizationare relying on GPS. Despite the good accuracy it provides, security is notconsidered from scratch in civilian GPS and its signals are weak, vulnerable tospoofing and prone to jamming. As it has become a more and more valuableresource, malicious agents have also become keener to identify and abuse theweaknesses in order to interrupt users or commit fraud. That is why therehave been continuous alerts about insecurity in civilian GPS in scholarly andacademic publications. A considerable amount of research has been conductedto tackle the problem of insecurity in GPS, but proposed solutions need eitherfundamental changes in GPS signal structure or more sophisticated types ofreceivers. As changes in GPS signal structure need time, money and politicalwill, this work works on a method to detect spoofing of GPS signals based onthe current GPS signal structure and receivers on mobile phones. We crosscheckpositioning and time information by comparing it with other sourcesof information. GPS positioning data are compared with the user’s positionderived from Wi-Fi positioning and cell positioning and the distance betweenthose is shown to the user.

The aim of this research is tocreate {{a better understanding of how}} different parts of theSwedish construction industry make use of IT and how theyjustify their investments in IT. The work has been carried outusing surveys. Postal questionnaires as well as interviews havebeen used. The research project started with the design anddevelopment of a questionnaire, which has been used twice inSweden. The same questionnaire has also been used in Denmarkand Finland on the same occasions. The results of the postalsurveys have, to some extent, been compared with similarsurveys regarding other industries in Sweden, as well as theconstruction industries in other countries. The findings fromthe postal surveys have also been used as a basis for aninterview study with twelve companies in the Swedishconstruction industry, with the purpose of explaining theexisting level of IT use. The conclusions that were reachedwere that the access to IT is widespread in the industry, andthat the use is concentrated in the areas of: administration,communication and design. There is a lack of use and investmentin advanced systems such as product models, virtual reality andelectronic trading. The contractors use IT to the least extentin the industry.

40|$|Organic {{materials}} as polymers and molecular crystals {{are very important}} in the modern society. We can find them in packaging processes or in fondamental components of electronic devices like TV, computers, <b>mobilephones</b> and so on. They are generally named plastics due to the properties which make them easily modeled. Indeed the mechanical, optical or conductive properties of organic materials can be tuned modifing their chemical components. In the last 30 years organic compounds have attracted strong attention because they are lighter, more flexible and less expensive than inorganic materials. This {{does not mean that}} plastics can substitute inorganic compounds like silicon. The organic conductors/semiconductors in fact can be used in complementary applications where their peculiar properties, like machanical flexibility, low cost, ease of fabrication and large area applicability are relevant. Charge transport in organic materials is of enormous interest. In 1963 Weiss et al. reported high conductivity in iodine-doped oxidized polypyrrole. This discovery together with the one made by Shirakawa et al. in 1977 marks the birth of the Organic electronics. In fact in 1977 Shirakawa et al. showed that the conductivity in polyacetylene increases several orders of magnitude in presence of dopants like halogens. Shirakawa, MacDiarmid, Heeger received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery. There are many branches of the research and development where organic materials are crucial: Flexible displays, electronic papers and organic solar cells, Organic Field Eeffct Transistors (OFET), and Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED). Recently great interest has been devoted to organics also for thermoelectric applications. The present thesis is concentrated on organic molecular crystals. Among them I present the Perilene Diimide family which has been recently recognized of great importance as air stable n-type semiconductor. The high performance in electron transport for such materials can be ascribed both to high electron affinity and low energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals to facilitate electron injection from the contacts, and the formation of π − π molecular stacking, which enhances electron mobility due to orbital coupling. In this field it is thus of primary importance to investigate theoretically the relationships between structural, electronic and optical properties of the chosen organic semiconductors, to determine the conditions for optimal charge transport in solid state devices. In {{the first part of the}} thesis I start presenting the state of art of molecular crystal: properties, fabrication and the application in OFET. Indeed this application is also useful to study the fundamental physics behind the charge transport. As I said I show the properties of the PDIF-CN 2 molecular crystal. The main part of the work is the analysis of a layer of PDIF-CN 2 on a silicon surface. We have studied which would be the best configuration of the silicon surface to simulate an epitaxial growth. After that we have studied the electronic properties of the system Silicon/PDIF-CN 2. We also applied an electric field to simulate the gate potential of an OFET. To simulate our systems I used two different ab-initio codes: Quantum ESPRESSO, CRYSTAL 09. They implement the Density functional theory (DFT), a fundamental theory to solve many-body problem. In the thesis I explain the theoretical framework of the DFT and the main characteristics of the codes...|$|R
