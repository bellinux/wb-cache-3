Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{night fell}} on August 13, some protesters threw {{projectiles}} at police including Molotov cocktails, and police launched {{tear gas and}} smoke bombs. While police were clearing a McDonald's restaurant, The Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and The Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly were arrested. Officers reportedly asked them to leave first, gave them a 45-second countdown {{when they were not}} moving fast enough, and ultimately resorted to more forceful measures to remove people from the McDonald's. [...] "Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door they were asking <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of," [...] Lowery said. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, issued a statement, saying [...] "there was absolutely no justification for Wesley Lowery's arrest," [...] and that the police behavior [...] "was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the {{following}} season in 1979, Gwynn {{still had not}} heard from Aztecs baseball coach Jim Dietz about joining the team after the basketball season. However, an opportunity arose after two outfielders riding bicycles were struck by an automobile and injured, and Dietz {{was in need of}} replacements. Freshman shortstop Bobby Meacham, who played against Gwynn in high school, convinced the coach to give Gwynn a chance. Dietz had never seen Gwynn play, but contacted him mostly because he trusted Meacham. Vezie by then had been fired, and his successor, Smokey Gaines, allowed Gwynn to play baseball. Were it not for the accident, Gwynn doubted he would have ever played baseball with SDSU. [...] "Knowing what I now do about Coach Dietz ... e's too loyal to his athletes to have allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> over after basketball season and join the team." [...] said Gwynn.|$|E

2500|$|Brando's next film, Julius Caesar (1953), {{received}} {{highly favorable}} reviews. Brando portrayed Mark Antony. While most acknowledged Brando's talent, some critics felt Brando's [...] "mumbling" [...] and other idiosyncrasies betrayed {{a lack of}} acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and co-starring British stage actor John Gielgud, Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony's noted [...] "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." [...] speech. Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined. In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, [...] "Marlon's autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, 'for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine'—yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect." [...] Kanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented, [...] "Christ! It was like a furnace door opening—the heat came off the screen. I don't know another actor who could do that." [...] During the filming of Julius Caesar, Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of [...] "subversives" [...] to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in On The Waterfront. [...] "None of us is perfect," [...] he later wrote in his memoir, [...] "and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself." ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter aims {{to explore}} the sensuous {{experience}} of walking between sites of the city which pull the viewer into different historical and affective spaces. Can a smell be a monument? Are the enveloping tons of particulates poisoning city dwellers an atomised monument to lack of foresight? When the air is so thick with dust you can taste it, is this a cloud monument parallel to the concrete poured and the rubble pounded? <b>To</b> <b>walk</b> is <b>to</b> be naked to the surfaces of the world, the holes of the body invaded, sound, sight, taste, smell, all without the filter of screen, of glass. <b>Walk</b> <b>to</b> the Park, the trees breathe into <b>me,</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the River, it flows <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Canada, <b>walk</b> past the Alaska works, seals made into hats. I work in the abandoned church, the stink of dead pigeons and a gloomy light. Give it the flickering life of a film, local men push over walls, building the flats I live in now, monuments to the present future...|$|R
