500|$|During a {{sentencing}} hearing {{related to}} the 2001 shoplifting incident (see below), Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, referred to her work with the Polly Klaas Foundation and other charitable causes. In response, Deputy District Attorney Ann Rundle said: [...] "What's offensive to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> trot out {{the body of a}} dead child." [...] Ryder was visibly upset at the accusation and Rundle was admonished by the judge. Outside the courthouse, Polly's father Marc Klaas defended Ryder and expressed outrage at the prosecutor's comments.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year Hawke received the Michael Mendelson Award for Outstanding Commitment to the Theater. In {{his acceptance speech}} Hawke said [...] "I don't know why they're honoring me. I think the real reason they are honoring <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> help {{raise money for the}} theater company. Whenever the economy gets hit hard, one of the first thing [...] to go is people's giving, and last on that list of things people give to is the arts because they feel it's not essential. I guess I'm here to remind people that the arts are essential to our mental health as a country." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to M. Hunter Hayes, Self {{has given}} his reason for writing as follows: [...] "I don't write fiction {{for people to}} {{identify}} with and I don't write {{a picture of the}} world they can recognise. I write to astonish people." [...] "What excites <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> disturb the reader's fundamental assumptions. I want to make them feel that certain categories within which they are used to perceiving the world are unstable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1957, Presley had {{to defend}} himself from claims of being a racist: he was alleged to have said: [...] "The only thing Negro people can do for <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] The singer always denied saying, or ever wanting to say, such a racist remark. Jet magazine, run by and for African-Americans, {{subsequently}} investigated the story and found no basis to the claim. However, the Jet journalist did find plenty of testimony that Presley judged people [...] "regardless of race, color or creed." ...|$|E
2500|$|What {{especially}} pleases <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see the interwoven themes, the fuguelike {{relationships of}} images that exactly replay the way Dune took shape. As in an Escher lithograph, I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience-the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to perform, it must tangle {{itself in a}} web of predestination. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like a koan, a Zen mind breaker. It's like the Cretan Epimenides saying, [...] "All Cretans are liars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gustav first intervened {{actively}} in politics during the December Crisis (1768), when he compelled the dominant Cap faction, which mainly represented {{the interests of}} the peasantry and clergy, to summon an extraordinary diet from which he hoped for the reform of the constitution in way that would increase the power of the crown. But the victorious Hat party, which mainly represented {{the interests of the}} aristocracy and military establishment, refused to redeem the pledges that they had given before the previous elections. [...] "That we should have lost the constitutional battle does not distress us so much", wrote Gustav, in the bitterness of his heart; [...] "but what does dismay <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> see my poor nation so sunk in corruption as to place its own felicity in absolute anarchy." ...|$|E

Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, [...] "as far as I am concerned, Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know". His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out [...] "Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing", a playful take on [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". He explained: [...] "It's light-hearted, joyful and fun... At my age, {{the most important thing for}} <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy. I do not know how long I am going to be around, so every day is a celebration, and I want to share it with my fans." ...|$|E
