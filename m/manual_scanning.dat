40|$|Hand-held optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) imaging probes offer {{flexibility to}} image sites that are otherwise challenging to access. While the majority of hand-held imaging probes utilize galvanometer- or MEMS-scanning mirrors to transversely scan the imaging beam, these probes are commonly limited to lateral fields-of-view (FOV) {{of only a few}} millimeters. The use of a freehand manually scanned probe can significantly increase the lateral FOV. However, using the traditional fixed-rate triggering scheme for data acquisition in a manually scanned probe results in imaging artifacts due to variations in the scan velocity of the imaging probe. These artifacts result in a structurally inaccurate image of the sample. In this paper, we present a sensor-based <b>manual</b> <b>scanning</b> technique for OCT imaging, where real-time feedback from an optical motion sensor is used to trigger data acquisition. This technique is able to circumvent the problem of motion artifacts during <b>manual</b> <b>scanning</b> by adaptively altering the trigger rate based on the instantaneous scan velocity, enabling OCT imaging over a large lateral FOV. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by imaging several biological and nonbiological samples...|$|E

A phased array is a multi-element piezo-electric device whose elements are individually excited by electric pulses at programmed delay times [1].

One {{of the advantages}} of using phased arrays in NDE applications over conventional ultrasonic transducers is their great maneuverability of the ultrasonic beam, i. e., dynamic beam steering and focusing.

40|$|A method {{based on}} {{position}} tracking to reconstruct images for a manual-scanning {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) probe is proposed and implemented.

The tracking accuracy of the system was characterized to be about 6 μm along two axes and 19 μm along the third. A phantom target was used to validate the method.

40|$|A {{composite}} fuselage aircraft {{forward section}} was inspected with flash thermography. The fuselage section is 24 {{feet long and}} approximately 8 feet in diameter. The structure is primarily configured with a composite sandwich structure of carbon fiber face sheets with a Nomex(Trademark) honeycomb core. The outer surface area was inspected. The thermal data consisted of 477 data sets totaling in size of over 227 Gigabytes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to process the data sets for substructure and defect detection. A fixed eigenvector approach using a global covariance matrix was used and compared to a varying eigenvector approach. The fixed eigenvector approach was demonstrated to be a practical analysis method for the detection and interpretation of various defects such as paint thickness variation, possible water intrusion damage, and delamination damage.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{reports on}} a {{methodology}} for complete automation {{of the process of}} scanning the surface of an unknown object through the utilization of optical range sensors. An incremental model representing object surface and workspace occupancy is used to de®ne an optimization strategy for selecting the best scanning viewpoints and generate adaptive collision-free scanning trajectories. The optimization strategy proposed attempts to select the viewpoints that maximize the knowledge of the object taking into account the status of the current model and the constraints associated with the range sensor and positioning system. One of the novel aspects of this work is the fact that viewpoint selection and scanning path de®nition are performed automatically {{on the basis of a}} simple volumetric model in situations where potential collisions may arise. The ability to control the quality of acquired data and the reduction in global scanning trajectories when compared with <b>manual</b> <b>scanning</b> operations are other important aspects.
