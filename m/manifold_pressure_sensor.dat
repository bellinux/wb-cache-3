Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open loop systems have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since open loop systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature. For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread.|$|E

40|$|Many model based {{solutions}} to diagnosis problems in SIengines {{have been discussed}} in literature. However most presented methods are useful only for a specic class of faults. Here a systematic and more general method is presented. With this method, {{which is based on}} a structure of hypothesis tests, it is possible to diagnose a large variety of dierent types of faults. The method is applied to the diagnosis of sensor-faults and leakage in the air-intake system of an SI-engine. The features of the method are demonstrated by using experiments on a real SI-engine.

40|$|The {{application}} of a new method for fault diagnosis in an automotive diesel engine is presented. Two common types of fault are investigated: (i) sensor fault, caused by a bias in the inlet <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> and (ii) process fault, caused by small air leaks in the inlet manifold plenum chamber. Such faults may lead to increased emission levels which, if left undetected, can eventually degrade engine performance. A diagnostic model using a variant of auto-associative neural networks (AANN), which has a unique architecture which shows great potential for fault diagnosis, is investigated. This new variant uses a reduced set of original data for the input-target network and is denoted as a generalized serial T 2 T (GST 2 T) network. The proposed GST 2 T model is experimentally validated using data from a real engine embedded in a chassis dynamometer at a test-cell facility. It is demonstrated that using just one diagnostic model, {{the different types of}} common faults mentioned above can be accurately detected and diagnosed. This new GST 2 T network constitutes a nonlinear extension of linear principal component analysis. ...|$|E

A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (MAF sensor) to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a MAF sensor on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} strategies, such as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI), {{have been}} identified as one method to achieve future emissions and fuel economy regulations for diesel engines. These advanced combustion strategies require precise inputs to the combustion process to maintain stable combustion, maximize fuel efficiency, and minimize emissions. Given that the inputs to the combustion process can be considered outputs of the gas exchange process, an accurate understanding of the dynamics of the gas exchange process is critical to accurate control of the combustion process. ^ The work presented in this thesis focuses on modeling for estimation and the estimation of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) flow. In the process of developing a candidate estimation strategy for the EGR flow, extensive efforts were focused on the development of a physically-based, control-oriented, gas exchange model; specifically, the development of an exhaust enthalpy model for application in the gas exchange model. The exhaust enthalpy model is utilized to determine the temperature of gas flow out of the cylinder. This is accomplished by first determining the conditions in the cylinder when the intake valve close (IVC) then assuming a polytropic compression process to top dead center (TDC). To maintain simplicity in the model, fuel injection is neglected, and it is assumed that combustion begins at TDC in a constant pressure process until the end of combustion (EOC). Upon completion of combustion, the expansion process is modeled as a polytropic expansion process until the exhaust valves open (EVO). The proposed model for exhaust gas enthalpy was extensively experimentally validated against 193 data points and is shown to accurately predict the exhaust gas temperature, generally well within 10 % error. ^ Ultimately, the gas exchange model, including the exhaust gas enthalpy model, was utilized in the development of an estimation strategy for EGR flow. The estimation strategy utilizes the exhaust manifold pressure state equation and feedback from the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> as well as models of the EGR flow, charge flow, and turbine flow to estimate the EGR flow. Preliminary validation of the estimator has been accomplished utilizing both the gas exchange model and GT-POWER simulations, with the results demonstrating that with accurate models for charge flow and turbine flow, the estimator can accurately predict the EGR flow. ...|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature <b>sensor,</b> <b>manifold</b> absolute <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor,</b> throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|R

Based on the results found in 20 runs, the second variant of the hybrid algorithm yields a better network performance than the first variant of hybrid algorithm, LM, LM with BR and PSO by estimating the MAP closely to the simulated MAP values.
