Thus, a member will lend' money to other members through his regular <b>monthly</b> <b>contributions.</b> After having received the lump sum amount when it is his turn (i.e. 'borrow' from the group), he then pays back the amount in regular/further <b>monthly</b> <b>contributions.</b> This explains the name rotating savings and credit associations' for such groups.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is twofold: first we calculate, under certain scenarios, the final total accumulation of a representative individual who invests a certain amount of funds per month during a long investment horizon of say 30 or 40 years. Second, we evaluate the performance of such an investment plan of defined <b>monthly</b> <b>contributions.</b> This evaluation is based on a benefit target and working backwards we compute the necessary <b>monthly</b> <b>contributions.</b> In our calculations we use actual monthly returns of the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 Index instead of averages obtained from a large sample. We calculate that accumulations of gradual investments over 30 or 40 years are skewed to the right and we also compute the probability that a given percentage of contributions will be sufficient to finance certain retirement benefits...|$|R
40|$|On Wikipedia, {{the largest}} online encyclopedia, editors who {{contribute}} to the same articles and exchange comments on articles' talk pages work in collaborative manner engaging in communication about their work. Thus they {{can be considered as}} peers who are likely to influence each other. In this article, I examine whether the activity of these peers, measured by the average amount of peer contributions or by the number of peers, yields spillovers to the amount of individual contributions. The partially overlapping group structure allows to identify peer effects and to use the number of the indirect peers as an instrument for the activity and the number of direct peers. The results show that, while controlling for observable editor and peer characteristics, an increase in the <b>monthly</b> average peer <b>contribution</b> by 1 per cent increases the amount of individual <b>monthly</b> <b>contributions</b> to Wikipedia (among individuals that contribute to Wikipedia every month) by about 0. 44 per cent.
