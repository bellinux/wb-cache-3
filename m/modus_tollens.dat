40|$|Argumentative thought {{experiments}} are structurally conditional clauses. They can hence be formalized {{by means of}} the principle of modus ponendo ponens, as well as of <b>modus</b> tollendo <b>tollens.</b> In contrast to the practice in formal logic, exponents of argumentative thought experiments claim that the logical validity of a conclusion drawn within the framework of a particular conditional argument also holds beyond the particular conditional in question. In this paper, I articulate the criticism that this claim is wrong by arguing that the counterfactual scenario sets itself the most determinant premise. If the counterfactual scenario sets the initial conditional premise of the argument, then its true conclusion holds only as a counterfactual truth. The present paper illustrates this criticism using Frank Jackson’s thought experiment, the so-called knowledge argument, as a concrete example...|$|R

Experiment 1 showed that when participants reason {{about whether a}} tip or warning could be true in different situations, their judgments correspond to a biconditional or conditional interpretation on {{about half of all}} trials, but to an enabling or tautology interpretation on many others. Experiment 2 showed that participants make few <b>modus</b> ponens and <b>tollens</b> inferences from tips and warnings, and more modus ponens inferences from tips than warnings.

40|$|The Kathāvatthu (Kv.) {{is one of}} {{the seven}} works which make up the Abhidhamma-piţaka, and it is the work dealing with debate which begins with {{questions}} and answers. Its logicalness has hitherto attracted scholars'attention for the reason that it has formal consistency in its lines of argument. In considering especially the logic (not the science but the laws of thought for constructing argument forms) of the Kv., this paper focusses on the contrasting contents of the studies by St. Schayer and J (1). M. Bocheński. First, a basic line of argument is considered. Here the following facts are shown: (i) the part named anuloma-pañcaka is the most fundamental regarding form; and (ii) it is difficult to discover logical significance in most of the basic lines of argument because many parts can be said to be redundant and {{do not seem to be}} arranged with logical necessity. Next, the focal point is to consider the logic of the anuloma-pañcaka. According to S. Z. Aung, the way of thinking which is in accord with the mixed hypothetical syllogism denying the consequent (<b>modus</b> tollendo <b>tollens)</b> is found in the anuloma-pañcaka. Schayer points out that two laws of propositional logic (the definition of implication and the law of contraposition) exist in the same part, and this makes the logic of the Kv. correspond to the logic seen in the studies of the Stoics of ancient Greece. Schayer, however, does not accept Aung's analysis using terminal variables, and maintains that propositional variables should be used, considering the logic of the Kv. to be formalized per proposition. Bocheński, on the contrary, in accordance with his view that the logic of the Kv. is formalized per term, asserts that terminal variables should be used, and that the logic of the Kv. is correspondent to that of dialectics in the pre-Aristotelian period of ancient Greece. The present writer judges Bocheński's opinion to be correct about the placing of the logic of the Kv. in the developmental stages of Greek logic. It is not, however, the case that, following his assertion, the above correspondence is accepted within the framework of terminal logic. The acceptance is based on various similarities, one of which is that both the Kv. and the dialectics of the pre-Aristotelian period treat of the logical relationship between propositions. On the other hand, the present writer supports Schayer regarding his interpretation of the logic of the Kv., and considers it to be formalized per proposition. The main reasons are as follows: (i) cases with no fixed subject are often found in the Kv.; (ii) the quantity of the hypothetical proposition is not made into a problem; (iii) truth or falsity is predicated not of terms but of propositions; and (iv) the logical relationship is between propositions and not terms. Therefore, it can be said that a method of argument conforming to the laws of propositional logic is being used in the Kv [...] However, based on several facts, this paper judges that the science of propositional logic did not exist in the period when the Kv. was composed, just as it did not exist in the pre-Aristotelian period of ancient Greece...|$|R

50|$|Most {{behavioral}} {{experiments on}} conditionals in {{the psychology of}} reasoning {{have been carried out}} with indicative conditionals, causal conditionals, and counterfactual conditionals. People readily make the modus ponens inference, that is, given if A then B, and given A, they conclude B, but only about half of participants in experiments make the <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> inference, that is, given if A then B, and given not-B, only about half of participants conclude not-A, the remainder say that nothing follows (Evans et al., 1993). When participants are given counterfactual conditionals, they make both the modus ponens and the <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> inferences (Byrne, 2005).|$|E

5000|$|Modus ponendo tollens (Latin: [...] "mode that by affirming, denies") {{is a valid}} rule of {{inference}} for propositional logic, sometimes abbreviated MPT. It {{is closely}} related to modus ponens and <b>modus</b> <b>tollens.</b> It is usually described as having the form: ...|$|E

50|$|Attention {{is given}} to {{argument}} and sentence form, because form is what makes an argument valid or cogent.

5000|$|In propositional logic, <b>modus</b> <b>tollens</b> (or modus tollendo tollens {{and also}} denying the consequent) (Latin for [...] "the way that denies by denying") {{is a valid}} {{argument}} form and a rule of inference.
