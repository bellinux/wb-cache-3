40|$|Political {{parties as}} {{multi-level}} organizations {{have become a}} popular subject for research in recent years (see e. g Thorlakson 2009; Allern ja Saglie 2010; Fabre 2011; Reiser ja Vetter 2011). They are no more exclusively unitary collective actors. Most of them operate {{at the same time}} on several power levels – the national level, regional and local level and, within the European Union, the European level as well. (Allern and Saglie 2010, 2). Richard S. Katz has said: „In many cases (/ [...] . /), however, to treat parties as unitary actors would be to dismiss an important – some cases perhaps even the most important – aspect of politics“ (Katz 2005, 87). Secondly, the widespread local presence of parties shows their organizational strength, which is important for democratic consolidation (Tavits 2011). Most of the pointed analyses are in the light of cartel party theory, which states that the relationships between different party faces are more stratarchical than hierarchical. Each face of the party is becoming increasingly autonomous of the others. (Mair 1994, 17) In Estonia we still lack the knowledge about the territorial structure of parties – organizational units, their role and power relationship. The aim of this bachelor’s thesis is to fill the gap by analysing the role of county and municipal party branches in Estonian party structure and comparing its similarity with particular party model. To achieve the purpose of this work I have set the following research tasks: 1) to propose an analytical framework which is suitable for the Estonian case; 2) to describe the party's organizational structure in different party models by using theoretical literature and to define the main functions among the sub-national party branches within different party types and the power relationship with party elite; 3) to analyse party statutes; 4) to formulate questions and interview party representatives to confirm and specify the results of the party statutes analysis; 5) to make conclusions and consider possible links with certain party models. Reviewing existing literature, analysing party statutes and the data collected by interviews I found that in Estonia county and municipality party branches are chiefly the agents of national party, carrying out party policy at the local level. County party branches co-ordinate the activities of municipal party branches and also function as information channels between the central office of the party and the municipal party branches. Municipal party branches deal with local questions. In particular, the functions of county and municipal party branches are connected with <b>member</b> <b>administration,</b> local elections, nominating candidates to parliamentary elections and collecting the opinions of members. There are no significant differences between parties. The organizational structure is starting to equalize. The activities of county and municipal party branches are important for parties. Looking at the roles of county and municipal party branches we can find links with all the mentioned party types (mass party, catch-all party, cartel party and modern elite party). The roles of county and municipal party branches in Estonia are a combination of these models. It {{can be explained by the}} impact of Estonian territorial structure...|$|E
40|$|In seeking novel ways to {{addressing}} global climate change, renewable energy producing cooperatives (REPCs) can potentially generate several benefits {{with regard to}} a decentralized energy transition. RECPs represent a direct citizen participation model to realize local renewable energy (RE) projects with a long-term return rate to recover the initial investments, as {{the main focus of}} REPCs lies on sufficing member utility rather than increasing short-term shareholder value. They enable local ownership and create regional added-value. REPCs democratic structure and low entrance fee additionally allow for broad citizen participation, independent of income. Due to its dependency on durable collective action in the founding process and the later management of the REPC, many interested individuals or interest groups face the problem that other individuals are often willing to participate in terms of financially investing in the local REPCs and their projects, but only few are willing to also establish and manage the REPC on a voluntary basis in its early development. An additional hurdle is the knowledge that is required from different fields of expertise (e. g. business administration). However, intermediary organizations, like cooperative associations, market actors and local government agencies that support the founding process and the foster the further development of REPCs can potentially help to overcome this issue. Thus far, there is only little scientific research on this issue. This thesis started from the identified the need to generate theoretical and practical insights {{on the role of the}} support by intermediate organizations in order to understand the demands of RECPs in the founding process and their further development and improve support. The main research objective was to identify and analyze the impact of specific forms of support provided by intermediary organizations on the establishment and on the durable collective action capacity of REPCs. This objective is fulfilled by firstly establishing a theoretical framework that includes forms of support of intermediary organizations as well as the founding process and the durable collective action capacity of REPCs. The founding process is conceptualized as a project with four phases and respective tasks that need to be fulfilled by the founding members. The durable collective action capacity of REPCs is determined by the management board‘s and other active members’ (1) available human capital; (2) intrinsic motivation (3) and extrinsic motivation. Support by intermediary organizations encompasses (1) financial support; (2) advocacy support; (3) networking or alliance-building support; and (4) provision of research and informational resources. The framework is subsequently applied to explore the joint support concept of the renewable energy cooperative association Verband der Bürger Energiegenossenschaften Baden-Württemberg (VBBW) and the energy provider EnBW Regional AG for interest groups and REPCs in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany. This is done via a comparative case study, which includes two sample cases of RECPs that received support by VBBW and EnBW and two control cases of RECPs without such support. The data for the case study included semi-structured interviews with active members from the selected sample and control cases, respectively, extensive online research and a survey that was send out to larger, according to selection criteria chosen, sample and control groups. 	 The analysis revealed specific forms of support that are useful to very useful for interest groups in the founding process and that strengthen the durable collective action capacity of REPCs. Useful support in the founding process include (1) the provision of research and information in form of an informational package that comprise all the relevant documents in the founding process (e. g. necessary legal documents, sample code of conducts and business plans); (2) the provision of advocacy support in terms of promoting the founding event through informational flyers and newspaper ads as well as staff provision to host the founding event; (3) alliance-building and networking support through involving the local municipality in the REPC as an additional partner that provides the REPC with rooftops free-of-charge or for a low rent. Useful support to foster the durable collective action capacity include (1) the provision of research and information in the form of seminars on the roles and tasks of the management and advisory board and a <b>member</b> <b>administration</b> software that facilitates the management of the REPC; (2) the provision of networking and alliance-building support through an institutionalized meeting structure, where members can frequently exchange knowledge and experiences with other VBBW REPCs in annual and regional network meetings organized by the VBBW. With regard to the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of the REPCs’ active members no influence of the support could be discerned. Additionally, it was noteworthy that especially the VBBW RECPs realized much less projects since the amendment of the EEG in 2012, which reduced the profitability of this business model...|$|E
