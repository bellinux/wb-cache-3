5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man {{of energy and}} enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line strikes <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> serious blemish {{on a beautiful}} poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or {{that it is a}} statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

25|$|Some of my {{critics have}} painted <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{kind of moral}} leper, {{comparing}} me to those who deny that the Jewish Holocaust happened, that six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.

500|$|The most {{commonly}} criticized {{element of the}} film is its ending.
