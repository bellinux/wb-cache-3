5|$|The Ninety-five Theses or Disputation on the Power of Indulgences are {{a list of}} propositions for an {{academic}} disputation written in 1517 by Martin Luther, professor of <b>moral</b> <b>theology</b> at the University of Wittenberg, Germany, that started the Reformation, a schism in the Catholic Church which profoundly changed Europe. They advance Luther's positions against {{what he saw as}} abusive in the practice of clergy selling plenary indulgences, which were certificates believed to reduce the temporal punishment for sins committed by the purchasers or their loved ones in purgatory. In the Theses, Luther claimed that the repentance required by Christ in order for sins to be forgiven involves inner spiritual repentance rather than merely external sacramental confession. He argued that indulgences led Christians to avoid true repentance and sorrow for sin, believing that they could forgo it by purchasing an indulgence. They also, according to Luther, discouraged Christians from giving to the poor and performing other acts of mercy, believing that indulgence certificates were more spiritually valuable. Though Luther claimed that his positions on indulgences accorded with those of the Pope, the Theses challenge a fourteenth-century papal bull stating that the pope could use the treasury of merit and the good deeds of past saints to forgive temporal punishment for sins. The Theses are framed as propositions to be argued in debate rather than necessarily representing Luther's opinions, but Luther later clarified his views in the Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences.|$|E

In the medieval and early modern period, the field is indebted to Islamic scholarship such as Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi (who wrote the Conduct of a Physician, the first book dedicated to medical ethics), Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and Muhammad ibn Zakariya ar-Razi (known as Rhazes in the West), Jewish thinkers such as Maimonides, Roman Catholic scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, and the case-oriented analysis (casuistry) of Catholic <b>moral</b> <b>theology.</b> These intellectual traditions continue in Catholic, Islamic and Jewish medical ethics.|$|E

Since 1689, the cloister and interior garden became the place where classes in rhetoric and Latin were held (these classes were famous in the archipelago for being open to all interested, regardless of their social condition). The curriculum included: a first and second class in latin; rhetoric (then referred to as aula prima (first class); and <b>moral</b> <b>theology.</b> In 1791, Queen Maria I of Portugal, indicated her interest in establishing a chair in grammar at the convent, and on 23 March 1792, she established the appropriate stipend to support these classes.

500|$|Holmes {{wrote in}} the second preface to Elsie Venner, his first novel, that his aim in writing the work was [...] "to test the {{doctrine}} of 'original sin' and human responsibility for the distorted violation coming under that technical denomination". He also stated his belief that [...] "a grave scientific doctrine may be detected lying beneath some of the delineations of character" [...] throughout all fiction. Deeming the work a [...] "psychological romance", he employed a romantic narrative in order to describe <b>moral</b> <b>theology</b> from a scientific perspective. This means of expression is also present in his two other novels, in which Holmes uses medical or psychological dilemmas to further the story's dramatic plot.|$|E
500|$|Martin Luther, {{professor}} of <b>moral</b> <b>theology</b> at the University of Wittenberg and town preacher, wrote the Ninety-five Theses against the contemporary {{practice of the}} church with respect to indulgences. In the Catholic Church, practically the only Christian church in Western Europe at the time, indulgences {{are part of the}} economy of salvation. In this system, when Christians sin and confess, they are forgiven and will no longer receive eternal punishment in hell, but may still be liable to temporal punishment. This punishment could be satisfied by the penitent's performing works of mercy. If the temporal punishment is not satisfied during life, it would need to be satisfied in purgatory. With an indulgence (which may be translated [...] "kindness"), this temporal punishment could be lessened. Under abuses of the system of indulgences, clergy benefited by selling indulgences and the pope gave official sanction in exchange for a fee.|$|E
