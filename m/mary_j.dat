5|$|Amtrak {{used to run}} its trains through Cleveland Union Terminal (now Tower City Center), {{which was}} built in 1928 and served as the main {{terminal}} for the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit, and in 1955, the crosstown Red Line. By 1976, because of Cleveland Union Terminal's high rent, the massive size of the facility, {{and the need to}} switch to electric locomotives to access its enclosed platforms, Amtrak decided to construct a smaller station. Lakefront Station was built in 1976–1977 and opened for service in 1977 to provide service for the Lake Shore Limited, which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975. The station officially opened on June 29, 1977, with the formal dedication occurring on July 12. According to Amtrak's employee magazine, a crowd of more than 300 gathered for the dedication of the $552,000 depot. Speakers included <b>Mary</b> <b>J.</b> Head, vice chairman of the Amtrak Board of Directors, and Cleveland Mayor Ralph J. Perk. Following the dedication ceremony, attendees were invited to tour the facility and enjoy cake and coffee.|$|E

5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of <b>Mary</b> <b>J.</b> Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E
