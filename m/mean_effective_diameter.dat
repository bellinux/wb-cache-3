40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different reconstruction kernels on the semi-automated segmentation of liver lesions in MDCT. Materials and Methods: A total 62 liver lesions were measured by three independent radiologists with the semi-automated segmentation software Oncology-Prototype (Fraunhofer MEVIS, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) using MDCT datasets (3 -mm slice thickness, 2 -mm increment) reconstructed with standard, soft and detailed kernels (Philips B, A and D). To ensure objective measurements, only lesions with satisfactory initial segmentation were included, and manual correction was not used. The <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> and volume were recorded for each lesion. Segmentation in the soft and detailed kernel datasets was performed by copying the initial seed's position from the standard kernel dataset. Results: The <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> lesion <b>diameter</b> was 19. 9 ± 9. 7 mm using the standard kernel. Comparing the three kernels, {{no significant differences were}} found. The mean d ifference was 1 % ± 6 % for the standard kernel compared to the soft kernel, 3 % ± 13 % for the standard kernel vs. the detailed kernel and 2 % ± 9 % for the soft kernel compared to the detailed kernel. The intra-class correlation coefficients were > 0. 96 in all cases.

The glass plates are 610 mm long and 350 mm high. Three different values of the normal separation distance between them were investigated: 25. 4 mm, 38. 1 mm, and 50. 8 mm. For each of these separation distances, the following three values (nominal) of the mass flow rate per unit width were considered: 0. 81 kg/s-m, 1. 85 kg/s-m, and 3. 33 kg/s-m. The granular material used in this work consists of slightly polydisperse, almost spherical, ceramic (zirconium silicate) beads: <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> of 1. 59 mm and mass density of 4071 kg/m 3. For these ranges of dimensional parameters, statistically-steady fully developed flows were established in a reliable and repeatable manner.

Image processing and a commercial PTV software package (DiaTrackPro 2. 3) were used to obtain the particle trajectories. Special routines were written in Matlab to obtain the corresponding instantaneous and ensemble-averaged velocity distributions. These results were then used to compute the corresponding distributions of granular temperature and a related dimensionless parameter that is commonly referred to as the Savage-Jeffrey parameter. The aforementioned PTV and data processing procedures, the results in dimensional and dimensionless forms, and the applicability of some recently proposed scaling laws are discussed in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{contrail}} from a large-body A 380 aircraft has extensively been probed in {{the vortex}} and early dispersion regime with in situ instruments to measure microphysical and optical properties of contrail ice particles on the DLR research aircraft Falcon. Concentrations up to 340 cm− 3 of ice particles with diameters d > 0. 9 μm and extinction coefficients up to 7. 0 km− 1 were measured inside the plume. Initially the primary vortices were sampled about 270 m below the A 380 flight altitude at contrail ages of 70 to 120 s in ice subsaturated conditions, followed by measurements {{in the secondary}} wake with contrail ages of 120 to 220 s at conditions near ice saturation. In the primary vortices the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> was 3. 5 μm and the maximum ice water content (IWC) was 7. 0 mg m− 3 increasing with altitude and ice saturation in the secondary wake to 4. 8 μm and 10. 0 mg m− 3 . The asymmetry parameter was found to decrease systematically with contrail age (and altitude) from 0. 87 to 0. 80 indicating that ice crystals {{become more and more}} aspherical during ice crystal growth. In addition, an inversion approach was used to retrieve the ice particle size distribution and the partitioning between spherical and aspherical particles. In the young primary vortex 100 % of the ice particles were of spherical shape, whereas partitioning coefficients of 68 % and 44 % were found in the more aged secondary wake. The extrapolation of our results to older contrails under similar meteorological conditions suggests that contrails with ages over 5 min may be dominated by aspherically-shaped ice particles typical for natural mid latitude cirrus...|$|E

Both nanoparticle types have also previously [16, 24] {{been shown to have}} a positive influence on boiling phenomena at the concentrations used in this work. Water-based nanofluids of these nanoparticles were purchased as Ludox TMA from Sigma-Aldrich (silica; St. Louis, MO, USA) and Plasma-Chem GmbH (diamond; Berlin, Germany). The delivered concentrations of the silica and diamond nanoparticles were 34 % and 4 % by weight, respectively. The as-purchased nanofluids were then diluted with deionized water to the low concentrations of interest in these experiments, i.e., 0.1 % by volume for silica and 0.01 % by volume for diamond. The <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> of the nanoparticles in the dilute nanofluids was measured with the dynamic light scattering technique and was approximately 34 ± 10 nm (measured range from 16 to 50 nm) [25] for the silica nanofluid and 173 ± 10 nm (measured range from 90 to 377 nm) [26] for the diamond nanofluid. No surfactant was used to stabilize either nanofluid. Scanning electron microscope [SEM] pictures of the dried silica particles showed them to be very spherical [26]. Various properties relevant to two-phase heat transfer were also measured. The surface tension, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of the nanofluids were measured [26, 27] by means of a tensiometer, a thermal conductivity probe, and a capillary viscometer, respectively. These properties were found to differ negligibly from those of pure water, i.e., within ± 4 %. At the low concentrations of interest here, the fluid density and heat of vaporization can also be considered unaltered. The temperature dependence of viscosity and thermal conductivity for low nanoparticle loadings in water were measured by Williams et al. [28] and found to be {{the same as that of}} water. In summary, the transport and thermodynamic properties of the dilute nanofluids used in these experiments are very similar to those of pure water; thus, the thermo-physical properties of nanofluids are not expected to be responsible for any change in the heat transfer coefficient or critical heat flux.|$|E
40|$|A {{contrail}} from a large-body A 380 aircraft at cruise in {{the humid}} upper troposphere has been probed with in-situ instruments onboard the DLR research aircraft Falcon. The contrail was sampled during 700 s measurement time at contrail ages of about 1 – 4 min. The contrail {{was in the}} vortex regime during which the primary wake vortices were sinking 270 m below the A 380 flight level while the secondary wake remained above. Contrail properties were sampled separately in the primary wake at 90 and 115 s contrail age and nearly continously in the secondary wake at contrail ages from 70 s to 220 s. The scattering phase functions of the contrail particles were measured with a polar nephelometer. The asymmetry parameter derived from these data is used to distinguish between quasi-spherical and aspherical ice particles. In the primary wake, quasi-spherical ice particles were found with concentrations up to 160 cm − 3, <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> D eff of 3. 7 μm, maximum extinction of 7. 0 km − 1, and ice water content (IWC) of 3 mg m − 3 at slightly ice-subsaturated conditions. The secondary and primary wakes were separated by an almost particle-free wake vortex gap. The secondary wake contained clearly aspherical contrail ice particles with mean D eff of 4. 8 μm, mean (maximum) concentration, extinction, and IWC of 80 (350) cm − 3, 1. 6 (5. 0) km − 1, and 2. 5 (10) mg m − 3, respectively, at conditions apparently above ice-saturation. The asymmetry parameter in the secondary wake decreased with contrail age from 0. 87 to 0. 80 on average indicating a preferential aspherical ice crystal growth. A retrieval of ice particle habit and size with an inversion code shows that the number fraction of aspherical ice crystals increased from 2 % initially to 56 % at 4 min contrail age. The observed crystal size and habit differences in the primary and secondary wakes of an up to 4 min old contrail are of interest for understanding ice crystal growth in contrails and their climate impact.

40|$|During summertime, {{dust from}} the Sahara can be {{efficiently}} transported westwards within the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). This can lead to high aerosol loadings being observed above a relatively clean marine boundary layer (MBL) in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. These dust layers can impart significant radiative effects through strong visible and IR light absorption and scattering, and can also have indirect impacts by altering cloud properties. The processing of the dust aerosol can result in changes in both direct and indirect radiative effect, leading to significant uncertainty in climate prediction in this region. During August 2015, measurements of aerosol and cloud properties were conducted {{off the coast of}} West Africa as part of the ICE-D and AER-D campaign. Observations were obtained over a 4 -week period using the FAAM Bae 146 aircraft based on Santiago Island, Cabo Verde. Ground based observations were collected from Praia, also located on Santiago Island. The dust in the SAL was mostly sampled in situ at altitudes of 2 – 4 km, and the potential dust age was estimated by backward trajectory analysis. The particle mass concentration (at diameter d =  0. 1 – 20  µm) decreased with transport time. <b>Mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> (D eff) for super-micron SAL dust (d =  1 – 20  µm) was found to be 5 – 6  µm regardless of dust age, whereas submicron D eff (d =  0. 1 – 1  µm) showed a decreasing trend with longer transport. For the first time, an airborne laser-induced incandescence instrument (the single particle soot photometer, SP 2) was deployed to measure the hematite content of dust. For the Sahel-influenced dust in the SAL, the observed hematite mass fraction of dust (F Hm) was found to be anti-correlated with the single scattering albedo (SSA, λ =  550  nm, for particles d  F Hm increased from 2. 5  % to 4. 5  %, SSA decreased from 0. 97 to 0. 93 and the derived imaginary part (k) of the refractive index at 550  nm increased from 0. 0015 to 0. 0035. However the optical properties of Sahara-influenced plumes (not influenced by the Sahel) were independent of dust age and hematite content with SSA ~  0. 95 and k  ~  0. 0028. This indicates that the absorbing component of dust may be source-dependent, or that gravitational settling of larger particles may lead to a higher fraction of more absorbing clay-iron aggregates at smaller sizes. Mie calculation using the measured size distribution and size-resolved refractive indices of the absorbing components (black carbon and hematite) reproduces the measured SSA to within ± 0. 02 for SAL dust, by assuming a goethite/hematite mass ratio of 2. Hematite and goethite constituted 40 – 80  % of the absorption for particles d <  2. 5  µm and black carbon (BC) contributed 10 – 37  %. This highlights the importance of size-dependent composition in determining the optical properties of dust, and also the contribution from BC within dust plumes...|$|E
40|$|During the CIRCLE- 2 {{experiment}} {{carried out}} over Western Europe in May 2007, combined in situ and remote sensing observations allowed to describe microphysical and optical properties near-top of an overshooting convective cloud (11 080 m/− 58 °C). The airborne measurements were {{performed with the}} DLR Falcon aircraft specially equipped with {{a unique set of}} instruments for the extensive in situ cloud measurements of microphysical and optical properties (Polar Nephelometer, FSSP- 300, Cloud Particle Imager and PMS 2 -D-C) and nadir looking remote sensing observations (DLR WALES Lidar). Quasi-simultaneous space observations from MSG/SEVIRI, CALIPSO/CALIOP-WFC-IIR and CloudSat/CPR combined with airborne RASTA radar reflectivity from the French Falcon aircraft flying above the DLR Falcon depict very well convective cells which overshoot by up to 600 m the tropopause level. Unusual high values of the concentration of small ice particles, extinction, ice water content (up to 70 cm − 3, 30 km − 1 and 0. 5 g m − 3, respectively) are experienced. The <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>diameter</b> and the maximum particle size are 43 μm and about 300 μm, respectively. This very dense cloud causes a strong attenuation of the WALES and CALIOP lidar returns. The SEVIRI retrieved parameters confirm the occurrence of small ice crystals {{at the top of the}} convective cell. Smooth and featureless phase functions with asymmetry factors of 0. 776 indicate fairly uniform optical properties. Due to small ice crystals the power-law relationship between ice water content (IWC) and radar reflectivity appears to be very different from those usually found in cirrus and anvil clouds. For a given equivalent reflectivity factor, IWCs are significantly larger for the overshooting cell than for the cirrus. Assuming the same prevalent microphysical properties over the depth of the overshooting cell, RASTA reflectivity profiles scaled into ice water content show that retrieved IWC up to 1 g m − 3 may be observed near the cloud top. Extrapolating the relationship for stronger convective clouds with similar ice particles, IWC up to 5 g m − 3 could be experienced with reflectivity factors no larger than about 20 dBZ. This means that for similar situations, indication of rather weak radar echo does not necessarily warn the occurrence of high ice water content carried by small ice crystals. All along the cloud penetration the shape of the ice crystals is dominated by chain-like aggregates of frozen droplets. Our results confirm previous observations that the chains of ice crystals are found in a continental deep convective systems which are known generally to generate intense electric fields causing efficient ice particle aggregation processes. Vigorous updrafts could lift supercooled droplets which are frozen extremely rapidly by homogeneous nucleation near the − 37 °C level, producing therefore high concentrations of very small ice particles at upper altitudes. They are sufficient to deplete the water vapour and suppress further nucleation as confirmed by humidity measurements. These observations address scientific issues related to the microphysical properties and structure of deep convective clouds and confirm that particles smaller than 50 μm may control the radiative properties in convective-related clouds. These unusual observations may also provide some possible insights regarding engineering issues related to the failure of jet engines commonly used on commercial aircraft during flights through areas of high ice water content. However, large uncertainties of the measured and derived parameters limit our observations...|$|E
