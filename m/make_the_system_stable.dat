40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that fuzzy {{learning}} controller is powerful for nonlinear systems, it is very difficult to apply a learning method if they are unstable. An unstable system diverges for impulse input. This divergence makes it difficult to learn the rules unless we can find the initial rules to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>stable</b> prior to learning. Therefore, we introduced LQR(Linear Quadratic Regulator) technique to stabilize the system. It is a state feedback control to move unstable poles of a linear system to stable ones. But, if the system is nonlinear or complicated to get a linear model, we cannot expect good results with only LQR. In this paper, we propose that the LQR law is derived from a roughly approximated linear model, and next the fuzzy controller is tuned by the adaptive on-line learning with the real nonlinear plant. This hybrid controller of LQR and fuzzy learning was superior to the LQR of a linearized model in unstable nonlinear systems...|$|E

For tracking, the feedback linearization technique is combined with T-S model to give a fuzzy control law.

Under an important pinning control approach, by a minimum number of controllers, the system can reached the predetermined goal. Under a sampled-data controller, the states of the control systems at sampling instants are adjusted continuously by using zero-order holder. Under an impulsive controller, states of the control systems are adjusted at discrete-time sampling instants.

Only two-dimensional disturbances are studied in this paper because Squire's theorem does not apply in general, owing to the presence of the aligned magnetic field. The analysis is partly analytical and partly numerical. The asymptotic solutions for non-viscous fluid are first obtained analytically and they are then improved by introducing viscous and thermal diffusion terms (but only for Ï 1) to get a uniformly valid solution. The neutral stability curves are numerically computed for a range of values of Richardson and Stuart numbers, which show that the flow is completely stabilized when a Stuart number exceeds a certain value for a given Ri & gt; 0.

40|$|The {{interest}} in the impact of fiscal policy lags on economic stability increased in the last decade. Several studies have been made on delays either in the government expenditure or in the tax system, where lags exist between the accrual and the payment of taxes. Nevertheless {{there is in the}} literature no model where time delays in government expenditures and in tax revenues are considered together as it happens in the real world. In this paper we remedied this defect and proposed a macro-dynamic model where two delays appear: the first pertains to the public expenditure, the second, to the tax revenue. The resulting system of delayed differential equations is studied qualitatively and numerically. The analysis suggests that only particular combinations of the two delays <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>stable.</b> Prevalently the system is unstable and chaotic motions may arise.
