25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at <b>my</b> <b>wrists.</b> Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, however, Laws {{felt that}} EastEnders was {{becoming}} too depressing, noting that Wellard's death {{came at the}} same time Jase was murdered and Honey and her husband Billy (Perry Fenwick) broke up, writing: [...] "I feel like slitting <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> when I tune in now. [...] There's only so much gritty realism we can take in our soaps, and EastEnders is really overloading us at the moment." [...] In 2013, Digital Spy's Naomi Gordon opined that Wellard's death was one of the eight [...] "saddest fictional dog deaths", saying [...] "There wasn't a dry eye in the house." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2001, EastEnders began airing a 4th weekly episode. The storyline to {{mark the}} {{occasion}} centred around Mel, her husband Steve, and her former lovers Phil and Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). After Phil and Steve wrongfully framed Dan for Phil's shooting, Dan sought revenge by kidnapping Mel and demanding a ransom. An EastEnders insider reportedly told The Mirror, [...] "This has be [...] {{one of the most}} dramatic storylines we have ever filmed. Dan has vowed to get even with Phil and Steve for framing him over the shooting. Kidnapping Mel kills two birds with one stone. Although Mel and Phil have had their differences, he still harbours feelings for her." [...] As part of the storyline, Outhwaite, as Mel, was tied up to a radiator in a council flat. Outhwaite commented, [...] "They offered to untie <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> between scenes, but I said no so I could feel what it was really like. <b>My</b> <b>wrists</b> were raw by the end of it and I was exhausted, but that was the challenge I wanted." ...|$|E
60|$|I leaned towards Louis, but he {{anticipated}} my question. His {{hand had}} caught <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> and was pinning {{it down to}} the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{pulled out}} my knife, and {{severing}} the line at <b>my</b> <b>wrist,</b> walked away, looking for some one to introduce me to Smarty Mellor." ...|$|R
60|$|I stole {{a look at}} his gnarled hands. Any finger {{would have}} made three of mine. His wrist would have made three of <b>my</b> <b>wrist.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Type O Negative's debut album, Slow, Deep and Hard, was {{released}} in 1991. The album incorporated the thrash elements of Carnivore merged with doom metal. Steele had written the music {{in the space of}} one night {{in the aftermath of a}} relationship break-up, and this was reflected in the lyrical topics of heartbreak, fantasies of revenge, and the contemplation of suicide; something Steele had himself attempted: [...] "On October 15th, 1989, I slashed <b>my</b> <b>wrists.</b> All I can say is that I fell in love with the wrong person." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I had {{went through}} {{a lot of things in}} my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, {{painting}} the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my dicision (sic) to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vaughan's New York Times {{obituary}} {{described her}} as a [...] "singer who brought an operatic splendour to her performances of popular standards and jazz." [...] Fellow jazz singer Mel Tormé said that Vaughan had [...] "...the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field." [...] Her ability was envied by Frank Sinatra who said that [...] "Sassy is so good now that when I listen to her I want to cut <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> with a dull razor." [...] The New York Times critic John S. Wilson said in 1957 that Vaughan possessed [...] "what {{may well be the}} finest voice ever applied to jazz." [...] Age hardly affected Vaughan's voice. Her voice was still close to its peak until shortly before her death at the age of 66. Late in life Vaughan retained a [...] "youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre", she was still capable of the projection of coloratura passages described as [...] "delicate and ringingly high".|$|E
60|$|At {{this she}} let go <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> and covered {{her face with her}} hands passionately. When she dropped them she had the look of one morally crushed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I got {{a scratch}} on <b>my</b> <b>wrist,</b> that is all, and Hans says he twisted his left ankle a little. But we are glad we weren't drowned." ...|$|R
6000|$|If I {{tried to}} do it very gradually, would they see I was {{slipping}} <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> out of the looser turn? If they did, what would they do? ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{affection for}} her was undying, {{and it has been}} noted that {{after the death of his}} Queen Consort, Gojong locked himself up in his {{chambers}} for several weeks, refusing to assume his duties. When he finally did, he lost the will to even try and signed treaty after treaty that was proposed by the Japanese, giving the Japanese immense power. When his father regained political power after the death of his daughter-in-law, he presented a proposal with the aid of certain Japanese officials to lower his daughter-in-law's status as Queen Consort all the way to commoner posthumously. Gojong, a man who had always been used by others and never used his own voice for his own causes, was noted by scholars as having said, [...] "I would rather slit <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> and let them bleed than disgrace the woman who saved this kingdom." [...] In an act of defiance, he refused to sign his father's and the Japanese proposal, and turned them away.|$|E
60|$|Federigo halted me {{beneath the}} pulleys, and his horrid hands grew busy {{adjusting}} the ropes to <b>my</b> <b>wrists.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon you are right." [...] Songbird gave a groan. [...] "Gosh! they tied <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> {{together}} so tightly the blood won't circulate!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{with great}} gravity he drew {{from his pocket}} a pair of ancient handcuffs, one of which he {{attached}} to <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> {{and the other to}} his own.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> smashed with a musket ball, fired by a party {{on a hill}} to the right, belonging, I suppose, to the force that came up from Oycke." ...|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] Scarcely, by groping, had I {{reached the}} Spot, [...] When round <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> I felt a cord drawn tight, [...] As if the blind Man's dog were pulling at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are safe," [...] she began, glancing {{first at}} the palm ropes that lay upon the rock and then at <b>my</b> <b>wrists,</b> {{one of which was}} cut.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} it," [...] I said. [...] "You {{were dressed}} up as Father Christmas. It was I who put out the fire; <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> were burnt in doing so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very numb, but I'll be {{all right}} {{in a very short}} time. <b>My</b> <b>wrists</b> hurt; your thread is very tight. My arms always swell. Please give me a drink of water." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack {{had come}} in while she spoke, and was {{standing}} by the bed, I saw now. The servant had gone out. He lifted my arm, and held <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fall, Señor," [...] {{answered}} d'Aguilar; [...] "I {{think that}} it has broken <b>my</b> <b>wrist.</b> But I have still my left hand. Suffer me to arise, and we will finish this fray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> tab I'll be safe. The ground {{around the}} bunker {{is a living}} field of claws. They collect down in the ash. Like crabs. Without tabs you wouldn't have a chance." ...|$|R
60|$|Knowing that {{it would}} be folly to resist, I allowed them to do as Moran had advised. <b>My</b> <b>wrists</b> were knotted {{together}} behind my back, and then the cord was drawn tightly about my waist.|$|E
60|$|When I awoke it {{was with}} a start to find a couple of huge Sagoths astride me. They pinioned my arms and legs, and later chained <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> behind my back. Then they let me up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I Master of the earth?" [...] he said. [...] "Or is your Society? Now. Take {{your hands}} off those levers, and hold <b>my</b> <b>wrists.</b> Yes--so. And now, how do we turn her nose down to the glide?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} there's nobody does," [...] he said. [...] "Still, as you've got my pistol and 'most dislocated <b>my</b> <b>wrist,</b> the {{least you can}} do is to get a partner out of this." ...|$|R
60|$|Holmes was for {{the moment}} as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.|$|R
60|$|I {{held up a}} lumpy {{wrist to}} show. She took one glance at it, halted abruptly, and, neatly {{balancing}} herself to the roll, took <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> in both her hands and gave it close scrutiny.|$|R
6000|$|I {{go in the}} rain, and, {{more than}} needs, [...] A rope cuts both <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> behind; And I think, by the feel, my {{forehead}} bleeds, [...] For they fling, whoever has a mind, Stones at me for my year's misdeeds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have so quarrelled with myself, Yorke. I have so kicked {{against the}} pricks, and {{struggled}} in a strait waistcoat, and dislocated <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> with wrenching them in handcuffs, and battered my hard head by driving it against a harder wall." ...|$|E
60|$|Work! More {{than once}} I sank {{down on the}} coal where {{no one could see}} me, and cried with rage, and mortification, and exhaustion, and despair. That second day was my hardest, and all that enabled me to survive it and get in the last of the night coal at the end of {{thirteen}} hours was the day fireman, who bound both <b>my</b> <b>wrists</b> with broad leather straps. So tightly were they buckled that they were like slightly flexible plaster casts. They took the stresses and pressures which hitherto had been borne by <b>my</b> <b>wrists,</b> and they were so tight that {{there was no room for}} the inflammation to rise in the sprains.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{write what}} I shall tell thee"; {{and here he}} so pressed and wrung <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> that his fingers entered into my living flesh with a fiery pang. I writhed, but I did not cry.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{he could}} strike again, however, I {{got in my}} right hand and he was {{sprawling}} on {{his back on the}} floor. <b>My</b> <b>wrist</b> bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up <b>my</b> <b>wrist,</b> keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from <b>my</b> wounded <b>wrist.</b> He was easily secured, and to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again, [...] "The blood is the life! The blood is the life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tired? I'm nearly dead. My {{feet are}} cut and bruised, <b>my</b> <b>wrist</b> is sprained, and I ache all over. But, Jonathan, I don't care. I am {{so happy to}} have my wild venture turn out successfully." ...|$|R
