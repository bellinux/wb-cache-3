50|$|In simple aircraft, {{without an}} air data {{computer}} or <b>Machmeter,</b> true <b>airspeed</b> can be calculated {{as a function of}} calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density).

Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).|$|R

5000|$|... for {{aircraft}} control, CAS (and EAS) {{are the primary}} reference points, since they describe the dynamic pressure acting on aircraft surfaces regardless of density, altitude, wind, and other conditions. EAS {{is used as a}} reference by aircraft designers, but EAS cannot be displayed correctly at varying altitudes by a simple (single capsule) <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator.</b> CAS is therefore a standard for calibrating the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> such that CAS equals EAS at sea level pressure and approximates EAS at higher altitudes.|$|R

50|$|The <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> is {{connected}} to both the pitot and static pressure sources. The difference between the pitot pressure and the static pressure is called dynamic pressure.

25|$|True {{airspeed}} {{differs from}} the equivalent airspeed because the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> is calibrated at SL, ISA conditions, where the air density is 1.225kg/m³, whereas the air density in flight normally differs from this value.|$|R
50|$|To {{the left}} and right of the {{attitude}} indicator are usually the <b>airspeed</b> and altitude <b>indicators,</b> respectively. The <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> displays the speed of the aircraft in knots, while the altitude indicator displays the aircraft's altitude above mean sea level (AMSL). These measurements are conducted through the aircraft's pitot system, which tracks air pressure measurements. As in the PFD's attitude indicator, these systems are merely displayed data from the underlying mechanical systems, and do not contain any mechanical parts (unlike an aircraft's <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> and altimeter). Both of these indicators are usually presented as vertical “tapes”, which scroll up and down as altitude and <b>airspeed</b> change. Both <b>indicators</b> may often have “bugs”, that is, indicators that show various important speeds and altitudes, such as V speeds calculated by a flight management system, do-not-exceed speeds for the current configuration, stall speeds, selected altitudes and airspeeds for the autopilot, and so on.|$|R
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicators.</b> [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> to {{register}} an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the <b>airspeed</b> <b>indicator</b> will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|R
