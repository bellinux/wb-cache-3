5|$|The rasping {{advertising}} call {{is readily}} {{distinguished from the}} hwitt-hwitt-hwitt of spotted crake, the <b>monotonous</b> clockwork tak-tak-tak-tak-tak of striped crake, or the quick-quick of Baillon's crake. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E
5|$|He was not {{an elegant}} exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and <b>monotonous.</b> But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{describes}} {{the island of}} Timor, its abundance of fan-palms, its people who are like Papuans, and the Portuguese government which he considers extremely poor. On some hills he finds Eucalyptus (gum) trees, a genus from Australia; he finds the vegetation <b>monotonous</b> also.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination (rapid shuffling steps and a forward-flexed posture when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred <b>monotonous</b> quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
5|$|The life of {{the royal}} family was {{relatively}} quiet and withdrawn. The Athenian court was not as brilliant and sumptuous as that of Saint Petersburg, and days in the Greek capital were sometimes <b>monotonous</b> for members {{of the royal family}}. In spring and winter, they divided time between the Royal Palace in Athens, and Tatoi Palace at the foot of Mount Parnitha. Summers were spent on vacation at Aix-les-Bains in France, visiting relatives in the Russian capital or at Fredensborg and Bernstorff in Denmark, and relaxing at Mon Repos, Corfu.|$|E
5|$|The {{thought as}} enounced {{in the first}} stanza is the {{supremacy}} of ideal art over Nature, because of its unchanging expression of perfect; and this is true and beautiful; but its amplification in the poem is unprogressive, <b>monotonous,</b> and scattered... which gives an effect of poverty {{in spite of the}} beauty. The last stanza enters stumbling upon a pun, but its concluding lines are very fine, and make a sort of recovery with their forcible directness.|$|E
5|$|An {{aspect of}} Murder on the Orient Express which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in {{particular}} gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, {{with the voice}} actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who {{said that it was}} tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and <b>monotonous</b> sound effects.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and <b>monotonous</b> speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|Calling himself Anders, and feigning {{an injured}} leg, Kator is {{taken in by}} Jessica and Jo. His arrival {{immediately}} causes friction between the two. Bored of her <b>monotonous</b> existence, Jessica welcomes the stranger's arrival. Jo, however, openly resents his presence and suggests that the socially-awkward Anders is an escapee from a psychiatric hospital (which she is herself). Later, having returned {{to the spot where}} he killed Anderson and Sandy, Kator kills and partly devours two policemen who are examining the couple's abandoned car. Back at the house, Jessica finds a knife and bloodstained clothes in a spare bedroom; recognising the latter as Simon's, she realises that he was murdered by Jo.|$|E
5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, <b>monotonous</b> calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was <b>monotonous</b> and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a success, earning {{a total of}} $141.2 million worldwide, {{exceeding}} the earnings of the three previous Bond films. In 1966, John Stears won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and production designer Ken Adam was also nominated for a BAFTA award. Thunderball is the most financially successful film of the series when adjusting for ticket price inflation. Some critics and viewers showered praise on the film and branded it a welcome addition to the series, while others complained of the repetitively <b>monotonous</b> aquatic action and prolonged length. In 1983, Warner Bros. released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title Never Say Never Again, with McClory as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat <b>monotonous</b> routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw {{the need}} for {{dedicated}} battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked Australia to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, Australia was diverted to Gibraltar. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and Australia reached Rosyth on 17 February after sailing through a gale. She was made flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey {{and the leader of}} the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his flag aboard Australia. British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet penned in European waters through a distant blockade while trying to lure them into a decisive battle. During her time with the 2nd BCS, Australias operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the North Sea area in response to actual or perceived German movements, and some escort work. These duties were so <b>monotonous,</b> one sailor was driven insane.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been <b>monotonous</b> and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was {{accepted}} for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was able to claim one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a <b>monotonous</b> chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

25|$|Critical {{reception}} for Spirit Detective has been mostly unfavorable. While separate reviewers {{had their own}} qualms about the game, nearly all complained of <b>monotonous</b> gameplay and boring visuals.|$|E
25|$|Positive reviewers {{describe}} it as impressive {{because it is the}} most suggestive and graphic account of why women who live <b>monotonous</b> lives are susceptible to mental illness.|$|E
25|$|In Playing Dress Up (Goss Michael Foundation, Dallas 2007), McCartney {{chronicled the}} {{rarefied}} and at times, both <b>monotonous</b> and madcap, world of high fashion, {{both on the}} catwalk and backstage with an unreserved collection of images.|$|E
25|$|All the {{varieties}} were appreciated, but the hot ones are particularly appreciated {{because they can}} enliven otherwise <b>monotonous</b> diets. This was of some importance during dietary restrictions for religious reasons, such as Lent in Christian countries.|$|E
25|$|The chants, {{as may be}} supposed, {{have more}} of rhyme than reason in them. The tunes are {{generally}} plaintive and <b>monotonous,</b> as are most of the capstan tunes of sailors, but resounding over the still waters of the Bay, they had a fine effect.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet goal of {{providing}} housing for every family, and {{the rapid growth}} of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, <b>monotonous</b> housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne’s {{grid plan}} was {{considered}} dull and <b>monotonous</b> by some people, {{and so the}} architect William Campbell designed a blueprint for the city. The main principle behind this were diagonal streets, providing sites for new and comprehensive architecture and for special buildings. The designs of Paris and Washington were major inspirations for this plan.|$|E
25|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} with criticism targeted its <b>monotonous</b> level design and limited control scheme, while praise {{was given to}} its 3D graphics and pre-rendered cutscenes. The game's sequel, Epidemic, was released in Japan in December 1995, and in North America the following year. Both Kileak and Epidemic became available on the Japanese PlayStation Network in September 2015.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to simpler buildings, the 1960s are remembered for massive housing plans. A typical project was developed using concrete panels {{to make a}} simple, five-story house. These Pyatietazhki became the dominant housing construction. Although rapidly built, their quality was poor compared with earlier housing; their <b>monotonous</b> appearance contributed to the grey and dull stereotype characteristic of socialist cities.|$|E
25|$|The tide {{has turned}} {{but it is}} not yet high tide for England. There must be few people who did not welcome England's victory in the Fifth Test because it broke the <b>monotonous</b> string of Australian {{victories}} and sympathy was entirely with Freddie Brown and his men for the gallant performances they had put up throughout the tour.|$|E
25|$|Considering its poetic roots (Russian literature, bard music), {{it is not}} a big {{surprise}} that lyrics play a far larger role in Russian rock than Western rock. Vocal melody is sometimes eschewed in favor of a more impassioned delivery (Viktor Tsoi, the lead singer of Kino, pioneered a characteristically strained, <b>monotonous</b> style of singing that has been imitated by many).|$|E
25|$|Paolo {{painted the}} Lives of the Church Fathers in the cloisters {{of the church}} of San Miniato, which sat on a hill {{overlooking}} Florence. According to Vasari, Paolo protested against the <b>monotonous</b> meals of cheese pies and cheese soup served by the abbot by running away, and returned to finish the job only after the abbot promised him a more varied diet.|$|E
25|$|Food {{was very}} basic and <b>monotonous.</b> One {{incident}} in the early 1900s told how for weeks on end there was not 'pudding' until constant demands resulted in a dessert made from boiled cabbage scraps. Sobriety was encouraged, not always successfully, by {{the establishment of a}} soft drink bottling factory inside the Fort. The 'Artillery' bottles of this factory are much sought after today.|$|E
25|$|Simon (Franklin), Gretchen (Ward) and Sigmund (Pender) are {{a trio of}} apathetic Germans who {{dress in}} black and speak in <b>monotonous</b> voices. They appear in places that are usually the source of happy, bubbly personalities, like children's TV shows, {{aerobics}} shows, or as replacements for a department store Santa, and frequently make comments on the meaninglessness and futility of life, love and other endeavours.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra {{developed}} {{especially among}} the vulnerable populations in institutions such as orphanages and prisons, because of the <b>monotonous</b> and restricted diet. Soon pellagra began to occur in epidemic proportions in states south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. The pellagra epidemic lasted for nearly four decades beginning in 1906. It was estimated that there were 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths due to pellagra during the epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Paul disliked {{everything}} that was dear {{to his mother and}} Quarenghi's architecture obviously fell into this category. After the emperor took the Maltese knights under his protection, Quarenghi also joined the Order and served as its official architect until 1800. His commissions became less frequent, as the <b>monotonous</b> rhythm of solemn collonnades and the laconic clarity of symmetrical compositions appeared boring to those courtiers who had found Quarenghi's designs so delightful a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|Amusia {{can also}} be related to aprosody, a {{disorder}} in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely <b>monotonous.</b> It {{has been found that}} both amusia and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere. They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with amusia from injury. There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.|$|E
25|$|Actual {{travel time}} on public {{transport}} becomes a lesser consideration when predictable and when travel itself is reasonably comfortable (seats, toilets, services), and {{can thus be}} scheduled and used pleasurably, productively or for (overnight) rest. Chauffeured movement is enjoyed by many people when it is relaxing, safe but not too <b>monotonous.</b> Waiting, interchanging, stops and holdups, for example due to traffic or for security, are discomforting. Jet lag is a human constraint discouraging frequent rapid long-distance East-West commuting, favoring modern telecommunications and VR technologies.|$|E
