50|$|Matching Payments: Created {{to provide}} {{incentives}} for collecting underutilized biomass for bioenergy production. This would remove existing biomass {{where it might}} not currently be profitable to do so, such as from crop residue or forest undergrowth. Through a <b>matching</b> <b>payment,</b> USDA would pay dollar-for-dollar, up to $45 per ton, of the price to collect, harvest, store, and transport eligible material to biomass conversion facilities. The payments have different eligibility and sign-up requirements, payment rates, and contract length.|$|E
5000|$|Initially the Brisbane City Council {{planned to}} recover {{the cost of the}} bridge by {{collecting}} a toll of $2.70 per vehicle. However, due to budget savings this amount was reduced to $1.50 until the end of 2010, then {{for the first six months}} of 2011 it cost $2.00, rising to $2.35 plus CPI from July 2011. [...] The bridge features free-flow tolling with electronic tag and video <b>matching</b> <b>payment</b> options. Transurban has a 50 year lease to toll and operate the bridge.|$|E
5000|$|Another method {{allows the}} {{candidates}} to raise funds from private donors, but provides matching funds for the first chunk of donations. For instance, the government might [...] "match" [...] the first $250 of every donation. This would effectively make small donations more valuable to a campaign, potentially leading them to put more effort into pursuing such donations, which {{are believed to have}} less of a corrupting effect than larger gifts and enhance the power of less-wealthy individuals. Such a system is currently in place in the U.S. presidential primaries. As of February 2008, there were fears that this system provided a safety net for losers in these races, as shown by loan taken out by John McCain's campaign that used the promise of matching funds as collateral. However, in February 2009 the Federal Election Commission found no violation of the law because McCain permissibly withdrew from the <b>Matching</b> <b>Payment</b> Program and thus was released from his obligations. It also found {{no reason to believe that}} a violation occurred as a result of the Committee’s reporting of McCain’s loan. The Commission closed the files.|$|E

5000|$|In 1989, some enterprising {{state budget}} experts {{discovered}} that they could claim federal DSH funds without expending general state funds [...] and use the DSH payment as a mechanism for mitigating hospitals’ financial distress. To earn the match, however, the state had to spend the tax or donation revenues, because the federal Medicaid match is based on expenditures, not revenues. The Medicaid DSH payment provided the mechanism to spend these revenues. The DSH payment was singled out {{because it was not}} subject to the Medicare upper payment limit. Thus, states could make virtually unlimited DSH payments and, in the process, earn federal matching dollars. As such the hospitals that were slated to receive DSH funds were asked to contribute the required state share; the state would then use this money to draw down a large federal <b>matching</b> <b>payment.</b> The hospitals would get their contributions back and perhaps a bit more, but the states often kept the lion's share of the federal payment. With the DSH system effectively serving as a money pump that pulled federal funds into state coffers, the program experienced explosive growth. Between 1990 and 1996, federal DSH payments ballooned from $1.4 billion to more than $15 billion annually.|$|E
40|$|The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P. L. 110 - 246, 2008 farm bill) {{created the}} Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). The two main {{purposes}} of BCAP are (1) {{to support the}} establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy in selected areas, and (2) to assist agricultural and forest land owners and operators with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of eligible material {{for use in a}} biomass conversion facility. BCAP is intended to assist with the bioenergy industry’s hurdle of continuous biomass availability. The U. S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Farm Service Agency (FSA) implemented one portion of BCAP—the Collection, Harvest, Storage, and Transportation (CHST) <b>matching</b> <b>payment</b> program—on June 11, 2009, through a Notice of Funds Availability in the Federal Register. The partial implementation created a possible unintended consequence of market competition for wood shavings, wood chips, sawdust, and other wood “scraps” between traditional purchasers—namely landscapers and particleboard manufactures—and facilities that convert biomass to energy. The issuance of the BCAP proposed rule on February 8, 2010, suspended CHST program enrollment and proposed rules for the implementation of the remainder of the BCAP program. According to USDA’s proposed rule, the two main components of BCAP are split into two forms of payments: annual and establishment payments, which share in the cost of establishing eligible biomass crops and maintaining production; and matching payments, which share in the cost of the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of biomass to an eligible biomass conversion facility. The payments have different eligibility and sign-up requirements, payment rates, and contract lengths. Funding for the program is mandatory through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) at “such sums as necessary” through FY 2012. While BCAP remains to be fully implemented, concerns regarding eligibility, sustainability, and funding continue to be discussed. These issues could shape future congressional action on the program in the context of budgetary measures and possible reauthorization in the next farm bill...|$|E
