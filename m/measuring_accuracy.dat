50|$|Another {{issue in}} <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> is the {{position}} in which the shots are fired.

50|$|However recent {{research}} has shown that Eupalinos used three straight lines for his navigation. First he constructed a “mountain” line, over the mountain at the easiest part of the summit which gave a non-optimal position both for feeding water into the tunnel and for water delivery to the city. He connected a “south line” to the mountain line at the south side going straight into the mountain around which Eupalinos undulated the south tunnel. At the north side a “north line” is connected to the mountain line. This line guided the cut into the mountain from the north side. After 273 meters Eupalinos directed the tunnel to the west obviously because of a combination of water, weak rock and mud. When leaving the north line Eupalinos used for navigating an equal legged triangle with angles 22.5, 45 and 22.5 degrees in theory. Measuring errors occurred and were handled by Eupalinos within the accuracy he could obtain. The cutting of the south tunnel was stopped after 390 metres for the north tunnel to catch up. For the rendezvous of the two tunnels a tentacle was applied {{at the head of the}} south tunnel giving 17 metres wider catching width. When the two tunnels reach within earshot which can be estimated for this rock to approximate 12 metres, the tunnels are directed towards each other and met at a nearly right angle. This took place almost under the summit but this was coincidental. Eupalinos levelled around the mountain probably following a contour line but not necessary at the same level as the tunnel. He underestimated his <b>measuring</b> <b>accuracy</b> because before the rendezvous Eupalinos raised the ceiling of the north tunnel by 2.5 m and lowered the floor of the south tunnel by 0.6 m, giving him a catching height of almost 5 metres. At the rendezvous the closing error in altitude for the two tunnels was a few decimetres. Eupalinos used a unit of 20.59 metres for distance measurements and 7.5 degrees (1/12 of a right angle) for setting out directions.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{forecasting}} {{is effectively}} limited to forecasts that are expressed with clarity; {{which is to}} say that the forecasted event must be sufficiently well-defined so that it can be clearly resolved whether or not the event occurred and forecasts certainties are expressed as quantitative probabilities. When forecasts are expressed with clarity, then quantitative measures (scoring rules, calibration, discrimination, etc.) can be used to <b>measure</b> forecast <b>accuracy,</b> which in turn can be used to <b>measure</b> the comparative <b>accuracy</b> of different forecasting methods. Unfortunately most real world forecasts are not expressed clearly. This lack of clarity extends to both the description of the forecast event and to the use of vague language to express forecast certainty.
