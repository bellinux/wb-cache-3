50|$|Blast Furnace - {{originally}} the Bessemer converter, invented pre-Civil war. Where steel comes from and why there's no wrought iron anymore. In this process, the iron ore {{is reduced to}} a molten state, the slag is poured off, and then air (oxygen) is forced into the melted mass. Any impurities, such as carbon, are burned from the <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> {{in the presence of}} the free oxygen.

50|$|The continual {{wars and}} fiscal crises greatly limited the {{expansion}} of French industry. The Industrial Revolution had only just begun in France. Production during the Directory had fallen below {{what it was in}} 1789. The number of workers in the silk industry in Lyon had dropped from 12,000 before 1787 to 6,500. The cotton textile industry was more successful due to the embargo against British products caused by the war. New factories and new technologies, such as mechanical looms, were introduced in Normandy and in Alsace. However, the technologies were still primitive; the steam engine had not yet arrived in French factories. The chemical industry was also advancing rapidly during he Directory; the chemist and entrepreneur Jean Antoine Claude Chaptal built a chemical factory in Montpellier, which he soon moved to Chaillot, a village west of Paris. The most effective promoter of French industry was François de Neufchâteau, who was Minister of the Interior before becoming a Director in 1797. He planned a new canal system, began work on a new road across the Pyrenees, and organized the first national industrial exposition in Paris, which opened with great success in October 1798. Once he became Consul, Bonaparte copied the idea of the industrial exposition. Despite this bright spot, French industry was primitive: without steam power, most factories in France depended upon water power, and the metallurgy industry still <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> with wood fires, not oil.|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of making iron, the liquid level at the blast furnace hearth is one {{important}} effect to consider in the operation. The liquid level is check {{in order to have a}} smooth running process. Many numerical methods have been done and analyzed in order to have an understanding of the liquid behavior inside the blast furnace. All numerical methods done, about the liquid level, show a strong flow phenomenon at the taphole of the blast furnace. Since many numerical methods already exist, a physical scale model is more optional in order to have a truthful visualization of the <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> simulation. In this way, it can be proven that the strong blow phenomenon really happens. For this reason, a pressurized physical scale model has been built in order to simulate the liquid level of the molten iron and slag in the blast furnace hearth. A simulation of the liquid level was done using water to simulate the liquid in the blast furnace. This was done with a purpose, to visualize and prove the existence of the strong flow phenomenon. The results obtained of this simulation show the strong blow phenomenon quite visibly. Another simulation was done using water and vegetable oil to simulate the <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> and the slag. Since the ratio of <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> to slag is about 2. 6 (The respective densities for molten iron and slag are 6700 kg/m 3 and 2600 kg/m 3), and the production rate of <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> to slag is 3. 3, a rate of 3 (water) to 1 (vegetable oil) was done in order to achieve an approximation to a ratio of 3 (The respective densities at room temperature are 1 g/cm 3 for water and 0. 922 g/cm 3 for the oil). The results obtained for this simulation, again, show the strong flow phenomenon very visibly. The geometrical similarity was satisfied as was the kinematic similarity. However, the dynamic similarity was not achieved. The equalities obtained are Rep = 5. 487 Rem, Fr m = 558. 38 Frp, and Np = 9. 879 Nm. Although, similarity was not achieved completely, the observed results illustrate a pattern where it can be said that the strong blow phenomenon really does happen. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium oxide on the {{crushing}} strength, reduction, and smelting performance of high-chromium vanadium–titanium magnetite pellets (HCVTMP) was studied in this work. The main characterization methods of an electronic {{universal testing machine}} (EUTM), X-ray fluorescent (XRF), inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscope-energy disperse spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were employed. The crushing strength was affected by the mineral phases generated during oxidative baking and the subsequently-formed pellet microstructures owing to CaO addition. The reduction and smelting properties of HCVTMP with different CaO additives were measured and characterized with different softening-melting-dripping indices. Although HCVTMP showed the highest crushing strength with CaO addition of ca. 2 wt %, more CaO addition {{may be needed to}} achieve high permeability of the furnace burdens and a good separation condition of the slag and <b>melted</b> <b>iron.</b> In the formation process of the slag and <b>melted</b> <b>iron,</b> it can be determined that CaO could have a relationship with the transformation behavior of Cr, V, and Ti to some extent, with respect to the predominant chemical composition analysis of ICP-AES and XRF.

40|$|Before 1782 {{little more}} than a ‘partial agglomer-ation ’ of {{platinum}} had been achieved, mainly by hot forging from the powder which, although it sufficed to make many platinum artefacts, did not produce homogeneous molten metal (1 – 3). The first to melt impure platinum may have been Henrik Theophil Scheffer (1710 – 1759) who in 1751 melted platinum with copper, and later arsenic, in a furnace (4). Franz Achard (1753 – 1821) similarly melted the metal with arsenic (5). In both cases alloys of platinum, rather than pure platinum, are likely to have been melted. In 1775 Pierre Macquer (1718 – 1784) and Antoine Baumé (1724 – 1804) unsuccessfully attempted to melt platinum in a porcelain crucible over a wood fire. Macquer and others (later including Lavoisier) then tried with burning glasses: a 56 cm diameter concave mirror which focused the sun’s rays quickly <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> but platinum gave only silvery-white glistening particles – the product probably contained impurities of carbon which lowered its melting point (1).

40|$|After {{describing}} all {{the contradictions}} {{associated with the}} current Plate Tectonics theory, this paper proposes a model where a single cause can explain all geophysical and geological phenomena. The source of the Earth's activity lies in the difference of the angular velocities of the mantle and of the solid inner core. The friction between both spheres infers heat, which {{is the cause of}} the <b>melted</b> <b>iron</b> which constitutes most of the liquid outer core, as well as the source of the global heat flow. The solid inner core angular velocity is supposed to remain steady, while the mantle angular velocity depends on gyroscopic forces (involving acceleration) and slowing down due to external attractions and, principally the motions of mantle plates 2900 km thick. The variations of the geomagnetic field are therefore the direct consequence of the variations of the angular velocity of the mantle relative to that of the inner core. As a result, the biological and tectonic evolutions during geological times are due to those phenomena. So, the limits of eras coincide exactly with the passage to zero of the geomagnetic field. Here we show that cycles of about 230 - 250 millions years, which exhibit the correlation between the mantle angular velocity variations, the geomagnetic variations, and therefore the climate, allow us to predict future events : the current global warming which parallels the Earth's magnetic field decrease...|$|E
