Miller had led his battalion {{in the front}} line of the advance through the forest of Argonne, the enemy was met in a prepared position south of Gesnes. Though almost exhausted, he energetically reorganized his battalion and ordered an attack. Upon reaching open ground the advancing line began to waver in the face of machinegun fire from the front and flanks and direct artillery fire. Personally leading his command group forward between his front-line companies, Maj. Miller inspired his men by his personal courage, and they again pressed on toward the hostile position. As this officer led the renewed attack he was shot in the right leg, but he nevertheless staggered forward at the head of his command. Soon afterwards he was again shot in the right arm, but he continued the charge, personally cheering his troops on through the heavy machinegun fire. Just before the objective was reached he received a wound in the abdomen, which forced him to the ground, but he continued to urge his men on, telling them to push on to the next ridge and leave him where he lay. He died from his wounds a few days later.|$|E

However, with the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, his command was mobilised as part of 2nd Division in the British Expeditionary Force and sent to France. The brigade saw heavy combat at the Battle of Mons, where Davies was mentioned in despatches, but he was quickly worn down by his habit of always marching at the head of his brigade, which put him under heavy physical and <b>mental</b> <b>strain,</b> and from the lasting effects of an attack of pneumonia earlier in the year.

40|$|Background: Physical {{exercise}} during {{leisure time}} {{is known to}} increase physical capacity; however, the long-term effects on work ability and work strain are inconclusive. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of a 6 -month physical exercise program on work ability and work strain after 6 months and 30 months, among women with menopausal symptoms at baseline. Methods: A questionnaire including questions on work ability and work strain was mailed in the beginning, at 6 months and after 30 months after the intervention to occupationally active women participating in a randomized controlled study on physical exercise and quality of life. The intervention included aerobic exercise training 4 times per week, 50 minutes per session. Work ability was measured with the Work Ability Index (WAI) and with questions about physical and <b>mental</b> work <b>strain.</b> Results: Women aged 47 – 62 years (N =  89) who were occupationally active at baseline were included in the analyses. The increase in WAI from baseline to the end of the exercise intervention (6 months) was statistically significantly greater among the intervention group than among the control group (regression coefficient 2. 08; 95 % confidence interval 0. 71 – 3. 46). The difference between the groups persisted for 30 months. No significant short- or long-term effects on physical and <b>mental</b> work <b>strain</b> were found.

40|$|Background: high job strain {{increases}} the risk of health decline, but {{little is known about the}} specific consequences and long-term effects of job strain on old age health. Objectives: purpose was to investigate whether physical and <b>mental</b> job <b>strain</b> in midlife was associated with hospital care use in old age. Methods: study population included 5, 625 Finnish public sector employees aged 44 – 58 years who worked in blue- and white-collar professions in 1981. The number of in-patient hospital care days was collected from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register for the 28 -year follow-up period. Results: rates of hospital care days per 1, 000 person-years for men were 7. 78 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 7. 71 – 7. 84) for low, 9. 68 (95 % CI 9. 50 – 9. 74) for intermediate and 12. 56 (95 % CI 12. 47 – 12. 66) for high physical job strain in midlife. The corresponding rates for women were 6. 63 (95 % CI 6. 57 – 6. 68), 7. 91 (95 % CI 7. 87 – 7. 95) and 10. 35 (95 % CI 10. 25 – 10. 42), respectively. Rates were parallel but lower for <b>mental</b> job <b>strain.</b> Reporting high physical job strain in midlife increased the risk of hospital care in old age compared with those who reported low job strain, fully adjusted incidence rate ratio 1. 17 (95 % CI 1. 00 – 1. 38) for men and 1. 42 (95 % CI 1. 25 – 1. 61) for women. These associations were robust in analyses confined to hospital care that took place after the employees had turned 65 years. Conclusion: exposure to high mental and, particularly, high physical job strain in midlife may set employees on a higher healthcare use trajectory which persists into old age...|$|R

Suicide incidence is increasing. Within this context, Native American veterans are {{in a unique position to}} offer perspectives on alternative approaches to mental health care, and to help close this health gap. Native Americans are the demographic with the highest per-capita rate of military service. Additionally, many Native American veterans access health services outside the VA and other hospitals.
