50|$|During these years, Genicom leased {{offices in}} Calabasas, California. At this facility, {{development}} was being conducted on a 400 dot-per-inch <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printer.</b> In the early 1990s, GENICOM's headquarters and corporate offices were moved from Waynesboro, VA to Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with all}} Anoto pattern-based pens, the smartpen can only {{determine}} {{its position on}} the page when used with paper pre-printed with the dot pattern. Livescribe sells notebooks in several styles, and users can also print their own dot paper with a laser printer capable of at least 600 dpi. (A color or <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> works.) ...|$|E
5000|$|ISO/IEC 19752 Information {{technology}} [...] - [...] Method for {{the determination}} of toner cartridge yield for monochromatic electrophotographic printers and multi-function devices that contain printer components is an ISO standard method for {{the determination of}} toner cartridge yield for <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printers,</b> introduced in June 2004.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} {{electronic}} devices, {{the cost of}} <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> has fallen markedly over the years. In 1984, the HP LaserJet sold for $3500, had trouble with even small, low resolution graphics, and weighed 32 kg. , low-end <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> can sell for less than $75. These printers tend to lack onboard processing and rely on the host computer to generate a raster image, but outperform the 1984 LaserJet in nearly all situations.|$|R
50|$|Silverstone has a BS in Industrial Administration {{from the}} University of Illinois where, as a student, {{he worked with}} the IBM 650 in the {{registration}} and grading process. After a successful athletic fencing career which included three years as an all-American and representation of Canada internationally, he relocated to California. In 1973, while at Xerox Corp., he {{played an important role}} in the development of, and production of, the first corporate networked office. This Xerox (PARC) developed network included the first personal computers (Alto), the first high speed <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printers,</b> the first color <b>laser</b> <b>printer,</b> and the first Ethernet-based corporate-wide electronic network. In 1977, a complete network modeled on the Xerox network was installed in President Jimmy Carter’s White House.|$|R
50|$|The HP LaserJet 1012 is a low-end, <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> from Hewlett-Packard that {{retails for}} US $199.99 and was {{designed}} as an inexpensive laser alternative to Inkjet printers for home and small office use. It is capable of printing a maximum 15 pages per minute (although after many pages, the print speed slows down to prevent overheating, as the printer has no onboard fan) and has a 1200 dpi effective output (optical 600 dpi).|$|E
50|$|Besides {{traditional}} full-service {{copy and}} print shop services, all stores {{also provide a}} number of self-service features: color and monochrome photocopiers, fax machines, digital photo printer kiosks, and several desktop computer rentals, of which one always has an image scanner and some design software (mainly Adobe Systems applications) installed. The computers available for rental are connected {{to at least one}} color and one <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printer.</b> Some newer stores have only a color printer but charge less for monochrome prints. Most locations also have at least one or two empty seating areas for patrons to use their own laptop computers, using complimentary WiFi connections provided by AT&T. The stores also offer a selection of office supplies and business books for retail purchase.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} approach to conduct system level optimal parameter design for electrophotographic systems.

For comparison, the problem is solved using both single-objective and multi-objective optimization algorithms. Note that the proposed approach is also applicable to other complex systems...|$|E
5000|$|The HP LaserJet 5 was a {{group of}} <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> {{produced}} in the mid-1990s as part of the LaserJet series by Hewlett Packard (HP). [...] It was the successor to the HP LaserJet 4 series of printers. After the LaserJet 5 series, however, HP introduced a new naming convention for its LaserJet line. While the LaserJet 5L and 5P were replaced with the LaserJet 6L and 6P, there was never a LaserJet 6; the successor to the LaserJet 5/5M/5N/5se line was the LaserJet 4000 series, and the successor to the LaserJet 5si/5siMX/5siNX was the LaserJet 8000 series. In addition, the LaserJet 4V/4MV was not succeeded by a LaserJet 5 series printer, as its successor was the LaserJet 5000 series.|$|R
50|$|The HP LaserJet 4 (abbreviated {{sometimes}} to LJ4 or HP4) {{is a group}} of <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> produced in the early to mid-1990s as part of the LaserJet series by Hewlett Packard (HP). The 4 series has various models, including the standard LaserJet 4 for business use, the 4L for personal use and the 4P for small businesses. Additional models included the 4Si model, created as a heavy-duty business printer, and the 4V model, a B-size printer for desktop publishing and graphic artists. There are also PostScript variants of these machines with the '4M' designation, where M stands for, but is not limited to, usage with an Apple Macintosh. Hewlett Packard also released an upgraded version of the LaserJet 4/4M known as the 4 Plus ('4+')/4M Plus ('4M+').|$|R
50|$|In 1984, {{the company}} changed {{direction}} to make peripherals for Macintosh computers: the HyperDrive (the Mac's first internal hard drive), the WideWriter 360 large format inkjet printer, and the Personal <b>Laser</b> <b>Printer</b> (the first QuickDraw <b>laser</b> <b>printer).</b> Presently the company focuses exclusively on <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R

40|$|A new control {{configuration}} for {{laser printing}} process was proposed, which constructs a feedback controller for {{regulation of the}} motor/gear transmission subsystem using direct velocity measurement from the imaging component. Causal connection between banding artifact and transmission errors has been demonstrated previously. Two controller design approaches were suggested for reducing banding artifact. The proposed designs {{were based on the}} internal model principle and H-infinity robust control theories, both have two degree of freedom control structure. The controllers were implemented on a <b>monochrome</b> <b>laser</b> <b>printer,</b> for which latent images are formed on a cylindrical photoconductor drum. Experimental results showed significant reduction in the measured velocity error for the photoconcluctor drum as well as noticeable banding reduction on the printed images. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|LaserJet as a {{brand name}} {{identifies}} the line of dry electrophotographic (DEP) <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> marketed by the American computer company Hewlett-Packard (HP). The HP LaserJet was the world's first desktop <b>laser</b> <b>printer.</b> As of 2016, Canon supplies both mechanisms and cartridges for all HP's <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} inkjet, copier and <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> toners have been {{developed}} to utilize this process. This is the process developed at BlackLightning by Walter Jeffries in the 1980s for negatively charged <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> toners for use in black and white <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> like those from Apple, HP, Xerox, Canon and other vendors.|$|R
50|$|An {{in depth}} {{comparison}} of inkjet and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> suggest that <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are the ideal {{choice for a}} high quality, volume printer, while inkjet printers {{tend to focus on}} large-format printers and household units. <b>Laser</b> <b>printers</b> offer more precise edging and in-depth mono-chromatic color, but tend to cost more than a traditional inkjet printer.|$|R
50|$|Dataproducts later used Fuji Xerox engines {{for their}} Typhoon series of <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> The LZR1560/1580 was OEMed as the Apple LaserWriter Pro 810 in 1993. In 1998, the LZR 5200 {{continuous}} feed <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> was announced.|$|R
50|$|Although corona {{discharge}} is usually undesirable, until recently {{it was essential}} {{in the operation of}} photocopiers (xerography) and <b>laser</b> <b>printers.</b> Many modern copiers and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> now charge the photoconductor drum with an electrically conductive roller, reducing undesirable indoor ozone pollution.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>printer</b> speed {{can vary}} widely, and depends on many factors, {{including}} the graphic {{intensity of the}} job being processed. The fastest models can print over 200 monochrome pages per minute (12,000 pages per hour). The fastest color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> can print over 100 pages per minute (6000 pages per hour). Very high-speed <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are used for mass mailings of personalized documents, such as credit card or utility bills, and are competing with lithography in some commercial applications.|$|R
40|$|Color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> have fast {{printing}} {{speed and}} high resolution, and forgeries using color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> can cause significant harm to society. A source printer identification technique {{can be employed}} as a countermeasure to those forgeries. This paper presents a color <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> identification method based on cascaded learning of deep neural networks. The refiner network is trained by adversarial training to refine the synthetic dataset for halftone color decomposition. The halftone color decomposing ConvNet is trained with the refined dataset, and the trained knowledge is transferred to the printer identifying ConvNet to enhance the accuracy. The robustness about rotation and scaling is considered in training process, which is not considered in existing methods. Experiments are performed on eight color <b>laser</b> <b>printers,</b> and the performance is compared with several existing methods. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms existing source color <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> identification methods.

30|$|The {{character}} contour roughness of a <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> {{is expected}} to be less than that of an inkjet printer because character contours originated from <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> are smoother. This feature describes the degree of character contour roughness between the two printing techniques.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>printers</b> {{combine the}} best {{features}} of both printers and plotters. Like plotters, <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> offer high quality line art, and like dot-matrix printers, {{they are able}} to generate pages of text and raster graphics. Unlike either printers or plotters, however, a <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> makes it possible to position high-quality graphics and text on the same page. PostScript made it possible to fully exploit these characteristics, by offering a single control language that could be used on any brand of printer.|$|R
30|$|Via Adobe® Photoshop® CC 2018, {{we could}} {{successfully}} track all active security features {{characteristic of the}} color <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> of Xerox® brand.
