25|$|The {{three major}} {{employers}} of career physicists are academic institutions, laboratories, and private industries, {{with the largest}} employer being the last. Physicists in academia or government labs tend to have titles such as Assistants, Professors, Sr./Jr. Scientist, or postdocs. As per the American Institute for Physics, some 20% of new physics Ph.D.s holds jobs in engineering development programs, while 14% turn to computer software and about 11% are in business/education. A majority of physicists employed apply their skills and training to interdisciplinary sectors (e.g. finance). Job titles for graduate physicists include Agricultural Scientist, Air Traffic Controller, Biophysicist, Computer Programmer, Electrical Engineer, Environmental Analyst, Geophysicist, <b>Medical</b> <b>Physicist,</b> Meteorologist, Oceanographer, Physics Teacher/Professor/Researcher, Physiognomist, Research Scientist, Reactor Physicist, Engineering Physicist, Satellite Missions Analyst, Science Writer, Stratigrapher, Software Engineer, Systems Engineer, Microelectronics Engineer, Radar Developer, Technical Consultant, etc.|$|E

This is particularly evident in cancer care where <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> are involved in radiotherapy treatment planning and quality assurance as well as in imaging and radiation protection. Due to the large variety of tasks and interests, medical physics is often subdivided into specialties such as radiology, nuclear medicine and radiation oncology medical physics.

2500|$|One of Stoney's sons, George Gerald Stoney FRS, was a scientist, his {{daughter}} Florence Stoney OBE was a radiologist while {{his daughter}} Edith {{is considered to}} be the first woman <b>medical</b> <b>physicist.</b> But a more scientifically notable relative was Stoney's nephew, the Dublin-based physicist George FitzGerald (1851–1901). Stoney and FitzGerald were in regular communication on scientific matters. In addition, on political matters, both Stoney and FitzGerald were active opponents of the Irish Home Rule Movement. In their political opinion, the spirit of Irish Home Rule and later Irish nationalism was contrary to the spirit of science. Stoney resigned from his job as Secretary of Queen's University of Ireland in 1882 in objection to a government decision to introduce [...] "sectarianism" [...] into the system; i.e., Stoney wanted to keep the system non-denominational, but the government acceded to Irish Catholic demands for Catholic institutions.|$|E

40|$|In many {{countries}} {{the education and}} training of <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> {{has changed over the}} last few decades from being rather ad hoc to becoming structured with residency programs becoming quite common. These are often followed by formal certification by independent bodies, and medical physics professional organizations (MPPOs) affirming the quality of certified physicists and recognizing their competence and ability to practice independently. Policies on the training and education of <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> have been developed by the International Organization for Medical Physics (IOMP) and by the Asia- Oceania Federation of Organizations for Medical Physics (AFOMP). Currently nine countries in Asia-Oceania operate systems for the certification of clinical <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> and four others are planning or implementing such systems.

This core curriculum for <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> in radiology is issued jointly by the European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics (EFOMP) and the European Society of Radiology (ESR). It provides guidelines for the education and training of <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> in <b>medical</b> imaging.

The proposed SKIIR is mainly designed for sharing knowledge based on specific cases of treating patients with cancer. Integrated Information and Knowledge are captured for storing knowledge and medical information related to the specific cases of interest, in any useful form and format, for the <b>medical</b> <b>physicists.</b> Various patient cases’ descriptions and related documents of primary interest for the <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> are stored and organized for future use in a multimedia library including short descriptions, radiotherapy planning, ultrasound, CT and MRI images, statistical information, bibliography, discharge letters, etc. Codification of knowledge and preservation of anonymity is also discussed...|$|R

The survey contained eight multiple-choice questions, a ranking question, and seven free text questions. The survey was sent to <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> associated with cancer centers across Canada. The respondents to the survey expressed interest in having guidelines to help them in their software-related work, but also demonstrated extensive skills in the area of testing, safety, and com-munication.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this article is to {{understand}} the way in which <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> take into account treatment effectiveness and safety when selecting a treatment plan, with respect to the medical prescription and the technical, human and organizational resources available. Data-gathering was based on the allo-confrontation method: 14 <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> from five different treatment centers commented on real treatment plans that had been drawn up by their colleagues. Results show that <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> have two means at their disposal to control treatment effectiveness and safety: risk avoidance and risk reduction. Risk avoidance is achieved when conceiving the treatment solution. Risk reduction occurs after the design of the plan and consists in accompanying and assisting the radiographers at the work station where the treatment is carried out...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{damage and}} loss of life caused by the March 11 th earthquake-generated tsunami in Japan, and the resulting emergency at the Fukushima—Daiichi nuclear power facility, raise once again {{the question of the}} role of knowledgeable civilians in responding to public health emergencies. In the case of a radiological emergency, <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> are among the more knowledgeable individuals in the private sector with regard to several relevant issues including radiation exposures and risks, radioactive contamination, and the fear of radiation that make management of a radiological emergency so difficult. The challenges for <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> are to know the consequences of radiation exposure and radioactive contamination, to separate fantasy from fact in dealing with these consequences, and to address the consequences in a manner that instils confidence rather than fear in those who are less knowledgeable. All <b>medical</b> <b>physicists</b> should be knowledgeable about radiological emergencies and prepared to respond to an emergency if one occurs in their vicinity. Four types of radiological emergency would potentially expose large numbers of people to high amounts of radiation and require an emergency response that involves <b>medical</b> <b>physicists.</b> These types of events are (1) the detonation of a nuclear weapon or improvised nuclear de- vice, with an impact on the order of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs, or possibly larger; (2) a crisis at a nuclear power plant, including...|$|R
