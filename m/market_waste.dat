Currently, the government has no other cheaper and easier options than landfill. Dumping of organic waste materials into the environment will partly contribute to the global warming phenomenon due to methane gas generation through anaerobic process, occurred inside the landfill or river bed. Methane gas has 21 times higher global warming potential (GWP) than carbon dioxide and can severely affect the environment if not properly managed. Therefore this paper will highlight the concept of biorefinery to enhance the current state of halal food waste handling which include kitchen waste, waste cooking oil, food waste, landscaping and garden waste, wet <b>market</b> <b>waste,</b> night <b>market</b> <b>waste,</b> halal slaughterhouse waste, food processing facility waste and other types of halal waste.
