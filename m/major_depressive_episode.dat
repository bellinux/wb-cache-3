25|$|Symptoms of the {{depressive}} {{phase of}} bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of sadness, irritability or anger, loss {{of interest in}} previously enjoyed activities, excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, sleeping too much or not enough, changes in appetite and/or weight, fatigue, problems concentrating, self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. In severe cases, the individual may develop symptoms of psychosis, a condition also known as severe bipolar disorder with psychotic features. These symptoms include delusions and hallucinations.

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} linked smoking to anxiety disorders, {{suggesting}} the correlation (and possibly mechanism) {{may be related}} to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship. Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced a major depressive disorder at some time in their lives than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. People with major depression are also much less likely to quit due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse.|$|E

25|$|The causes are {{not clearly}} understood, but both {{environmental}} and genetic factors play a role. Many genes of small effect contribute to risk. Environmental factors include {{a history of}} childhood abuse, and long-term stress. The condition is divided into bipolar I disorder {{if there has been}} at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no manic episodes) and one <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration, the condition cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed. If due to drugs or medical problems, it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present in a similar manner include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder {{as well as a number}} of medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis, though blood tests or medical imaging can be done to rule out other problems.|$|E
25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode</b> {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{actions of}} 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to {{high doses of}} trazodone. Doses of trazodone lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H1 and α1-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT2C inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia {{is one of the}} most frequent residual symptoms of depression after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of trazodone to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby trazodone can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants.|$|E

2500|$|Given his {{reported}} symptoms, one modern view is {{that his}} death {{was a result of}} syphilis, which he may have contracted during his student days, and which would have remained latent during most of his marriage. According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar Eric Sams, Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of mercury poisoning, mercury at this time being a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a [...] "gelatinous" [...] tumor {{at the base of the}} brain; it may have represented a colloid cyst, a craniopharyngioma, a chordoma, or a chordoid meningioma. In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations, such as Schumann reported. It has also been hypothesised that he may have suffered from either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and bipolar II disorder. Other sources have supported a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, citing his mood swings and changes in productivity. Schumann did indeed hear an [...] "A" [...] at the end of his life. It was a form of tinnitus, or perhaps an auditory hallucination related to his <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> At times, he had musical hallucinations which were longer than just the single [...] "A", but his diaries include comments from him about hearing that annoying single note. However, he didn't go mad from hearing it; he was suffering from a <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode,</b> and he experienced problems with his mental health long before he mentioned the tinnitus.|$|E
2500|$|The Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI) is a {{behavioral}} rating checklist created by Dr. Kenneth Gadow and Dr. Joyce Sprafkin that assesses {{a range of}} behaviors related to common emotional and behavior disorders identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episode,</b> mania, dysthymic disorder (now pervasive depressive disorder in DSM-5), schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder, anorexia, and bulimia. In addition, one or two key symptoms {{of each of the}} following disorders are also included: obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, panic attack, motor tics, vocal tics, and substance use. [...] CASI combines the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) and the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI), letting it apply to both children and adolescents ages 5 to 18. The CASI is a self-report questionnaire completed by the child's caregiver or teacher to detect signs of psychiatric disorders in multiple settings. Compared to other widely used checklists for youths, the CASI maps more closely to DSM diagnoses, with scoring systems that map to the diagnostic criteria as well as providing a severity score. Other measures {{are more likely to have}} used statistical methods, such as factor analysis, to group symptoms that often occur together; if they have DSM-oriented scales, they are often later additions that only include some of the diagnostic criteria. It is not yet clear scientifically whether a statistical or DSM-oriented approach is more useful at a clinical level. The CASI provides a low burden way of gathering a lot of information quickly about common problems, helping the clinician and family decide where to focus attention during interviews and treatment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{serotonin}} transporter 5 -HTT imaging to investigate <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> disorder (MDD) and antidepressant occupancy. Such investigations {{have only recently}} been possible {{as a result of}} major advances in ligand development. The state of the art method is [11 C] DASB PET or [11 C]- 3 -amino- 4 -(2 -dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl) -benzonitrile) positron emission tomography. [11 C]DASB is a breakthrough for brain imaging 5 -HTT. Compared with previous radioligands, [11 C]DASB offers both high selectivity and a favourable ratio of specific binding relative to free and nonspecific binding. These characteristics contribute to valid, reliable quantitation of the 5 -HTT binding potential (BP). The 5 -HTT BP can be viewed as an index of 5 -HTT density in a medication free state, or unblocked 5 -HTT density in a medication-treated state. During <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> with no other axis I comorbidity, either no difference in regional 5 -HTT BP or a trend toward elevated 5 -HTT BP is typically found. During <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> (of MDD) with more severe symptoms of pessimism (dysfunctional attitudes), regional 5 -HTT BP is elevated. In subjects with <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and comorbid axis I psychiatric illnesses, decreased regional 5 -HTT BP is often reported. With selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment at doses that distinguish from placebo in the treatment of <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> 5 -HTT occupancy is approximately 80 %, and there is a strong relation between plasma level and occupancy that is not predictable based on affinity alone. Implications of 5 -HTT imaging findings for understanding <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> disorder and antidepressant treatment will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Aims. To prospectively {{examine whether}} {{negative}} life events (NLE) and low perceived coping efficacy (CE) {{increase the risk}} for the onset of various forms of psychopathology and low CE mediates the associations between NLE and incident mental disorders. Methods. A representative community sample of {{adolescents and young adults}} (N= 3017, aged 14 - 24 at baseline) was prospectively followed up in up to three assessment waves over 10 years. Anxiety, depressive and substance use disorders were assessed at each wave using the DSM-IV/M-CIDI. NLE and CE were assessed at baseline with the Munich Event List and the Scale for Self-Control and Coping Skills. Associations (odds ratios, OR) of NLE and CE at baseline with incident mental disorders at follow-up were estimated using logistic regressions adjusted for sex and age. Results. NLE at baseline predicted the onset of any disorder, any anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder, any depression, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> dysthymia, any substance use disorder, nicotine dependence and abuse/dependence of illicit drugs at follow-up (OR 1. 02 - 1. 09 per one NLE more). When adjusting for any other lifetime disorder prior to baseline, merely the associations of NLE with any anxiety disorder, any depression, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> dysthymia and any substance use disorder remained significant (OR 1. 02 - 1. 07). Low CE at baseline predicted the onset of any disorder, any anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, generalised anxiety disorder, any depression, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> dysthymia, any substance use disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence and abuse/dependence of illicit drugs at follow-up (OR 1. 16 - 1. 72 per standard deviation). When adjusting for any other lifetime disorder prior to baseline, only the associations of low CE with any depression, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> dysthymia, any substance use disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence and abuse/dependence of illicit drugs remained significant (OR 1. 15 - 1. 64). Low CE explained 9. 46, 13. 39, 12. 65 and 17. 31 % of the associations between NLE and any disorder, any depression, <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and dysthymia, respectively. When adjusting for any other lifetime disorder prior to baseline, the reductions in associations for any depression (9. 77 %) and <b>major</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> (9. 40 %) remained significant, while the reduction in association for dysthymia was attenuated to non-significance (p-value> 0. 05). Conclusions. Our findings suggest that NLE and low perceived CE elevate the risk for various incident mental disorders and that low CE partially mediates the association between NLE and incident depression.
