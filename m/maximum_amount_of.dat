5|$|A microbrewery, or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E

Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once {{a certain number of}} Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E
5|$|The gharial has {{undergone}} a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E

40|$|Delay {{discounting}} research {{determines how}} {{the value of}} an outcome is affected by delay to its receipt. Research so far shows that consumable outcomes are discounted more steeply by delay than money. Prior studies, however, have used large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> the outcomes (e. g. $ 100 worth) that would not typically be consumed in one bout, unlike the corresponding <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money (e. g. $ 100). This experiment examined whether small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> food would be discounted more steeply than money, as occurs with larger amounts. One hundred and two adults indicated their preferences in a series of choices for two hypothetical outcome types: immediate versus delayed food and immediate versus delayed money. Participants made choices involving either relatively small <b>maximum</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> food ($ 10 worth) and money ($ 10) or for relatively large <b>maximum</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> food ($ 100 worth) and money ($ 100). In the within-subject comparisons, food was discounted more steeply by delay than money for both groups. In the between-subject comparisons, different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> the commodities were affected similarly by delay. Overall, these results suggest that steeper discounting of consumable outcomes than money is a fairly robust phenomenon, occurring with relatively small <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> outcomes as well as with larger amounts...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantity}} and quality of farmland is the key factor determining grain production capacity, so protecting farmland has become the key to guaranteeing food security. I take Anshan City in Liaoning Province as the study area which has its own particularity in terms of protecting farmland. Based on the prediction of population, coupled with the relevant data concerning farmland area, the per unit area yield of grain, the prediction and analysis of the balance of supply and demand of farmland in Anshan City are conducted. The results show that in the year 2010, the <b>maximum</b> supply <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> farmland that the city can offer is 239000 hm 2, and in the year 2020 the <b>maximum</b> supply <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> farmland that the city can offer will be 238000 hm 2; in the year 2010, the <b>maximum</b> demand <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> farmland is 204186. 02 hm 2, and in the year 2020 the <b>maximum</b> supply <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> farmland will be 226409. 61 hm 2.

The characterization of organic matter indudes the determination of buk parameters (hydrogen index values and C/N ratios) and the analysis of specific biomarkers (n-alaknes, fatty acids, alkenones, and pigments). Total organic carbon (TOC) values vary between 0. 3 and 2 %. In general, the organic matter from the Laptev Sea continental margin is dominated by terrigenous matter throughout. However. significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> marine organic carbon occur. The turbidites, according to a still preliminary stratigraphy probably deposited during glacial Oxygen Isotope Stages 2 and 4, are characterized by <b>maximum</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> organic carbon of terrigenous origin.
