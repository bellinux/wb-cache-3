40|$|To compare dry eye {{symptoms}} after LASIK with mechanical keratome-created flaps and {{femtosecond laser}} keratome-created flaps {{as well as}} to analyze the efficacy of Systane® Ultra <b>Monodose</b> used to prevent and to treat transient dry eye after excimer laser surgery. Methods: 98 patients (194 eyes) with myopia and compound myopic astigmatism who underwent excimer laser surgery were included in the study. In group 1 patients with pre-op dry eye, femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK was performed, Systane® Ultra <b>Monodose</b> was prescribed postoperatively. In group 2 patients with pre-op dry eye, LASIK was performed using mechanical microkeratome, Systane® Ultra <b>Monodose</b> was prescribed postoperatively. In group 3 patients without pre-op dry eye, LASIK was performed using mechanical microkeratome, standard anti-inflammatory therapy without any lubricant eye drops was prescribed. Patients were followed up for 60 days. Results: It was demonstrated that excimer laser surgery provokes transient dry eye in all patients, therefore, artificial tears are required for 2 months and more after the surgery. Post-operative lubricant eye drops use improves tear film stability, tear production, tear osmolarity, and objective signs of dry eye. Femtosecond laser decreases clinical and functional symptoms of transient dry eye as compared with mechanical microkeratome and provides more rapid visual recovery. Conclusion: Systane® Ultra <b>Monodose</b> has both high efficiency and good tolerability. It can be recommended for the prevention and treatment of dry eye following excimer laser surgery. </p...|$|E

Methods: Fifteen (12 female, three male, medium age 39 &plusmn; 9 years) dSCL wearers were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were Ocular Surface Disease Index (ODSI) symptom questionnaire score &gt; 12, tear film break-up time (TFBUT) &lt; 10 sec, Schirmer test I &gt; 10 mm over five minutes, mild punctuate keratopathy, and conjunctival staining (Oxford grading &le; 4). <b>Monodose</b> Xiloial eyedrops were administered three times daily for a two-month period. Patients were evaluated at enrollment, after three days of washout (baseline), and after one and two months of treatment, by OSDI score, Schirmer test I, TFBUT, ferning test, ocular surface damage (Oxford grade), and serum albumin in tears (index of passive exudation related to serum leakage). Results: At endpoint versus baseline, respectively, the mean &plusmn; standard deviation of all variables improved as follows: OSDI (8. 5 &plusmn; 3 versus 20. 2 &plusmn; 1. 6); TFBUT (9. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 versus 7. 1 &plusmn; 1. 0); Oxford grading (0. 5 &plusmn; 0. 1 versus 3. 6 &plusmn; 0. 8); ferning test (2 &plusmn; 1 versus 2. 4 &plusmn; 0. 5); and Schirmer test I (14. 6 &plusmn; 1. 1 versus 12 &plusmn; 2. 1), with P &lt; 0. 05 for all variables (Friedman and Wilcoxon tests).

40|$|An old {{problem of}} topical dermo-cosmesis and {{dermatology}} {{is represented by}} the quantity of product or drug that the subjecy applies and its compositions in terms of number and concentration of ingredients. Many (perhaps all) of the dermatologists must be accustomed to using outdated terminology and generic descriptions, which includes phrases like "two applications per day" or "a veil at evening" and so on. The truth is that {{we do not know how}} much product or medication the subject apply. Vitamins A, C and E are joined by a common difficulty in formulation: the first and last with fat-soluble character, the second water-soluble; they are active in the biologically free form, highly instable to light and oxygen. This has meant that strategies have been developed to make them usable in dermatology. Do not underestimate the aspect of pleasantness that the finished product must have.

40|$|Viscous poly(ortho ester) (POE), a {{promising}} polymer for controlled release {{is being investigated}} as an injectable drug delivery system for peptides, for antiproliferative agents after glaucoma filtering surgery and for antibiotics {{in the treatment of}} periodontitis. Due to the chemical lability of POE, the strategies for obtaining a sterile product are limited to aseptic processing and terminal sterilization using high energy radiation. In {{the first part of the}} present investigation, we used electron-paramagnetic-resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to evaluate radical formation and radical-induced polymer degradation after irradiation treatment. Due to the viscous nature of POE, radicals were only found at low temperatures or by using the method of ‘spin-trapping’. Several radical species could be distinguished by a variation of the microwave power and the differences of the thermal stability of the radicals. The incorporation of 5 -fluorouracil accelerates the degradation of the polymer. In the second part, we have compared the effects of the two commonly applied methods for irradiation sterilization (i. e. gamma and beta rays) on POE and on POE with incorporated 5 -fluorouracil and compared these methods to aseptically prepared devices. In addition, we have checked the possibility of preventing radical-induced degradation using two different protecting agents: α-tocopherol at a concentration of 0. 1 % (w/w) and sterilization under nitrogen monoxide. The weight and number average molecular weight of POE decreased drastically after irradiation treatment and subsequent to irradiation, an accelerated degradation was observed. Generally it was found that higher molecular weight polymers are more affected and that gamma irradiation leads to more degradation than beta treatment. Also, the addition of protecting agents did not significantly prevent polymer degradation. Therefore, we have concluded that irradiation sterilization of POE is not a viable process and aseptic preparation is preferred. Without sterilization POE is stable for about 1 year when kept as <b>monodoses</b> at low temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Pulmonary {{inflammation}} is {{an important}} therapeutic target in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, aiming to limit and delay the lung damage. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to produce respirable engineered particles of ketoprofen lysinate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug able to fight lung inflammatory status by direct administration to the site of action. Micronized drug powders containing leucine as dispersibility enhancer were prepared by co-spray drying the active compound and the excipient from water or hydro-alcoholic feeds. Microparticles were fully characterized in terms of process yield, particle size distribution, morphology and drug content. The ability of the drug to reach the deepest airways after aerosolization of spray-dried formulations was evaluated by Andersen cascade impactor, using the <b>monodose</b> DPI as device. In order to investigate the behaviour of the drug once in contact with lung fluid, an artificial CF mucus was prepared. Drug permeation properties were evaluated interposing the mucus layer between the drug and a synthetic membrane mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells. Finally, the effect of the engineered particles on vitality of human airway epithelial cells of patients homozygous for ΔF 508 CF (CuFi 1) was studied and compared to that of raw active compound. Results indicated that powders engineering changed the diameter and shape of the particles, making them suitable for inhalation. The mucus layer in the donor compartment of vertical diffusion cells slowed down drug dissolution and permeation, leucine having no influence. Cell proliferation studies evidenced that the spray drying process together with the addition of leucine reduced the cytotoxic effect of ketoprofen lysine salt as raw material, making the ketoprofen lysinate DPI a very promising product for the inflammation control in CF patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research in this thesis was to investigate two aspects of the de-agglomeration of cohesive materials in respiratory delivery, i. e. the influence of cohesive material properties {{and the influence of}} the inhaler device characteristics. Firstly, the thesis focussed on the characterisation of cohesive powder behaviour during aerosolisation at a sequence of air flow rates to understanding the micro-structure of the powder bed. This part of the thesis determined the relative de-agglomeration as a function of air flow rate of micronized drugs, in particular salbutamol sulphate (SS) and various lactoses using a simple powder inhaler device. The study was extended to the investigation of the de-agglomeration efficiencies of binary mixtures of SS and lactohale 300 (LH 300) in the ratios of SS:LH 300 of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4 and 1 : 8. The data were modelled using non-linear least square regression and sigmoidal equation parameters were used to characterise single components and binary mixtures. Secondly, the thesis determined to correlate kinetics of emptying and kinetics of de-agglomeration for the powders aerosolised from inhaler devices. This second part of the thesis investigated the kinetics of powder emptying and de-agglomeration of single component systems using three model inhaler devices, Rotahaler® (RH), <b>Monodose</b> Inhaler® (MI) and Handihaler® (HH). The study correlated the rate constants for emptying and de-agglomeration for the powders aerosolised from inhaler devices. Due to the differences in inhaler design, the role of pressure drop across the device and sensitivity of the device on powder de-agglomeration was also studied. The primary particle size distribution of the materials was achieved through wet dispersion of powders using laser diffraction. The powders (single components and binary mixtures) were processed with a validated laboratory mixing technique prior to aerosolisation. The content uniformity of binary mixtures was assessed using a validated UV spectrophotometric assay. The real time particle size distributions of the aerosolised plume were obtained using laser diffraction following aerosolisation from inhaler devices at various air flow rates (30 - 180 l min- 1). The in-vitro performance of SS-LH 300 mixtures were assessed using custom-made jet diameters of stage 1 of the twin stage liquid impinger with drug assayed by a validated HPLC assay. Images of the powders were captured using scanning electron microscopy. The significance (p< 0. 05) was obtained from ANOVA and t-test using SPSS software. Relative de-agglomeration vs. air flow rate profiles of SS and LH 300 and the estimated parameters obtained from modelling with sigmoid three parameter equation defined comparative powder micro-structures of cohesive powders. The maximum relative de-agglomeration of SS was much higher than LH 300 at higher air flow rates. In contrast, the relative de-agglomeration of LH 300 was higher than SS at low air flow rates. The de-agglomeration vs. air flow rate profiles of cohesive mixtures of SS and LH 300 demonstrated improved powder de-agglomeration with increased content of LH 300 in SS-LH 300 binary mixtures. The study showed that the cohesive materials did not behave independently and that the particle interactions occurring in the powder bed resulted in SS rich and SS poor regions of the aerosolised plume depending on the air flow rate. The parameters obtained from sigmoid three parameter equation provided an understanding of structural changes of binary mixtures (SS and LH 300) and SS with increased proportion of LH 300 in the mixture. Prolonged powder emptying was observed with inhaler devices, MI and HH in contrast to RH where powder emptied within a second. The emitted mass vs. time profiles were modelled using a mono-exponential equation to estimate the rate constant of powder emptying (kCCEM). In general, with both materials, the relative kCCEM followed the order: MI<HH<RH. However, the kCCEM between the materials depended on powder micro-structure of the materials. Similar to kCCEM, the rate of de-agglomeration (kd) from the three inhaler devices followed first-order kinetics. The rate constants i. e., kCCEM and kd were influenced by air flow rate, micro-structure of powder bed and device design. Profiles of kCCEM vs. kd resulted in linear relations for MI and HH where the slopes were 1. 0 and 0. 8 for MI and HH respectively. The capsule characteristics are very important in controlling kCCEM and kd, while the variability in kCCEM and kd was due to the design of the capsule chamber. The relative de-agglomeration as a function of pressure drop between the materials depended on the inhaler device; however; at 4 kPa pressure drop, the mechanism imparted by MI was more efficient in de-agglomerating both materials. The device sensitivity to pressure drop depended on the micro-structure of the powder. The outcomes of this thesis provided an approach to characterise the cohesive powders enabling a better understanding of micro-structures of the cohesive powders for inhalation. In addition, this study provided a way to define emptying and de-agglomeration rate of powders from inhalers to enable the use these rate constants to study both powder and device characteristics in improving inhaler design to achieve better and more reliable performance...|$|E
