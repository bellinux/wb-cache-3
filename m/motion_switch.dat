It features all six action buttons arranged in an arcade-like matter with the LXR buttons on the top row and the YBA buttons on the bottom (similar to the Capcom Power Stick Fighter), as well as six turbo switches for each button and slow <b>motion</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|These arcade style {{joysticks}} {{have two}} pairs of 'A' and 'B' buttons, located {{on either side of}} a metal joystick {{in the center of the}} controller. At the top are two 'auto fire' dials, one for each pair of 'A' and 'B' buttons, and are trademarked as 'dial-a-speed'. The Nintendo Entertiainment System version contains a 'Start' button, a 'Select' button, and a slow <b>motion</b> <b>switch</b> located to the right of the auto-fire dials, with the 'Beeshu Inc' logo located between them. On the Sega Master System version, the two buttons and switch are not present, with the logo being enlarged to cover the unused area.|$|E

In this Letter, we report the first direct studies of ferroelectric capacitor switching on a submicrosecond time scale. Simultaneous domain imaging and sub-µs transient current measurements establish a direct relationship between polarization P(t) and domain kinetics. Switching times scale with capacitor size over an order of magnitude.

40|$|Dynamic {{behaviors}} of a particle (or a bouncing ball) in a generalized Fermi-acceleration oscillator are investigated. The <b>motion</b> <b>switching</b> of a particle in the Fermi-oscillator causes {{the complexity and}} unpredictability of motion. Thus, the mechanism of <b>motion</b> <b>switching</b> of a particle in such a generalized Fermi-oscillator is studied through the theory of discontinuous dynamical systems, and the corresponding analytical conditions for the <b>motion</b> <b>switching</b> are developed. From solutions of linear systems in subdomains, four generic mappings are introduced, and mapping structures for periodic motions can be constructed. Thus, periodic motions in the Fermi-acceleration oscillator are predicted analytically, and the corresponding local stability and bifurcations are also discussed. From the analytical prediction, parameter maps of periodic and chaotic motions are achieved for a global view of motion behaviors in the Fermi-acceleration oscillator. Numerical simulations are carried out for illustrations of periodic and chaotic motions in such an oscillator. In existing results, <b>motion</b> <b>switching</b> in the Fermi-acceleration oscillator is not considered. The <b>motion</b> <b>switching</b> for many <b>motion</b> states of the Fermi-acceleration oscillator is presented for the first time. This methodology will provide a useful way to determine dynamical behaviors in the Fermi-acceleration oscillator...|$|R

Based on such analytic conditions of <b>motion</b> <b>switching,</b> {{the influence of the}} maximal static friction torque and the driving torque on the stick motion is studied. Moreover, the sliding time bifurcation diagrams, duty cycle figures, time history diagrams, and the K-function time history diagram are also presented, which confirm the analytic results.

40|$|A regime-switching {{geometric}} Brownian {{motion is}} used to model a geometric Brownian motion with its coefficients changing randomly according to a Markov chain. In this work, we give a complete characterization of the recurrent property of this process. The long time behavior of this process such as its $p$-th moment is also studied. Moreover, the quantitative properties of the regime-switching geometric Brownian <b>motion</b> with two-state <b>switching</b> are investigated to show the difference between geometric Brownian <b>motion</b> with <b>switching</b> and without switching.

40|$|AbstractWe study {{existence}} and continuity of self-intersection local time (SILT) for a Gaussian S′(Rd) -valued process which arises as a high-density fluctuation limit of a particle system in Rd, where the particle <b>motion</b> <b>switches</b> {{back and forth}} between symmetric stable processes of indices α 1 and α 2 at exponential time intervals. We prove that SILT exists if and only if d< 2 min{α 1,α 2 }. This means that existence of SILT is determined by the “most mobile” of the two types, and we interpret this result in terms of the particle picture.

40|$|Brownian {{motion in}} a {{granular}} gas in a homogeneous cooling state is studied theoretically and {{by means of}} molecular dynamics. We use the simplest first-principle model for the impact-velocity dependent restitution coefficient, as it follows for the model of viscoelastic spheres. We reveal that {{for a wide range}} of initial conditions the ratio of granular temperatures of Brownian and bath particles demonstrates complicated non-monotonous behavior, which results in transition between different regimes of Brownian dynamics: It starts from the ballistic <b>motion,</b> <b>switches</b> later to superballistic one and turns at still later times into subdiffusion; eventually normal diffusion is achieved. Our theory agrees very well with the MD results, although extreme computational costs prevented to detect the final diffusion regime. Qualitatively, the reported intermediate diffusion regimes are generic for granular gases with any realistic dependence of the restitution coefficient on the impact velocity...|$|R

To elucidate the partitioning mechanisms, we simultaneously analysed {{movements of the}} plasmid and the SopA ATPase in single living cells. SopA, which is a putative motor protein assembled densely near nucleoid borders and formed a single discrete focus associated with less dense filamentous distribution along the long axis of the cell. The dense SopA focus oscillates between cell poles. The direction of the plasmid <b>motion</b> <b>switches</b> as the SopA focus switches its position. The velocity of the plasmid motion stays constant while it oscillates moving towards the SopA focus. The low density filamentous distribution of SopA persisted throughout the SopA oscillation.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of natural convection {{is presented to}} examine {{the influence of a}} horizontal temperature gradient and a concentration gradient occurring from the bottom to the cold wall in a cavity. As the solutal buoyancy force changes from augmenting to opposing the thermal buoyancy force, the fluid <b>motion</b> <b>switches</b> from unicellular to multicellular flow (fluid motion is up the cold wall and down the hot wall for the bottom counterrotating flow cell). Qualitatively, the agreement between predicted streamlines and smoke flow patterns is generally good. In contrast, agreement between measured and predicted temperature and concentration distributions ranges from fair to poor. Part of the discrepancy can be attributed to experimental error. However, there remains considerable discrepancy between data and predictions due to the idealizations of the mathematical model, which examines only first-order physical effects. An unsteady flow, variable thermophysical properties, conjugate effects, species interdiffusion, and radiation were not accounted for in the model...|$|R

40|$|We use an N-body {{simulation}} {{to study}} the 3 D density distribution of spirals and the resulting stellar vertical velocities. Relative to the disc's rotation, the phase of the spiral's peak density away from the mid-plane trails that at the mid-plane. In addition, at fixed radius the density distribution is azimuthally skewed, having a shallower slope on the trailing side inside corotation and switching to shallower on the leading side beyond corotation. The spirals induce non-zero average vertical velocities, 〈Vz〉, as large as 〈Vz〉 ∼ 10 – 20 [*]km[*]s− 1, consistent with recent observations in the Milky Way. The vertical motions are compressive (towards the mid-plane) as stars enter the spiral, and expanding (away from the mid-plane) as they leave it. Since stars enter the spiral on the leading side outside corotation and on the trailing side within corotation, the relative phase of the expanding and compressive <b>motions</b> <b>switches</b> sides at corotation. Moreover, because stars always enter the spiral on the shallow density gradient side and exit on the steeper side, the expanding motions are larger than the compressing motion...|$|R

Here we review our recent experimental progress to utilize novel DNA nanostructures for self-assembly {{as well as for}} templates in the fabrication of functional nano-patterned materials. We have prototyped a new DNA nanostructure known as a cross structure. This nanostructure has a 4 -fold symmetry which promotes its self-assembly into tetragonal 2 D lattices. We have utilized the tetragonal 2 D lattices as templates for highly conductive metallic nanowires and periodic 2 D protein nano-arrays. We have constructed and characterized a DNA nanotube, a new selfassembling superstructure composed of DNA tiles. We have also demonstrated an aperiodic DNA lattice composed of DNA tiles assembled around a long scaffold strand; the system translates information encoded in the scaffold strand into a specific and reprogrammable barcode pattern.

The reinforcement function has become the critical component for its effect of evaluating the action and guiding the learning process. We present an augmented reward function that provides a new way for RL controller to incorporate prior knowledge and experience into the RL controller. Also, the difference form of augmented reward function is considered carefully. The additional reward beyond conventional reward will provide more heuristic information for RL. In this paper, we present a strategy for the task of complex skill learning. Automatic robot shaping policy is to dissolve the complex skill into a hierarchical learning process.
