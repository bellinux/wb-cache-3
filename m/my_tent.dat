At the time, Norton lived in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is located minutes outside of TNA's headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee and commented that wrestling is, [...] "something I enjoy doing. You miss it. I can still perform at a high level. [...] I’m still a big, strong man. I would like to give it another shot.

2500|$|Following {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the U.S. Army {{prepared}} to depart Northern Mexico. [...] By this time Borginnes' second husband had left herwhether by death or abandonment is unknown.

[...] Come, my beauties, don't all speak at oncewho is the lucky man?" [...] Eventually a dragoon named either Davis or David E. volunteered, on condition that a priest perform the marriage ceremony. [...] Her response to this was, [...] "Bring your blanket to <b>my</b> <b>tent</b> tonight and I will learn you to tie a knot that will satisfy you, I reckon!" ...|$|E
60|$|With these {{thoughts}} I resolved to remove <b>my</b> <b>tent</b> {{from the place}} where it stood, which was just under the hanging precipice of the hill, and which, if it should be shaken again, would certainly fall upon <b>my</b> <b>tent.</b> And I spent the two next days, being the 19th and 20th of April, in contriving where and how to remove my habitation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{it be the}} King's permission,' I said, 'I {{will not}} strike <b>my</b> <b>tents</b> till the third day and I will see this man. The mercy of the King is God-like, and {{rebellion}} is like unto the sin of witchcraft. Moreover, both the bottles and another be empty.' ...|$|R

6000|$|That orbed maiden {{with white}} fire laden, [...] 45 Whom mortals call the Moon, Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor, By the midnight breezes strewn; And {{wherever}} {{the beat of}} her unseen feet, Which only the angels hear, [...] 50 May have broken the woof of <b>my</b> <b>tent's</b> thin roof. The stars peep behind her and peer; And I laugh to see them whirl and flee, Like a swarm of golden bees. When I widen the rent in <b>my</b> wind-built <b>tent,</b> [...] 55 Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas, Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high, Are each paved with the moon and these.|$|R

60|$|Nov. 17.—This day I {{began to}} dig behind <b>my</b> <b>tent</b> into the rock, {{to make room}} for my further conveniency.|$|E
60|$|When I {{had done}} this, I {{began to work}} my way into the rock, and {{bringing}} all the earth and stones that I dug down out through <b>my</b> <b>tent,</b> I laid them up within my fence, {{in the nature of}} a terrace, so that it raised the ground within about a foot and a half; and thus I made me a cave, just behind <b>my</b> <b>tent,</b> which served me like a cellar to my house.|$|E

6000|$|The Buriat {{shook his}} head. [...] "I was {{thinking}} of that yesterday, and was afraid for you.

You can take my horse, we will watch over your friend. Once in <b>my</b> <b>tents</b> you will be safe." ...|$|R

60|$|Each of <b>my</b> <b>tenting</b> places drew near. At one moment, {{far in the}} Skeena Valley, I sat {{watching}} the brave fire beat back the darkness and the rain--hearing a glacial river roaring from the night. At another I was encamped in the shelter of a mighty cliff, listening in awe while along its lofty shelves the lions prowled and in the cedars, amid the ruins of prehistoric cities, the wind chanted a solemn rune filled with the voices of those whose bones had long since been mingled with the dust.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{heart of}} a man to the {{heart of a}} maid, light of <b>my</b> [...] <b>tents</b> be fleet, [...] Morning waits {{at the end of the}} world and the world is [...] all at our feet," ...|$|R

60|$|This gave me {{not only}} egress and regress, {{as it were}} a back-way to <b>my</b> <b>tent</b> and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my goods.|$|E

60|$|Over against <b>my</b> <b>tenting</b> place {{a colony}} of herons had their nests in some dark hemlocks. They were {{interesting}} as a camp of gypsies, some going off in straggling bands to the coast at daybreak, others frogging in the streams, and a few solitary, patient, philosophical ones joining me daily in following the gentle art of Izaak Walton. And then, when the sunset came and the deep red glowed just behind the hemlocks, and the gypsy bands came home, I would see their sentinels posted here and there among the hemlock tips--still, dark, graceful silhouettes etched in sepia against the gorgeous after-glow--and hear the mothers croaking their ungainly babies {{to sleep in the}} tree tops.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nine of them," [...] muttered Nehushta, who {{had counted}} the roars, [...] "all bearded and old, royal beasts. To hearken to them makes me young again. Yes, yes, I smell {{the desert and}} see the smoke rising from <b>my</b> father's <b>tents.</b> As a child I hunted them, now they will hunt me; it is their hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not expect}} to see you so soon, and am pleasantly surprised," [...] said Geoffrey, who, warned by {{something}} in Helen's face, restrained the answer he was about to make.
