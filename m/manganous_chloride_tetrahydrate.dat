40|$|Wrought iron with a {{remaining}} metallic core {{recovered from}} marine and terrestrial archaeological contexts is unstable {{and has the}} potential for further corrosion after recovery or excavation. Where metallic iron remains within the object, it deteriorates as crystals of new, chloride-bearing, corrosion products form at the metal/corrosion interface, resulting in the loss of overlying corrosion. This is undesirable, for the information on the form of the original, uncorroded, artefact is commonly found within the overlying corrosion which is detached.
