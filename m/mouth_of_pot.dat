The carrier slung the pots over the shoulder or onto an animal.Decoration consists of circumferential motifs: lines, bands, zig-zags or wavy lines, incised, stabbed or impressed with a comb. These patterns are best understood when seen from the top. They appear then to be a solar motif, with the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pot</b> as the sun.

The area of the monument approximately is 0.8 hectares. During the farm works, the monument were badly damaged and only remained a central part in 80-90 cm of height. The collected materials shows the existence of cultural layers of the Eneolithic and Kura-Aras in here. Because of the Eneolithic ceramic fragments made from clay are small, {{it is not possible to}} determine the forms <b>of</b> <b>pots.</b> Just can be mentioned the fact that the edge <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pots</b> is cut straight. There are examples of both good and poor cooked. Surfaces were slightly smoothed. In general, the ceramic is more close to the materials of Kultepe I. In the settlement has been found the remains of obsidian. The settlement is belongs to the 4 - 3 millennium of BC.|$|R
50|$|Vinayakram's concert {{career began}} {{at the age of}} 13. His first {{performance}} occurred on 5 March 1957 at the Rama Navami festival in Thoothukudi. While proceeding for the arangetram the tuned ghatam instrument was broken by a child named Ganesh, which by itself had been a good omen for his bright career. where he accompanied V.V.Sadagopan. He was soon accompanying many famous vocalists in Carnatic music at the time, including Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna, G. N. Balasubramaniam, Madurai Mani Iyer, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M. S. Subbulakshmi and Maharajapuram Santhanam, among others. His brother, T. H. Subhash Chandran, also excelled in the field. The Ghatam followed the master by rising to fame as a percussion instrument that required nimble fingers and strong stomach muscles to control the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pot.</b>|$|R
50|$|A beanpot is a deep, wide-bellied, short-necked vessel used to cook bean-based dishes.

The relatively narrow <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the beanpot minimizes evaporation and heat loss, while the deep, wide, thick-walled body <b>of</b> the <b>pot</b> facilitates long, slow cooking times.|$|R
60|$|Proceeding onward, {{we reached}} Shelburne Falls. Here the river, in the {{distance}} {{of a few hundred}} yards, makes a descent of about a hundred and fifty feet over a prodigious bed of rock. Formerly it doubtless flowed unbroken over the rock, merely creating a rapid; and traces of water having raged over it are visible in portions of the rock that now lie high and dry. At present the river roars through a channel which it has worn in the stone, leaping in two or three distinct falls, and rushing downward, as from flight to flight of a broken and irregular staircase. The mist rises from the highest of these cataracts, and forms a pleasant object in the sunshine. The best view, I think, is to stand on the verge of the upper and largest fall, and look down through the whole rapid descent of the river, as it hurries, foaming, through its rock-worn path,--the rocks seeming to have been hewn away, as when mortals make a road. These falls are the largest in this State, and have a very peculiar character. It seems as if water had had more power at some former period than now, to hew and tear its passage through such an immense ledge of rock as here withstood it. In this crag, or parts of it, now far {{beyond the reach of the}} water, it has worn what are called pot-holes,--being circular hollows in the rock, where for ages stones have been whirled round and round by the eddies of the water; so that the interior <b>of</b> the <b>pot</b> is as circular and as smooth as it could have been made by art. Often the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pot</b> is the narrowest part, the inner space being deeply scooped out. Water is contained in most of these pot-holes, sometimes so deep that a man might drown himself therein, and lie undetected at the bottom. Some of them are of a convenient size for cooking, which might be practicable by putting in hot stones.|$|R

In each boat embarked a whole family, from the robustious burgher down to the cats and dogs and little negroes. In this way they set off across the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Hudson, under the guidance of Oloffe the Dreamer, who hoisted his standard on the leading boat.|$|R
50|$|On 15 April, Crisp {{notified}} Katie Hinds, the Portable Antiquities Scheme Finds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire, that he {{had found}} the hoard of coins. On 22 April Hinds, together with Anna Booth (Finds Liaison Officer for Somerset) and Alan Graham—an independent archaeologist contracted by Somerset County Council—visited the site to carry out an emergency excavation. The excavation, led by Graham and assisted by Hinds, Booth, Crisp and members of the landowner's family, was performed over three days, from 23 to 25 April.Graham initially excavated a 1.5 m trench around the small hole that Crisp had dug, and identified the pit in which the pot had been deposited. A small black-burnished ware bowl had been inverted over the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the larger <b>pot,</b> to form a lid. First he excavated the pit fill around the exterior <b>of</b> the <b>pot,</b> identifying organic matter which might represent packing material to protect it, and determined that the pot had been broken in situ long before its discovery in 2010. He then excavated the pot itself. Due to the weight of the contents, the need for speedy excavation due to security concerns and the difficulty in lifting the broken pot with the contents still inside—which would be the preferred archaeological method, so that the contents could be excavated in controlled, laboratory conditions—the decision was taken to excavate the coins in the field. The coins were removed in layers, by which method it was hoped to determine if there was any chronological pattern in the deposition of the coins; that is, whether the earliest coins were at the bottom and latest coins at the top. The coins were collected in 66 labelled bags, and in total weighed approximately 160 kg. Graham excavated and recorded the finds, and the others bagged the coins as Graham lifted them out.|$|R

40|$|Deleting the OB folds {{encoding}} the telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) -binding {{activity of}} the human telomeric protein POT 1 induces significant telomere elongation, suggesting {{that at least one}} critical aspect of the regulation of telomere length is disrupted by this POT 1 ΔOB mutant protein. POT 1 is known to associate with two proteins through the protein interaction domain retained in POT 1 ΔOB—the telomeric double-stranded DNA-binding protein TRF 2 and the telomere-associated protein TPP 1. We report that introducing a mutation that reduces association <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 with TRF 2, but not a mutation that reduces the association with TPP 1, abrogates the ability <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 ΔOB to promote telomere elongation. Mechanistically, expression <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 ΔOB reduced the association of TRF 2 with POT 1, RAP 1, and TIN 2; however, of these proteins, only ectopic expression <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 suppressed the telomere elongation induced by POT 1 ΔOB. Lastly, replacing endogenous POT 1 with a full-length POT 1 mutant defective in the association with TRF 2 induced telomere elongation. Thus, we conclude that the association <b>of</b> <b>POT</b> 1 with both ssDNA and TRF 2 is critical for telomere length homeostasis...|$|R

It took several years to relocate the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river to its current position and to landfill the former <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river. This relocating <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river allowed for widening and deepening <b>of</b> the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river and the now adjacent <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the river's tributary, Muddy Creek.
