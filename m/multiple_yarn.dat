40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the stick-slip properties of dry polyester plain, ribs and satin woven fabric weaves. It was found that the amount of stick-slip force was related to the number of interlacement points in the fabric, whereas the amount of accumulative retraction force was related to fabric structural response. Stick-slip force and accumulative retraction force depend on fabric weave, fabric density, the number of pulled ends in the fabric and fabric sample dimensions. The weft directional single and <b>multiple</b> <b>yarn</b> stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces of dry plain fabrics in fabric edge and centre regions were higher than those in the satin fabric due to fabric weave. In addition, the warp directional single and <b>multiple</b> <b>yarn</b> stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces in the meso-cell- 1 to the meso-cell- 6 of dry wide and long satin fabric in fabric edge were higher than those in the weft direction due to fabric density.

40|$|Rotor {{speed and}} twist per metres (tpm) are two key {{parameters}} in open-end rotor spinning of cotton yarns. High spinning productivity {{can be obtained}} by keeping the rotor speed high and twist level as low as possible. However, too high rotor speed may result in yarn imperfections and too low twist level may result in lower tenacity yarns. This study aimed at optimising the <b>multiple</b> <b>yarn</b> characteristics in open-end rotor spinning using the Taguchi method and the grey relational analysis. Cotton yarn samples of 30 tex were produced on rotor spinning machine with different twist levels (i. e. 500, 550, 600 and 700 tpm) at different rotor speeds (i. e. 70, 000, 80, 000, 90, 000 and 100, 000 rpm) according to the Taguchi design of experiment. Optimal spinning process parameters were determined using the grey relational grade as the performance index. It was concluded that for the cotton fibres and yarn count used in this study, optimum properties of the yarns could be obtained at 90, 000 rpm rotor speed and 700 tpm...|$|E
40|$|Unconventional {{textiles}} are goods {{obtained by}} methods {{other than the}} classic spinning, weaving and knitting. They are manufactured by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a fabric consisting of fiber layers {{or a combination of}} fiber, weaving, yarn or textile layers. Also, unconventional textiles can be obtained by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a yarn pattern or <b>multiple</b> <b>yarn</b> patterns. The tendency of the industry to increase production of synthetic fibers în comparison to natural fibers is also visible în the field of unconventional textiles. Additionally, there is more and more emphasis on using fibers recovered from recycled materials and products which resulted from a classic textile manufacturing process. A TUFTING product is made from a backing fabric, usually cloth, reinforced with yarn introduced through the fabric in loops spaced equally relative to the stitches, and raised at the ends. The fur substitutes can also be obtained with unconventional TUFTING technologies, by reinforcing a backing cloth and then undergoing a final reinforcement by raising and felting on one side. The TUFTING product obtained by reinforcing and weaving can be used în the manufacturing process because it is predisposed to unraveling and has an inadequate aspect. For an optimal uniformity în Tufting fur substitutes, it is recommended that the backing cloth has a mean apparent density of 300 Kg/m 3 with a 5...|$|E
2500|$|Weft-knit fabrics {{may also}} be knit with <b>multiple</b> <b>yarns,</b> usually to produce {{interesting}} color patterns. [...] The two most common approaches are intarsia and stranded colorwork. [...] In intarsia, the yarns are used in well-segregated regions, e.g., a red apple on a field of green; in that case, the yarns are kept on separate spools and only one is knitted at any time. [...] In the more complex stranded approach, two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row, as seen in Fair Isle sweaters. Double knitting can produce two separate knitted fabrics simultaneously (e.g., two socks). [...] However, the two fabrics are usually integrated into one, giving it great warmth and excellent drape.|$|R

5000|$|Wrapping the <b>yarn</b> <b>multiple</b> times {{produces}} {{very long}} loop, which can yield interesting visual effects. For example, {{a row of}} such long stitches makes an interesting horizontal stripe. Alternatively, the knitting of the long loop can be deferred until a later row (e.g., 5 rows later); in this case, the loop need not be knit vertically, but can be knit diagonally, e.g., to form the lower leaves of a flower.|$|R
50|$|Knitting creates <b>{{multiple}}</b> {{loops of}} <b>yarn,</b> called stitches, {{in a line}} or tube. Knitting has multiple active stitches on the needle at one time.

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{determine}} yarn bending and torsional rigidities was proposed in this paper. Measuring methods of yarn bending and yarn torsion were reviewed. The proposed method {{is a combination}} of theoretical modeling, instrumentation and statistical analysis. One major feature of this method is that bending and torsional rigidities of a naturally curved yarn, like those yarns in knitted fabrics, can be measured. With the aid of modeling, a recently developed Crimped Yarn Length Measurement Instrument (CLI) is able to measure both bending and torsional rigidities at the same time. The CLI generates a large amount of data points for the force and extension relationship during the decrimping of the curved <b>yarn,</b> <b>multiple</b> regression analysis was applied to determine bending and torsional rigidities. In this way, the experimental errors can be minimized and hence more representative results can be obtained. Experimental results from the new proposed method were compared with those measured by the KES-F bending tester and the KES-YN yarn torsion tester; good agreement was evident in testing results from both methods. The advantages of the proposed method were discussed including the capability of measuring the yarn bending rigidity at higher curvature. This is part 1 of the paper in which crimped nylon monofilament was used for the study. The measurements of bending and torsion moduli of crimped short staple spun yarn unraveled from knitted fabric will be further studied in Part 2. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Sensory Responsive Objects' were {{a series}} of works {{designed}} by Philippa Brock, Samuel Plant Dempsey and Priti Veja This collaboration brought together three researchers who had not previously worked together on textiles, but who all share an interest in smart materials. The collaboration has been as much {{about the process of}} the collaboration as it was the outcomes. Many ideas were discussed during the initial phases of the project, and the designers were particularly interested in exploring sensory experiences on the London underground – haptic, visual and sound for woven jacquard design. The designers discussed how these specific senses (haptic, visual and sound) respond and interact to sensory signal data on the London underground. Using the idea of contrasts for visual aids, tactility of moquette seat fabrics and platform blisters, and sounds of announcements, these ideas were further progressed into the design ideation phase using ludic methodology for design thinking. The designers collected a range of small analogue and digital toys/ objects, reactive materials and electronic components, that would help inform design thinking via hacking, making and linking key sensory themes of haptic, visual and sound. Some of the key objects that worked towards the final outcomes included: −	Digibirds – digital toy birds that respond by singing and moving when sensing sound −	Analog music machine – sound response to a punch card data when wound through analog music machine (reading a punch card relating back to jacquard data) −	Stereo earphones – digital music earphones −	Bike light – reflective and flashing mode bicycle safety light −	Tactile materials and yarns – materials including rubber, paper, mohair, plastics, monofilaments, vibration motors, reflective yarn, phosphorescent yarn, wire, chenille, polyester, UV-reactive −	E-textile materials – conductive yarn and sensory output components (LEDs, buzzers, pressure sensors, actuated soft circuits) Although multiple ideas were inspired by the ‘hacking and making’ session, only specific ones were taken through for jacquard design. The final jacquard designs were reflective QR code, multi-haptic graphic jacquard, giant speaker, digibird graphic e-textile tracks, mind the gap music/braille code. Each jacquard outcome is explained as follows: •	Reflective QR code (Sensory response: SIGHT) Visual contrasts to aid clarity and visibility are vital on Transport for London designs. This jacquard outcome grew from how visual contrasts could be transformed as data, and led to the idea of QR codes (digital data as a visual response). The graphics of QR codes are usually a black and white code, read by a digital reader much like a serial barcode. The contrast between the dark and light space is what enables the code to be encrypted to a weblink. Generating a QR code for the @WeavingFutures twitter handle resulted in the visual graphic. Pattern manipulation in some of the idle code areas enabled swirl pattern aesthetics. The QR code was woven in reflective yarn and phosphorescent <b>yarn</b> to give <b>multiple</b> visual contrasts effects depending on the lighting condition viewed in, while still working as an active code. •	Multi-haptic graphic jacquard (Sensory response: HAPTIC & SIGHT) A photograph of the iconic ‘mind the gap’ text between the train and platform, enabled the designers to think about the multiple details integrated in this one image i. e. text, yellow boundary lines, paving indentations. Every detail served a purpose, thus the jacquard translation could also respond via multiple tactile materials (e. g. mohair - furry, polyester -smooth/shiny, matt chenille - soft/moquette like, yellow - reflective) while still keeping the ‘mind the gap’ text in a single woven design. •	Giant speaker (Sensory response: SOUND & SIGHT) This sample was a reaction to all the sound data on the London underground. When hacking the digibird and earphones, small speakers play an integral part of these functions. One of the physical qualities required for a speaker are coils of copper around a magnetic field. This could be translated as a literal spiral graphic and specifically designed structures, which would enable the piece to operate as a speaker. A giant coil was woven and requires connection to active sound source and magnetic field. In addition, this piece is also woven with a UV-reactive yarn to change visually when exposed to UV light. •	Digibird graphic e-textile tracks (Sensory response: SIGHT, SOUND & HAPTIC) The digibirds were integral to inspire many trails of thought during the residency. The dissected digibirds enabled the designers to study the internal ‘guts’ and understand the methods of connections and actuation. The visual photograph of the step-by-step dissection was used as the graphic for the jacquard design, with <b>multiple</b> tactile <b>yarns.</b> Disguised amongst the aesthetic design, <b>multiple</b> conductive <b>yarn</b> tracks were woven in to act as a fabric electronic breadboard. The piece is able to connect to a circuit of multiple electronic outputs to emulate to multiple outputs of the digibirds. •	Mind the gap music code (Sensory response: SIGHT & HAPTIC) The wind up analog music machine inspired this piece. The punch card system that operates the music machine requires holes to be punched in a specific sequence to play notes/ tunes. The visual aesthetic of the punched music card resembled that of braille, leading the designers to research and analyse the configuration of the braille alphabet. The 2 x 3 dot configuration that can make any braille letter could be reconfigured as a linear 1 x 6; hence, each braille alphabet letter could be translated as a punch card music machine sound/ note. Using this method, phrases from the London underground were translated as complete tunes, including ‘mind the gap’. The visual aesthetic of this translated braille to music machine notes were woven as a jacquard design in this piece. The braille-music note hybrid coded dots were woven in structures that enabled raised surfaces, relating back to the original haptic of braille...|$|R
