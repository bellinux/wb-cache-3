There was little <b>marketing</b> <b>support</b> for the Premier by the Jeep-Eagle dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable Jeep models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with Chrysler-Plymouth dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand.

40|$|<b>Marketing</b> {{management}} <b>support</b> systems (MMSS) are computer-enabled {{devices that}} help marketers {{to make better}} decisions. Marketing processes can be quite complex, involving large numbers of variables and mostly outcomes are {{the results of the}} actions of many different stakeholders (e. g., the company itself, its customers, its competitors). Moreover, a large number of interdependencies exist between the relevant variables and the outcomes of marketing actions are subject to major uncertainties. Given the complexities of the market place, <b>marketing</b> management <b>support</b> systems are useful tools to help the marketing decision makers carry out their jobs. <b>Marketing</b> management <b>support</b> systems can only be effective when they are optimally geared towards their users. We, therefore, deal with decision making in marketing (which generates the need for <b>marketing</b> management <b>support</b> systems). We discuss how marketing decisions are made, how they should be made, and the relative roles of analytical versus intuitive cognitive processes in marketing decision-making. We also discuss the match between marketing problem-solving modes and the various types of <b>marketing</b> management <b>support</b> systems. Finally we discuss how the impact of MMSS can be improved. This is important, given the current under-utilization of MMSS in practice. We discuss the conditions for the successful implementation and effective use of <b>marketing</b> management <b>support</b> systems. The issue ends with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges for <b>marketing</b> management <b>support</b> systems as we foresee them...|$|R
