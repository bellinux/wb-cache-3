In our previous work, we found that exploiting highly mobile nodes, such as Unmanned Air Vehicles, with cyclic mobility patterns, as message ferries can significantly improve the performance of information dissemination solutions. However, our experience demonstrated that robust forecasting mechanisms are essential in order to withstand frequent changes in the mobility patterns of message ferrying nodes. This paper presents an extension of the adaptive node presence forecasting component developed for DisService, a Peer-to-peer information dissemination system, that provides estimates of tolerance and accuracy of node <b>mobility</b> <b>forecasts.</b> We tested the extended forecasting mechanism in a simulation environment and found that it can lead to significant improvements in the timeliness and reliability of information dissemination...|$|E

If the bearing capacity of a beach is too small, then beach matting, which is heavy and bulky, needs to be transported.

A widely used model for predicting mobility is the NATO Reference Mobility Model, version II, (NRMM II).

40|$|Road safety {{forecasts}} for 2020 and 2030; Estimate of {{the expected}} numbers of fatalities and serious road injuries. The {{purpose of this study}} is to draw up outlooks to examine whether the target of a maximum of 500 fatalities and 10 600 serious road injuries in 2020 is feasible with the current and planned road safety policy. In addition to an outlook for 2020, we have also made on outlook for the number of fatalities and serious road injuries in 2030. The outlooks have been made in two steps: 1. Multiplication of expected risk and expected mobility. The risks in 2020 and 2030 have been estimated based on extrapolation of risk developments in the past. 2. Modification of the forecast in step 1 for new developments, new road safety measures and other changes in road safety policy that affect road safety development. SWOV developed a model for the extrapolations of risks. This model describes the risk development for different groups of road users —based on a combination of age and type of conflict - during a reference period and predicts the risks in the years for which the forecasts are made, 2020 and 2030. In this report the reference periods used are 1995 - 2014 for fatalities and 1995 - 2013 for serious road injuries. Multiplication of the risks by available mobility and population forecasts results in the numbers of fatalities and serious road injuries for each sub group. The numbers of the different subgroups were totalled to determine the total numbers of fatalities and serious road injuries. For the expected mobility in 2020 the data in the Nationale Energieverkenning (National Energy Outlook) was used, the <b>mobility</b> <b>forecasts</b> for 2030 are based on the new Welfare, Prosperity and Quality of the Living Environment study and were drawn up in consultation with the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) and the Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis (KiM). The method was adapted slightly to make the forecasts for serious road injuries. After 2009 it has not been possible to stratify by type of conflict because the registration rate in the police register is too low. Based on the data per conflict type before 2010 and the total numbers of serious road injuries in the following years, the risk development during the period 1995 - 2013 was estimated simultaneously for all subgroups and extrapolated for 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, the risk for various groups of cyclists shows a sharp increase between 2006 and 2010. Due to lack of data, the cause of this increase cannot be investigated. This makes it difficult to predict how risk will develop for these groups. This outlook presents two possible developments for bicycle crashes, both being described using a model. Both models include an intervention (=increase) between 2006 and 2010. In one model the increase in risk is temporary and does not last, in the other model the increase in risk is permanent. Extrapolation of risk requires the assumption that past developments will continue in the future. This is not always the case, for example when new measures are taken or when new developments occur. The forecasts that are the result of step 1 are therefore adapted for such (policy) changes whenever this is possible. The forecast has been adapted for the following (policy) changes: • Vehicle safety: vehicle automation, support of the driving task, ESC, DRL, passive road safety; • Behaviour: failure of further improvement of drink-driving and seatbelt use; • Improvement cycling safety as a result of the local safe cycling approach and supportive measures; • Infrastructure: saturation 30 and 60 km/h zones and possible cuts on infrastructural measures [...] The effect of a new measure or development is estimated by multiplying the expected effectiveness of the measure or development and the expected penetration rate and the size of the target group the measure is intended for. Modifications as a result of policy changes or changes in other developments are determined as the difference between the effects of two penetration rates: the expected actual penetration rates in 2020 and 2030 and the penetration rate that will result from unchanged continuation of present policy. For some, potentially very relevant, developments/measures it is very difficult to make an estimate of the effects in 2020 and in 2030. In those cases scenarios were used. For a number of other possible developments insufficient knowledge or information was available to apply a modification. The forecast could, for example, not be subjected to meaningful modification for a possible change of risk due to a large (or not so large) growth in the use of electric bikes and speed pedelecs. The number of fatalities is expected to continue declining in the coming years. The expected number of fatalities in 2020 is approximately equal to the target maximum of 500 fatalities. The uncertainty in the outlook for 2030 is largely determined by uncertainties regarding developments in the field of driver assistance and vehicle automation. Also in future years, the number of serious road injuries is expected to develop less favourably than the number of fatalities. Given that the expected number of serious road injuries in 2020 is considerably higher than the maximum target of more than 10, 600 serious road injuries, it is highly unlikely the target for serious road injuries will be met with ongoing and proposed policy. It is then uncertain whether the number of serious road injuries will decline any further between 2020 and 2030, and until now it seems that the number of serious road injuries in 2030 will also be higher than 10, 600. Further analysis of the main modes of transport shows that the number of casualties among car occupants develops more favourably than the number of cycling casualties. For car occupants both the number of fatalities and the number of serious road injuries are expected to decrease during the next 15 years. For cyclists the number of fatalities is also expected to decrease, but less strongly than for car occupants. Also in the coming years the number of seriously injured cyclists will fail to show a downward trend. Most cyclists are injured in crashes not involving a motor vehicle. The underlying cause is the increasing mobility of elderly cyclists who have a relatively high risk. Forecasts have also been made for serious road injuries among (light) moped riders, although these forecasts have some limitations. From these forecasts, we can cautiously conclude that between 2020 and 2030 the number of serious road injuries among (light) moped riders will increase rather than decrease. Regarding age, the over- 60 s are a focus group. In 2030, more than half of the fatalities and roughly a third of the serious road injuries are expected to be 60 years or older. The proportion of people older than 60 in the total number of serious road injuries does not seem to be increasing noticeably, due to a decline in the risk of crashes not involving a motor vehicle for those older than 66. This reduction in risk partly offsets the increase in bicycle mobility for this group. The forecasts lead to the conclusion that the target for fatalities may be achieved, but it is also possible that the target is not quite met. The target for serious road injuries will most probably not be met with the ongoing and proposed policies. In 2030, the number of serious road injuries is expected to still be significantly higher than 10 600...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Ad hoc {{networks}} are collections of mobile nodes communicating using wireless media, without any fixed infrastructure. Existing multicast protocols fall short in a harsh ad hoc mobile environment because node mobility causes conventional multicast trees to rapidly become outdated. The amount of bandwidth resources required for {{building up a}} multicast tree is commonly less than that required for other delivery structures, since a tree avoids unnecessary duplication of data. However, a tree structure is more subject to disruption due to link/node failure and node mobility than more meshed structures. This paper explores these contrasting issues, and proposes PPMA, a new probabilistic predictive multicast algorithm in ad hoc networks, which leverages the tree delivery structure for multicasting, solving its drawbacks in terms of lack of robustness and reliability in highly mobile environment. PPMA overcomes the existing tradeoff between the bandwidth efficiency {{to set up a}} multicast tree, and the tree robustness to node energy consumption and mobility, by decoupling tree efficiency from mobility robustness. By exploiting the non-deterministic nature of ad hoc networks, the proposed algorithm takes into account the estimated network state evolution in terms of node residual energy, link availability, displacement of set up multicast trees, and node <b>mobility</b> <b>forecast,</b> in order to maximize the multicast tree lifetime. The algorithm statistically tracks the relative movements among nodes to capture the dynamics in the ad hoc network. This way, PPMA estimates the nodes’ future relative positions, in order to calculate a long lasting multicast tree. To do so, it exploits those more stable links in the network, while minimizing the total network energy consumption. We propose PPMA in both its centralized and distributed version, providing performance evaluation through extensive simulation campaign run on an ad hoc C++ based simulator. I...|$|R

40|$|The Toutle-Cowlitz River system {{experienced}} dramatic landscape disturbance {{during the}} catastrophic eruption of Mount St Helens on May 18, 1980. The eruption {{was triggered by}} a 2. 5 km 3 debris avalanche which buried the upper 60 km 2 of the North Fork Toutle River catchment to an average depth of 45 m and obliterated the surface drainage network. Subsequent channel response on the debris avalanche, dominated by incision and widening, has delivered significant quantities of sediment to downstream reaches where resultant deposition has reduced channel capacity and heightened flood risk. Estimates of future sediment yield from the upper North Fork Toutle River are therefore required to inform development of sustainable options for long-term flood risk mitigation. Previous estimates {{have been based on}} extrapolation of post-eruption trends in sediment yield and channel network evolution, but the divergent predictions reported in {{a number of studies have}} clouded effective decision-making regarding long-term sediment management. This study therefore uses a numerical, landscape evolution model (CAESAR-Lisflood) to make long-term forecasts of sediment yield based on process simulation rather than extrapolation. A suite of forecasts of cumulative catchment sediment yields up to 2100 are produced using scenario-based model runs designed to account for uncertainty associated with the hydrological impacts of climate change and the model coefficient for lateral <b>mobility.</b> The <b>forecasts</b> fall in a narrow band +/- 20 % of the mean that lies between two previous estimates derived from the extrapolation of post-eruption trends. Importantly, predicted trends in future annual sediment yield are predominantly linear, although some limited decay is evident for runs in which modelled channel lateral mobility is lower. Sustained sediment production in the upper North Fork Toutle River is found to result from persistent bank erosion and channel widening. These findings cast doubt on the applicability of negative exponential decay functions based on the rate law to characterise post-disturbance sediment yield when lateral rather than vertical adjustments dominate channel evolution. Moreover, forecast trends in future sediment yield suggest that it may not be possible to manage future sediment-related flood risk along the lower Cowlitz solely by retaining sediment in the upper North Fork Toutle River catchment...|$|R
40|$|Promoting rail {{systems can}} {{represent}} a useful policy for rebalancing modal choices and reducing private car use, especially in high density contexts. Obviously, {{an increase in}} passenger numbers is only possible if generalised costs (i. e. a weighted sum of times and monetary costs) associated to public transport are abated. According to the recent literature and current professional practice, most strategies for achieving this objective are based only on infrastructural interventions which may be unfeasible or inadequate in densely populated contexts. Likewise, the adoption of policies based on replacing existing fleets or reducing fare levels entails increases in national or regional subsidies, which {{would be difficult to}} achieve in the current economic climate. Hence, our proposal is based on investigating effects on travel demand arising from the replacement or upgrading of existing signalling systems (both in terms of trackside and on-board equipment). Indeed, the recent European Union policy to create a single transnational interoperable rail network imposes the development of innovative signalling systems. In this context, since cost-benefit analysis has to be implemented to verify the economic and environmental feasibility of the proposed intervention strategy, an appropriate method should be developed to estimate passenger flows according to future configurations.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Efficient and {{reliable}} goods movement via our nation's highway system {{is critical to}} the nation's economy and quality of life. Truck mobility {{is one of the key}} performance measures for evaluating the conditions of goods movement and supporting freight planning. Truck GPS data can be useful in developing truck mobility measures and providing insights into freight planning. This dissertation employs truck GPS data and proposes a set of methodologies for measuring and <b>forecasting</b> truck <b>mobility</b> performance, with particular emphases on truck travel time and travel time reliability. It also examines how GPS data can be used to support freight planning, using the analysis of impacts of a tolling project on truck mobility and routing as a case study. The first part of this dissertation investigates how to measure truck travel time reliability given the characteristics of GPS data. An improved spot-speed distribution based travel time reliability measure is proposed. The proposed approach is compared with a number of commonly applied reliability measures. The correlations among these measures reveal that the reliability measures are not highly correlated, demonstrating that different measures provide different conclusions for the same underlying data and traffic conditions. The author presents recommendations of the appropriate measures for different applications. Quantitative freight project prioritization processes require both pre- and post-investment truck mobility performance. Therefore, the second part of this dissertation develops quantitative methods for forecasting truck specific travel time and travel time reliability. For travel time prediction, a speed-density based approach is proposed to predict truck travel time associated with segment density changes. Traffic regimes are segmented using a cluster analysis approach. The travel time estimates are compared with two widely applied traditional methodologies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to estimate more accurate travel times. For reliability prediction, we analyze the changes of GPS spot speed distribution in response to different traffic conditions. A relationship between truck spot speed distribution coefficient of variation and segment density is proposed to forecast reliability. The approach is transferrable and sheds a light on forecasting travel time reliability. The third part of this dissertation focuses on examining how GPS data can be used to assist freight planning. The SR- 520 toll bridge in the City of Seattle, Washington is selected as the case study. We quantify the toll project impacts on truck mobility and route choice. Truck GPS data is used to evaluate route choice and travel speed along SR- 520 and the alternate toll-free route I- 90. A logit model is developed to determine the influential factors in truck routing. The results indicate that travel time, travel time reliability and toll rate are all influential factors during both peak and off-peak periods. The values of truck travel time during different time periods are estimated, and the values vary with the definition of peak and off-peak periods. This dissertation provides decision makers with useful guidance and information on using GPS data for truck <b>mobility</b> measurement and <b>forecasting.</b> It also demonstrates the capability of GPS data in supporting freight planning...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{networks}} grow {{subject to}} structural constraints which affect their measurable properties. Assessing {{the effect that}} such constraints impose on their observables is thus a crucial aspect {{to be taken into}} account in their analysis, if one wants to quantify the effect a given topological property has on other observed network quantities observed in empirical datasets. Null models are needed for this end. A well understood analytical approach to face the generation and development of flexible models for binary networks is based on considering ensembles of networks obtained using an entropy maximization principle. In this work, we explore the generalization of maximum entropy ensembles to networks where multiple or non-dihcotomic connections among nodes are allowed. We develop a statistical mechanics framework where it is possible to get information about the most relevant observables given a large spectrum of linear and non-linear constraints including those depending both on the weight per link and their binary projection. We furthermore identify three different relevant cases that lead to distinctively different edge statistics, depending on the distinguishable nature of the events allocated to each link. For each case, we perform an extensive study considering microcanonical or hard constrained ensembles as well as grand canonical or soft constrained ones. We provide tools for the generation an analysis of network instances belonging to each model which are implemented and available in the form of open-source software packages, and we provide also analytical tools to obtain null model expectations to later compare to real data. Developing the theory developed, we apply the obtained insights to the analysis of urban mobility considering four large datasets of taxi displacements in the cities of New York, Singapore, San Francisco and Vienna. We show that, once they are appropriately transformed, mobility patterns are highly stable over long time scales and display common features across the studied datasets which are very conveniently represented using one of the cases earlier studied maximum entropy ensembles. We furthermore perform a critical review on existing <b>mobility</b> demand <b>forecasting</b> models and discuss their strengths and weaknesses when adapted to the urban environment, while showing how entropy maximizing models display the best descriptive power of the datasets using a number of network-based, information and matrix similarity metrics to assess the accuracy of the predicted vehicle flows. Based on our observations, we develop two practical applications based on our theoretical work. On the hand, we envisage a supersampling methodology to reliably extrapolate mobility records from a reduced sample which opens the possibility to scale up data from limited records when information on the full system is required. On the other hand, we adapt previous work on graph filtering to our proposed models that allows to extract random contributions from the observed empirical data. This allows to obtain simplified network backbones which contain the most relevant features of mobility datasets not explained by the considered constraints imposed in the maximum entropic models considered. Such a filter is useful for easing the analysis, computational handling and visualization of dense datasets, as well as assessing the degree of proximity between a model and empirical data using suitable hypothesis testing arguments.

Tot seguit realitzem un anàlisi crític de models de predicció de mobilitat existents i la seva possible adaptació als entorns urbans, mostrant com els models de màxima entropia tenen el major poder predictiu per descriure les dades. Finalment presentem dues aplicacions de la teoria desenvolupada que exploten les propietats comunes detectades a les dades estudiades. D'una banda, derivem un model que permet extrapolar dades de mobilitat sobre sets de dades reduïts. De l'altra, proposem un mètode de filtratge per extreure les contribucions de les dades reals dels trajectes esperats d'acord a qualssevol dels nostres models de màxima entropia. Aquest procediment permet obtenir versions simplificades de les xarxes originals que continguin les seves propietats més rellevants...|$|R
