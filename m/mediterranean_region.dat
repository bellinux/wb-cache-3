5|$|Aside from these, since Constantinople was a prime trading {{center in}} the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>region</b> and beyond, {{virtually}} every known language of the Middle Ages was spoken in the Empire at some time, even Chinese.

5|$|The {{geography}} of mountain ranges bordering the Mediterranean are conducive for severe weather and thunderstorms, with the sloped nature of mountainous regions permitting {{the development of}} convective activity. Although the {{geography of}} the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>region,</b> {{as well as its}} dry air, typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones, when certain meteorological circumstances arise, difficulties influenced by the region's geography are overcome. The occurrence of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea is generally extremely rare, with an average of 1.57forming annually and merely 99recorded occurrences of tropical-like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study, with no definitive trend in activity in that period. Few medicanes form during the summer season, though activity typically rises in autumn, peaks in January, and gradually decreases from February to May. In the western <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>region</b> of development, approximately 0.75such systems form each year, compared to 0.32in the Ionian Sea region.|$|E

40|$|Agro – food {{manufacturing}} {{is a basic}} {{activity in}} economic structure of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>regions.</b> Spanish <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>regions</b> are not an exception in this pattern of specialization. Agro – food manufacturing {{is very important in}} all the Spanish <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>regions</b> (Catalonia, Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia). But there are some problems of reduced articulation of economic activities in southern Spanish <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>regions</b> that are not perceived in other Mediterranean spaces (Catalonia or Valencia). The aim {{of this article is to}} compare the different patterns of behaviour of agro – food manufacturing in two different Spanish Mediterranean regions: Andalusia and the Valencia community. Andalusia is a region that represents approximately 18 % of Spanish population and territory. However, his participation in national g. d. p. is only of 12 %. So, Andalusia is a region with some degree of backwardness in Spanish context. One of the rare activities where Andalusia has a participation of national average higher than his participation in population is agro food manufacturing. Andalusian agro foo...|$|R

5|$|Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, in {{and near}} the Levant some 10,000 years ago. Its {{ancestors}} include wild emmer wheat; this was hybridised, harvested and sown to create domestic strains with larger grains, in ears that shatter less readily than wild forms. It had been spread across the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>region</b> as far as Spain by 5,000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Fruit is {{normally}} picked by a perched bird, {{although there is}} a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight.

5|$|Israeli eating customs also {{conform to}} the wider <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>region,</b> with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, {{vegetables}} and salads, olives, hard-boiled eggs or omelets, pickled and smoked herring, a variety of breads, and fresh orange juice and coffee.|$|E

5|$|Mari's {{discovery}} in 1933 provided an important {{insight into the}} geopolitical map of ancient Mesopotamia and Syria, due {{to the discovery of}} more than 25,000 tablets that contained important information about the administration of state during the second millennium BC and the nature of diplomatic relations between the political entities in the region.

5|$|Other {{influences}} on the cuisine are the availability of foods common to the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>region,</b> especially certain kinds of fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fish; the distinctive traditional dishes prepared at holiday times; the tradition of keeping kosher; and food customs specific to Shabbat and different Jewish holidays, such as challah, jachnun, malawach, gefilte fish, hamin, me'orav yerushalmi and sufganiyot.|$|E

Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size.
