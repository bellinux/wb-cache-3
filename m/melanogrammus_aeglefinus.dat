40|$|A multinomial {{logistic}} model {{is presented as}} a tool for comparing two or more age–length keys. The model provides an objective way to fill in missing values and can be used for estimating uncertainty and visualizing age–length keys (ALKs). An example of haddock (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus</b> L.) in ICES Division VIa (West of Scotland) is used to illustrate that significant regional differences in the proportions of age classes-at-length can exist on a small spatial scale. These differences are caused by regional variation in both length-at-age and relative abundance at age. As the length-at-age data are normally not weighted by the local catch rate (abundance), the ALK of the combined age data can result in strongly biased estimates of numbers-at-age. In the present case, the use of unweighted age data would have resulted in an overestimate of recruitment of nearly 200 % and an underestimate of spawning stock biomass of 15 %. Comparing ALKs using this method has several practical applications in fisheries science.

This paper uses bioeconomic simulation techniques to conduct an ex-ante impact assessment of the early life stages in haddock production. Using an economic engineering methodology, early life stages are modeled by decomposing the production system into two separable production activities: the production of live feeds and juvenile fish from hatching to grow-out. Uncertainty in live feeds and haddock production is simulated using Monte Carlo techniques in order to compare alternative production technologies using stochastic dominance techniques. Overall, fifteen production technologies are analyzed. Large-scale traditional production techniques dominate the other alternatives despite being more risky.

Proportions of first-time spawning haddock ranged from 3 to 62 percent of the spawning stock biomass during 1963 – 96. Exclusion of all first-time spawners from spawning stock biomass improved the Ricker stock-recruit-ment relationship by 39 percent.

40|$|Crude {{oil spills}} are a {{worldwide}} ocean conservation threat. Fish {{are particularly vulnerable}} to the oiling of spawning habitats, and crude oil causes severe abnormalities in embryos and larvae. However, the underlying mechanisms for these developmental defects are not well understood. Here, we explore the transcriptional basis for four discrete crude oil injury phenotypes in the early life stages of the commercially important Atlantic haddock (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus).</b> These include defects in (1) cardiac form and function, (2) craniofacial development, (3) ionoregulation and fluid balance, and (4) cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Our findings suggest a key role for intracellular calcium cycling and excitation-transcription coupling in the dysregulation of heart and jaw morphogenesis. Moreover, the disruption of ionoregulatory pathways sheds new light on buoyancy control in marine fish embryos. Overall, our chemical- genetic approach identifies initiating events for distinct adverse outcome pathways and novel roles for individual genes in fundamental developmental processes...|$|E
40|$|A central {{problem when}} using {{commercial}} catch per unit effort (CPUE) as {{an index of}} fish stock abundance is that fishing vessels search for concentrations of fish. For a given stock abundance, CPUE may become high if the vessels succeed in finding patches of fish and low if the vessels distribute their catching operations more randomly. In this work, the relationship between catchability and two measures {{of the degree of}} spatial concentration of a trawl fleet (the fleet’s spatial extent and the fleet’s degree of spatial patchiness) is investigated for four different fish stocks. The catchability of northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) is strongly related to the fleet’s degree of spatial concentration, but the relationship is weaker for northeast Arctic haddock (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus),</b> and no relationships appear for two saithe (Pollachius virens) stocks.

At 14 degrees C cortisol levels peaked within 1 h post-stressor, and returned to pre-stressor levels within 24 h. In contrast, at 4 degrees C, peak cortisol levels were not attained until 6 h post-stressor in haddock and remained elevated beyond 24 h in both species. The rate of plasma glucose accumulation was greater at higher temperatures in both species and no increase was seen at 4 degrees C.

The increased abundance of fish, such as cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (<b>Melanogrammus</b> <b>aeglefinus),</b> has been reported near the western coast of Spitsbergen and entering fjords together with Atlantic waters. This study used multifrequency acoustics to measure fish distribution and abundance in 2013 – 2014 in two Arctic fjords, the colder Hornsund, which is typically of Arctic character, and the warmer Kongsfjorden, which is more of Atlantic character. The study revealed a bimodal fish size distribution with larger fish in the deep parts of fjords, and smaller fish distributed in more shallow waters. An evident increase in the abundance of large fish, most probably Atlantic cod, was observed in Hornsund and especially in Kongsfjorden in 2014 in comparison to 2013. The intense inflow of Atlantic water on the shelf in 2014 is suggested as the explanation for this phenomenon...|$|E

Haddock are group synchronous, serial spawners. Each female releases 8 - 10 batches of eggs spontaneously in communal spawning tanks over 4 - 6 weeks.
