5|$|Turner Catledge, the top {{editor at}} The New York Times from 1952 to 1968, wanted {{to hide the}} {{ownership}} influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote <b>memos</b> to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders.

40|$|<b>Memo</b> was {{recently}} identified in a screen for proteins required for ErbB receptor induced cell migration. Encoded by a single-copy gene {{present in all}} branches of life, it is ubiquitously expressed during all stages of embryogenesis and in adult tissues. This study aimed to investigate the physiological role of <b>Memo.</b> Initially, we generated a conventional knock out of <b>Memo,</b> which was embryonic lethal between E 12. 5 to E 14. 5. We subsequently generated a mouse strain to allow temporal control of <b>Memo</b> deletion by crossing a mouse strain harboring a homozygous floxed <b>Memo</b> allele (Memofl/fl) with pCX-CreERTM transgenics, where the ubiquitous actin promoter drives the Cre recombinase. Following tamoxifen treatment, <b>Memo</b> was deleted in all organs (<b>Memo</b> null mice). Knock out of <b>Memo</b> in mice {{at the age of}} 2 to 14 weeks revealed a severe premature aging phenotype accompanied by alterations in insulin and glucose metabolism. The phenotype of the <b>Memo</b> null mice, especially the metabolic phenotype, revealed an interesting similarity to the Klotho and FGF 23 mutant mice. In particular, insulin and glucose metabolism was very similar to the phenotype shown by both Klotho mutant and FGF 23 knock-out mice. To investigate this phenotype further, and as Klotho is mainly expressed in the renal tubular cells, we generated a mouse model, which lacked <b>Memo</b> specifically in the kidney. We chose a Pax 8 promoter system to delete <b>Memo</b> in the renal tubular cells (1). Kidney specific <b>Memo</b> knock-out mice were generated by crossing <b>Memo</b> floxed (Memofl/fl) mice with a mouse line expressing the tetracycline-sensitive transactivator rtTA under control of the Pax 8 promoter, and a mouse line harboring Cre recombinase under a promoter that contains a tetracycline-responsive promoter element. In these mice doxycycline treatment induced loss of <b>Memo</b> in renal tubular epithelial cells. By investigation of the <b>Memo</b> null and kidney-specific <b>Memo</b> KO mice we found that only the <b>Memo</b> null mice showed premature aging symptoms. However, both KO models showed deregulation of the FGF 23 -Klotho axis measuring expression of enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism and phosphate reabsorption. Moreover, blood analysis of both models showed renal insufficiency and hypercalcemia. For the kidney-specific <b>Memo</b> KO animals we also performed analysis of the urine and found hypercaliuria. Surprisingly, for both models {{there was no difference in}} serum phosphate levels, which has earlier been shown by others to be causative for the premature aging syndrome. In conclusion, we found that deletion of <b>Memo</b> in the full body or specifically in the kidney induces renal insufficiency and hypercalcemia. Furthermore, <b>Memo</b> deletion in the full body results in severe premature aging symptoms that cannot be explained by elevated serum phosphate levels. To date, it is not clear how hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria affects <b>Memo</b> mice and what specifically induces the premature aging in <b>Memo</b> null animals. To investigate the function of <b>Memo</b> in vitro we isolated and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Memofl/fl embryos. These cells were then infected with a Cre recombinase containing vector, which following 4 -hydroxytamoxifen treatment ablated <b>Memo</b> expression (KO MEFs). Our studies showed that signaling downstream of FGF 2 was reduced in activity and duration in <b>Memo</b> KO MEFs and furthermore that <b>Memo</b> was associated with the FGFR signaling complex (FGFR-FRS 2 -GRB 2 -GAB 1). In addition, we tested mammary carcinoma cells (4 T 1) for sensitivity to FGFR inhibition and revealed lower sensitivity to FGFR inhibition in <b>Memo</b> downregulated cells. To investigate the role of <b>Memo</b> in the metabolic signaling we used HEK 293 cells that are stably transfected with Klotho or ßKlotho and therefore responsive to FGF 19, 21 and 23. We found that in <b>Memo</b> downregulated HEK 293 -Klotho and –ßKlotho cells, FGFR signaling activity after stimulation with FGF 23 and FGF 19 was affected. In summary, this study provides evidence for a physiological role of <b>Memo</b> downstream of the FGFR pathway. We show that <b>Memo</b> is part of the FGFR signaling complex. Loss of <b>Memo</b> affects the intensity and duration of the FGFR signaling and modulates sensitivity to FGFR inhibition and to oxidative stress. Furthermore, we uncovered an important role of <b>Memo</b> in renal physiology that contributed to a premature aging phenotype, which is similar to that observed in Klotho mutant or FGF 23 knock out animals...|$|R
