5|$|Federer's {{success in}} 2008 was {{severely}} hampered by a lingering bout of <b>mononucleosis,</b> which {{he suffered from}} {{during the first half}} of the year. At the end of the year, he would suffer a back injury that would prove to be recurring throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|In July 2000, Kinský was {{diagnosed}} with infectious <b>mononucleosis,</b> receiving treatment at the Střešovice military hospital in Prague and resultantly being unable {{to play in the}} autumn part of the 2000–01 season. The following season, he recorded consecutive clean sheets {{at the beginning of the}} campaign. Liberec went on to reach the quarter finals of the 2001–02 UEFA Cup and won the 2001–02 Gambrinus liga.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Federer {{captured}} one Grand Slam, a singles {{title at}} the US Open over Briton Andy Murray. Federer {{was defeated by}} Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, at the French Open, and at Wimbledon, {{when he was going}} for six straight wins to break Björn Borg's record. At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals. Later in the year, it was found Federer had been suffering from <b>mononucleosis</b> {{at the start of the}} year, particularly during the Australian Open. He lost twice in Masters Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. However, Federer captured three titles in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2012, he was at first unable {{to qualify for the}} 2012 Elite 11 in his home region, but participated in a second {{regional}} contest and was named MVP, earning an invitation. Morris was described as having the strongest arm of the 25 quarterbacks at the Elite 11 finals, although he did not finish in the top 11 of the competition. On September 6, 2012, he was the first quarterback selected to participate in the January 4, 2013 Under Armour All-America Game for high school seniors. As he was attempting to regain momentum following his battle with <b>mononucleosis,</b> he was reported to have been unimpressive in the week of practice and in the game. In the game, he was notable for being the recipient of a vicious tackle by Matthew Thomas, who was the top-ranked outside linebacker in the class of 2013 according to ESPN. The Detroit News named him as the top prospect in the state of Michigan on their 2013 Blue Chip List.|$|E
5|$|Following his draft, {{he joined}} the college hockey ranks with the Dartmouth Big Green of the ECAC Hockey Conference. He missed 8 games in his {{freshman}} year due to <b>mononucleosis,</b> finishing with 11 points over 26 games. He helped the Big Green to the third-place game of the ECAC playoffs, where they lost to the Colgate Raiders. The following season, he improved to 15 points in 33 games. Prior to his junior year, he was named an alternate captain for the Big Green, going on to score a college career-high 12 goals and 28 points over 33 games. Glass made his second appearance in the ECAC's third-place game, winning 3–2 against Colgate. Captaining the team as a senior in 2006–07, Glass matched his career-high 28 points and helped Dartmouth to the third-place game once more. He finished his college career losing to the St. Lawrence Saints.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of <b>mononucleosis.</b> At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
5|$|He participated {{as one of}} {{the four}} quarterbacks in the July 2011 Gridiron Kings event at Disney World (with the top 24 quarterbacks {{participating}} in the 2011 Elite 11), but he was overshadowed by Matt Davis. As a junior in the fall of 2011, he passed for 1,684 yards and 19 touchdowns. He led the team to the 2011 Division 1 MHSAA state quarterfinals where they lost 96 to eventual state champions Cass Technical High School. Prior to his senior season, he was regarded {{as one of the}} best quarterback prospects produced by the state of Michigan, a state whose greatest quarterback products have been Gary Danielson, Earl Morrall, Craig Morton and James Ninowski. From the start of ESPN's rankings with the class of 2006 through the class of 2012, no Michigan quarterback ever ranked in the top 100. The closest were Rob Bolden (112th, 2010) and Gardner (128th, 2010). Prior to his senior year, he was ranked as ESPN's 37th best and Rivals.com's 17th best prospect and rising in the national class of 2013. Entering his senior season, he and Max Browne were the only two 5-star rated quarterbacks in the class of 2013 by Rivals.com. A few weeks into his senior season, he had risen to 26th at ESPN, but suffered season-ending <b>mononucleosis</b> with five games remaining on the schedule. By the beginning of November, he was the top quarterback in the country according to some evaluators. He ended his high school career ranked 127th by ESPN and 81st by Rivals.com.|$|E

25|$|Having lost in {{an opening}} round at the Canada Masters, and having skipped the Cincinnati Masters as the fatigue {{intensified}} {{and the weight}} loss mounted, Ančić withdrew from the 2008 Summer Olympics, and later the US Open, due to a recurrence of <b>mononucleosis.</b> Ančić returned in September, playing for the Davis Cup. After a good {{start at the beginning}} of the 2009 season, Ančić announced in May that he would pull out of the French Open, Wimbledon, and the Davis Cup semifinal match, again because recurrence of <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|During 2007 and 2008, <b>mononucleosis</b> {{and minor}} {{injuries}} {{forced him to}} miss many major events, and his ranking dropped from No. 9 in January 2007 to No. 135 in January 2008.|$|E
25|$|A nonallergic {{amoxicillin}} rash {{may also}} be an indicator of infectious <b>mononucleosis.</b> Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute Epstein Barr virus infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, 1998, Lipinski {{announced}} {{her decision to}} withdraw from the 1998 World Figure Skating Championships, citing a serious glandular infection that required her to have two molars extracted, constant fatigue, and possible <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Micropsia can {{be caused}} by {{swelling}} of the cornea due to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and can therefore present as an initial symptom of EBV <b>mononucleosis,</b> a disease caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection.|$|E
25|$|Infectious <b>mononucleosis</b> ("glandular fever") {{caused by}} the Epstein–Barr virus. This may cause {{significant}} lymph gland swelling and an exudative tonsillitis with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The heterophile test can be used if this is suspected.|$|E
25|$|In Marseille, Ančić {{retired in}} the first round and was {{diagnosed}} with <b>mononucleosis.</b> Later, he confessed that he was playing sick a week before in a match against Germany in the Davis Cup, and the virus had started to affect him at the Australian Open. Due to his illness, Ančić spent most of the next 10 weeks in bed and missed six months from the tour.|$|E
25|$|This tournament also {{transformed}} Söderling's {{career as}} he went from a top thirty player to a perennial top ten player, reaching a high of number 4 in the world. Söderling remained a fixture in the top ten from 2009–2011 until {{he was forced to}} stop playing, while still ranked number 5 in the world, and ultimately had to retire after contracting a serious case of <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to a wrist injury, Söderling {{was forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the back-to-back hard court Masters tournaments in Montreal and Cincinnati. He was also diagnosed with <b>mononucleosis,</b> an illness that forced him {{to withdraw from the}} U.S. Open at the last minute. He had been slated to play Louk Sorensen of Ireland in the first round. With the illness continuing to hamper his progress, he decided to take yet more time out, withdrawing {{for the rest of the}} season and including the 2012 Australian Open.|$|E
25|$|Infectious <b>mononucleosis</b> (IM), {{also known}} as mono, is an {{infection}} commonly caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces little or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and tiredness. Most people get better in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen. In {{less than one percent}} of cases splenic rupture may occur.|$|E
25|$|Lymphadenopathy {{refers to}} one or more {{enlarged}} lymph nodes. Small groups or individually enlarged lymph nodes are generally reactive in response to infection or inflammation. This is called local lymphadenopathy. When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called generalised lymphadenopathy. Generalised lymphadenopathy may be caused by infections such as infectious <b>mononucleosis,</b> tuberculosis and HIV, connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers, including both cancers of tissue within lymph nodes, discussed below, and metastasis of cancerous cells {{from other parts of the}} body, that have arrived via the lymphatic system.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{delay in}} the {{translation}} of his transcripts, Faye sat out his first season and was cleared to begin practice with the team in the fall 2006 semester. He started {{his career as a}} redshirt freshman in the 2006–07 season, but his initial playing status was in question due to a wrist injury that he sustained in a pickup game over the summer. Faye became a starter when his teammate Lewis Clinch was suspended {{for the remainder of the}} 2006–07 season on January 5, 2007. Faye was sidelined again on February 5, 2007 after struggling with flu-like symptoms, which coach Paul Hewitt speculated may have been caused by <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many people {{experience}} episodes of OSA {{for only a}} short period. This can {{be the result of}} an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, along with swelling of the throat, or tonsillitis that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection, and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe infectious <b>mononucleosis.</b> Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug (such as alcohol) that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal from sleep mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people become}} {{infected}} with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. In the United States, {{about half of}} all five-year-old children and about 90 percent of adults have evidence of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. In the United States and other developed countries, many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence, it causes infectious <b>mononucleosis</b> 35 to 50 percent of the time.|$|E
25|$|Carlisle's first {{venture into}} music was in 1977 as drummer for the punk rock band the Germs, {{under the name}} Dottie Danger. She was {{recruited}} into the band by Lorna Doom, whom she had met in an art class while a student at Thousand Oaks High School. However, her time in the band was short due to her contracting <b>mononucleosis,</b> and she never recorded or performed live with the Germs. According to Pat Smear, upon quitting, she introduced her friend, Donna Rhia, who became her replacement. Carlisle does appear on one recording introducing the band at a 1977 performance at the Whisky a Go Go, heard on the live album Germicide (1977). Around this time Carlisle did some back-up singing for Black Randy and the Metrosquad.|$|E
25|$|In the 1963 {{track and}} field season he {{achieved}} a Canadian record of , having previously become the first Canadian to clear the sixty foot mark. This mark ranked him seventh globally that year. He was among Canada's top prospects for the 1964 Summer Olympics, but in 1963 he criticised the attitude of officials at the Canadian Amateur Athletic Union, {{saying that they were}} not sufficiently concerned with the well-being of the nation's athletes. Suffering heavily from infectious <b>mononucleosis,</b> he ultimately missed the entire 1964 season, including the Olympic competition. The launch of the Canada Fitness Council, supported by the Royal Canadian Legion, marked a turnaround in his fortunes. Steen credited the organisation with improving his career by assisting with living costs and subsidising travel to international competitions.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{stint in}} the US Marines and the rank of Captain in 1970, and {{competing}} in two SCCA National events, Lunger was among drivers in the 1971 L Grand Prix, at Lime Rock Park, who were competing for 2nd place in the 1971 SCCA L 5000 Continental Championship. Lunger started the race with a 103 degree fever having been diagnosed with <b>mononucleosis</b> the previous day. As race progressed he started to lose strength allowing Sam Posey to pass and moving Lunger to third in the championship. He was hospitalized after the race for several days. His first major win was that year at Brainerd International Raceway in the Minnesota Grand Prix. Lunger had 58 points prior to the event. Lunger came in 3rd overall in the overall standing, after David Hobbs had clinched the title with 99 points. His home {{at the time was}} Pomona, California.|$|E
25|$|In August, it was {{revealed}} that Kvitová was diagnosed with <b>mononucleosis</b> and that she contracted the virus during spring earlier in the year but nevertheless, was cleared to compete. During the US Open series, Kvitová lost her openers in Toronto and Cincinnati. Then, as the defending champion at the Connecticut Open, second-seeded Kvitová received a bye in the opening round and safely advanced to the semifinals after defeating Keys and Agnieszka Radwańska. She then rolled past Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets for a place in her fourth straight final at the tournament, where she beat compatriot Lucie Šafářová in three sets for her 17th career title. With this win, she successfully defended a title for the first time. At the US Open, Kvitová was the fifth seed and reached the round of 16 after defeating Laura Siegemund, wildcard Nicole Gibbs and 32nd seed Anna Karolína Schmiedlová, all in straight sets. She then advanced to her maiden quarterfinal of the tournament after seeing off qualifier Johanna Konta, thus completing the feat of reaching at least the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams. There, she fell short to 26th seed and eventual champion Flavia Pennetta in three sets.|$|E
25|$|Roddick next took a {{wild card}} {{to play in the}} Atlanta Tennis Championships, the first event of the US Open Series, where he was the top seed. He was {{eliminated}} in the semifinals by eventual champion Mardy Fish. His next tournament was the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, where he lost in the round of 16 to Gilles Simon. The only American man in the ATP top 10 prior to the tournament, the loss dropped him from the list. For {{the first time since the}} inception of the ATP world rankings, there was no American man in the top 10. Following the Washington tournament, Roddick withdrew from the Canada Masters due to illness, leading to a drop in ranking to No. 13, his lowest ranking since 2002. On August 14, 2010, Roddick revealed that he had been diagnosed with <b>mononucleosis,</b> although he said his doctor believed it was in its later stages and he would make a complete recovery soon. At the Cincinnati Masters, he defeated world No. 5 Robin Söderling to reach the quarterfinals, where he defeated second seed Novak Djokovic. The win was Roddick's fourth consecutive over Djokovic, raising his career head-to-head record against Djokovic to 5–2 and ensuring Roddick's return to the top 10. In the semifinals, Roddick faced Mardy Fish, but lost, failing to serve out the match at 5–3 in the second set. In the second round of the 2010 US Open, Roddick was beaten by Janko Tipsarević of Serbia in four sets.|$|E
500|$|On November 4 it was {{confirmed}} that Lesnar {{was suffering from}} <b>mononucleosis</b> and that his bout with Carwin would have to wait a bit longer and the fight for Lesnar's heavyweight championship was cancelled. On November 14 at the UFC 105 post-fight conference, Dana White stated, [...] "'s not well and he's not going to be getting well anytime soon" [...] and that an interim title match might need to be set up. In addition to <b>mononucleosis,</b> it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case of diverticulitis, an intestinal disorder, which required surgery. After further diagnosis, Lesnar underwent surgery on November 16 to close a perforation in his intestine that had been leaking fecal matter into his abdomen, causing pain, abscesses and overtaxing his immune system to the point that he contracted <b>mononucleosis.</b> From the level of damage to Lesnar's system, the surgeon estimated that the intestinal condition had been ongoing for around a year.|$|E
500|$|As the {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis overlap with other conditions, {{it can be difficult}} to make the diagnosis clinically. [...] Coughing, nasal discharge, diarrhea, and red, irritated eyes in addition to fever and sore throat are more indicative of a viral sore throat than of strep throat. The presence of marked lymph node enlargement along with sore throat, fever, and tonsillar enlargement may also occur in infectious <b>mononucleosis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Shane Ryan Morris (born August 4, 1994) is an American {{football}} {{quarterback for}} the 2017 Central Michigan Chippewas who formerly played for the Michigan Wolverines.

He was a highly touted five-star prospect from De La Salle Collegiate High School in Warren, Michigan, until he endured <b>mononucleosis</b> midway through his senior season. He played in the 2013 Under Armour All-America Game.|$|E
500|$|On June 28, 2017, Holliday {{was placed}} on the 10-day {{disabled}} list due to a viral infection. On July 5, it was revealed that Holliday tested positive for an Epstein-Barr virus, a symptom associated with <b>mononucleosis.</b> [...] He hit a game-tying home run in the ninth inning versus Craig Kimbrel of the Boston Red Sox on July 15, which the Yankees eventually won in 16 innings, 4−1. [...] On August 6, Holliday was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a lower back strain.|$|E
500|$|Set {{to begin}} his rookie {{campaign}} with the Giants the following season, Kane experienced a minor setback, as {{he was forced to}} miss the start of training camp with a case of <b>mononucleosis.</b> [...] He nevertheless recovered and joined the Giants full-time to tally 24 goals – third in team scoring – and 41 points in his first WHL season. [...] Finishing tenth in rookie scoring, he was nominated for the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as WHL rookie of the year, which was awarded to Brayden Schenn of the Brandon Wheat Kings.|$|E
500|$|As a true {{freshman}} on the 2007 Michigan team, {{he appeared}} in 10 games, making his first start September 22 against Penn State. [...] His first receptions came during an October 6 game against Eastern Michigan when he recorded 3 catches for 33 yards. [...] He also recorded a reception in the January 1, 2008 Capital One Bowl against the Florida Gators. He was limited as a true sophomore by <b>mononucleosis</b> which caused him to miss the final eight {{games of the season}} for the 2008 team, but did make one start. He received a medical redshirt {{as a result of the}} illness.|$|E
500|$|Scheyer {{signed with}} Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports. [...] Scheyer missed the NBA Draft Combine in late May and lost 10 pounds as he battled <b>mononucleosis,</b> which had {{him out for}} {{approximately}} three weeks and also forced him to miss his graduation. In June he participated in pre-draft workouts for ten teams, including the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, and Phoenix Suns.

500|$|Schilling did {{not arrive}} in Ann Arbor, Michigan {{in time for}} 2006 spring {{practice}} like some of his classmates. [...] Just prior to the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener for the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team, Schilling was diagnosed with <b>mononucleosis.</b> [...] This caused him to miss several weeks of practice. In late October, he decided to redshirt and have a second shoulder surgery after having missed weeks of practice and lost lots of weight. [...] As part of his transition from a Wing T offense that rarely passed, Schilling had to work on improving his pass blocking.|$|E
