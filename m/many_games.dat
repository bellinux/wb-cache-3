5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus <b>many</b> <b>games</b> transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|In 1836 Staunton came to London, {{where he}} took out a {{subscription}} for William Greenwood Walker's Games at Chess, actually played in London, by the late Alexander McDonnell Esq. Staunton was apparently twenty-six when he took a serious interest in chess. He said that at that time the strongest players he saw in London, Saint-Amant and George Walker, could easily have given him rook odds. In 1838 he played <b>many</b> <b>games</b> with Captain Evans, inventor of the Evans Gambit, and also lost a match against the German chess writer Aaron Alexandre. He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master H. W. Popert, a slow, cautious player with great defensive skill.|$|E
5|$|In Division I and Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hockey, {{the fighters}} {{are given a}} Game Disqualification, which is an {{ejection}} from the game and a suspension for as <b>many</b> <b>games</b> as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications {{during the course of}} a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Jersey City Giants of the Class-AA International League after the 1936 season.

Jackson's knees prevented him from appearing in <b>many</b> <b>games</b> with Jersey City as a player, but he remained as the team's manager until July 1938, when he was replaced with Hank DeBerry. The Giants brought Jackson back to MLB as a coach for the remaining 18 months on his contract, succeeding Tommy Clarke, who became a scout.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was sidelined with a groin injury at the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, and did not make his first start until 17 September in a 3–0 victory against Dartford, in which he scored one goal and set up another. This victory provided the springboard for Luton to embark on a 27-game unbeaten run in the league, in which Lawless was heavily involved, scoring five further times and contributing 10 assists. After playing in 32 games and scoring six goals, including <b>many</b> <b>games</b> in an unfamiliar position as a left midfielder, he missed the final part of the season due to injury.

5|$|Legend of Mana was {{directed}} by Mana series creator Koichi Ishii, who had worked on the three previous games in the series.

The game's character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka, who was also new to the series. Retro Gamer, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game.|$|E
5|$|Like most RPGs, the Final Fantasy {{installments}} use {{an experience}} level system for character advancement, in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies. Character classes, specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters, are another recurring theme. Introduced {{in the first}} game, character classes have been used differently in each title. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story, while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in <b>many</b> <b>games,</b> such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside their class.|$|E
