Advanced transmission antenna technology is critical to generate and switch narrow beams rapidly among {{a large number of}} users under quality of service (QoS) constraints such as average delay. In this paper, we jointly optimize resource allocation and congestion control, and compare the performances of two types of satellite transmit antennas: a <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> and a phased array antenna. For a <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> with traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA), throughput is decided by either the most demanding user or the average of all user parameters. For a phased array antenna, joint antenna gain patterning and beam scheduling is given as a function of channel conditions, interference (depending on users' geographical distribution), and average delay requirements. We then develop a low-complexity on-line algorithm of choosing either interference suppression or sequential service for the active users who are closely located within the width of a spotbeam. Due to flexible power allocation, the phased array antenna can provide better performance than the <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> when a small number of users are very demanding or many users are densely crowded in a small area.

40|$|For {{multimedia}} {{and other}} data services over satellite networks, the efficient management of scarce satellite communication resources is critical for the economic competitiveness of the medium. To support {{a broad spectrum of}} users with small terminals at high data rates, narrow transmit spotbeams from the satellite must be used. Since satellite on-board resources are too expensive to illuminate all of the spotbeam-coverage cells within the satellite service area, an optimized method of agile antenna gain patterning and beam scheduling is required to greatly improve the efficiency of transmission and power management. In this thesis, we jointly optimize resource allocation/scheduling, congestion control and antenna gain patterning for communication satellites with advanced transmission antennas. Then, we develop a low-complexity on-line algorithm that considers channel conditions, interference and average delay constraints, and approaches the theoretical steady-state limit. We introduce optimized beam profiling based on traffic demand and channel conditions over satellite downlinks, which can achieve a substantial power gain and reasonable proportional fairness. We show that a modest number of active parallel beams are sufficient to cover many cells efficiently with dynamic capacity allocation. (cont.) Next, for the <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> case, we develop a jointly optimized scheme of beam allocation and congestion control with transmitter-sharing and average delay constraints, which provides high throughput and/or small average queueing delays. Last, we find the solution for joint antenna gain patterning and scheduling by considering spatially close co-channel interference in the use of phased array antenna. We suggest an optimum scheduling policy, which selects users with higher marginal returns of a composite cost function with respect to allocated power, in terms of better channel conditions, less interference (depending on users' geographic distribution), and larger delay. The simulation result indicates that a real-time on-line algorithm can achieve a throughput close to the analytic steady-state upper bound.

Pointing error, end coverage gain, peak gain degradation, etc. are the main concerns. The thermal or dynamic distortions of a reflector antenna structural system can affect the far-field antenna power distribution in a least four ways. (1) The antenna gain is reduced; (2) the main lobe of the antenna can be mispointed thus shifting the destination of the delivered power away from the desired locations; (3) the main lobe of the antenna pattern can be broadened, thus spreading the RF power over a larger area than desired; and (4) the antenna pattern sidelobes can increase, thus increasing the chances of interference among adjacent beams of <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> <b>antenna</b> system or with antenna beams of other satellites.

The Olympus payload description and link budget analysis was performed in order to identify the size of the earth station required for these networks. The performance of the satellite link was simulated using BOSS software package together with some earlier simulation using the TOPSIM software package. The methods of BER estimation used are investigated and various results compared. These simulations covered most aspects of the RF (degradation due to TWTA non-linearity, fading, carrier spacing, co-channel interference) and some aspects of the baseband circuits. These simulation results have been compared with the experimental results and were found to be in close agreement. Thus giving confidence in the simulation methods used.
