As she said in remarks shortly before leaving office, [...] "I have found it highly ironic that, in today's world, when we can be anywhere virtually, more than ever people want us to show up, actually.

Togo happens to be on the U.N. Security Council. Going there, making the personal investment, has a real strategic purpose." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall not}} go near her {{so long as}} that odious actor is hanging about. His smirk at <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> made me ill." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't they?" [...] commented Isobel. [...] "Well, {{that saves}} the Queen some trouble {{of which she}} must be glad as she does not get the subscription.
