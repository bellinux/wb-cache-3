40|$|The {{performance}} and exit flow characteristics of two <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>turbines</b> {{have been investigated}} under steady-state conditions. The two rotors differ mainly in their inlet angle geometry, one has a nominal constant incidence (rotor B) and the other has a constant blade angle (rotor C), {{but also in the}} number of blades. The results showed that the overall peak efficiency of rotor C is higher than that of rotor B. Two different volutes were also used for the tests, differing in their cross-sectional area, which confirm that the new larger area volute turbine has a higher efficiency than the old one, particularly at lower speeds, and a fairly uniform variation with velocity ratio...|$|R

The effects of the solid particles diameter and volume fraction on the flow around the guide vane are discussed, based on which the prediction and analysis of abrasion and cavitation properties on the guiding device were given.

40|$|As axial and {{radial turbine}} designs {{have been pushed}} to their aerothermodynamic and {{mechanical}} limits, the <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>turbine</b> (MFT) concept has been projected to offer performance and durability improvements, especially when ceramic materials are considered. The objective of this NASA/U. S. Army sponsored <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>turbine</b> (AMFT) program {{was to determine the}} level of performance attainable with MFT technology within the mechanical constraints of 1997 projected ceramic material properties. The MFT geometry is similar to a radial turbine, exhibiting a large radius change from inlet to exit, but differing in that the inlet flowpath is not purely radial, nor axial, but mixed; it is the inlet geometry that gives rise to the name 'mixed-flow'. The 'mixed' orientation of the turbine inlet offers several advantages over radial designs by allowing a nonzero inlet blade angle yet maintaining radial-element blades. The oblique inlet not only improves the particle-impact survivability of the design, but improves the aerodynamic performance by reducing the incidence at the blade inlet. The difficulty, however, of using mixed-flow geometry lies in the scarcity of detailed data and documented design experience. This paper reports the design of a MFT stage designed with the intent to maximize aerodynamic performance by optimizing design parameters such as stage reaction, rotor incidence, flowpath shape, blade shape, vane geometry, and airfoil counts using 2 -D, 3 -D inviscid, and 3 -D viscous computational fluid dynamics code. The aerodynamic optimization was accomplished while maintaining mechanical integrity with respect to vibration and stress levels in the rotor. A full-scale cold-flow rig test was performed with metallic hardware fabricated to the specifications of the hot ceramic geometry to evaluate the stage performance...|$|E
40|$|Global {{decarbonizing}} {{efforts in}} transportation industry {{have forced the}} automotive manufacturers to opt for highly downsized high power-to-weight ratio engines. Since its invention, turbocharger remains as integral element {{in order to achieve}} this target. However, although it has been proven that a turbocharger turbine works in highly pulsatile environment, it is still designed under steady state assumption. This is {{due to the lack of}} understanding on the nature of pulsating flow field within the turbocharger turbine stage. This paper presents an effort to visualize the pulsating flow feature using experimentally validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. For this purpose, a lean-vaned <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>turbine</b> with rotational speed of 30000 rpm at 20 Hz flow frequency, which represent turbine operation for 3 -cylinder 4 -stroke engine operating at 800 rpm has been used. Results indicated that the introduction of pulsating flow has resulted in more irregular pattern of flow field as compared to steady flow operation. It has also been indicated that the flow behaves very differently between pressure increment and decrement instances. During the pressure decrement instance, flow blockage in terms of low pressure region occupies most of the turbine passage as the flow exit the turbine...|$|E

This is enabled through the development of a bespoke non-adiabatic pressure loss boundary to represent the turbine rotor. In this paper, turbocharger turbine pulse flow performance predictions are presented along with a comparison of computation duration against the previously established integrated meanline method. Plots of prediction deviation indicate that the mass flow rate and actual power predictions from both methods are highly comparable and are reasonably close to experimental data. However, the new boundary condition required significantly lower computational time and rotor geometrical inputs. In addition, the pressure wave propagation in this simplified unsteady turbine model at different pulse frequencies has also been found to be in agreement with data from the literature, thereby supporting the confidence in its ability to simulate the wave action encountered in turbine pulse flow operation. ozzle and rotor stage pressure loss together...|$|E
40|$|A new {{vertical}} single-regulated <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>turbine</b> with conical guide {{apparatus and}} without spiral casing {{is presented in}} this paper. Runner blades are fixed to the hub and runner band and resemble to the Francis type runner of extremely high specific speed. Due to lack of information and guidelines {{for the design of}} a new turbine, a theoretical model was developed in order to determinate the design duty point, i. e. to determine the optimum narrow operation range of the turbine. It is not necessary to know the kinematic conditions at the runner inlet, but only general information on the geometry of turbine flow-passage, meridional contour of the runner and blading, the number of blades and the turbine speed of rotation. The model is based on the integral tangential lift coefficient, which is the average value over the entire runner blading. The results are calculated for the lift coefficient 0. 5 and 0. 6, for the flow coefficient range from 0. 2 to 0. 36, for the number of the blades between 5 and 13, and are finally presented in the Cordier diagram (specific speed vs. specific diameter). Calculated results of the turbine optimum operation in Cordier diagram correspond very well to the adequate area of Kaplan turbines with medium and low specific speed and extends into the area of Francis turbines with high specific speed. Presented model clearly highlights the parameters that affect specific load of the runner blade row and therefore the optimum turbine operation (discharge-turbine head). The presented method is not limited to a specific reaction type of the hydraulic turbine. The method can therefore be applied to a wide range from mixed-flow (radial-axial) turbines to the axial turbines. Applicability of the method may be considered as a tool in the first stage of the turbine design i. e. when designing the meridional geometry and selecting the number of blades according to calculated operating point. Geometric and energy parameters are generally defined to an extent that these parameters are considered in detailed design using turbulent viscous flow CFD solver...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design methodology {{of a high}} performance Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) for turbocompounding applications {{to be used in}} a 1. 0 L “cost-effective, ultra-efficient heavily downsized gasoline engine for a small and large segment passenger car”. Under this assumption, the LPT was designed to recover the latent energy of discharged exhaust gases at low pressure ratios (1. 05 – 1. 3) and to drive a small electric generator with a maximum power output of 1. 0 kW. The design speed was fixed at 50, 000 rpm with a pressure ratio, PR of 1. 08. Commercially available turbines are not suitable for this purpose due to the very low efficiencies experienced when operating in these pressure ratio ranges. By fixing all the LPT requirements, the turbine loss model was combined with the geometrical model to calculate preliminary LPT geometry. The LPT features a <b>mixed-flow</b> <b>turbine</b> with a cone angle of 40 ° and 9 blades, with an inlet blade angle at radius mean square of + 20 °. The exit-to-inlet area ratio value is approximately 0. 372 which is outside of the conventional range indicating the novelty of the approach. A single passage Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was applied to optimize the preliminary LPT design by changing the inlet absolute angle. The investigation found the optimal inlet absolute angle was 77 °. Turbine off-design performance was then predicted from single passage CFD model. A rapid prototype of the LPT was manufactured and tested in Imperial College turbocharger testing facility under steady-state and pulsating flow. The steady-state testing was conducted over speed parameter ranges from 1206 rpm/K 0. 5 to 1809 rpm/K 0. 5. The test results showed a typical flow capacity trend as a conventional radial turbine but the LPT had higher total-to-static efficiency, ηt-s in the lower pressure ratio regions. A maximum total-to-static efficiency, ηt-s of 0. 758 at pressure ratio, PR ≈ 1. 1 was found, no available turbines exist in this range as parameters. A validation of the predicted single passage CFD analysis for the off-design performance against the LPT test result found a minimum total-to-static efficiency Standard Deviation of ± 0. 026 points for the speed parameter of 1507 rpm/K 0. 5. A minimum Mass Flow Parameter Standard Deviation of ± 0. 091 kg/s K 0. 5 bar is found at 1206 rpm/K 0. 5...|$|E
