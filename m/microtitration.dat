The ELISA was serotype specific when lipopolysaccharide antigens were reacted against sera from convalescent swine. Seroconversion of infected pigs was detectable with the ELISA within 1 to 2 weeks postinoculation and with the <b>microtitration</b> agglutination test 2 to 3 weeks postinoculation.

Genomic DNA purified from C. albicans blastoconidia suspended in blood was amplified by PCR with fungus-specific universal primers ITS 3 and ITS 4.

40|$|We {{developed}} a <b>microtitration</b> method {{to determine the}} parasite burdens in homogenized organs of mice infected with Leishmania infantum.

Rodent models of visceral leishmaniasis have been used for experimental purposes for at least 6 decades (3). Assessment of parasite burdens is usually based on microscopic enumera-tion of amastigotes against host cell nuclei on tissue imprints (4). However, when parasites are confined to a few infected macrophages, optical quantification is not considered reliable (2). Thus, we adapted the sensitive <b>microtitration</b> method of Titus et al.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for circulating IgG mouse antibody to Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein {{was modified}} for use with human sera collected {{in an area of}} northern Zambia that was endemic for malaria and from individuals never exposed to malaria. Optimum sensitivity was achieved using Immulon 2 <b>microtitration</b> plates, boiled casein-Tween 20 blocking buffer, and by adding a solution of boiled casein (4 micrograms/ml) to the capture antigen diluent. The results for the detection of anti-CS IgG correlated well with those of sporozoite immunofluorescence antibody assays. Modification of the ELISA method permitted the simultaneous detection of anti-CS IgG and IgM antibody on a single serum sample in the same well of the <b>microtitration</b> plate and the detection of anti-CS IgG antibody in Kenyan dried whole-blood samples collected on filter-paper.

40|$|Seventy-eight {{clinical}} isolates {{and four}} control strains of viridans streptococci {{were tested in}} parallel for arginine hydrolysis by five different methods.

The clinical isolates were speciated by their biochemical reactions in the API 20 STREP and API 20 ZYM systems. One strain produced only a weak reaction for arginine hydrolysis in the medium by ammonia production, but otherwise the results with this medium, the API 20 STREP and the <b>microtitration</b> plate method were identical.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for measuring the drug sensitivity of human gliomas in short-term culture, using scintillation counting or autofluorography. Cell cultures prepared from malignant astrocytomas were treated with anticancer drugs whilst in exponential growth in <b>microtitration</b> plates. After drug treatment and a recovery period, residual viability was measured by [3 H] leucine incorporation followed by scintillation counting or by [35 S] methionine incorporation and autofluorography in situ. In 5 glioma cell lines tested against 6 drugs, the <b>microtitration</b> method correlated well with monolayer cloning. Although replicate samples of the same tumour showed little variation in chemosensitivity, there was marked variation between the chemosensitivities of cultures derived from the tumours of different patients. However, as variability between replicates was apparent during drug exposure or shortly after, {{it is important to}} allow the assay to run as long as possible after drug removal.

40|$|A <b>microtitration</b> plate based time-resolved {{fluorescence}} (TRF) hybridisation assay {{was developed}} for HLA typing utilising biotinylated sequence-specific catching probes and europium (Eu) labelled gene locus-specific detection probe to allow time-resolved fluorometer reading of the reaction. In an application for HLA-DQA typing a 228 base pair long region of the polymorphic exon 2 of DQA 1 gene was amplified and the denatured PCR product distributed into streptavidin-coated <b>microtitration</b> wells together with the detection probe {{and one of the}} catching probes.

40|$|Studies {{using the}} in vitro {{lymphocyte}} stimulation test (LST) {{were conducted with}} cattle in a dairy herd with {{a high percentage of}} reactors to several serological tests for brucellosis. Lymphocytes were prepared from peripheral bovine blood by the Ficoll-diatrizoate technique. Lymphocytes were cultured using <b>microtitration</b> culture plates. Brucella abortus soluble antigen, at a concentration of 4. 4 microgram/culture, was added to the appropriate wells of <b>microtitration</b> culture plates and incubated for 6 days. The lymphocyte stimulation responses were measured by assaying for [3 H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Seroagglutination tests were conducted simultaneously with the LST, and tissues were collected after slaughter of the cattle for bacteriological culture to isolate B. abortus. All 21 animals studied were serologically negative for anti-brucella antibodies. Two of the 21 animals were classified as infected with Brucella by the LST, and B. abortus biotype 1 was isolated from tissues of these same two animals. The LST exhibited significant sensitivity and specificity in this study, and more observations of this nature might strengthen the application of this assay as an aid in the diagnosis of brucellosis...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{develop the}} simple, rapid and {{sensitive}} dual-label time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay for pepsinogens in human serum. METHODS: Based on two-site sandwich protocol, monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against pepsinogen I (PG I) and PG II were co-coated in 96 <b>microtitration</b> wells, and tracer McAbs against PG I and PG II were labeled with europium (Eu) and samarium (Sm) chelate, respectively. Diluted serum samples of Eu 3 +- and Sm 3 +-McAbs were added into <b>microtitration</b> wells simultaneously. After washing, fluorescence of bound Sm 3 + and Eu 3 + tracers was detected. RESULTS: The detection limit was 0. 2 μg/L for PG I and 0. 05 μg/L for PG II. The assay range was 5. 0 - 320. 0 μg/L for PG I and 1. 0 - 55. 0 μg/L for PG II. The average recovery rate was 102. 7 % for PG I and 98. 8 % for PG II. Sera from healthy controls and patients with gastric disease were analyzed. The PG detected by dual-label assay {{was in good}} agreement with that detected by single-label assay or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

40|$|To gain an {{understanding}} of the role of fimbriae and flagella in the adherence of Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis to inanimate surfaces, the extent of adherence of viable wild-type strains to a polystyrene <b>microtitration</b> plate was determined by a crystal violet staining assay, Elaboration of surface antigens by adherent bacteria was assayed by fimbriae- and flagella-specific ELISAs, Wild-type Enteritidis strains adhered well at 37 degrees C and 25 degrees C when grown in <b>microtitration</b> wells in Colonisation Factor Antigen broth, but not in other media tested, At 37 degrees C, adherent bacteria elaborated copious quantities of SEF 14 fimbrial antigen, whereas at 25 degrees C adherent bacteria elaborated copious quantities of SEF 17 fimbrial antigen. Non-fimbriate and non-flagellate knock-out mutant strains were also assessed in the adherence assay. Mutant strains unable to elaborate SEF 14 and SEF 17 fimbriae adhered poorly at 37 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively, but adherence was not abolished. Non-motile mutant strains showed reduced adherence whilst type- 1, PEF and LPF fimbriae appeared not to contribute to adherence in this assay. These data indicate that SEF 17 and SEF 14 fimbriae mediate bacterial cell aggregation on inanimate surfaces under appropriate growth conditions...|$|E
