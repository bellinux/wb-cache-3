But what can one expect when a rich tradesman buys up a fine estate, and manages it on what he calls 'business lines'? This must mean putting the screw of a <b>merciless</b> <b>competition</b> upon the farmer. On the other hand, you see men with honored names living in extravagant luxury without a thought of their duty to their land, gambling on the Stock Exchange--even singing in music halls. The country's in a bad way when you read of its old aristocracy opening hat shops." ...|$|E
50|$|Dejan and {{his twin}} brother Darko began playing water polo in {{elementary}} school. This was decided after the inducements of a father's friend, who {{saw them as}} {{the future of this}} sport. Both were attracted to other disciplines, but in the end the swimming and handling of the ball in the pool prevailed in reconciliation with other disciplines. At that time Partizan had good and proven coaches, who have emerged in the famous former Yugoslavian water polo school, which base was set by Bata Vlaho Orlić. For Dejan, Nikola Stamenić stood out as a top expert, who would first see his potential in being a coach. He went thru all Partizan and national teams with great success. For a full decade and a half, he wore black and white cap as a team captain. On the other hand, Darko was the recorder for most played games in the most successful national water polo team of all time. Because of the strong and <b>merciless</b> <b>competition</b> in their time, only the best were crowned thru their careers with a vast array of titles. Among them were Udovičić brothers. While his brother Darko still played, Dejan decided {{that the time has come}} for him to become a coach.|$|E
40|$|A perusal of {{this thesis}} reveals meagre {{references}} to printed material {{and a very}} scanty bibliography. The absence of this information is not due {{in any way to}} lack of research work {{on the part of the}} writer, but arises primarily from the newness of the cellophane industry. The comparatively recent establishment of the industry largely accounts for the lack of literature dealing with it. Furthermore, a large number of patents originally covering the process of manufacturing cellophane has expired, thereby exposing the DuPont cellophane company in the United states and the cellophane subsidiary of Canadian Industries Limited in Canada to <b>merciless</b> <b>competition</b> on the part of outsiders.

So far, telecommunication industry provided infrastructure and voice-based services. On the other hand, computer industry provided applications and services based on data transfer. With an extensive growth of the Internet and Internet-oriented services and applications, merge between the two worlds became an imperative. Newborn ICT industry is focused on bringing services to clients wherever they are and whichever device they are using. Services are becoming even more interesting with the introduction of mobile access to the global network. New protocols, such as WAP, enable 24 / 7 access to the services that were primarily designed for non-mobile users. Since service and content providing is becoming main source of revenues, rapid service development is an imperative in <b>merciless</b> market <b>competition.</b> Every content provider that hosts services which offer content to the users must have an infrastructure that enables content offering, customer care and billing. Development of the required infrastructure is long and expensive process that yields with low or no profit. As for service providers and developers, non-collaborative services have negative impact on end users...|$|R

The results of the findings part of the disertation aim to find out what image of Bulgaria has been created by two independent but very important to tourists sources - the Bulgarian tourism authorities and tour operators from two major, for the country, target markets.
