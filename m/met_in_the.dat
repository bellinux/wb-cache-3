5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end of}} this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being <b>met</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper and middle sloughs and generally being <b>met</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E
