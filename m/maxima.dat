5|$|In their 1914 Flora of Jamaica, William Fawcett and Alfred Barton Rendle linked Sloane's {{illustration}} to {{the tree}} species that was then known as Ficus suffocans, a name that {{had been assigned to}} it in August Grisebach's Flora of the British West Indian Islands. Gordon DeWolf agreed with their conclusion and used the name F. <b>maxima</b> for that species in the 1960 Flora of Panama.

5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with <b>Maxima,</b> a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While <b>Maxima</b> sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E

40|$|The firm should pursue both <b>maximum</b> {{return rate}} on capital and <b>maximum</b> return rate on equity simultaneously. <b>Maximum</b> return rate on capital {{is the primary}} goal for firms because <b>maximum</b> return rate on capital {{guarantees}} efficiency. Therefore, <b>maximum</b> profit, <b>maximum</b> {{market value of the}} firm, <b>maximum</b> value of equity and <b>maximum</b> return rate on equity are inappropriate to be the primary goal. Since gross profit is independent of capital structure, capital structure just distributes return on capital into equity and debt (i. e., <b>maximum</b> return rate on equity determines capital structure). The <b>maximum</b> return rate on equity is the secondary goal that the firm pursues. Leverage makes the return rate on equity be higher than interest rate. Leverage explains the puzzle of equity premium...|$|R

5|$|Thomas Nuttall {{described}} the {{species in the}} second volume of the his 1846 work The North American Sylva with specific epithet aurea ('golden' in Latin). In 1768, Scottish botanist Philip Miller described Ficus <b>maxima,</b> citing Carl Linnaeus' Hortus Cliffortianus (1738) and Hans Sloane's Catalogus plantarum quæ in insula Jamaica (1696). Sloane's illustration of the species, published in 1725, depicted it with figs borne singly, a characteristic of the Ficus subgenus Pharmacosycea. As {{a member of the}} subgenus Urostigma, F. aurea has paired figs. However, a closer examination of Sloane's description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the subgenus Urostigma (since it had other diagnostic of that subgenus), almost certainly F. aurea, and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably artistic license. Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane's illustration was based and concluded that Miller's F. <b>maxima</b> was, in fact, F. aurea. In his description of F. aurea, which was based on plant material collected in Florida, Thomas Nuttall considered the possibility that his plants belonged to the species that Sloane had described, but {{came to the conclusion that}} it was a new species. Under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the name F. <b>maxima</b> has priority over F. aurea since Miller's description was published in 1768, while Nuttall's description was published in 1846.|$|E

The crabs' unusual size, up to , and longevity (up to 15years) are also interpreted as evidence of a long-established population, by analogy with island gigantism.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative <b>maxima</b> and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the <b>maxima</b> are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
