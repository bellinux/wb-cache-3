The test model levitated at speeds above 22 mph, but Richard Post believes that, on real tracks, levitation {{could be achieved}} at [...] "as little as 1 to 2 mph". [...] Below the transition speed the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> increases with vehicle speed; above the transition speed, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> decreases with speed. [...] For example, at 500 km/h the lift to drag ratio is 200:1, far higher than any aircraft but much lower than classic steel on steel rail which reaches 1000:1 (rolling resistance). This occurs because the inductive impedance increases proportionately with speed which compensates for the faster rate of change of the field seen by the coils, thus giving a constant current flow and power consumption for the levitation.|$|E

50|$|The Mk.1 and Mk.1A {{computers}} were electromechanical, {{and many of}} their mechanical calculations required drive movements of precise speeds. They used reversible two-phase capacitor-run induction motors with tungsten contacts. These were stabilized primarily by rotary <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> (eddy-current) slip clutches, similar to classical rotating-magnet speedometers, but with a much higher torque. One part of the drag was geared to the motor, and the other was constrained by a fairly stiff spring. This spring offset the null position of the contacts by an amount proportional to motor speed, thus providing velocity feedback. Flywheels mounted on the motor shafts, but coupled by magnetic drags, prevented contact chatter when the motor was at rest. Unfortunately, the flywheels must also have slowed down the servos somewhat.A more elaborate scheme, which placed a rather large flywheel and differential between the motor and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag,</b> eliminated velocity error for critical data, such as gun orders.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a novel {{solution for the}} active lo-comotion of a miniaturized endoscopic capsule in the gastrointesti-nal (GI) tract. The authors present the design, development, and testing of a wireless endocapsule with hybrid locomotion, where hybrid locomotion {{is defined as the}} combination between internal actuation mechanisms and external <b>magnetic</b> <b>dragging.</b> The cap-sule incorporates an internal actuating legged mechanism, which modifies the capsule profile, and small permanent magnets, which interact with an external magnetic field, thus imparting a dragging motion to the device. The legged mechanism is actuated whenever the capsule gets lodged in collapsed areas of the GI tract. This allows modification of the capsule profile and enables <b>magnetic</b> <b>dragging</b> to become feasible and effective once again. A key com-ponent of the endoscopic pill is the internal mechanism, endowed with a miniaturized brushless motor and featuring compact design, and adequate mechanical performance. The internal mechanism is able to generate a substantial force, which allows the legs to open against the intestinal tissue that has collapsed around the capsule body. An accurate simulation of the performance of the minia-turized motor under magnetic fields was carried out in order to define the best configuration of the internal permanent magnets (which are located very close to the motor) and the best tradeoff operating distance for the external magnet, which is responsible for magnetically dragging the capsule. Finally, a hybrid capsule was developed generating 3. 8 N {{at the tip of the}} legged mechanism and a magnetic link force up to 135 mN. The hybrid capsule and its wireless control were extensively tested in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, thus confirming fulfilment of the design specifications and demon-strating a good ability to manage collapsed areas of the intestinal tract.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic {{endovascular}} navigation {{of wireless}} or soft-tethered endoluminal devices was recently {{proposed in the}} literature. This approach allows for innovative therapeutic procedures, but developing a real-time tracking strategy, compatible with <b>magnetic</b> <b>dragging,</b> is a challenging problem and is not yet solved. METHODS: Two-dimensional (2 D) imaging ultrasound (US) -based tracking algorithms applied to a platform for cardiovascular treatment, i. e. the MicroVAST platform, were implemented and tested for deriving the optimal strategy for tracking endovascular devices <b>dragged</b> by <b>magnetic</b> locomotion. RESULTS: The algorithm, based on the combination of Shi-Tomasi features detector, Lucas-Kanade features tracking and watershed segmentation technique, was demonstrated {{to be the most}} reliable and accurate solution for the implementation of the tracking strategy of soft-tethered endoluminal devices.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of exoplanetary atmospheres, we present a {{comprehensive}} linear analysis of forced, damped, magnetized shallow water systems, exploring the effects of dimensionality, geometry (Cartesian, pseudo-spherical and spherical), rotation, magnetic tension and hydrodynamic and magnetic sources of friction. Across {{a broad range of}} conditions, we find that the key governing equation for atmospheres and quantum harmonic oscillators are identical, even when forcing (stellar irradiation), sources of friction (molecular viscosity, Rayleigh drag and <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag)</b> and magnetic tension are included. The global atmospheric structure is largely controlled by a single, key parameter that involves the Rossby and Prandtl numbers. This near-universality breaks down when either molecular viscosity or <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> acts non-uniformly across latitude or a poloidal magnetic field is present, suggesting that these effects will introduce qualitative changes to the familiar chevron-shaped feature witnessed in simulations of atmospheric circulation. We also find that hydrodynamic and magnetic sources of friction have dissimilar phase signatures and affect the flow in fundamentally different ways, implying that using Rayleigh drag to mimic <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> is inaccurate. We exhaustively lay down the theoretical formalism (dispersion relations, governing equations and time-dependent wave solutions) for a broad suite of models. In all situations, we derive the steady state of an atmosphere, which is relevant to interpreting infrared phase and eclipse maps of exoplanetary atmospheres. We elucidate a pinching effect that confines the atmospheric structure to be near the equator.

We find that atmospheric pressures remain close to their local saturation values in all cases. Despite the emergence of strongly supersonic winds which carry sublimating mass away from the substellar point, the atmospheres do not extend much beyond the day-night terminators. Ground temperatures, which determine the planetary thermal (infrared) signature, are largely unaffected by exchanges with the atmosphere and thus follow the effective irradiation pattern. Atmospheric temperatures, however, which control cloud condensation and thus albedo properties, can deviate substantially from the irradiation pattern. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> and ohmic dissipation can also strongly impact the atmospheric behavior, depending on atmospheric composition and the planetary magnetic field strength.

40|$|We present {{scaling laws}} for advection, radiation, <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> and ohmic {{dissipation}} in the atmospheres of hot giant exoplanets. In {{the limit of}} weak thermal ionization, ohmic dissipation increases with the planetary equilibrium temperature (T_eq >~ 1000 K) faster than the insolation power does, eventually reaching values >~ 1 % of the insolation power, which may be sufficient to inflate the radii of hot Jupiters. At higher T_eq values still, <b>magnetic</b> <b>drag</b> rapidly brakes the atmospheric winds, which reduces the associated ohmic dissipation power. For example, for a planetary field strength B= 10 G, the fiducial scaling laws indicate that ohmic dissipation exceeds 1 % of the insolation power over the equilibrium temperature range T_eq ~ 1300 - 2000 K, with a peak contribution at T_eq ~ 1600 K. Evidence for magnetically dragged winds at the planetary thermal photosphere could emerge {{in the form of}} reduced longitudinal offsets for the dayside infrared hotspot. This suggests the possibility of an anticorrelation between the amount of hotspot offset and the degree of radius inflation, linking the atmospheric and interior properties of hot giant exoplanets in an observationally testable way.
