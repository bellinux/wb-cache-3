5|$|The {{emerging}} {{discipline of}} geology also brought {{natural history and}} natural philosophy closer together; {{the establishment of the}} stratigraphic column linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. Georges Cuvier and others <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell, William Buckland, Mary Anning, and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth. Most of these geologists held to catastrophism, but Charles Lyell's influential Principles of Geology (1830) popularised Hutton's uniformitarianism, a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the City of Springfield was on {{the brink}} of {{financial}} default, and thus taken over by a Commonwealth-appointed Finance Control Board until 2009. Disbanded in June of that year, the Control Board <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> stabilizing Springfield's finances. While Springfield has achieved balanced budgets since 2009, the city has not enlarged its tax-base, and thus many of its public works projects— which have been in the pipeline for years, some even decades— remain unfinished, (e.g., repairs to Springfield's landmark Campanile.). Springfield is being considered for a $800million development project; MGM Springfield. To many this is an impressive feat given the natural disasters and continuous cuts to state aide during the Great Recession.|$|E
25|$|By the 1930s {{animation}} {{was well}} established in Japan {{as an alternative}} format to the live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata, who still worked in cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation. Other creators, Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nonetheless <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> in animation technique; they benefited from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda. The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka, produced by Masaoka in 1933. By 1940, numerous anime artists' organizations had risen, including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka. The first feature-length animated film was Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors directed by Seo in 1944 with sponsorship by the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by Abraham Darby, who <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709. However, the coke pig iron he made was used mostly {{for the production of}} cast iron goods, such as pots and kettles. He had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots, cast by his patented process, were thinner and cheaper than theirs. Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron in forges until the mid-1750s, when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron. Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III.|$|E
40|$|The Kurdistan Region of Iraq has <b>made</b> <b>greater</b> <b>strides</b> towards gender {{equality}} {{than the federal}} government of Iraq, with CEDAW principles and the Women, Peace and Security agenda internalised {{to a greater extent}} in regional laws and regulations. Women’s rights activism and some policymakers’ willingness to realise change have played important roles in this. However, discriminatory rules and practices still exist, and changes are not fully implemented and monitored in the Region. This paper argues that the Kurdistan Region’s policies of {{gender equality}} are linked to its dependence on multilateral organisations and Western states, as well as its government’s aspiration to gain international legitimacy for statehood. Long-term international involvement in the Kurdistan Region has strengthened Kurdish autonomy, integrated international actors into administrative, political, economic and social life, and created the perception that external connections are helping the Region achieve its ultimate goal of independence...|$|R

25|$|Black female {{artists such}} as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> since the hip hop {{industry}} first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop. Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates women's struggle.|$|E
25|$|The gap {{caused by}} the digital divide in China is {{beginning}} to close. The percentage of the Chinese population using the internet has been increasing dramatically each year. In the year 2000 only 1.7 percent of the Chinese population were internet users. By 2010 that percentage had increased to 31.6 percent of the population. This data shows that the gap separating China {{and the rest of}} the world is closing. However, the digital divide among Chinese citizens remains strong. Many Chinese citizens are faced with the issues of the digital divide because of their income, education, or location. While China has <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> in improving the country's communication infrastructure as well as narrowing the overall digital divide, there remains a divide between urban and rural areas of the country. This divide between rural and urban, developed and under developed, is illustrated in the lack of ICTs between the western (i.e., Xinjiang province) and eastern (i.e., Jiangsu province) parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|Brazil generates nearly three-quarters (73%) of its {{electricity}} from hydropower. This contribution was {{as high as}} four-fifths in 2010 but the share of hydropower has been eroded {{by a combination of}} declining rainfall and ageing hydroelectric plants, many of which date back to the 1960s and 1970s. Intensive use of thermoelectric power plants operating on fossil fuels has compensated for much of the loss, since the share of new sources of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, in the energy mix remains small. Moreover, although Brazil has <b>made</b> <b>great</b> <b>strides</b> in the use of bioethanol in transportation, there has been little focus on research and innovation in energy generation, be it in terms of developing new sources of energy or improving energy efficiency. In light of the foregoing, there is little reason to expect public investment in energy R to rebound to the levels seen {{at the turn of the}} century that would rebuild Brazil’s international competitiveness in this field.|$|E
