50|$|Mariner 2 was {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 12 at 06:53:14 UTC on August 27, 1962 by a two-stage Atlas-Agena rocket.The two-stage Atlas-Agena rocket carrying Mariner 1 had veered off-course during its launch on July 22, 1962 {{due to a}} defective signal from the Atlas and a bug in the program equations of the ground-based guidance computer, and subsequently the spacecraft was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer. Two days after that launch, the backup probe and booster (Atlas vehicle 179D) were rolled out to LC-12. Mariner 2 nearly met the same fate as its predecessor {{when one of the}} Atlas's verniers moved to <b>maximum</b> <b>stop</b> shortly before BECO. This caused a rapid roll of the launch vehicle that quickly approached one revolution per second and also made it impossible for ground guidance to lock onto the Atlas and issue a counteracting command. With the structural integrity of the booster in jeopardy, the Range Safety officer prepared to issue the destruct command, but after a few tense moments, the rolling motion stopped and the launch proceeded uneventfully. The incident was traced to a loose wire in the Atlas programmer which was pushed back into place by the centrifugal force of the roll, which also by fortunate coincidence left the Atlas only a few degrees off from where it started and within the range of the Agena's horizontal sensor.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} stopping {{cross section}} (SCS) of Al 2 O 3 for proton beams is studied both experimentally and theoretically. The measurements are made for proton energies from 40 keV up to 1 MeV, which cover the <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> region, using two experimental methods, the transmission technique at low energies (~ 40 – 175 keV) and the Rutherford backscattering at high energies (≈ 190 – 1000 keV). These new data reveal an increment of 16 % in the SCS around the <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> with respect to older measurements. The theoretical study includes electronic stopping power calculations based on the dielectric formalism and on the transport cross section (TCS) model to describe the electron excitations of Al 2 O 3. The non-linear TCS calculations of the SCS for valence electrons together with the generalized oscillator strengths (GOS) model for the core electrons compare well with the experimental data in {{the whole range of}} energies considered.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} jet {{stopping}} in strongly-coupled QCD-like plasmas have used gauge-gravity duality {{to find that}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> distance scales like E^{ 1 / 3 } for large jet energies E. In recent work studying jets that are created by finite-size sources in the gauge theory, we found an additional scale: the typical (as opposed to <b>maximum)</b> jet <b>stopping</b> distance scales like (EL) ^{ 1 / 4 }, where L is the size of the space-time region where the jet is created. In this paper, we show that the results of our previous, somewhat involved computation in the gravity dual, and the (EL) ^{ 1 / 4 } scale in particular, can be very easily reproduced and understood in terms of the distance that high-energy particles travel in AdS_ 5 -Schwarzschild space before falling into the black brane. We also investigate how stopping distances depend on the conformal dimension of the source operator used to create the jet. Comment: 30 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Microfabricated {{interdigitated}} {{electrode array}} is a con-venient form of electrode geometry for dielectrophoretic trapping of biological particles within micro-fluidic biochips. We have previ-ously reported experimental results and {{finite element modeling}} of the holding forces for {{both positive and negative}} dielectrophoretic traps on microfabricated interdigitated electrodes within a microflu-idic biochip fabricated in silicon with a 12 µm deep chamber and anodic-bonded glass cover. Based on these prior studies, we present in this paper a dynamic study to investigate the stopping capability of dielectrophoretic devices with limited electrode teeth. Simulation re-sults on the issues of design and optimization of the dielectrophoretic devices are also presented and discussed in detail. Simulation results show that the <b>maximum</b> particle <b>stopping</b> distance in a specific de-vice is very sensitive to the chamber height due to the near-electrode nature of DEP force. The relationship between <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> distance and the applied voltage is presented, and the electrode spac-ing is found to be important in designing the electrode geometry. The spacing should be no less than the chamber height in order to ef-ficiently capture the particles in a relatively short range at a given applied voltage and flow rate...|$|R

In this parameter range, discrepancies of up to 30 % exist between the various stopping theories and hardly any experimental data are available. The considered plasma, created by irradiating a thin carbon foil with two high-energy laser beams, is fully-ionized with a temperature of nearly 200 eV. To study the interaction at the <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> power, Monte-Carlo calculations of the ion charge state in the plasma are carried out at a projectile energy of 0. 5 MeV per nucleon.

40|$|Previous {{top-down}} {{studies of}} jet stopping in strongly-coupled QCD-like plasmas with gravity duals {{have been in}} the infinite 't Hooft coupling limit lambda -> infinity. They have found that, though a wide range of jet stopping distances are possible depending on initial conditions, the <b>maximum</b> jet <b>stopping</b> distance l_max scales with energy as E^(1 / 3) at large energy. But it has always been unclear whether the large-coupling and high-energy limits commute. In this paper, we use the string alpha' expansion in AdS-CFT to study the corrections to the lambda=infinity result in powers of 1 /lambda. For the particular type of "jets" that we study, we find that (i) the naive expansion in 1 /lambda breaks down for certain initial conditions but (ii) the relative corrections to the <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> distance are small when 1 /lambda is small. More specifically, we find that the expansion in 1 /lambda is well behaved for jets whose stopping distance l_stop is in the range lambda^(- 1 / 6) l_max << l_stop <~ l_max, but the expansion breaks down (and the fate of lambda=infinity results is uncertain) for jets created {{in such a way that}} l_stop << lambda^(- 1 / 6) l_max. The analysis requires assessing the effects of all higher-derivative corrections to the supergravity action for the gravity dual.

His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the <b>maximum</b> <b>stopping</b> potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy {{is determined by the}} frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised {{in a matter of minutes}} even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.|$|R

The International Space Station (ISS) {{must be able}} to withstand the hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids and orbital debris that strike its many surfaces. In order to design and implement shielding which will prevent hull penetration or other operational losses, NASA must first model the orbital debris and micrometeoroid environment. Based upon this environment, special multi-stage shields called Whipple and Enhanced Stuffed Whipple Shields are developed and implemented to protect ISS surfaces. Ballistic limit curves that establish shield failure criteria are determined via ground testing. These curves are functions of material strength, shield spacing, projectile size, shape and density, {{as well as a number}} of other variables. The combination of debris model and ballistic limit equations allows NASA to model risk to ISS using a hydro-code called BUMPER.
