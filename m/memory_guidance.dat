40|$|Visual task {{performance}} is generally stronger in familiar environments. One {{reason for this}} familiarity benefit is that we learn where to direct our visual attention and effective attentional deployment enhances performance. Visual working memory plays {{a central role in}} supporting long-term <b>memory</b> <b>guidance</b> of visuospatial attention. We adapted a change detection task to create a new paradigm for investigating long-term <b>memory</b> <b>guidance</b> of attention. During the training phase, subjects viewed images in a flicker paradigm and were asked to detect between one and three changes in the images. The test phase required subjects to detect a single change in a one-shot change detection task in which they held all possible locations of changes in visual working memory and deployed attention to those locations to determine if a change occurred. Subjects detected significantly more changes in images for which they had been trained to detect the changes, demonstrating that memory of the images guided subjects in deploying their attention. Moreover, capacity to detect changes was greater for images that had multiple changes during the training phase. In Experiment 2, we observed that capacity to detect changes for the 3 -studied change condition increased significantly with more study exposures and capacity was significantly higher than 1, indicating that subjects were able to attend to more than one location. Together, these findings suggest memory and attentional systems interact via working memory such that long-term memory can be used to direct visual spatial attention to multiple locations based on previous experience...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown interactions between the process of keeping information 'online' in working memory, and the processes that select relevant information for a response.

Neurophysiological data, from functional brain imaging, indicate that the interaction between working memory and attention is based on neuronal mechanisms distinct from the processes mediating 'bottom-up' priming effects from implicit memory.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{extended}} previous findings of geographical slant perception, in which verbal judgments of the incline of hills were greatly overestimated but motoric (haptic) adjustments {{were much more}} accurate. In judging slant from memory following a brief or extended time delay, subjects' verbal judgments were greater than those given when viewing hills.

40|$|Visual attentional {{capacity}} is severely limited, but humans excel in familiar visual contexts, {{in part because}} long-term memories guide efficient deployment of attention. To investigate the neural substrates that support memory-guided visual attention, we performed a set of functional MRI experiments that contrast long-term, memory-guided visuospatial attention with stimulus-guided visuospatial attention in a change detection task. Whereas the dorsal attention network was activated for both forms of attention, the cognitive control network (CCN) was preferentially activated during memory-guided attention. Three posterior nodes in the CCN, posterior precuneus, posterior callosal sulcus/mid-cingulate, and lateral intraparietal sulcus exhibited the greatest specificity for memory-guided attention. These 3 regions exhibit functional connectivity at rest, and we propose that they forma subnetworkwithin the broader CCN. Based on the task activation patterns, we conclude that the nodes of this subnetwork are preferentially recruited for long-term <b>memory</b> <b>guidance</b> of visuospatial attention.

40|$|Luck and Vogel (1997) {{showed that}} the storage {{capacity}} of visual working memory is about four objects and that this capacity {{does not depend on}} the number of features making up the objects. Thus, visual working memory seems to process integrated objects rather than individual features, just as verbal working memory handles higher-order "chunks" instead of individual features or letters. In this article, we present a model based on synchronization and desynchronization of reverberatory neural assemblies, which can parsimoniously account for both the limited capacity of visual working memory, and for the temporary binding of multiple assemblies into a single pattern. A critical capacity of about three to four independent patterns showed up in our simulations, consistent with the results of Luck and Vogel. The same desynchronizing mechanism optimizing phase segregation between assemblies coding for separate features or multifeature objects poses a limit to the number of oscillatory reverberations. We show how retention of multiple features as visual chunks (feature conjunctions or objects) in terms of synchronized reverberatory assemblies may be achieved with and without long-term <b>memory</b> <b>guidance...</b>|$|E

Taking {{account of the}} mutual impacts of distributed generation and reactive power, to determine the optimal position and capacity of the compensation device to be installed, the paper proposed an improved Tabu search algorithm for reactive power optimization. The voltage quality is considered of the model using minimum network active power loss as objective Function.

40|$|One {{might assume}} that {{familiarity}} with a scene or previous encounters with objects {{embedded in a}} scene would benefit subsequent search for those items. However, {{in a series of}} experiments we show {{that this is not the}} case: When participants were asked to subsequently search for multiple objects in the same scene, search performance remained essentially unchanged over the course of searches despite increasing scene familiarity. Similarly, looking at target objects during previews, which included letter search, 30 seconds of free viewing, or even 30 seconds of memorizing a scene, also did not benefit search for the same objects later on. However, when the same object was searched for again memory for the previous search was capable of producing very substantial speeding of search despite many different intervening searches. This was especially the case when the previous search engagement had been active rather than supported by a cue.

40|$|Many factors {{influence}} visual search, {{including how}} much targets stand out (i. e., their visual salience) {{and whether they}} are currently relevant (i. e., Are they in working memory?). Although these are two known influences on search performance, {{it is unclear how}} they interact to guide attention. The present study explored this interplay by having participants hold an item in memory for a subsequent test while simultaneously conducting a multiple-target visual search. Importantly, the memory item could match one or neither of two targets from the search. In Experiment 1, when the memory item did not match either target, participants found a high-salience target first, demonstrating a baseline salience effect. This effect was exaggerated when a high-salience target was in working memory and completely reversed when a low-salience target was in memory, demonstrating a powerful influence of working <b>memory</b> <b>guidance.</b> Experiment 2 amplified the salience effect by including very high-salience, “pop-out”-like targets. Yet this salience effect was still attenuated when the memory item matched a less salient target. Experiment 3 confirmed these were memory-based effects and not priming.

40|$|The perceptual load {{theory in}} {{selective}} attention literature proposes that the interference from task-irrelevant distractor is eliminated when perceptual capacity is fully consumed by task-relevant information. However, the biased competition model {{suggests that the}} contents of working memory (WM) can guide attentional selection automatically, even when this guidance is detrimental to visual search. An intriguing but unsolved question is {{what will happen when}} selective attention is influenced by both perceptual load and WM guidance. To study this issue, behavioral performances and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded when participants were presented with a cue to either identify or hold in memory and had to perform a visual search task subsequently, under conditions of low or high perceptual load. Behavioural data showed that high perceptual load eliminated the attentional capture by WM. The ERP results revealed an obvious WM guidance effect in P 1 component with invalid trials eliciting larger P 1 than neutral trials, regardless of the level of perceptual load. The interaction between perceptual load and WM guidance was significant for the posterior N 1 component. The <b>memory</b> <b>guidance</b> effect on N 1 was eliminated by high perceptual load. Standardized Low Resolution Electrical Tomography Analysis (sLORETA) showed that the WM guidance effect and the perceptual load effect on attention can be localized into the occipital area and parietal lobe, respectively. Merely identifying the cue produced no effect on the P 1 or N 1 component. These results suggest that in selective attention, the information held in WM could capture attention at the early stage of visual processing in the occipital cortex. Interestingly, this initial capture of attention by WM could be modulated by the level of perceptual load and the parietal lobe mediates target selection at the discrimination stage...|$|E

In this paper, we introduce a tool architecture supporting continuous learning and reuse of all kinds of experience from the software engineering domain, present the underlying methodology, and point out organizational aspects to be considered.

40|$|Top-down {{guidance}} of {{behavior in a}} complex and dynamically changing world is often based on information held in working <b>memory.</b> Such <b>guidance</b> serves to bias decision-making processes in directions consistent with externally set rules or internally maintained intentions. Orthogonal to this goal-driven guidance, decisions may be biased also by stimulus-driven factors, such as the automatic reactivation of episodic associations that accompanied the current stimulus in a previous instance. We investigated whether top-down and bottom-up processes account for variation in context based decision making {{as measured by the}} AX-CPT in a behavioral [1] and fMRI study [2]. Moreover, several behavioural studies have indicated that transiently induced positive affect modulates control processes in context-based decision making, generally leading to enhanced flexibility. Using ERPs in a classic AX-CPT, we studied the temporal dynamics of a positive affect induction on control processes in context-based decision making [3]. Additionally, we studied learning the associations between a situation, the response to it, and the outcome of that decision and the effect of basal ganglia modulations on this learning process by means of a Parkinson’s patient study. Studies [1] and [2] pointed out that in decisions with rapidly changing environmental demands, goal-driven preparation is often beneficial but may also hamper performance which can be overcome by applying increased control. Moreover, this top-down bias is regulated more efficiently when the specific stimulus is presented in the same context it was previously associated with, compared to when it is presented in a new and unusual context. Additionally, fMRI study shed light on the way these stimulus-driven performance changes may be represented in the brain. Study [3] showed that a positive affect induction influenced reactive and evaluative components of control (indexed by the N 2 elicited by the target, and by the Error-Related Negativity elicited after incorrect responses) in an AX-CPT task, whereas cue-induced preparation and maintenance processes remained largely unaffected (as reflected in the P 3 b and the Contingent Negative Variation components of the ERP).

Previous {{research has suggested that}} holding items in visual working <b>memory</b> influences the <b>guidance</b> of selective attention and performance on attentional tasks. It has also been demonstrated that visual attention is strongly influenced by overlearned spatial stimuli (symbolic attention). However, substantially less work has examined the direct connection between spatial attention, symbolic attention, and working memory. This dissertation investigates the relationship between exogenous, endogenous, and symbolic attention as it relates to working memory and attentional allocation. Furthermore, it is examined how allowing the cue to become task relevant (though unrelated to the target detection task) influences performance on standard attentional tasks. ^ Spatial cues held in working memory and presented online were shown to guide visual attention in a complex search task. Furthermore, in support of the flexible nature of attentional control settings, participants also demonstrated the ability to avoid attending to features in the environment that matched the working memory load of the observer in order to best adhere to task demands. This top-down control of visual attention via the contents of working memory was also seen with endogenous cues and to some degree exogenous cue, demonstrating the importance of one’s attentional control setting when guiding visual behavior. The current thesis provides further evidence in regards to the degree to which attentional cues are {{under the control of the}} observer, how task relevant cues influence performance on attentional task, as well as a more complete understanding of the complex relationship between attention and working memory. ...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} neural {{mechanisms}} supporting working <b>memory</b> (WM) <b>guidance</b> of visual attention, {{focusing on the}} role of the thalamus. Chapter 1 is a review of the relevant literature and sets-up the specific research aims. Chapters 2 and 3 explore the role of the thalamus on guidance of attention by WM contents. Stroke patients with focal-brain lesions performed a WM-guided search task. In valid conditions, the colour of the search target was pre-cued by the WM cue while on neutral conditions there was no cue prior to search. In invalid conditions, the WM cue specified the colour of a search distracter and the target appeared elsewhere. First, it was hypothesized that lesions to the thalamus could lead to deficits in attentional control (e. g. failing to separate irrelevant memory contents with relevant target information and leading to increased capture from WM-like distracters during invalid search conditions). An alternative hypothesis was that the thalamus may support the capture of attention by WM contents, hence thalamic patients would display little bias of attention from the WM contents, despite those contents are being maintained in memory. It was found that patients with focal-thalamic lesions especially in the ventrolateral nucleus, showed no search benefit from the valid cues on search as opposed to a control group of patients with lesions outside the thalamus and non-stroke patients. In the invalid condition, thalamic patients showed no capture by the irrelevant search item that matched the WM cue, whereas a group of healthy age-match controls exhibited the normal effect of capture by irrelevant contents held in WM. These observations suggest that lesions to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus impair the capture of attention from WM contents. In Chapter 4, I aimed to establish the role of cortical structures that are known to be structurally connected with the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (i. e. superior frontal gyrus) in WM guidance of attention. To do this, I investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsal frontal cortex in WM guidance of attention under distinct WM loads. I found that despite the effect of WM guidance of attention decreasing as WM load increased, frontal-tDCS modulated WM guidance in these conditions. We suggest that the dorsal frontal cortex forms part of a network alongside the thalamus in supporting WM guidance of attention. Finally, I conducted a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment (Chapter 5) with healthy volunteers to test the hypothesis that the thalamus plays a role in WM guidance when learning of abstract cue-target feature associations needs to take place for guidance of behaviour to emerge. I used four Japanese ideograms as WM cues, each associated with the colour surrounding the sought after target in the subsequent search display (valid trials). In the neutral condition, four different Japanese ideograms were presented that did not predict the colour of the target. Hence, for WM to guide attention the association between the abstract cue and the colour that surrounded the search target needed to be learned. I found that responses in the thalamus and the frontoparietal cortex displayed sensitivity to the predictiveness of the ideogram cues as WM guidance of attention emerged during learning. The findings reported in this thesis demonstrate the pivotal role of the thalamus in WM guidance of attention. Open Acces...|$|R
