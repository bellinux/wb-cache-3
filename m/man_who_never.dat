5|$|The {{following}} year Sellers {{appeared in a}} further three television series based on The Goons, which aired on Britain's new ITV channel. The series were The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d, A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred. In 1957 film producer Michael Relph became impressed with Sellers's portrayal of an elderly character in Idiot Weekly, and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden's The Smallest Show on Earth, supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now {{thought of as a}} minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war era. Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award winning film The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Never</b> Was. Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi's offbeat black comedy The Naked Truth, opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price.|$|E

25|$|Will Hutchins as Coley. As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins {{was cast}} in the same burst of {{inspiration}} that Hellman had when he also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, when The Shooting began production Hutchins was already fully identified with the western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a funny and charming <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> complained about the often adverse filming conditions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve {{as a means to}} exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about cultural values and lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told {{the story of a young}} <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.|$|E
25|$|Wartime London has {{featured}} in many films, with The Man Who Loved Redheads and Zeppelin (1971) among those set during the First World War. The 1943 film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp covered 40 {{years in the}} city, including the Edwardian era, the First World War and the Second World War. Several others made during the Second World War itself, featured London locations, including Millions Like Us (1943) and Waterloo Road (1944). The Blitz featured prominently in the Ealing drama The Bells Go Down (1943), and in Humphrey Jennings' drama-documentary Fires Were Started (1943). The latter featured real firemen recreating scenes from the bombings. At the same time, a number of London-set films were being made in Hollywood, like Waterloo Bridge (1940), Mrs. Miniver (1942) and Forever and a Day (1943). The latter followed several generations of owners of a London house until 1943. Later films set in the city during World War II include The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Never</b> Was (1955), I Was Monty's Double (1958), Battle of Britain (1969), Hanover Street (1979), Hope and Glory (1987), Shining Through (1992) and The End of the Affair (1999), {{as well as some}} low-budget Italian-made war films like Stukas Over London (1970) and From Hell to Victory (1979).|$|E

25|$|After {{a bitter}} debate in Congress the Republic of Texas was voluntarily annexed in 1845, which Mexico had {{repeatedly}} warned meant war. In May 1846, Congress {{declared war on}} Mexico after Mexican troops massacred a U.S. Army detachment in a disputed unsettled area. However the homefront was polarized as Whigs opposed and Democrats supported the war. The U.S. Army, augmented by {{tens of thousands of}} volunteers, under the command of General Zachary Taylor defeated Santa Anna's in northern Mexico while other American forces quickly took possession of New Mexico and California. Mexico continued to resist despite a chaotic political situation, and so Polk launched an invasion of the country's heartland. A new American army led by Winfield Scott occupied the port of Veracruz, and pressed inland amid bloody fighting. Santa Anna offered to cede Texas and California north of Monterrey Bay, but negotiations broke down and the fighting resumed. In September 1847, Scott's army captured Mexico City. Santa Anna was forced to flee and a provisional government began the task of negotiating peace. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed on February 2, 1848. It recognized the Rio Grande as the southern boundary of Texas and ceded what is now the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico to the United States, while also paying Mexico $15,000,000 for the territory. In the presidential election of 1848, Zachary Taylor ran as a Whig and won easily when the Democrats split, even though he was an apolitical military <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> voted in his life. Scott became the last Whig candidate for president in 1852, and he lost badly.|$|E
500|$|... "The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Never</b> Lied" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 25 seconds. It is written in the key of D major, in common time, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of A4 to the high note of B5. Lyrically, the song finds the protagonist in a {{relationship}} trouble where he is playing a role of a good person: [...] "I was the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>never</b> lied... but I couldn't break your heart like you did yesterday." [...] According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, in [...] "The <b>Man</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Never</b> Lied", Levine sings [...] "about spoiling his perfect record of honesty to spare a quarreling lover some hurtful feelings."

500|$|Despite Euler's immense {{contribution}} to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of Frederick and ended up having to leave Berlin.
