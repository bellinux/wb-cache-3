However, he did not offer any firm conclusions, and confessed that this was beyond his area of expertise.|$|E

25|$|For {{the greater}} part of a decade, the IHSA was {{concerned}} mostly with establishing school control over interscholastic athletic programs and setting eligibility standards for competition. Ringers were a persistent problem, and among schoolboy sports, football was a special concern. In this period, severe injuries and even deaths were not uncommon, and there was <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> of banning football completely.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria {{remained}} {{sympathetic to}} her fellow Catholics and, in 1632, began {{construction of a}} new Catholic chapel at Somerset House. The old chapel had been deeply unpopular amongst Protestants, and there had been <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> amongst London apprentices of pulling it down as an anti-Catholic gesture. Although modest externally, Henrietta Maria's chapel was much more elaborate inside and was opened in a particularly grand ceremony in 1636. The result was great alarm amongst many in the Protestant community.|$|E

At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots—tournament officials, however, did not allow her to wear the boots during matches.

In America there was a return by the government of George W. Bush to a moderate form of Keynesian policy, with interest rates lowered to ease unemployment and head off recession, along with a form of fiscal intervention with emergency tax cuts to boost spending.|$|E

The latest plan has been to move beyond Liverpool's council boundary to Kirkby, but this has proved controversial with some fans, as well {{as members of the}} local community.

25|$|By late 1992, with <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> of Schneerson as the Messiah, a {{movement}} to formally crown Schneerson as Messiah gained prominence. Rabbi Shmuel Butman announced his plan to crown the Rebbe. The Rebbe, who had been paralyzed and speechless since March the previous year, would join the daily prayers on a special balcony that was built for him to easily be wheeled. Butman planned to crown the Rebbe on January 30, 1993 after the evening prayers. However, when the Rebbe got word of the planned event, he communicated to his secretaries Leibel Groner and Yudel Krinsky that he would only attend for the usual evening service. Both Groner and Krinsky, then followed by Butman, announced that the event was actually not a coronation {{and should not be}} intended as such.|$|E
25|$|Then Prime Minister Francesco Crispi and his Treasury Minister Giovanni Giolitti {{knew of the}} 1889 {{government}} inspection report, but {{feared that}} exposure might undermine public confidence and suppressed the report. In addition, they also wanted to avoid it becoming known that the Banca Romana, like other banks, had extended substantial loans to politicians (including themselves), often without interest. This was a common way for politicians to finance election expenses in return for favours. Over {{the next three years}} there was <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> of the need for a single note-issuing bank and for a reduction in the note circulation. But neither Crispi nor his successors, Antonio Di Rudinì and Luigi Luzzatti, had the courage to cope with the revelations and the political turmoil which any serious effort at banking reform was bound to trigger.|$|E
25|$|With such a {{successful}} season behind him, there was <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> {{as to whether}} the Roar could equal or better that in the 2011–12 season. Their title credentials were in doubt when the club went on a club-record worst losing streak of five matches immediately following the ending of their record 36-match unbeaten streak. Postecoglou remained steadfast in the club's footballing philosophy and the club went on to record just one loss in the last 14 games of the regular season to finish league runners-up. Unable to retain the Premiers Plate, Postecoglou led the club to back-to-back championships in the 2012 A-League Grand Final in front of a club-record 50,344 supporters. Postecoglou also led the Roar's initial foray into the 2012 Asian Champions League as reward for their success in the previous season. Success was mixed, picking up two draws from four matches.|$|E

25|$|The Social Democratic Party of Croatia {{also saw}} some {{controversy}} {{in the process of}} nominating a candidate. Immediately after the 2009 local elections and Milan Bandić's landslide victory in Zagreb as a candidate of the Social Democrats, there was <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> of his potential candidacy for president. Before the election, many influential members of SDP urged Zoran Milanović, the president of the party, to intervene and nominate someone other than Bandić, referring to numerous corruption and malversation allegations made against him during his tenure as the mayor of Zagreb. However, Milanović denied the widespread rumours about internal turmoil and publicly supported Milan Bandić in the mayoral campaign, making him the target of an open letter signed by many prominent left-wing intellectuals, in which they attacked Bandić and endorsed Josip Kregar. Although Milanović dismissed these charges, SDP conspicuously put Bandić {{at the bottom of the}} electoral list for the city council, which prompted further accusations of hypocrisy from their opponents.|$|E

Virgin was more than ready to release [...] "God Save the Queen", but new {{obstacles}} arose. Workers at the pressing plant laid down their tools in protest at the song's content. Jamie Reid's now famous cover, showing Queen Elizabeth II with her features obscured by the song and band names in cutout letters, offended the sleeve's plate makers. After <b>much</b> <b>talk,</b> production resumed and the record was finally released on 27 May.|$|E
500|$|Lettice Knollys was {{the wife}} of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, and first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth on her mother's side. Leicester had flirted {{with her in the}} summer of 1565, causing an {{outbreak}} of jealousy in the Queen. After Lord Essex went to Ireland in 1573, they possibly became lovers. There was <b>much</b> <b>talk,</b> and on Essex' homecoming in December 1575, [...] "great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Essex" [...] was expected. In July 1576 Essex returned to Ireland, where he died of dysentery in September. Rumours of poison, administered by the Earl of Leicester's means, were soon abroad. The Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, conducted an official investigation which did not find any indications of foul play but [...] "a disease appropriate to this country ... whereof ... died many". The rumours continued.|$|E

After hearing Aretha Franklin's {{version of}} [...] "Respect", Whitfield rearranged [...] "Grapevine" [...] {{to include some}} of the funk elements of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. According to David Ritz, Whitfield set to record a song that would [...] "out-funk" [...] Aretha. After Whitfield presented the demo tapes, Gladys Knight, Bubba Knight, William Guest, and Edward Patten worked for several weeks on their vocal arrangement. To make the song suitable for Gladys, {{the first line of}} the second verse ("I know a man ain't supposed to cry/But these tears I can't hold inside") was altered to ("Take a good look at these tears in my eyes/Baby, these tears I can't hold inside"). After <b>much</b> <b>talk,</b> Gordy reluctantly allowed the Pips' version to be a single on September 28, 1967 on Motown's Soul label.|$|E
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

He felt free to participate in organizations and initiatives connected with the war effort, and was particularly committed to programs in support of Greece and Russia. He backed Roosevelt for the 1944 election, partly because he feared a return to isolationism and the prolonging of the wartime erosion of civil liberties. In 1943, the House Un-American Activities Committee or [...] "Dies Committee", for example, had aroused his fears with an investigation into [...] "subversive activities" [...] by government workers. Hand's contemporary at Harvard College, Robert Morss Lovett, {{was one of those}} accused, and Hand spoke out on his behalf. As {{the end of the war}} approached, there was <b>much</b> <b>talk</b> of international peace organizations and courts to prevent future conflict, but Hand was skeptical. He also condemned the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, which he saw as motivated by vengeance; he did not believe that [...] "aggressive war" [...] could be construed as a crime. [...] "The difference between vengeance and justice," [...] he wrote later, [...] "is that justice must apply to all." ...|$|E
