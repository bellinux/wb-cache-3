It focused on (1) <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>of</b> positive language politeness strategies and (2) <b>the</b> <b>used</b> <b>of</b> negative language politeness strategies in dialogoues discourse on television. This research was approached qualitatively <b>using</b> etnoghrapy <b>of</b> communication design. The data concisted of two kinds, {{they were the}} utterances data and field notes. They were recorded from the interactive dialogs on three television stations, i. e. tvOne, MetroTv, and TVRI. The collected {{data were analyzed using}} interactive models Miles and Huberman. Based on the data analysis, some findings were made as follows: In the dialoguous discourse on television, the positive politeness strategies <b>used</b> by <b>the</b> interactants covered (1) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> emphaty and symphaty, (2) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> group identity markers, (3) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> asking for agreement, (4) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> repetition <b>of</b> utterances, (5) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> humor, (6) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> being optimistic, (7) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> offers and promises, (8) involving the hearer and the speaker in the activities, (9) seeking for reasons or giving questions, and (10) extending presents. Related to <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> negative politeness strategies <b>used</b> by <b>the</b> interactants covered (1) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> indirect utterances, (2) asking for apologies, (3) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> impersonal form, (4) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> general rules of interaction, and (5) <b>the</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> respect...|$|R

40|$|The current {{controversy}} as to {{the proper}} role of the placebo control in the evaluation of new treatments for schizophrenia requires an analysis that is sensitive to both ethical and scientific issues. Clinical equipoise, widely regarded as the moral foundation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), requires <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> best available treatment as the control in RCT. Scientific criticisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an active control are examined and none present an insuperable barrier to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an active control. Indeed, scrutiny of the most recent argument for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> placebo controls, 2 ̆ 7 assay sensitivity 2 ̆ 7, suggests that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> placebo may be the cause of the problem pointed to.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationship}} between the motivational components of self-regulated learning, i. e. value of studying, perceived abilities and perceived effort, goal orientation (mastery, performance and work-avoidance) and perceived <b>use</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies. Two path models were proposed, one with the elaboration strategy and the other with monitoring and regulation strategies as outcome variables. The value of studying and perceived ability predicted <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> reading strategies through goal orientation and perceived effort, directly and indirectly. The results showed that the value <b>of</b> studying affected <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration and monitoring and regulation strategies equally, and its impact was stronger than the impact of perceived ability. Perceived ability had a stronger effect on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration strategies than on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> monitoring and regulation. Also, the mediational effect of mastery orientation was stronger for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> elaboration strategies than for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> monitoring and regulation strategies.
