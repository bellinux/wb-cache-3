40|$|We {{develop a}} simple {{theory of the}} {{electromagnetic}} response of a d- wave superconductor {{in the presence of}} potential scatterers of arbitrary s-wave scattering strength and inelastic scattering by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. In the clean London limit, the conductivity of such a system may be expressed in ”Drude ” form, in terms of a frequencyaveraged relaxation time. We compare predictions of the theory with recent data on YBCO and BSSCO crystals and on YBCO films. While fits to penetration depth measurements are promising, the low temperature behavior of the measured microwave conductivity appears to be in disagreement with our results. We discuss implications for d-wave pairing A remarkable series of recent <b>microwave</b> experiments <b>on</b> <b>high</b> quality single crystals of YBCO 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has been taken as evidence for d-wave pairing in the high-Tc oxide superconductors, complementing NMR, 6 photoemission, 7 and SQUID phase coherence data 8 supporting the same conclusion. 9 In particular, there is thus far no alternate explanation for the observation of a term linear in temperature in the YBCO penetration depth,...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} peculiar velocity effects due to {{the motion of the}} solar system relative to the <b>microwave</b> background (CMB) <b>on</b> <b>high</b> resolution CMB experiments. It is well known that on the largest angular scales the combined effects of Doppler shifts and aberration are important; the lowest Legendre multipoles of total intensity receive power from the large CMB monopole in transforming from the CMB frame. On small angular scales aberration dominates and is shown here to lead to significant distortions of the total intensity and polarization multipoles in transforming from the rest frame of the CMB to the frame of the solar system. We provide convenient analytic results for the distortions as series expansions in the relative velocity of the two frames, but at the highest resolutions a numerical quadrature is required. Although many of the high resolution multipoles themselves are severely distorted by the frame transformations, we show that their statistical properties distort by only an insignificant amount. Therefore, cosmological parameter estimation is insensitive to the transformation from the CMB frame (where theoretical predictions are calculated) to the rest frame of the experiment.

The experiments employ a waveguide and a magnetron to study the influence of <b>high</b> power <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> TTL/CMOS IC inverters. The TTL/CMOS IC inverters are composed of a LED circuit for visual discernment. A CMOS IC inverter damaged by a high power microwave is observed with power supply current and delay time. When the power supply current was increased 2. 14 times for normal current at 10 kV/m, the CMOS inverter was broken by latch-up. The CMOS inverter damaged by latch-up returned its original level of functioning, because parasitic impedance inside the chip increased with the elapse of time. Three different types of damage were observed by microscopic analysis: component, onchipwire, and bondwire destruction.

40|$|Microwaves are {{non-ionizing}} {{electromagnetic waves}} with frequencies between 0. 3 and 300 GHz. Both humans and microorganisms {{living on the}} human body are exposed to significant doses of microwave radiation in everyday life. Whether and how microwave radiation could influence the viability and growth of microorganisms {{is the subject of}} this educational paper. Studies on the effects of <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> the growth of microbial cultures were searched for in biomedical journals indexed in MEDLINE from 1966 to 2012. The published studies showed that microwaves produce significant effects on the growth of microbial cultures, which vary from the killing of microorganisms to enhancement of their growth. The nature and extent of the effect depend on the frequency of microwaves and the total energy absorbed by the microorganisms. Low energy, low frequency microwaves enhance the growth of microorganisms, whereas high energy, high frequency microwaves destroy the microorganisms. However, neither the effects of a wide spectrum of frequencies nor the effects of a wide range of absorbed energies have been investigated. Considering the potentially deleterious influence of <b>microwaves</b> <b>on</b> the symbiotic balance between microorganisms and the human host, further research on the effects of the complete frequency and energy spectra of <b>microwave</b> radiation <b>on</b> the growth of microorganisms is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Microwave {{frequency}} electromagnetic {{properties are}} critical for understanding and predicting the heating and ignition behavior of explosives. In this work complex permittivity measurements are reported from 1 to 20 GHz {{for a variety of}} neat and plastic bonded explosives measured by the circular cavity technique. These measurements were then used with analytic techniques to develop and understand a theoretical <b>microwave</b> applicator, dependent <b>on</b> <b>high</b> local electric fields. From these assumptions, a practical cavity was then designed using COMSOL 4. 3 Multiphysics finite element analysis software in order to simulate a low power (100 W), high electric field microwave applicator. Times to 100 °C were predicted for all materials with appropriate thermal properties using both analytic approximations and COMSOL simulations. Using available chemical kinetic parameters, times to ignition were predicted for PBX 9501, PETN, TATB, and HMX. For proposed applicators at 2. 45 and 10 GHz, ignition may occur at less than 10 seconds or less than 1 second exposure, respectively. These predictions show that neat explosive materials can be effectively heated in short time scales through direct microwave heating without a need for absorptive binders or inclusions. The addition of a binder leads to highly localized heating in the absorptive binder at much shorter timescales. Such heating enables fundamental studies of materials, such as the exploration of localized ignition and hot spot formation. Experimentally, the designed cavity at 2. 45 GHz was then used to observe rapid microwave heating of a plastic bonded, sugar mock explosive material (PBS 9501). Heating to the point of vaporization occurred in less than 10 s effective exposure time, subject to pulsed exposure. ...|$|R
