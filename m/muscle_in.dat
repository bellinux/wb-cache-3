5|$|The muscle of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, {{it is entirely}} striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|E

5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of an epidermal layer, a jellylike mesogloea layer and an inner gastrodermis; the septa are infoldings of the body wall and consist of a layer of mesogloea sandwiched between two layers of gastrodermis. In some taxa, sphincter <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the mesogloea close over the oral disc and act to keep the polyp fully retracted. The tentacles contain extensions of the coelenteron and have sheets of longitudinal <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> their walls. The oral disc has radial <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the epidermis, {{but most of the}} <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the column are gastrodermal, and include strong retractor muscles beside the septa. The number and arrangement of the septa, as well as the arrangement of these retractor <b>muscles,</b> are important <b>in</b> anthozoan classification.|$|R

5|$|Possible {{homologous}} {{structures in}} other {{species have been}} identified as the dorsoepitrochlearis muscle, the pectoralis quartus muscle or the panniculus carnosus. The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> monkeys and apes where it has its origin in the tendinous region of the latissimus dorsi and extends down the arm as a superficial muscle.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Tour de France, Ag2r {{had one of}} their better single-day {{finishes}} {{of the season with}} Chérel taking fifth place at Polynormande. Ravard had a string of top-ten placings in the later season, coming third at Paris–Brussels, eighth at the Grand Prix d'Isbergues, and seventh at Paris–Bourges. Ravard was also the rider responsible for the team's lone single-day victory of the season at the Châteauroux Classic, where he raced as the defending champion and took his third career win in the event. Ravard won a large field sprint, a victory which he felt validated his career. He had been considering retirement due to a medical abnormality, as a <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> his left leg is twice the size of the same <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> his right.|$|E

50|$|<b>Muscles</b> differ <b>in</b> {{the number}} of motor units that they contain, and how many muscle fibres are within each unit (innervation ratio). In a general sense, muscles that require {{specificity}} of movement, such as <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> charge of eye movement, have fewer fibres per unit, while those that are meant for less specific tasks, such as the calf <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> charge of jumping, have more.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> {{the human body}} {{are thought to be}} vestigial, either by virtue of being greatly reduced in size {{compared}} to homologous <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> other species, by having become principally tendonous, or by being highly variable in their frequency within or between populations.|$|R
5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other veins in that the smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, longitudinally oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of the <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a <b>muscle.</b> <b>In</b> {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E
50|$|FHP {{commonly}} {{appears as}} a part of the Upper Crossed Syndrome and Thoracic outlet syndrome. Treatment involves stretching <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the front of the torso such as the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor while also strengthening <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the back of the torso such as the rhomboids.|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{glycogen}} deposition in individual cardiothoracic and skeletal <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> response to oral and intraperitoneal glucose administration was examined in 40 h-starved rats. Rates of glycogen synthesis were consistently higher <b>in</b> oxidative <b>muscles</b> than <b>in</b> non-oxidative <b>muscles.</b> Intragastric ethanol administration {{was associated with}} an impaired glycaemic response and the almost total abolition of glycogen deposition <b>in</b> oxidative <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> response to oral or intraperitoneal glucose re-feeding. This effect was dose-dependent and differential, in that ethanol produced no equivalent impairment in glycogen deposition <b>in</b> non-oxidative <b>muscles.</b> Ethanol treatment also selectively promoted glycogenolysis <b>in</b> oxidative <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> the starved state. There was positive correlation (P < 0. 001) between the decrease in glycogen levels in soleus and diaphragm <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> response to increasing ethanol doses and blood glucose and lactate concentrations after intraperitoneal glucose administration, implying that {{the basis for the}} impairment in glycogen synthesis may be diminished glucose availability. The mechanism whereby ethanol may differentially compromise carbohydrate metabolism <b>in</b> oxidative <b>muscles</b> is discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E

5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him an edge in retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, defensive, and neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added <b>muscle</b> <b>in</b> the 2014 offseason.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 8, 1995.

Jackson and the Reds made the playoffs, winning the National League Divisional Series but losing the National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves in four games. Jackson was granted free agency on November 3, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the <b>muscle,</b> <b>in</b> the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
