40|$|Phytochemical and {{proximate}} {{constituents of}} leaf, stem and root of Cleome ciliata Schum. & Thonn. and Cleome viscosa Linn. were determined and compared. Fresh samples were oven-dried at 68 oC for 72 hours and ground to uniform powder using a crucible for the leaf and a Thomas Willey milling <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> the <b>stem</b> and root. Standard analytical laboratory methods were then applied. All values were considered significantly difference at p< 0. 05. A {{wide range of}} chemical compounds including alkaloid, flavonoid, phenol, saponin, tannin and hydrogen cyanide as well as proteins, fats and carbohydrate {{were found in the}} parts of the two species. There was high percentage flavonoid (0. 57 ± 0. 02; 0. 63 ± 0. 01), saponin (0. 52 ± 0. 02; 0. 44 ± 0. 02), tannin (0. 36 ± 0. 00; 0. 35 ± 0. 00), protein (11. 73 ± 0. 18; 11. 84 ± 0. 10) and fat (2. 13 ± 0. 02; 2. 16 ± 0. 02) in the leaf of Cleome ciliata and C. viscosa, respectively. Therefore, Cleome ciliata had high potential for usefulness as food and drug in ethnobotany, as well as synthesis of new drugs and dietary supplements, just as its counterpart, C. viscosa. However, as a result of high value of hydrogen cyanide detected in the parts of these plants, in vitro study of blood hydrogen cyanide level after administration of raw parts is strongly needed. In addition, it is important to examine if processing procedures like cooking or steaming, will reduce the level of hydrogen cyanide from the leaf and stem of these plants before utilization...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{biologists}} often {{claim that}} stem cells can “self-renew”. However, can {{the life of}} stem cells really be renewed? Or, the so-called “self-renewal ” of stem cells is just a self-cheating of cell biologists? “Self-renewal ” has been claimed as a defining feature <b>for</b> <b>stem</b> cells. However, this so-called hallmark feature is not only non-exclusive <b>for</b> <b>stem</b> cells but also untrue <b>for</b> <b>stem</b> cells. The “self-renewing” capability in fact is a common capability for all cells to reproduce them selves.

30|$|Relascope plots {{were most}} {{efficient}} for volume and basal area, {{but not as}} efficient <b>for</b> <b>stems</b> per ha. <b>For</b> <b>stems</b> per ha, fixed-radius plot were optimal. When the weight <b>for</b> <b>stems</b> per ha is increased enough, the fixed-radius plot becomes optimal overall. If we considered an inventory purely <b>for</b> <b>stems</b> per ha or basal area, subsample trees would not be needed at all. In fixed sized plots, measuring the diameters would neither be necessary except for borderline trees. Subsample tree selection strategies would thus be irrelevant for such an inventory. However, if the subsample tree measurement costs were removed, and the measuring cost of each tally tree would be reduced (some time {{would be needed to}} record the species and check the borderline trees), the conclusion would still be the same: relascope plot type is the best for basal area and fixed-radius plot is the best <b>for</b> <b>stems</b> per ha. While in principle there are no advantages in using fixed radius over variable radius (Stage & Rennie 1994), in relascope plots the effective plot size for small trees constituting most of the stems per ha is so small that the relascope plot type is very inefficient <b>for</b> <b>stems</b> per ha. Concentric sample plots were a good compromise between efficiency and accuracy. It also turned out that the optimal plot radius in the tested area was somewhat smaller than the one used in current Finnish NFI, 9 m.|$|R
