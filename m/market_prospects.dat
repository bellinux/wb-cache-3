Slattery believed that developing such an aircraft from scratch would lack sufficient <b>market</b> <b>prospects</b> and instead encouraged the use of as many components and systems from the existing Bristol Britannia transport aircraft as would be reasonably possible, a measure that was seen as logical and practical, acting to reduce development time and cost while improving reliability, with the downside of lesser performance.|$|E

The evolution of the supply and demand sides of the scientific labour market contributed to the low labour <b>market</b> <b>prospects</b> for PhD graduates. But, the explanation related to the flows of PhD graduates in the tradition of the equilibrium perspective is not sufficient. The evolution of the French innovation system in the 1990 s increased the difficulties in the labour market for some PhD graduates (development of intermediate structures at the interface between public and private research sectors…). Our hypothesis is that PhDs who do not have specific characteristics (broader competencies than their only scientific ones) have low labour <b>market</b> <b>prospects.</b> Empirically, we use two surveys of PhD graduates carried out in 1997 and 1999.
