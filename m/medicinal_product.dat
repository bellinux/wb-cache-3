5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a <b>medicinal</b> <b>product.</b> Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition. The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E

In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed by the outpatients’ department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003 – 2010, which are financed from public expenditures. The correlation and regression analyses are used {{in order to establish}} the association between the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and with the classification lists of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The research has confirmed the association of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> It has underlined the importance of the rational prescription and use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The explanatory variables included in the regression model for the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> explained up to 94 % of variability in the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reference}} price system in Slovenia is {{used with the}} aim of managing and reducing public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> We aim to investigate whether the {{reference price}} system has had an effect on real price reductions for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> We present the reference price regulation system for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and empirically estimate the effect of price regulation on the development of real prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and its economic rationale. The main thesis that the nominal and real prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during price regulation is revealed by the Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test, by confirming the existence of statistically significant differences in prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Therefore, we adopt the alternative hypothesis that prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the price regulation system. The reference price regulation system, with an efficient use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and their efficient supply, could have positive effects on management and reduction of public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> price regulation for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> reference price system, Slovenia...|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined more than the prices of original <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010. The price regulation system and reimbursement with an efficient use and supply of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> could have positive effects on the management and reduction of public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In the paper <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> used in hospitals have not been analysed...|$|R

2500|$|Fueled {{in part by}} the 1729 ban on madak, {{which at}} first {{effectively}} exempted pure opium as a potentially <b>medicinal</b> <b>product,</b> the smoking of pure opium became more popular in the 18th century. In 1736, the smoking of pure opium was described by Huang Shujing, involving a pipe made from bamboo rimmed with silver, stuffed with palm slices and hair, fed by a clay bowl in which a globule of molten opium was held over the flame of an oil lamp. This elaborate procedure, requiring the maintenance of pots of opium at just the right temperature for a globule to be scooped up with a needle-like skewer for smoking, formed the basis of a craft of [...] "paste-scooping" [...] by which servant girls could become prostitutes as the opportunity arose.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
