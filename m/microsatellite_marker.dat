40|$|Both {{theoretical}} and applied studies have proven that {{the utility of}} single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in linkage analysis is more powerful and cost-effective than current <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> assays. Here we performed a whole-genome scan on 115 White, non-Hispanic families segregating for alcohol dependence, using one 10. 3 -cM <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> set and two SNP data sets (0. 33 -cM, 0. 78 -cM spacing). Two definitions of alcohol dependence (ALDX 1 and ALDX 2) were used. Our multipoint nonparametric linkage analysis found alcoholism was nominal linked to 12 genomic regions. The linkage peaks obtained by using the <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> set and the two SNP sets had {{a high degree of}} correspondence in general, but the <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> set was insufficient to detect some nominal linkage peaks. The presence of linkage disequilibrium between markers did not significantly affect the results. Across the entire genome, SNP datasets had a much higher average linkage information content (0. 33 cM: 0. 93, 0. 78 cM: 0. 91) than did <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> set (0. 57). The linkage peaks obtained through two SNP datasets were very similar with some minor differences.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the haplotypic relationship between <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of considerable importance, as <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> can potentially be incorporated into haplotypes containing SNPs to increase marker density across a region of interest. However, SNPs and <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> have different mutation rates and durations, and it is conceivable that the linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between the genetic markers may considerably differ. We assessed the LD patterns using 1, 661 SNPs and 65 <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> along chromosome 22 and investigated whether common patterns of LD between the two genetic markers are deduced from the results. The results demonstrated that the patterns of LD among <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> varied considerably and the LD runs of SNPs and <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> showed distinct patterns. <b>Microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> have a much higher mutation rate and the evolution of <b>microsatellite</b> <b>markers</b> is a more complex process which has distinct mutation properties from those of SNPs.

AFLP was applied to both A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate strains, and it clearly differentiated these species. Microsatellite markers were only applied to A. niger aggregate strains because of the species-specific nature of these markers. Both AFLP and <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> analyses were able to divide A. niger aggregate strains into the two recognized internal transcribed spacer (ITS) - 5. 8 S rDNA RFLP types, N and T. Clustering of A. niger aggregate strains was similar in both AFLP and microsatellite analyses, yielding an additional separation of N type strains into two groups. Both <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> and AFLP analyses showed high levels of polymorphism in the A. niger aggregate (index of discriminatory power 0. 991 and 1. 0, respectively). Of the two techniques, <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> analysis was quicker and more straightforward to perform.

In the past few years, great efforts {{have been made to}} develop, map and utilize microsatellite markers in various crops. It is still a major challenge to find a <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> associated with an economically important trait. In the present study we report on the targeted development of a <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> to a barley disease resistance gene. The method includes the following steps: (1) pooling DNA samples from a segregating population based on the principle of bulked-segregant analysis; (2) digesting the pooled DNAs and ligating adaptors; (3) selectively amplifying and identifying polymorphic microsatellites; and (4) developing primers for the microsatellite associated with the targeted trait. Using this method, a <b>microsatellite</b> <b>marker</b> associated with the true loose smut resistance gene (Un 8) in the Harrington × TR 306 doubled-haploid population was identified. This marker showed polymorphism in four breeding populations segregating for true loose smut resistance. In three of these populations, genetic distance between the microsatellite and the true loose smut resistance gene varied from 8. 6 to 10. 3 cM. Polymorphism of the microsatellite was tested among three disease resistant lines and 21 susceptible cultivars.
