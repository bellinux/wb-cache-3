40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} one of {{the newest}} novels of Philip Roth, Everyman. From Everyman, I will discuss about the <b>main</b> <b>character's</b> anxiety about death.

Moreover, I use psychological approach with the theory of psychoanalysis in analyzing this novel: theory of anxiety, theory of defense mechanism and concept of obsession. After analyzing the novel by using those theories, I find that the <b>main</b> <b>character</b> gets anxiety about death because he has negative concept about death and has a negative perspective on aging. Then, I find that there are three effects of this anxiety about death in the <b>main</b> <b>character's</b> life. Those effects are being obsessed by death, regretting over his past life and being an atheist. Also in my findings, I conclude that the <b>main</b> <b>character</b> in Everyman deals with his anxiety about death through repression, sublimation and rationalization...|$|R
