25|$|The Eagles {{were popular}} (particularly in the snowbelt), had towing capacity, {{and came in}} several {{equipment}} levels including sport and luxury trims. Two additional models were added in 1981, the sub-compact SX/4 and Kammback. A manual transmission and a front axle-disconnect feature were also made available for greater fuel economy. During 1981 and 1982 a unique convertible {{was added to the}} line. The Eagle's <b>monocoque</b> <b>body</b> was reinforced for the conversion and had a steel targa bar with a removable fiberglass roof section. The Eagle station wagon remained in production for one model year after Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Chapman's {{next major}} {{innovation}} was popularising monocoque chassis construction within automobile racing, with the revolutionary 1962 Lotus 25 Formula One car. The technique {{resulted in a}} body that was both lighter and stronger, and also provided better driver protection {{in the event of}} a crash. Although a previously little-used concept in the world of motorsport, the first vehicle to feature such a chassis was the road-going 1922 Lancia Lambda. Lotus had been an early adopter of this technology with the 1958 Lotus Elite. The modified <b>monocoque</b> <b>body</b> of the car was made of fibreglass, making it also one of the first production cars made of composite materials.|$|E
2500|$|Nissan {{unveiled}} the Leaf Nismo RC (Racing Competition) demonstration {{car at the}} 2011 New York International Auto Show. This electric car has the same battery pack and motor as the Leaf but is designed and constructed as a racing car with a full carbon fiber <b>monocoque</b> <b>body</b> which makes it about 40% lighter than the production Leaf. Leaf Nismo RC is projected to have a running time of around 20 minutes under racing conditions, and in preliminary testing it accelerated from [...] in 6.85 seconds and has {{a top speed of}} [...] [...] Nissan built eight of these rear-wheel drive cars.|$|E

25|$|Aramid fibers {{are widely}} used for {{reinforcing}} composite materials, often in combination with carbon fiber and glass fiber. The matrix for high performance composites is usually epoxy resin. Typical applications include <b>monocoque</b> <b>bodies</b> for F1 racing cars, helicopter rotor blades, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash rackets, kayaks, cricket bats, and field hockey, ice hockey and lacrosse sticks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Monocoque</b> <b>bodies</b> {{without a}} chassis became general for mass-produced cars and Facel lost their big customers. French niche {{manufacturers}} ended production. Metallon left the partnership in 1953. Facel set about designing and {{making their own}} complete cars using engines made by Chrysler, Volvo and Austin. Their first design named Vega was shown {{to the public in}} 1954.|$|R

5000|$|Popular in Europe and Asia, many mini {{trucks are}} factory redesigns of light automobiles, usually with <b>monocoque</b> <b>bodies.</b> Specialized designs with {{substantial}} frames {{such as the}} Italian Piaggio shown here are based upon Japanese designs (in this case by Daihatsu) and are popular for use in [...] "old town" [...] sections of European cities that often have very narrow alleyways.|$|R
50|$|Coaches, like buses, may {{be fully}} built by {{integrated}} manufacturers, or a separate chassis consisting of only an engine, wheels and basic frame may {{be delivered to}} a coachwork factory for a body to be added. A minority of coaches are built with <b>monocoque</b> <b>bodies</b> without a chassis frame. Integrated manufacturers (most of whom also supply chassis) include Autosan, Scania, Fuso, and Alexander Dennis. Major coachwork providers (some of whom can build their own chassis) include Van Hool, Neoplan, Marcopolo, Irizar, MCI, Prevost, and Designline.|$|R

5000|$|Pressed Steel Company Limited {{made all}} Jaguar's (<b>monocoque)</b> <b>bodies</b> leaving {{provision}} and {{installation of the}} mechanicals to Jaguar. In mid-1965 British Motor Corporation (BMC), the Austin-Morris combine, bought Pressed Steel. Lyons became concerned {{about the future of}} Jaguar, partly because of the threat to ongoing supplies of bodies, and partly because of his age and lack of an heir. He therefore accepted BMC's offer to merge with Jaguar to form British Motor (Holdings) Limited. At a press conference on 11 July 1965 at the Great Eastern Hotel in London, Lyons and BMC chairman George Harriman announced, [...] "Jaguar Group of companies is to merge with The British Motor Corporation Ltd., as the first step towards the setting up of a joint holding company to be called British Motor (Holdings) Limited". In due course BMC changed its name to British Motor Holdings at the end of 1966.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine and}} gearbox are from Maruti 800 car, {{which is an}} 800 cc 3-cylinder engine. This series is a regular in the Indian {{motorsport}} scene ever since its launch in 1988. The chassis is a spaceframe <b>monocoque</b> with FRP <b>body</b> panels.|$|R
5000|$|The Nymph used {{almost all}} of the Imp parts aside from the body, with most of the {{hardware}} bolted directly to its GRP <b>monocoque.</b> This <b>body</b> was moulded in colour and also fire-retardant. At the time of introduction, a construction time of 50-60 hours were claimed. Doors and a hardtop, as well as a [...] "Surrey"-style softtop, were available as options. By 1977, production had ended as Bohanna and Stables had moved on to other projects and given up on manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|While {{most parts}} of the Komodo are made locally in Indonesia such as the frame, body and design, Pindad has {{publicly}} stated that they used imported components such as Hino for machinery parts and Michelin for the tires. Its diesel engines were imported directly from Renault. The Komodo's <b>monocoque</b> steel <b>body</b> was made locally by Krakatau Steel. The Indonesian Army's Research and Development Department or Dislitbang TNI AD has officially certified the Komodo as a road worthy vehicle after Pindad conducted static and dynamic tests.|$|R
