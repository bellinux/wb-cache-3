In North America, it emerged in the constitution of Michigan in 1835 before being brought to national attention by Horace Mann after a visit to Prussia in 1843. Mann, then secretary of the Massachusetts board of education (the first in the United States) has been styled as [...] "the father of the American public school system." [...] He studied <b>many</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> before promoting and introducing universal, free, and secular education based on the Prussian model as the most efficient way known to teach literacy on a large scale. [...] Within six decades every state in the USA had introduced a similar system. King Frederick's system was designed to teach obedience to solidify his control of the country. In the United States it found favor for its efficiency and secular form. [...] American educators such as Ellwood Cubberley emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and as a basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. Cubberley and social engineering theorists promoted the system as a way to industrialize the educational process as well as a tool for social engineering. In Public School Administration (1916), he described [...] "schools as, in a sense, factories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned into products to meet the various demands of life.” [...] Cubberley wrote that a school's role is [...] "to break up these groups or settlements, to assimilate and amalgamate these people as part of our American race, and to implant in their children so far as can be done, the Anglo-Saxon conception of righteousness, law and order and popular government." ...|$|E

Due to these problems, a new generation of hypermedia systems is emerging, from the following premises:. a) An educational system has to supervise and evaluate the student learning, avoiding the loss in the covered subjects by.. b) An educational system has to adapt to the student, at any level: domain organization, interface, strategies, [...] .

40|$|<b>Many</b> <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> {{consider}} using one-to-one {{access to the}} laptop {{as a way to}} improve teaching and learning. A two-year action research project on the use of laptop computers by New Brunswick (Canada) grade 7 and 8 Francophone students aimed to better understand the impact of laptops on learning. Two problem-based learning (PBL) interdisciplinary scenarios (math, science, language arts) were implemented in eight experimental classes to measure and document students’ actual learning process, particularly in terms of their ability to scientifically investigate authentic problems, to reason mathematically, and to communicate. On-site observations, video-recording, journals, samples of students’ work, and interviews were used to collect qualitative data. Based on our findings, we argue that laptops in and of themselves may not automatically lead to better results on standardized tests, but rather create opportunities to enrich learning with more open-ended, constructive, collaborative, reflective, and cognitively complex learning tasks...|$|E
