5000|$|By {{having the}} sound and picture sync this way this would save the expense and time of making an optical print or <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> strip {{on the edge of}} the film. [...] The Sepmag would follow a {{projector}} or a telecine or a hand-cranked or motorized film viewer on a workbench. The sepmag sound follower would stay in sync with the film. In post production work, a dubbed sound track of sound effects, or a second language, could be added to other channels of the sepmag.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{synchronised}} film soundtrack, optical and <b>magnetic.</b> Optical <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> are visual renditions of sound wave forms and provide sound through a light beam and optical sensor within the projector. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> are essentially the same as used in conventional analog tape recording.|$|R
50|$|Although CinemaScope {{was capable}} of {{producing}} a 2.66:1 image, the addition of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks</b> for multi-channel <b>sound</b> reduced this to 2.55:1.|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by Cinerama, {{the movie}} {{industry}} moved quickly to create simpler and cheaper widescreen systems, the first of which, Todd-AO, was developed by Broadway promoter Michael Todd with financial backing from Rodgers and Hammerstein, to use a single 70mm film running at 30 frames per second with 6 <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks,</b> for their screen presentation of [...] "Oklahoma!". Major Hollywood studios immediately rushed {{to create their own}} unique formats, such as Warner Bros. Panavision, Paramount Pictures' VistaVision and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation's CinemaScope, the latter of which used up to four separate <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|All Spirit DataCines use {{continuous}} transport motion, using a capstan and constant film tension. An optional optic audio, pick up {{system can be}} mounted in the capstan. All Spirit DataCines use a xenon lamp for illumination into a diffusion chamber to minimize dust and scratch visibility. With the standard 35mm lens gate: super 35 mm and academy 35 mm are supported. Also 2, 3, 4, perf are supported. VistaVision 8-perf and 6 perf are an option. The unit comes with select-a-speed, this gives the section of a film speeds from 2.00 frames per second to 57.00 fps in SDTV and 2.00 to 31.00 fps in HDTV interlace format. With the optional 16mm lens gate standard 16mm and Super 16 mm are supported. With the 16mm lens gate an optional Super 8 mm film gate can be added. 16mm audio system also support 16mm mag or <b>magnetic</b> strip <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> on the motion picture would {{be picked up by}} a head and could be fed to an audio sound mixing console or to the VTR.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1971 In-flight movies (previously 16 mm) {{were shown}} in Super 8 format until video {{distribution}} became the norm. The films were printed with an optical <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> (amateur films use <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound),</b> and spooled into proprietary cassettes that often held a whole 2-hour movie.|$|R
50|$|Super 8mm {{was also}} {{specified}} with an optical <b>sound</b> <b>track.</b> This occupied {{the same location}} as the <b>magnetic</b> <b>track.</b> Picture to <b>sound</b> separation in this format was 22 frames. Projectors and cameras obviously could not record sound in this system, but optical sound package movies became briefly popular, particularly in Europe (mainly because they were cheaper to produce - though the projectors cost more). Although the optical sound should have been inferior in quality to <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> (running at 3.6 inches per second for 24 frames per second), in practice it was often much better, largely because packaged movie <b>magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> was often poorly recorded.|$|R

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>sound</b> is {{no longer}} used in {{commercial}} cinema, but between 1952 and the early 1990s it provided the highest fidelity sound from film because of its wider frequency range and superior {{signal to noise ratio}} compared to optical sound.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the roles played by <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> type, attention to <b>sound</b> <b>track,</b> {{and meaning of}} <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> in mediating the effects of false autonomic feedback on attractiveness ratings of erotic stimuli. Male subjects were instructed either to ignore or {{to pay attention to}} a pulsed or continuous <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> that was described either as heart-rate feedback or as a neutral auditory stimulus while slides of nude females were shown. Slides associated with a change in either the pulsed <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> or the continuous-tone <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> (increase slides) were subsequently rated as significantly more attractive than those associated with steady sound (stable slides). This effect was contingent on the meaning given to the auditory stimuli, with subjects in the “heart-rate” condition showing a stronger tendency to rate increase slides more positively than stable slides, by comparison with subjects in the “neutral sounds” condition. Within the heart-rate condition, subjects told {{to pay attention to the}} feedback showed greater rating differences between these two types of slide than those told to ignore it. This pattern of findings contrasts with those of an earlier experiment (Parkinson & Manstead, 1981), where differential unpleasantness ratings of slides of skin diseases depended on the attention paid to the <b>sound</b> <b>track</b> but not on its meaning. It is concluded that the effects of false autonomic feedback are contingent upon the kind of emotional stimuli that are presented...|$|R
