25|$|Separate {{insurance}} contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or {{other kinds of}} contracts) were invented in Genoa in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from Genoa in 1347, {{and in the next}} century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks. These new {{insurance contracts}} allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful in <b>marine</b> <b>insurance.</b>|$|E

While Philadelphia already had two fire insurance companies--The Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire (1752) and the Mutual Assurance Company for Insuring Houses from Loss by Fire in and near Philadelphia (1784)--INA was different.
