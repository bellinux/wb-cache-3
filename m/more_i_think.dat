500|$|Overmars enjoyed further {{success in}} the 1994–95 season. Ajax {{retained}} the league and won the UEFA Champions League, beating Milan in the final. He scored against Bayern Munich at the semi-final stage of the latter competition. In later years, Overmars criticised {{the expansion of the}} Champions League to include non league champions: [...] "When I won it with Ajax it was only the teams who finished first who took part. It's not special any <b>more.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the Champions' League is just a starter for {{what they want to do}} in the future, create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal's interest, but was puzzled as to why a move [...] "didn't work out." [...] In the summer of 1995, he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said, [...] "No thanks I want to stay with Ajax for two more seasons." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, writing that [...] "The structure of 'White Rabbit' {{is kind of}} half-formed, {{in a way that}} strikes me as very similar to the structure of 'Tabula Rasa', but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn’t the earlier one." [...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which we probably didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Kyla was {{involved}} in three romantic relationships during her time in the show, {{the first of which}} was with physiotherapist Justin Fuller (Ben Richards). Ayola said of the relationship: [...] "She hasn't got great taste in men! She likes good-looking blokes - that whole 'take me to a cave' thing - but she doesn't check that there is a soft, gentle, sensitive side to him. He's gorgeous to look at, but she hasn't learned that you have to look a bit deeper." [...] Roger Griffiths was cast as Kyla's ex-husband Harvey. Ayola commented on their previous relationship: [...] "I think they split up because Kyla is so volatile. The more we learn about Harvey the <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he might not be the reason for their split". She expanded: [...] "They had a tempestuous relationship and Kyla is very irrational which got too much for Harvey. Harvey brings out the worst in Kyla and she just ends up yelling at him. It's a very difficult and if he knew how to handle her maybe it could work out but he doesn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{was also}} {{pleased with the}} episode, noting that Hermes' and Bender's team-up worked well and that the ending was cathartic. [...] He found the episode to be his {{favorite}} of the new season, giving it a 9/10 and stating, [...] "after an okay start, [...] {{turned out to be}} my favorite episode of this comeback season so far. The <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it, the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and trying new things. The sixth season is moving off from the repetition of its first two episodes and is all the better for it." [...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I think will bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|BBVA {{executive}} chairman, Francisco González, {{explained why}} banks must {{get with the}} technology program: [...] "Some bankers and analysts think that Google, Facebook, Amazon or the like will not fully enter a highly regulated, low-margin business such as banking.

In an emotional press conference on 14 February, he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement. Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career: [...] "It's very hard to leave something that made me so happy. Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost to my body.

2500|$|Suicide Season {{departs from}} Bring Me the Horizon's {{previous}} deathcore sound, the band has been credited as starting {{to adopt a}} more eclectic style and move into a more [...] "straight-up" [...] metalcore sound (elements of deathcore, such as shrieks, are present, however). In an interview with Metal Hammer magazine, Sykes states that this album is [...] "100% different" [...] from Count Your Blessings. He also says: [...] "We experimented a lot <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> more with other styles of music we all enjoy, using different instruments and technology, by bringing a lot of digital stuff to the table.

Luke Kerr from Daytime Confidential recapped the storyline, [...] "At Jabot, Leslie told Neil she couldn’t accept his job offerbecause she was thinking about him as a man. She told him it would be inappropriate for them to end up in a relationship if they were working together. Neil finally convinced her that if they had an overwhelming urge to date, he would fire her. Leslie accepted the job." [...] In December 2012, Redaric Williams was introduced to the series as her brother Tyler Michaelson, Leslie's first family member to appear on the soap opera.

2500|$|David Brading {{was born}} in London, England and educated at St Ignatius' College and Pembroke College, Cambridge where he read History and {{obtained}} a BA (Hons) Double first-class honours in 1960. He was an Exhibitioner and Foundation Scholar at Cambridge University where he attended the lectures of David Knowles, Geoffrey Elton, and Michael Postan. In 1961 he was awarded a Henry Fellowship to Yale University.But it was later that year, whilst in Mexico, that Brading’s fascination with the country began, “I have now found my field of study: sixteenth-century Spain and Latin America”…The <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of it, the more Latin America seems attractive. Sixteenth–century Spain, looking back to the Reconquista and forward to the Counter Reformation and the decadence. The nature of its Catholicism, its mysticism, the history of its expansion, the Jesuits, its art, architecture and poetry. Latin America with its archaeology and anthropology, {{the nature of its}} liberalism and its revolutions.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Within the Government doubts quickly {{began to}} be voiced about the justice of his treatment. [...] Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, Baldwin, wrote letters admitting that their {{decision}} had been wrong. As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote [...] "I feel it only right to say that, if I had had the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did". Writing in November 1937, Lord Hankey stated [...] "the <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about it the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime". In December 1938, the Marquess of Londonderry – the Secretary of State for Air {{at the time of}} the dismissal – wrote privately to Baldwin [...] "... was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant Sir Warren Fisher who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spain under Zapatero {{turned its}} focus to Europe from the United States, {{pursuing}} a middle road {{in dealing with}} tensions between Western powers and Islamic populations. In a May 2007 interview with El País, Daniel Fried, Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, commenting on the overall relationship between Spain and the United States, stated: [...] "We work together very well on some issues. I think the Spanish–American relationship can develop <b>more.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> some Spanish officials are knowledgeable and very skilled professionals and we work with them very well. I {{would like to see}} Spain active in the world, working through NATO, active in Afghanistan. You're doing a lot in the Middle East because Moratinos knows a lot about it.

2500|$|In August 2013, the fan {{campaign}} Voices for Yes {{was launched}} {{to get the}} band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The campaign was headed by two US political operators: John Brabender, senior media strategist for Republican Rick Santorum's 2012 US presidential campaign, and Tad Devine, who worked on Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and Al Gore's 2000 campaign. Also involved were former NBC president Steve Capus and former Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs Sara Taylor. On 16 October 2013, Yes failed to be inducted. In November 2013, Anderson expressed a wish to return to Yes {{in the future for}} a [...] "tour everybody dreams of", and cited Yes's nomination for inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a motive for a possible reunion.

2500|$|Lastly, in {{the late}} 1990s, a new Internet fad began, owing to simplistic {{software}} development kits such as the Japanese RPG Maker series (1988 onwards). Influenced by console RPGs and based mostly on the gameplay and style of the SNES and Sega Genesis games, {{a large group of}} young programmers and aficionados across the world began creating independent console-style computer RPGs and sharing them online. An early successful example was Corpse Party (1996), a survival horror indie game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like the survival horror adventure games Clock Tower (1995 onwards) and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. In an interview with GameDaily in 2007, MTVN's Dave Williams remarked that, [...] "Games like this [...] have been sort of under the radar for something that could be the basis of a business.

2500|$|On 19 January 2011, Architects' fourth album The Here and Now was released. The {{album was}} {{recorded}} across 2010 from May till June at The Omen Room Studios in California and featured guest vocals from Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid and Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan. The album {{was seen as}} going in a more commercial direction {{from the rest of}} the band's work. The album sold 900 copies in the United States in its first week and debuted at number 47 on the US Top Heatseekers album charts and number 57 on the UK Album Charts. Upon its release the album was well received by critics. Drummer Dan Searle when describing the sound on the album in an interview believe it was a massive departure but also a logical progression for the band, saying: [...] "I completely understand that we are “known” for being a technical band but it’s just not what we want to write any <b>more,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if you look at the way we have evolved over the last few records you could see it coming. We started writing technical music when we were 16 and have spent the years since slowly moving away from it, it feels like different people wrote those songs." [...] When looking back at the album in hindsight the band has always seen the period the record was released in as one of difficulty and lack of confidence in themselves.|$|E
