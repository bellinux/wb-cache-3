Also, in late 1941 Popular Mechanics had an article in which a U.S. {{scientist}} speculated about the British early warning system on the English east coast and came close to what it was and how it worked. Watson-Watt was sent to the U.S. in 1941 to advise on air defense after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. Alfred Lee Loomis organized the Radiation Laboratory at Cambridge, Massachusetts which developed the technology in the years 1941–45. Later, in 1943, Page greatly improved radar with the <b>monopulse</b> technique that was used for many years in most radar applications.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{principal}} sensor was an Ericsson PS 37 X-band <b>monopulse</b> radar, {{which used}} a mechanically steered parabolic dish {{housed in a}} radome. This radar performed several functions, including air-to-ground and air-to-air telemetry, search, track, terrain-avoidance and cartography. On the JA 37 fighter-interceptor model, the PS 37 radar {{was replaced by the}} more capable Ericsson PS 46 X-band pulse repetition frequency, which had an all-weather look-down/shoot-down capability reportedly in excess of 50 kilometers and continuous-wave illumination for the Skyflash missiles as well as the ability to track two targets while scanning. According to Ericsson, it had a 50 per cent chance of spotting a low-flying McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II within a single scan and possessed a high level of resistance to interference from ECM.|$|E
25|$|A {{key area}} of {{advancement}} on the Mirage F1 over its predecessors {{was in its}} onboard avionics. The Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV <b>monopulse</b> radar system, developed from the Cyrano II unit installed on the Mirage IIIE, serves as the main sensor; it operates in three different modes: air-target acquisition and tracking, ground mapping, and terrain avoidance. The later Cyrano IV-1 model also provided for a limited look-down capability. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the Cyrano IV radar was capable of detecting aerial targets at double the range of earlier models. The standard production Mirage F1 was furnished with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), radar altimeter, UHF/VHF radio sets, Tactical Air Navigation system (TACAN) and aground data link. Other avionics include an autopilot and yaw damper.|$|E
30|$|A {{wide range}} of pulse shapes have been {{explored}} for UWB communication from rectangular to Gaussian [30]. Gaussian pulses and their derivatives, usually called <b>monopulses,</b> are effective due to the ease of construction and good resolution in both time and frequency. In many cost-effective hardware designs, these shapes are generated without any dedicated circuits. A simple transistor or diode, which is turned ‘on’ and ‘off’ to generate a narrow rectangular pulse, will form an approximate Gaussian shape due to the imperfections in micro-electronic design [31].|$|R

25|$|Early {{versions}} of the Lightning were equipped with the Ferranti-developed AI.23 <b>monopulse</b> radar, which was contained right {{at the front of}} the fuselage within an inlet cone at the centre of the engine intake. Radar information was displayed on an early head-up display and managed by onboard computers. The AI.23, an immediate predecessor of the AI.24 Foxhunter, supported several operational modes, which included autonomous search, automatic target tracking, and ranging for all weapons; the pilot attack sight provided gyroscopically-derived lead angle and backup stadiametric ranging for gun firing. The radar and gunsight were collectively designated the AIRPASS: Airborne Interception Radar and Pilot Attack Sight System. The radar would be successively upgraded with the introduction of more capable Lightning variants, such as to provide guidance for the Red Top missile.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, Dassault {{commenced}} {{development of}} {{what would become the}} Mirage F1 as a private venture, alongside the larger Mirage F2. Work on the F1 eventually took precedence over the more costly F2, which was cancelled during the late 1960s. The French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) took interest in the fledgling fighter to meet its requirement for an all-weather interceptor aircraft. Accordingly, initial production units were equipped with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano IV <b>monopulse</b> radar. During the latter half of 1974, the Mirage F1 entered service in the French Air Force. Shortly thereafter, the type was deployed as the main interceptor of the French Air Force, a capacity which it continued to serve in until the arrival of the Mirage 2000. It later transitioned to an aerial reconnaissance role. During June 2014, the last French Mirage F1s was retired from service.|$|E
25|$|Clutter {{may also}} {{originate}} from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection/refraction (e.g., anomalous propagation). This clutter type is especially bothersome since {{it appears to}} move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it {{on the basis of}} jitter or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward. These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. <b>Monopulse</b> can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{systems are}} used extensively for imaging vast areas using electromagnetic radiation. Radar systems {{have the benefit}} of being able to image areas which optical light cannot pass through, which makes them suitable for surveillance and weather monitoring, or monitoring through difficult atmospheric conditions. This thesis investigates, based on simulation and real data, whether a hand-held radar utilizing gaussian <b>monopulses</b> can function as a synthetic aperture radar device, by employing standard SAR focusing and filtering algorithms. The implementation of SAR algorithms was verified by a simulation and processing program written in the C programming language, and includes a novel algorithm for simulating raw SAR data. The novel algorithm was verified by inspecting the pulse-compressed and Global Backprojection (GBP) -focused image and its two-dimensional spectrum, and compared and contrasted to images generated in standard fashion. Handheld radar measurements of corner reflectors and a large reflecting sphere processed by GBP indicated that additional pre-processing is needed for focusing to work. Pre-processing the radar data by employing a rolling calculation of background noise and its subtraction yielded filtered raw data of sufficient quality to enable azimuth focusing with GBP. In conclusion this thesis has shown the new radar imaging algorithm to work in conjunction with standard SAR processing steps if its projecting nature can be tolerated. In addition GBP {{has been found to be}} a viable algorithm for accomplishing azimuth focusing of background-filtered radar data from a handheld pulsed radar system, and that the radar system in question may be used to perform SAR imaging...|$|R
30|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{technology has}} been used since the 1960 's {{for the purposes of}} imaging landscapes and seascapes—both for the civilian and military purposes [1]. In the latter scenarios, the enemy may frequently use specific electronic countermeasures (ECM) [2] to introduce false imagery into the radar-collected data to prevent accurate battle scene assessment. Such methods of ECM are classified as deceptive [3]. Deceptive ECM techniques—or deception jammers—operate by sensing incoming radar signals and reproducing them to the best of jammer's capabilities, then resending resultant pulses in a particular fashion, so as to hinder correct imaging of enemy targets. False Target Generation (FTG) is one such commonly used form of deception jamming. The replicated and delayed SAR waveform is transmitted at the next expected arrival of the radar signal and is seen as an actual target after image reconstruction. This type of FTG can be accomplished using a digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) repeat jammer [4]. Another possible approach to FTG is to generate the replica waveforms by determining the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the incoming radar signal [5]. The effectiveness of ECM can be degraded using electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) techniques [2, 4, 6, 7]. One of the most robust ECCM methods against deception jamming is pulse diversity of radar signals, for example, multi-tone phase modulation and slowly varying chirp rate of linear frequency modulated (LFM) chirps are explored in [4]. Another method involves coding signals in such a fashion that a transmitted waveform at an arbitrary pulse repetition interval (PRI) will produce a low value of peak cross-correlation with the waveform at the previous PRI, thus severely limiting the effectiveness of deception jamming during the correlation process—one example of such an approach is random noise radar [5, 8 – 11]. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can also be employed in this fashion; it is currently being implemented in multiple commercial communications systems [12 – 14], however its applications to radar have been somewhat limited to this day [15 – 20]. Advances in sampling technology have made ultra-wideband (UWB) wave shaping a possibility for OFDM systems [21]. In our paper we contrast multifrequency UWB SAR signals based on OFDM with several common types of wideband SAR waveforms with certain similarities to OFDM. LFM chirps [22, 23], while easily implemented and widely used for SAR processing due to the relatively simple and efficient range-Doppler algorithm, experience high susceptibility to jamming because of the linear nature of the IF. Frequency-hopping (FH) signals [24, 25], similarly to OFDM, change spectral composition at each PRI, thus limiting the effectiveness of DRFM jammers. However, because their IF is constant, if the hopping interval is known, this type of signal may also be affected by IF jamming. On the other hand, ultra-short Gaussian <b>monopulses</b> [26], while allowing for submeter resolution and exhibiting good multipath performance, are usually processed using a different technique, backprojection, which is computationally expensive and varies significantly from range-Doppler processing employed in our simulations, thus these UWB SAR signals are not considered in the paper.|$|R
40|$|Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) {{is seen as}} one {{of several}} {{promising}} technologies aimed to help mine detection. GPR is sensitive to any inhomogeneity in the ground. Therefore any APM regardless of the metal content can be detected. On the other hand, all the inhomogeneities, which do not represent mines, show up as a clutter in GPR images. Moreover, {{it is known that}} reflectivity of APM is often weaker than that of stones, pieces of shrapnel and barbed wire, etc. Altogether these factors cause GPR to produce unacceptably high false alarm rate whilst it reaches the 99. 6 % detection rate which is prescribed by an UN resolution as a standard for humanitarian demining. The main goal of the work presented in the thesis is reduction of the false alarm rate while keeping the 99. 6 % detection rate intact. To reach this goal a set of data processing algorithms is developed and organized into an unsupervised target detection scheme. These algorithms are dedicated to clutter suppression and simultaneous detection of APM signatures in both GPR raw data and images resulting from them. The developed algorithms constitute together the following achievements: - An unsupervised generalized likelihood ratio test-based feature fusion framework; - A waveform based target detection/clutter suppression; - Advanced methods for construction of GPR maps The unsupervised generalized likelihood ratio test based feature fusion framework, which has been suggested in this thesis, takes as input an arbitrary amount of confidence maps corresponding to training and testing sites. The output of the framework is a list of target locations. The framework uses training data which can come from independent and non-coincident measurements with different radars and even sensors. The data from each of the sensors are processed independently to result in several detection lists. Every detection in these lists is accompanied with one or several features each represented by a scalar number. A decision level fusion is applied to reconcile the lists i. e. to associate the detections in them with the appropriate physical locations. Then the binary hypothesis testing is executed for the reconciled locations separating them on clutter and target lists. The generalized likelihood ratio test is employed to this end. The feature pre-normalization via Johnson's transform in suggested by the author to be used prior the testing. It is shown in the thesis that such approach outperforms the direct generalized likelihood ratio testing ad. hoc. based fusion techniques. The waveform based target detection/clutter suppression algorithm, which detects disc-shaped APM in heavy clutter with low false alarm rate, has been developed by the author. The algorithm detects a class of low-metal APM with a cylindrical shape (such as PMN 2, M 14, and NR 22 etc.) using just a single reference target return. It suppresses clutter responses from friendly objects while marking the presence of targets with sharp <b>monopulses</b> and preserving the spatial pattern inherent to localized objects. The algorithm is insensitive to the reflectivity and physical diameter of the target and also tolerates certain volatility in the properties of the hosting soil. This algorithm is superimposed with a focusing technique to further improve the mine detectability. A number of improved projection techniques, which allow better detection of APM in focused GPR images is also developed by the author. These utilize the prior knowledge on the character of the spatial correlation properties of target images and allow detection of the burial depth of the target. The algorithms suggested in the thesis were tested on the data acquired during two separate measurement campaigns held at the special facilities for testing of mine detection systems. It has been shown, that the fused multi-feature detection that uses the algorithms reported in this thesis, significantly decreases the false alarm rate in comparison to the previously published studies for the same minefields.

25|$|New to the Hercules {{system was}} the Target Ranging Radar, or TRR. It is {{relatively}} easy to jam range information on <b>monopulse</b> radars like the TTR by sending out false return signals. The radar can continue to locate the target in elevation or azimuth because all of the signals come from the same location, but the receiver cannot easily determine which pulse was sent by the radar and which was sent by the electronic countermeasures (ECM) on the target aircraft. The TRR system combatted this by operating on two selectable very different set of frequencies. The result was fine for ranging but useless for position determination. This signal {{would be very difficult to}} jam because the jammer would have to broadcast across a wide set of frequencies in order to ensure they were returning on the frequency the receiver had actually selected. Meanwhile, the TTR can continue offering location information, and in the case that is also jammed (difficult but possible), was upgraded to offer a home-on-jam mode that used the ECM system's own broadcasts as a location source. Skilled operators could also try to track the target in a manual tracking mode.|$|E
