25|$|Spatial ability may be {{responsible}} in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude. In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> ability in groups of 10-20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban {{high school in the}} Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> scores. <b>Mental</b> <b>rotation</b> was assessed using the Vandenberg Test of <b>Mental</b> <b>Rotation.</b> Students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure.|$|E
25|$|The {{study found}} that when <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> {{is used as a}} {{predictor}} of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from -0.03 to 0.54. However, an interesting finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> ability. Interestingly enough, for the verbal aptitude test on SAT, {{there was a significant difference}} in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.|$|E
25|$|Performance in <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> {{and similar}} spatial tasks is {{affected}} by gender expectations. For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite. Experiences such as playing video games also increase a person's <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> ability. A study from the University of Toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after playing video games requiring complex <b>mental</b> <b>rotation.</b> The experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males. However, male participants still performed superior to female participants {{both before and after}} training.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mental</b> <b>Rotations</b> Test {{is a test}} {{of spatial}} ability by Steven G. Vandenberg and Allan R. Kuse, first {{published}} in 1978. It {{has been used in}} hundreds of studies since then.|$|R
40|$|Transmission of six spatial tests, Card Rotations, Cube Comparisons, Group Embedded Figures, Hidden Patterns, <b>Mental</b> <b>Rotations,</b> and {{portable}} Rod and Frame, is examined among 73 members in {{four generations of}} an extended kindred. Nonadditive genetic variance is substantial {{for one of the}} six tests, Card Rotations. Whether this nonadditive genetic variance is due to a major autosomal gene is equivocal based on results from segregation and linkage analysis. There is no evidence for genetic variance for <b>Mental</b> <b>Rotations</b> or Hidden Patterns, in contrast to previous findings suggesting major gene involvement (Ashton et al., 1979). If spatial ability is due, in part, to an autosomal major gene, the gene has variable expression (reflected in different tests) or genetic heterogeneity is pronounced...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{shipping}} {{at higher}} speeds {{will be the}} result of growing industrialization and increasing world trade. In spite of all the electronic navigation devices on a modern ship’s bridge, bridge crews sometimes lose their orientation. Reasons for this might be excessive cognitive workload caused by fatigue, short decision times due to high speed, or too many instruments to read and integrate. An information design research project focusing on cognitive off-loading has allowed us to evaluate different ways of displaying navigational information. Traditionally, electronic charts and radars onboard are displayed in a north-up orientation. On south-bound courses, this requires <b>mental</b> <b>rotations</b> to align the chart or radar image with the real world. Research shows that <b>mental</b> <b>rotations</b> take time and are a possible source of error. This article presents an alternative way of displaying maps in driving situations to reduce errors...|$|R
25|$|Metastudies show a male {{advantage}} in <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> and assessing horizontality and verticality {{and a female}} {{advantage in}} spatial memory. A proposed hypothesis is {{that men and women}} evolved different mental abilities to adapt to their different roles in society. This explanation suggests that men may have evolved greater spatial abilities as a result of certain behaviors, such as navigating during a hunt. Similarly, this hypothesis suggests that women may have evolved to devote more mental resources to remembering locations of food sources in relation to objects and other features in order to gather food.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} showing benefits from action games {{has been questioned}} due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups. In addition, many of the studies are cross-sectional, and of the longitudinal interventional trials, not all have found effects. A response to this {{pointed out that the}} skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as <b>mental</b> <b>rotation,</b> which is not a common task in action games. Action gamers are not only better at ignoring distractions, but also at focusing on the main task.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} done to compare the {{relationship}} between <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> ability and gender difference, specifically in the SAT math section. Cognitive gender differences are apparent and findings of a male advantage in certain mathematical domains have been demonstrated cross-culturally. These gender differences found are largely in geometry and word problems and tend to be in countries with the highest-achieving students and with the largest gender gap in experience. Smaller differences were noted in countries with lower achieving students in mathematics which includes the United States. Moore and Smith say that within the United States, poorly educated female students outperform their male peers, but {{as the level of}} education increases, the male advantage in mathematics emerges.|$|E
40|$|Evidence that ovarian steroid hormones such as {{estrogen}} and progesterone affect cognition comes {{from studies of}} memory in older women receiving estrogen replacement therapy and studies of sexually dimorphic skills in young women across the menstrual cycle. Sixteen women (ages 18 – 28) completed tests of memory (implicit category exemplar generation, category-cued recall, implicit fragmented object identification) and sexually dimorphic skills (fine motor coordination, verbal fluency, <b>mental</b> <b>rotations)</b> at the early follicular (low {{estrogen and}} progesterone) and midluteal (high estrogen and progesterone) phases of the menstrual cycle. Performance on category exemplar generation, a test of conceptual implicit memory, was better at the midluteal than the follicular phase. In contrast, performance on a test of explicit memory, category-cued recall, did not vary across the menstrual cycle. At Session 1, women in the follicular phase performed better on the fragmented object identification task than did those in the midluteal phase. This unexpected finding suggests that high levels of ovarian hormones might inhibit perceptual object priming. Results confirmed previous reports of decreased <b>mental</b> <b>rotations</b> and improved motor skills and fluency in the midluteal phase. Estradiol levels correlated positively with verbal fluency and negatively with <b>mental</b> <b>rotations</b> and perceptual priming, which suggest that estrogen, and not progesterone, {{was responsible for the}} observed changes in cognition. Mood did not vary across the cycle phases. Overall, the findings suggest that estrogen may facilitate the automatic activation of verbal representation...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between administered estrogen and performance on verbal memory and other cognitive tasks was examined. Male-to-female transsexuals undergoing estrogen treatment for sex reassignment (n = 29) {{scored higher on}} Paired Associate Learning (PAL) compared to a similar transsexual control group, awaiting estrogen treatment (n = 30) (P < 0. 05). No differences between groups receiving and not receiving estrogen were detected on a control memory task (Digit Span) or on other cognitive tasks including <b>Mental</b> <b>Rotations</b> and Controlled Associations. There were no group differences in age. Group differences in mood or in general intellectual ability also did not explain the findings. Results suggest a specific influence of estrogen in men on verbal memory tasks, similar to that seen in prior studies of women. They are {{discussed in terms of}} differential processing demands of the two memory tasks and possible differences between estrogenic influences on <b>Mental</b> <b>Rotations</b> and Controlled Associations in men versus women...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to answer the question, “What is a plausible explanation (model) of the cognitive structure and processes that facilitate mental molecular rotation?”. This work used phenomenographic methodology and techniques of interview and think-aloud protocol. Constructivism was the theoretical framework. At the outset of the research, I designed nine tasks to obtain participant articulations of conceptualizations of <b>mental</b> molecular <b>rotations.</b> Articulations from five second-year organic chemistry students attending a Midwestern research university became the research data. Analysis produced four emerging themes along two axes: visualization representation and modeling cognition. These two axes formed a mental space, which was modeled by structure and processes that facilitated <b>mental</b> molecular <b>rotation.</b> A theoretical cognitive model of <b>mental</b> molecular <b>rotation</b> was {{based on the work of}} two researchers: Robbie Case and Richard Lesh. Lesh 2 ̆ 7 s “mental model” is composed of cognitive elements and operations, which are distributed over heeded local and global cognitive sub-models whereas Case deals with unheeded central conceptual structures. The models and structures interact to produce new knowledge and facilitate the use of existing knowledge. Two predictions of the theory of <b>mental</b> molecular <b>rotation</b> were elaborated. Students without a set of operations in a central conceptual structure will not be able to mentally rotate molecules. This is true even if a set of components, other than “operation”, is constructed. The artifacts of <b>mental</b> molecular <b>rotation</b> can be used to determine the state of construction of the central conceptual structure responsible for <b>mental</b> molecular <b>rotation.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Morton Ann Gernsbacher, a {{professor}} of psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a chest of drawers to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that neuroimaging experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> and facial expressions to grocery shopping and tickling—must strive to avoid such cultural bias and stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Although most of {{the tests}} showed no difference, there were some that did. For example, they found female {{subjects}} performed better on verbal abilities while males performed better on visuospatial abilities. For verbal fluency, females have been specifically found to perform slightly better in vocabulary and reading comprehension but significantly higher in speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and <b>mental</b> <b>rotation.</b> Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and visuospatial domains of g, because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on visuospatial tasks, thus evening out the sex differences on IQ tests.|$|E
25|$|Although {{investigations}} of higher cognitive processes, such as navigation and <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> are limited, the astronauts frequently {{report that the}} spacecraft interiors look longer and higher than they actually are, {{and a reduction in}} the perceived height of three-dimensional objects is observed in-flight compared with pre-flight, suggesting an alteration in the mental representation of three-dimensional cues in weightlessness. Perception is a model of the brain, a hypothesis about the world that presupposes the Newton's laws of motion. These laws change in weightlessness and, therefore, one could expect changes in the mental representation of objects’ shape and distance during spaceflight. The rare investigations carried out in space so far have not demonstrated drastic changes, probably because the CNS continues to use an internal model of gravity, at least for a short while. It can be speculated that the way of processing three dimensions will be more developed after a long absence of a gravitational reference.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMental {{rotation}} is {{the capacity}} to predict the orientation of an object or the layout of a scene after a change in viewpoint. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the cogni-tive cost of <b>mental</b> <b>rotations</b> is reduced when the viewpoint change results from the observer's motion rather than the object or spatial layout's rotation. The classical interpretation for these findings involves the use of automatic updating mechanisms triggered during self-motion. Nevertheless, little is known about how this process is triggered and particularly how sensory cues combine in order to facilitate <b>mental</b> <b>rotations.</b> The previously existing setups, either real or virtual, did not allow disentangling the different sensory contributions, which motivated the development of a new high-end virtual reality platform overcoming these technical limitations. In the present paper we will start by a didactic review of the literature on <b>mental</b> <b>rotations</b> and expose the current technical limitations. Then we will fully describe the experimental platform that was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen. The setup consisted of a cabin mounted on the top of a six degree-of-freedom Stewart platform inside of which was an adjustable seat, a physical table with a screen embedded, and a large projection screen. A 5 -PC cluster running Virtools was used to drive the platform and render the two passive stereovision scenes that were displayed on the table and background screens. Finally, we will present the experiment using this setup that allowed repli-cating the classical advantage found for a moving observer, which validates our setup. We will conclude by discussing the experimental validation and the advantages of such a setup...|$|R

2500|$|Many studies {{investigating}} the spatial abilities {{of men and}} women have found no significant differences, though metastudies show a male advantage in <b>mental</b> <b>rotation</b> and assessing horizontality and verticality, and a female advantage in spatial memory. The sexual division of labor has been proposed as an explanation for these cognitive differences. Those differences disappear with a short training [...] or when given a favorable image of woman ability. Furthermore, the individual differences are greater than the average differences, which isn't therefore a valid prediction of a man or woman cognitive ability. This hypothesis argues that males needed the ability to follow prey over long distances and to accurately target their game with projectile technology, and, as a result, male specialization in hunting prowess would have spurred the selection for increased spatial and navigational ability. Similarly, the ability to remember the locations of underground storage organs and other vegetation would have led to an increase in overall efficiency and decrease in total energy expenditure since the time spent searching for food would decrease. Natural selection based on behaviors that increase hunting success and energetic efficiency would bear a positive influence on reproductive success. However, recent research suggests that the sexual division of labor developed relatively recently and that gender roles were not always the same in early-human cultures, contradicting the theory that each sex is naturally predisposed to different types of work.|$|E
