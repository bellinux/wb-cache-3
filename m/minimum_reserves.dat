50|$|The reserve {{requirement}} sets the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> each bank must hold to demand deposits and banknotes. This type of regulation {{has lost the}} role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum reserve ratio. The purpose of minimum reserve ratios is liquidity rather than safety. An example of {{a country with a}} contemporary minimum reserve ratio is Hong Kong, where banks are required to maintain 25% of their liabilities that are due on demand or within 1 month as qualifying liquefiable assets.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully collateralised, i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|E
50|$|When {{money is}} {{deposited}} in a bank, it {{can then be}} lent out to another person. If the initial deposit was $100 and the bank lends out $100 to another customer the money supply has increased by $100. However, because the depositor can ask for the money back, banks have to maintain <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> to service customer needs. If the reserve requirement is 10% then, in the earlier example, the bank can lend $90 and thus the money supply increases by only $90. The reserve requirement therefore acts as a limit on this multiplier effect. Because the reserve requirement only applies to the more narrow forms of money creation (corresponding to M1), but {{does not apply to}} certain types of deposits (such as time deposits), reserve requirements play a limited role in monetary policy.|$|E

30|$|IEEE 802.16 MAC {{protocol}} is connection-oriented; each {{connection is}} assigned a connection ID (CID) {{and a single}} scheduling service determined {{by a set of}} QoS parameters. Four scheduling services in the 802.16 standard are supported: unsolicited grant service (UGS), real-time polling service (rtPS), nonreal-time polling service (nrtPS), and best effort (BE). The UGS supports real-time constant bitrate data streams, such as voice over IP (VoIP) without silence suppression. The QoS parameters of UGS service are <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, the tolerated jitter, maximum latency, and request/transmission policy. The rtPS supports real-time variable-rate data streams, such as MPEG video or VoIP with silence suppression. The QoS parameters of rtPS are maximum latency, request/transmission policy, <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, and traffic priority. The nrtPS supports delay-tolerant variable-rate data streams, such as FTP. The QoS parameters of nrtPS are <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, request/transmission policy, and traffic priority. The BE supports best-effort data streams. The QoS parameter is request/transmission policy. In IEEE 802.16 e [2], an additional service class called extended real-time polling service (ertPS) has superior efficiency than both UGS and rtPS. It supports real-time variable-rate data streams, such as VoIP with silence suppression. The QoS parameters of ertPS are <b>minimum</b> <b>reserved</b> traffic rate, maximum latency, request/transmission policy, and the tolerated jitter. Hence, considering the QoS requirements of the four class services, we calculate the reference goal as traffic specification (TSPEC) according to these QoS parameters.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the current}} operational framework chosen to implement singlemonetary {{policy in the}} euro area, pointing out the effects of certain technical choices {{in the field of}} monetary policy instruments on the interbank market and bank treasuries. In particular, I examine how the tender typology adopted for main refinancing operations affects overbidding and underbidding, as well as efficiency in bank liquidity management. I then go on to analyse the technical features of unsecured interbank markets in the euro area in order to determine whether a screen-based framework leads to more efficient liquidity management than achieved in over-the-counter markets. In accordance with the averaging provision mechanism, <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> during the maintenance period in Italy, where the interbankmarket is electronic-based, are taken as indicators of efficiency in this market. On the evidence of the data, it seems that Italian banks can reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves,</b> also performing intertemporal arbitrages between theinterbank market and their reserve accounts. Finally, the focus comes on cross border differences in the use of collateral within the euro area in order to analyse the projects currently debated for the reform of collateral lists...|$|E

40|$|On {{the base}} of {{significant}} fluctuations of the international financial markets, the international investment position of Romania has an increasing importance in assuring the financial stability. The Romanian National Bank reserves are increasing {{as a result of}} exchanging the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> into foreign currencies made by banks and of the privatization revenues. The international reserve has been negatively influenced by the payments made in the foreign debt service account and by the foreign payment forms redeemed by the Public Finance Ministry. This paper offers to analyze the evolution and impact of the foreign investments in any form whatsoever, on the Romanian economy with the help of autoregressive econometrical models. These models shall refer to all foreign investments elements: direct investments of non-residents, portfolio investment and other categories of foreign investments as well as bank deposits or external short-term, medium and long-term credits. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} in detail a new method {{which can be}} applied by any insurance company to its own data to set reserves for outstanding losses (including IBNR) and to calculate a confidence interval for these reserves.

Although the method can be applied to any sort of business it is particularly helpful in looking at long tail business, such as that written by reinsurers, for which other methods have proved less satisfactory. The methodology can also be applied by a supervisory authority to establish minimum reserving standards for companies where global general market data on run-offs for different classes of business is available. A new method of setting <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> for individual syndicates based on the methodology in the paper is currently being tested by Lloyd’s of London.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{monetary}} policy on the optimal bank behavior under oligopolistic conditions. In addition, we attempt to extend this analysis {{in the sphere of}} bank-clients behavior. We concentrate on the way the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements of commercial banks influence the optimal bank behavior in oligopoly. In particular, we are interested in the influence of this instrument of monetary policy on the interest rate spread. For this reason, we formulate a two-stage Cournot game with scope economies. We conclude that the sign of each change depends on the type of scope economies. Finally, treating an overlapping generation model as a guiding principle, we show that the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements of commercial banks {{have an impact on the}} depositors’ and borrowers’ two periods’ optimal level of consumption. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{matter of}} balance {{adjustment}} generates many interesting reflections. For a long time, the equilibrium {{of the balance}} of payments {{was the focus of}} theoretical debates referring to international economy. At the beginning, it was reduced to the equilibrium of the balance of current transactions. However, the focus still remains on bringing the balance to the state of equilibrium, both in the case of current transactions {{and in the case of}} non-monetary operations. The paper presents the main monetary factors that influence the elements of the balance of payments and the direction and path of such influence. Thus, the results can conclude the impact of the NBR monetary policy over the current account and the capital account of the balance of payments. In the first decade of the transition the monetary policy of the NBR was based especially on some very restrictive monetary tools, such as maintaining for a long time a high discount rate and a high rate of the <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves</b> in lei. Their high level, as compared to that of the other economies in transition, has caused the maintaining o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} I {{analyzed}} Romania's banking system {{evolution in the}} period 2000 – 2012, through a research both theoretical and empirical. The database is collected from monthly Reports of National Bank of Romania and is classified into categories as follows: key prudential indicators, banking risk information, loans and commitments granted by banks, loan portfolio classification and key ratio for <b>minimum</b> <b>reserves.</b> Afterwards, those indicators are framed through CAMELS approach. The research period was divided into pre-crisis period - before 2007 and post-crisis period - after 2007 {{and up to the}} present. The 2007 year was used as a crossroad point because starting with this year it was visible the downturn of the economic and financial evolution in Romania's system and also at global level. The research objectives are to observe the evolution of the banking system in Romania in the prior crisis period as well as after the crisis set in and to identify possible correlations and contagion effects of the selected indicators. Concluding, there are cross sectional influences between selected banking indicators which might gave us a warning signal regarding the evolution of the banking system...|$|E
