40|$|A {{comparative}} {{research has been}} developed for acidity and stability constants of M(Glu) 1, M(Asp) 2 and M(Ttr) 3 complexes, which have been determined by potentiometric pH titration. Depending on metal ion-binding properties, vital differences in building complex were observed. The present study indicates that in M(Ttr) com-plexes, metal ions are arranged to the carboxyl groups, but in M(Glu) and M(Asp), some metal ions are able to build chelate over amine groups. The results mentioned-above demonstrate that for some M(Glu) and M(Asp) complexes, the stability constants are also largely determined by the affinity of metal ions for amine group. This leads {{to a kind of}} selectivity of metal ions, and transfers them through building complexes accompanied with glutamate and aspartate. For heavy metal ions, this building complex helps the absorption and filtration of the blood plasma, and consequently, the excursion of heavy metal ions takes place.

The aim ofthe present study is to supply evidence about neurochemical effects of acute lamotriginetreatment on GABA and L-glutamic acid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of Wistar Albino ratsand the involvement of cholinergic system. The day after the placement of concentric <b>micro-dialysis</b> probes into the lateral ventricles of rats, microdialysis experiments were performedin conscious rat model. The rats either received intraperitoneal injections of physiologicalsaline or 20 mg/kg lamotrigine. For assessing the cholinergic involvement 0. 5 mg/kg phys-ostigmine or 2 mg/kg atropine sulfate pre-treatments were given prior to lamotrigine injec-tion. GABA, L-glutamic acid and lamotrigine concentrations in the dialysates were analyzedusing High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Saline produced no change in GABA orL-glutamic acid levels, but lamotrigine treatment significantly elevated GABA concentrations(p< 0. 05). Pre-treatment with physostigmine or atropine sulfate did not affect either GABA or L-glutamic acid levels siginificantly. Physostigmine or atropine sulfate pre-treatments {{did not affect the}} lamotrigine-induced GABA levels. The results may imply that lamotrigine-induced GABA plays a role in the pharmacological effects of lamotrigine where a linear relationship exists between lamotrigine and GABA.

40|$|Although {{microdialysis}} {{is commonly}} {{understood as a}} method of sampling low molecular weight compounds in the extracellular compartment of tissues, this definition appears insufficient to specifically describe brain microdialysis of neurotransmitters. In fact, transmitter overflow from the brain into dialysates is critically dependent upon the composition of the perfusing Ringer. Therefore, the dialysing Ringer not only recovers the transmitter from the extracellular brain fluid but is a main determinant of its in-vivo release. Two types of brain microdialysis are distinguished: quantitative <b>micro-dialysis</b> and conventional microdialysis. Quantitative microdialysis provides an estimate of neurotransmitter concentrations in the extracellular fluid in contact with the probe. However, this information might poorly reflect the kinetics of neurotransmitter release in vivo. Conventional microdialysis involves perfusion at a constant rate with a transmitter-free Ringer, resulting in the formation of a steep neurotransmitter concentration gradient extending from the Ringer into the extracellular fluid. This artificial gradient might be critical for the ability of conventional microdialysis to detect and resolve phasic changes in neurotransmitter release taking place in the implanted area. On the basis of these characteristics, conventional microdialysis of neurotransmitters can be conceptualized as a model of the in-vivo release of neurotransmitters in the brain. As such, the criteria of face-validity, construct-validity and predictive-validity should be applied to select the most appropriate experimental conditions for estimating neurotransmitter release in specific brain areas in relation to behaviou...|$|E
40|$|Quantification {{of target}} site {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) {{is crucial for}} drug discovery and development. Clinical <b>micro-dialysis</b> (MD) has increasingly been employed for the description of drug distribution and receptor phase PK of the unbound fraction of various analytes. Costs for MD experiments are comparably low and given suitable analytics, target tissue PK of virtually any drug molecule can be quantified. The major limitation of MD {{stems from the fact}} that organs such as brain, lung or liver are not readily accessible without surgery. Recently, non-invasive imaging techniques, i. e. positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), have become available for in vivo drug distribution assessment and allow for drug concentration measurements in practically every human organ. Spatial resolution of MRS imaging, however, is low and although PET enables monitoring of regional drug concentration differences with a spatial resolution of a few millimetres, discrimination between bound and unbound drug or parent compound and metabolite is difficult. Radiotracer development is furthermore time and labour intensive and requires special expertise and radiation exposure and costs originating from running a PET facility cannot be neglected. The recent complementary use of MD and imaging has permitted to exploit individual strengths of these diverse techniques. In conclusion, MD and imaging techniques have provided drug distribution data that have so far not been available. Used alone or in combination, these methods may potentially play an important role in future drug research and development with the potential to serve as translational tools for clinical decision making...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Studies {{investigating}} the target site concentration of antibiotics, such as b-lactams and fluoroquinolones, have demonstrated {{differences between the}} drug concentrations in healthy volun-teers and septic patients. The aims {{of this study were}} (i) to evaluate the muscle tissue concentration of metronidazole in patients with septic shock and (ii) to test the efficacy of metronidazole in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model at different single doses. Materials and methods: Six patients admitted to the ICU of Tartu University Clinics with a diagnosis of septic shock were studied. Patients receiving metronidazole treatment within 48 h before the study or with a BMI> 35 were excluded. Metronidazole muscle tissue concentration was assessed by a <b>micro-dialysis</b> technique. Based on the microdialysis data, similar kinetics were simulated in in vitro exper-iments using Bacillus fragilis strains with MIC 90 s of 0. 125 mg/L (BF 125) and 1. 0 mg/L (BF 1). Results: Metronidazole concentrations in plasma achieved a mean (S. D.) value of 11. 4 6 2. 0 mg/L at 30 min after administration of a single 500 mg intravenous dose, while in the muscle tissue, maximum concentrations of 8. 2 6 4. 5 mg/L were achieved at 140 6 92. 3 min after the dose. When this metronida-zole time course was simulated in vitro, the time to 99. 9 % kill ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 4 h for BF 125 and from 1. 8 to 3. 5 h for BF 1, while the eradication time ranged from 1. 7 to 2. 5 h and from 3. 4 to 6. 5 h, respectively. No regrowth was detected. Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic simulation of metronidazole interstitial concen-trations shows a high efficacy of the drug in septic patients...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The predominate {{issue in}} {{transplantation}} {{today is the}} inadequate supply of suitable organs for {{an increasing number of}} patients on the transplant waiting lists. In efforts to address this demand there has been an increasing use of expanded-criteria and donation-after-cardiac death donor kidneys and pancreases, however these organs are at higher risk for reperfusion injury. Advances in organ preservation thus need to focus on techniques to assess and optimise organ viability prior to transplantation. Methods: This research focuses on organ viability assessment during preservation using rapid sampling <b>micro-dialysis</b> (rsMD); preconditioning organs with novel endothelial localising anticoagulants to prevent micro-vascular thrombotic complications; development of both novel hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) solutions to minimise reperfusion injury, and HMP strategies that offer superior preservation of organ integrity compared to static cold storage (SCS). Using HMP and normothermic-reperfusion models of porcine and human kidney and pancreatic grafts, this project has investigated strategies addressing these themes. Results: rsMD can successfully provide detailed real-time information on tissue and organ viability during both SCS and HMP. Pre-conditioning grafts with novel localising anticoagulant proteins has been successful in ameliorating disturbances in macro and micro-vascular perfusion and graft microcvascular thrombosis, processes which play key roles in reperfusion injury and organ dysfunction. Separately the application of a novel adenosine/lidocaine based preservation solution in renal HMP preservation can potentially ameliorate reperfusion injury seen using conventional solutions. Post-ischaemic HMP reconditioning has been investigated in the context of recovering organs with an extreme period of SCS which may be a potential option to expand donor organ pools. Finally models of pancreatic HMP have been successfully established, opening the potential for organ viability assessment and optimization. Conclusion: This research has been successful in its overall objective to develop novel translational strategies that have high potential for clinical implementation. In doing so the goal would be to enable an expansion of the pool of acceptable donor organs by improving the methods used to determine and optimise their viability, specifically more effective preservation techniques and by addressing specific post-operative complications through graft preconditioning.

40|$|Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is an {{important}} method that enables open heart surgery. There is a risk of neurological complications, and efforts to minimize those include optimization of the cerebral perfusion during CPB. This thesis focuses on such optimization of flow conditions in case of obstructed venous drainage, carotid stenosis and during selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP). In a pig model of impaired venous drainage from the superior vena cava (SVC), stepwise obstruction increased the central venous pressure (CVP) and caused impaired oxygenation. Cerebral <b>micro-dialysis</b> revealed ischemic responses in some {{but not all of}} the pigs. Further experiments, using the same model, aimed to restore cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) reduced by 75 % superior venous obstruction. Both vasopressor treatment and increased venous drainage were effective in normalizing the CPP and improving the cerebral oxygenation. The intracranial pressure was elevated in the vasopressor group, but no signs of brain damage were observed. The arterial flow during CPB can be altered between pulsatile and non-pulsatile profiles. Switching between these modes was performed during CPB in 20 patients with or without carotid stenosis. The effects on cerebral oxygenation and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were examined. The MAP was significantly lowered by pulsatile flow, but the flow profile did not affect the cerebral oxygenation. No differences were seen between patients with or without carotid stenosis. SACP is used to ensure the cerebral perfusion during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). The cerebral blood flow (CBF) was examined using positron-emission tomography (PET) technique in 8 pigs divided into HCA and HCA+SACP groups. The CBF was downregulated by 70 % to 0. 10 ml/cm 3 /min by 20 °C hypothermia. A pump flow of 6 ml/kg/min preserved the CBF level without signs of cerebral desaturation. The fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake after re-warming to 37 °C was similar after SACP compared with HCA alone. In conclusion, experimental SVC obstruction may impair the cerebral perfusion. Vasopressors can restore the CPP during SVC obstruction and improve cerebral oxygenation. In patients, pulsatile flow can lower the MAP in absence of effects on the cerebral oxygenation. During experimental HCA, SACP at 6 ml/kg/min can preserve the CBF at 0. 10 ml/cm 3 /min...|$|E
40|$|The {{manifestation of}} {{psoriasis}} represents {{an interaction between}} a genetically predisposed individual and environmental influences such as infections, trauma, stress, endocrine factors, sunlight and drugs. The cutaneous lesions are characterised by marked epidermal proliferation, complex alterations in epidermal differentiation, multiple biochemical, immunological, in-flammatory and vascular abnormalities and a poorly understood relationship with the central and peripheral nervous system function. Hypothesis: Multiple observations are compatible with {{the existence of a}} peptidergic neurogenic mechanism in the pathophysiology of psoriatic plaque. Our hypothesis was that afferent noci-ceptive nerve-fibre endings in lesional skin are sensitised and activated by an unknown mediator. Via an axon-reflex mechanism in afferent C and A-delta fibre-endings, these nerves release neuro-peptides, which themselves have dilating effects and, in addition, may induce mast-cell degranulation/histamine release causing further vasodilatation. A pathological axon-reflex mechanism may thus contribute to the high blood flow and stimulate histamine release in lesional psoriatic skin. To test this hypothesis, a series of functional studies has been conducted to elucidate whether local neurogenic peptidergic mechanisms are of importance for the maintenance of the increase in blood flow and whether such mechanisms may induce histamine release in psoriatic plaque. Methods: Healthy subjects and patients with untreated psoriatic lesions were examined. The <b>micro-dialysis</b> technique was evaluated for application in dermal skin through measurements of tissue perturbations induced by the microdialysis catheter. A new calibration technique, retro-dialysis calibration, was tested and used to evaluate the concentration and release of histamine in lesional and non-lesional skin before and during the local stimulation and inhibition of noci-ceptive afferent nerves. The short term application of topical capsaicin was used to excite such neurones. Long-term treatment with capsaicin which desensitises nociceptive fibres or local anaesthesia was used to inhibit the activity. A laser Doppler technique was used to measure changes in perfusion before and after the provocations and 133 Xenon clearance methodology was used to estimate skin blood flow. Results: Perfusion, blood flow, histamine concentration and histamine release increased in lesional skin as compared with non-lesional tissue. The inhibition of nervous activity by topical local anaesthesia decreased the perfusion and augmented the concentration of histamine, but did not change the histamine release in lesional skin. No changes in these parameters were found in non-lesional skin. The stimulation of C-fibres by short-term capsaicin treatment increased the per-fusion and the concentration and release of histamine in both lesional and non-lesional skin. Long-term capsaicin treatment reduced the perfusion in lesional skin and increased it in lesion-free skin. Conclusion: The results are compatible with the hypothesis that a pathological axon reflex may contribute to the high blood flow in lesional psoriatic skin. In contrast, the increase in histamine release, is mediated either not at all or only to a minor extent by neurogenic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to clarify {{mechanisms}} involved in protective pre-treatment of ischemia by carbon monoxide (CO) and ischemic preconditioning (IP), so that new pro-tective therapies can be designed. This is studied in heart muscle, where the clinical gain would ultimately be {{to be able to}} prolong the period during a threatened myocardial infarction where permanent injury can be prevented. The aim is to elucidate energy meta-bolic relations as a basis for temporary metabolic adaptation to threatened injury in heart muscle, with focus on the biological relevance of this mechanism. All studies were conducted in an open-chest, anesthetized pig model using microdialysis sampling. Methods: In anesthetized 40 kg pigs, regional myocardial ischemia was produced by transient snare-ligation of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. <b>Micro-dialysis</b> catheters were used for local sampling of interstitial fluid in the ischemic area. In Studies 1 and 2, CO was administered before prolonged ischemia in a clinically relevant dose (5 % increase in carboxyhemoglobin). In Study 2, 45 Ca 2 + was administered locally by microperfusate to ischemic myocardium with 45 Ca 2 + recovery used as a marker for intra-cellular calcium overload during ischemia. Myocardial injury markers glycerol and glut-amate (and taurine in Studies 3 and 4) were measured in microdialysate. In Studies 3 and 4, IP was performed by 4 brief transient cycles of coronary occlusion and reperfusion before a prolonged index ischemic episode was performed. In Study 3, 14 C-marked adenosine was administered locally via microdialysis catheters in the heart muscle wall, and when this was metabolized during ischemia as an energy source, it was detected as 14 C-marked lactate. In Study 4, a water-soluble purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor was administered to heart muscle via microdialysis which was treated by IP before an index ischemia. Markers of glycolysis were measured serially before and during ischemia for Studies 1 - 4. Radio-labelled markers were analyzed using liquid chromatography and scintigraphy. Results: Study 1 results showed clear signs of metabolic advantage as far as glycolytic markers related to CO during myocardial ischemia. Study 2 results demonstrated no apparent energy metabolic advantage including for 45 Ca 2 + recovery and no diminishment of injury markers related to the single tested carbon monoxide dose during ischemia. Study 3 showed that IP led to enhanced radio-marked adenosine consumption as an energy-metabolic substrate, and that glycolytic flow (as less glucose consumption and lactate formation) was slower in IP-treated heart muscle. Study 4 showed that local purine nucleoside phosphorylase blockade inhibits adenosine utilization as an energy-metabolic substrate during ischemia, but this did not have an effect on glycolysis or injury markers during prolonged ischemia after IP. Conclusions: From Studies 1 and 2, we concluded that CO in this dose could show effects on glycolysis during ischemia but does not seem to confer cell protection during ischemia or early reperfusion, though CO protective effects in other doses or time frames cannot be ruled out. From Study 3 we concluded that there may be an immediate energy-metabolic explanation for why more IP-treated cells survive during prolonged ischemia. From Study 4 we concluded that experimental purine nucleoside phosphorylase blockade appears to allow interruption of IP-related adenosine utilization as an energy-metabolic substrate during prolonged ischemia without obvious effects on glycolysis, and that this requires further study to test if adenosine as an energy resource during ischemia is associated with protection during infarction.
