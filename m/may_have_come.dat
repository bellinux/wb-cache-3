5|$|According to Hervé Dumont's Encyclopédie du film historique {{the role}} of Kate Hardcastle was played by Rosemond and {{the role of}} George Marlow was played by Crane. This {{information}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from a surviving film still. One surviving film still was used in an advertisement by the Thanhouser Company.|$|E
5|$|Following the drilling, a hole {{opens up}} in the object's {{interior}} wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from a planet habitable five million years ago– Mars.|$|E
5|$|Ragtime was a {{style of}} dance music based around the piano, using syncopated rhythms and chromaticisms; the genre's most {{well-known}} performer and composer was undoubtedly Scott Joplin. Donald Clarke considers ragtime the culmination of coon songs, used first in minstrel shows and then vaudeville, {{and the result of}} the rhythms of minstrelsy percolating into the mainstream; he also suggests that ragtime's distinctive sound <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from an attempt to imitate the African American banjo using the keyboard.|$|E
60|$|So {{they went}} on living in utter misery till the month of <b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> round, and Lady Anna was at last {{pronounced}} to be convalescent.|$|R
25|$|I {{guarantee}} that, if {{we waited}} as we normally did, {{by the time}} <b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> around they would have picked up Angel. I can guarantee that.|$|R
50|$|A few Swedes <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>come</b> to Normandy.|$|R
5|$|Ralph Basset (sometimes Bassett; died c. 1127) was {{a medieval}} English royal justice {{during the reign}} of King Henry I of England. He was a native of Normandy, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to Henry's notice while Henry held land in Normandy prior to {{becoming}} king. Basset is first mentioned in documents about 1102, and from then until his death around 1127, he was frequently employed as a royal justice. His son Richard Basset also became a royal judge.|$|E
5|$|Sandgate was {{completed}} by the autumn of 1540; Henry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to the castle when he was visiting Folkestone in May 1542. Elizabeth I visited the fortification in 1573, and also used it to imprison the courtier Thomas Keyes for a period, after he married Lady Mary Grey against the Queen's wishes. In 1593, the castle {{was reported to be}} equipped with seven artillery pieces - one culverin, two demi-culverins, three sakers and one minion - along with muskets, bows and arrows.|$|E
5|$|Shahaf and Doriel built {{models of}} the wall, {{concrete}} drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from a position behind the France2 cameraman, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.|$|E
5000|$|People named [...] "Hergenröther" [...] <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>come</b> {{from this}} town.|$|R
50|$|Begnet <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Dalkey, {{despite the}} genealogical note on her origin. Missionaries <b>may</b> <b>have</b> founded the two churches {{in her name}} there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go {{when you}} like, Papa," [...] {{she said when}} the days of <b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>come,</b> [...] "but I'd sooner stay here a little longer if you wouldn't mind." [...] There was no talk of going home. It was only a {{question}} whether they should go further north, to Lucerne, before the warm weather came.|$|R
5|$|Some very fragmentary fossils {{belonging}} to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly Pteranodon itself, {{have also been}} found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States. For example, some bone fragments from the Mooreville Formation of Alabama and the Merchantville Formation of Delaware <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Pteranodon, though they are too incomplete to make a definite identification. Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to Pteranodon, but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Saint Andrew <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to Pictland from Northumbria, as had {{the cult}} of Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in {{particular}} from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. Óengus, like his successors and possible kinsmen Caustantín and Eógan, is recorded prominently in the Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis, a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in religious institutions connected with Durham.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for Sycorax's {{character}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the classical literature familiar {{to many in}} Shakespeare's day. Sycorax is similar to Medea, a witch in Ovid's Metamorphoses, in that both are powerful, magical female figures. Scholars have {{also pointed out that}} Sycorax resembles the magical Circe from Greek mythology as well as perhaps a version of Circe found in the mythology of the Coraxi tribe in modern-day Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recent years}} the United Arab Emirates has adopted an anti-Semitic policy to Jewish {{academics}} and authors from other countries who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to <b>come</b> to its territory." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> round {{again before}} Robert Fulmort stood {{waiting at the}} Waterloo Station to welcome the travellers, who had been {{prohibited}} from putting Bertha's restored health to the test of east winds. It was a vista of happy faces that he encountered as {{he looked into the}} carriage window, yet the first questions and answers were grave and mournful.|$|R

5|$|The {{only source}} from which Abuwtiyuw is known is a stone {{inscription}} tablet that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from the funerary chapel of the dog's owner. The tablet was apparently among spolia {{used to build}} another grave in approximately 2280 BC, a sixth-Dynasty mastaba, after the chapel's demolition. It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E
5|$|Through {{contact with}} {{neighboring}} civilizations, the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities. Dedun, who is first {{mentioned in the}} Old Kingdom, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Nubia, and Baal, Anat, and Astarte, among others, were adopted from Canaanite religion during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC). In Greek and Roman times, from 332 BC to the early centuries AD, deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt, but the native gods remained, and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Padarn {{was said}} to come {{originally}} from Brittany, but he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from south-east Wales. He {{was said to}} be both abbot and bishop (the distinction was not so great then as it later became) for many years, and from his base at what is now known as Llanbadarn Fawr (great or high church of St Padarn) he evangelised the neighbouring countryside.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{certainty}} in all that," [...] {{reiterated the}} other; [...] "they <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> in that vessel; if they did, {{some of them}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> escaped. We cannot tell." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{implies that}} people <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to America from North Asia through a land-bridge {{which is now}} {{underwater}} as previously thought.|$|R
5000|$|The Abenaki {{people called}} the {{mountain}} Miccasadenauk, meaning [...] "mountain {{with a black}} summit", which gave way to its original English name, [...] "Black Mountain". The Abenaki name, and ultimately the English one, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>came</b> about due to the mountain's long history of forest fires, the trees being destroyed leaving a rocky summit blackened by ash. The last of these great fires occurred in 1903.|$|R
5|$|A copy of {{the film}} leaked onto {{peer-to-peer}} file sharing networks just hours after opening in theaters. The film was a time-stamped workprint, suggesting it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from within the industry rather than from someone who videotaped an advance screening. Eight people were later charged with copyright infringement and distributing material illegally. Documents filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney allege that a {{copy of the}} film was taken from an unnamed Californian post-production office by an employee, who later pleaded guilty to his charges. The illegal copy was passed among seven people until reaching an eighth party, who also pleaded guilty to uploading to an unnamed P2P network.|$|E
5|$|Charles Guinand Blackader {{was born}} in Richmond, Surrey on 20 September 1869. His father, Charles George Blackader, was a teacher to {{a small number of}} {{boarding}} pupils; he had come from an Army family, and taught at Cheltenham College and Clifton College, Bristol, before moving to private tuition. His mother, Charlotte Guinand, {{was born in}} Germany; her family <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from Alsace-Lorraine, as Blackader would later describe himself as half-French. During his childhood, the Blackaders moved from Richmond to Southampton, where his father headed the education department at the Hartley Institute, and then to Boulogne, where he taught at Beaurepaire School.|$|E
5|$|Henry is {{generally}} credited with initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though as historian A. F. Pollard has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.|$|E

25|$|The gold <b>may</b> well <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from {{mines in}} {{the west of the}} Massif Central, which had been in {{operation}} since at least the 5th century BC.|$|R
5|$|Jones {{retired from}} his {{surveying}} work in 1800, for reasons unknown. Various reasons have been suggested; Jones {{was known as}} an extremely hard worker, and may have wanted less strenuous work as a farmer, his ties to Joseph Brant may have been politically problematic as Brant was frequently in conflict with Upper Canada authorities, and {{his status as a}} loyalist to the British Empire <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> into question as it became known his brother in law, James Gage, had fought with the Americans during the revolution, and his brother Ebenezer may have as well. Whatever the cause of his retirement, Jones returned to his farm in Saltfleet Township and began life as a farmer.|$|E
5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula {{during the}} 7th and 8th centuries AD {{following}} the Hegira, or Hijra, of Muhammad in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled {{most of the}} Iberian peninsula by 720. Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African Barb. A few Arabian horses <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> with the Ummayads who settled in the Guadalquivir valley. Another strain of horse that came with Islamic invaders was the Turkoman horse. Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France, where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD.|$|E

6000|$|The nineteenth of <b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>come,</b> {{and by that}} day's {{sunshine}} {{there had}} entered into Florence the two Papal Commissaries, charged with the completion of Savonarola's trial. They entered amid the acclamations of the people, calling {{for the death of}} the Frate. For now the popular cry was, [...] "It is the Frate's deception that has brought on all our misfortunes; let him be burned, and all things right will be done, and our evils will cease." ...|$|R
