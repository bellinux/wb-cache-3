25|$|A large camp {{had been}} set up to house the workers near this area and Mulholland used his spare time {{becoming}} familiar with the area's geological features. In the area, which later the dam would be situated, he found the mid and upper portion of the western hillside consisted mainly of a reddish colored conglomerate and sandstone formation that had small strings of gypsum interspersed within it. Below the red conglomerate, down the remaining portion of the western hillside, crossing the canyon floor and up the eastern wall, a drastically different rock composition prevailed. These areas were made up of <b>mica</b> <b>schist</b> that was severely laminated, cross-faulted in many areas and interspersed with talc. Although later many geologists disagreed on the exact location of the area of contact between the two formations, a majority opinion placed it at the inactive San Francisquito Fault line.|$|E

The geology of the region became greatly altered by this event; much of the weaker rock was stripped from the region, leaving only highly-resistant <b>mica</b> <b>schist.</b> As the glaciers retreated, a layer of glacial till was deposited, including several glacial erratics.

40|$|The Palaeoproterozoic Svecofennian {{bedrock of}} the Seinäjoki-Ilmajoki area, western Finland, is largely {{composed}} of porphyroblastic metapelites. In the area, the regional metamorphic grade increases towards the southwest. Over {{a distance of}} 15 km, andalusite <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> gradually grade into migmatitic garnet cordierite-sillimanite mica gneisses with a facies-series of the andalusite-sillimanite type. Five regional metamorphic zones are present: andalusite, sillimanite-muscovite, sillimanite-K-feldspar, cordierite-K-feldspar and garnet-cordierite-K-feldspar. The primary layering (S 0) of the <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> is deformed by an isoclinal fold phase (F 2), which is synchronous with the main metamorphic phase {{and the growth of}} micas. S 1 is very weak and subject to interpretation. The S 2 schistosity is deformed by intense late-metamorphic F 3 and F 3 b folds, which have formed under slightly different metamorphic conditions: practically no metamorphic micas have grown parallel to axial planes while within F 3 b folds there are a few granitic veins parallel to these planes. The F 3 and F 3 b folds probably belong to one phase. S 2 dominates in the <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> while S 3 and S 3 b dominate in the mica gneisses. The metapelites are also deformed by younger minor fold phases (F 4 and F 5). A composite schistosity (S 0 ±S 1 ±S 2 ±S 3, or S 3 b) commonly occurs in the metapelites. The peak of regional metamorphism has been associated with the intrusion of 1. 89 - 1. 88 Ga old tonalite plutons. Geothermometric estimates for regional metamorphism are c. 730 °C at an assumed pressure of 5 kbar. Neosomes in the high-grade mica gneisses occur as patches rather than as elongated, narrow veins. Garnet coexists with cordierite, but the minerals are rarely in equilibrium. Muscovitization and the formation of retrogressive andalusite did not occur in the high-grade mica gneisses, but there is minor kyanite indicating that the crust probably underwent near-isobaric cooling. The area of highest-grade regional metamorphic conditions contains a post-kinematic mangeritic quartz monzonite (1. 87 Ga), which has a narrow granulite-grade contact aureole. The chemical composition of biotites in the metapelites varies as a function of metamorphic zoning, but the chemical composition of metapelites remains mostly unchanged...|$|R
50|$|During the Variscan orogeny in the Pennsylvanian about 310 {{million years}} ago the sediments of the Canaveilles Group were metamorphosed under mesozonal {{conditions}} (amphibolite facies). The original shales transformed into <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> of the cordierite, andalusite and sillimanite zone in {{the lower part of}} the section, higher up they only converted to greenschist facies phyllites of the biotite zone. The carbonaceous intercalations became marbles and calcsilicates. Close to the contact with the “transitional gneiss” first the andalusite isograd is reached, followed by the cordierite isograd. This indicates a magmatic origin of the gneisses formed from intrusive granitoids.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Menderes Massif, {{which covers}} {{a large area}} in western Turkey, {{is made up of}} Pan-African {{basement}} rocks and a Palaeozoic to Early Tertiary cover sequence. The study area is located in the Dalama and Hallalar (AydÝn) area, in the northern and central parts of the ine submassif of the Menderes Massif. The oldest units of the Pan-African basement are metaclastics, consisting of paragneisses and <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> that gradually and conformably overlay paragneisses. Macroscopic appearances and mineralogical and textural data indicate that paragneisses can be subdivided into four subgroups. These are: (1) black spotted, (2) white spotted, (3) massive, grey-coloured and (4) massive, purple-coloured paragneisses. Geochemical data show that the spotted and purple-coloured paragneisses are characterized by high alumina content that is consistent with high sillimanite content. Paragneisses exposed {{in the eastern part of}} the ine submassif were partly migmatized during the last stage of the polyphase Pan-African metamorphism. Based on comparison with relics of upper amphibolite to granulite (?) facies parageneses in the Pan-African basement of the Menderes Massif, we infer that the porphyroblasts in the black-spotted paragneisses are pseudomorphs after cordierite. Considering the inferred replacement of cordierite by sillimanite + garnet + biotite, it can be concluded that former high-temperature assemblages were overprinted by almandine-amphibolite facies metamorphism. Geochemical data obtained from paragneisses and <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> reveal that the protoliths of this metaclastic sequence were derived from a cratonic provenance. The paragneisse...|$|R

40|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of igneous, metamorphic and mineralized {{rocks in}} the Edough massif, NE Algeria, indicates an interplay between crustal and magmatic sources, and magmatic and surface fluids, as determined by sulphur and oxygen isotopic analyses. The Tertiary igneous rocks (microgranites and rhyolites) show a tendency towards I-type granitoids with delta(34) S values of + 5. 4 +/- 2. 2 parts per thousand (1 sigma) and delta(18) O between + 5. 6 parts per thousand and + 6. 9 parts per thousand, with the most hydrothermally altered rocks having the lowest delta(18) O values. This is indicative of seawater being {{a major component of}} the hydrothermal fluids. Seawater interaction with the granitoids produced enrichment in S- 34 of sulphide-sulphur in both the microgranites and associated skarn mineralization. However, in the Beleleita WSn-(Au) deposit, magmatic fluids dominated the mineralization, reflected by delta(34) S values of + 1. 7 parts per thousand and + 1. 8 parts per thousand. The basement amphibolites of Kef Lakhal indicate derivation from a basaltic magma with delta(18) O ranging from + 4. 9 parts per thousand to + 8. 6 parts per thousand. Locally altered amphibolite has the lowest delta(18) O values suggestive of meteoric water interaction, whereas the highest delta(18) O indicate the incorporation of crustal material during the genesis of the amphibolites. Crustal contamination is also reflected in their delta(34) S of - 18 parts per thousand to + 2. 1 parts per thousand, with the most contaminated rocks having the lowest delta(34) S. Host Palaeozoic <b>mica</b> <b>schists</b> with delta(18) O of + 12. 7 parts per thousand, and delta(34) S of - 13. 2 parts per thousand and associated marbles (delta(34) S - 9. 9 parts per thousand to - 17. 4 parts per thousand) are thought to be the most likely contaminants. At the Ain Barbar Fe-Cu-Pb-Zn deposit, delta(34) S values range between - 9. 6 parts per thousand and - 10. 8 parts per thousand, indicating that the sulphide-sulphur and base-metals were likely leached from the host Cretaceous flysch and/or the underlying <b>mica</b> <b>schists,</b> with local Tertiary magmatic rocks providing the heat for local convection cells. At Boumaiza Fe- deposit, delta(34) S values of the sulphide-sulphur extend from - 1. 2 parts per thousand to - 8. 1 parts per thousand indicative of magmatic sulphur with the incorporation of substantial amounts of sulphur derived from the host <b>mica</b> <b>schists...</b>|$|R
