5000|$|Minced cutlet (котлета рубленая, kotleta rublenaya), or, {{since the}} late 19th century, simply [...] "cutlet", is a staple of Russian cuisine. It {{is similar to a}} Salisbury steak, with the main {{difference}} being <b>pure</b> <b>beef</b> is rarely employed—usually pork or a beef-pork mixture is used. The meat is seasoned with salt and pepper, mixed with finely chopped onion (optionally fried), garlic, and a binder (eggs and breadcrumbs soaked in milk), divided into oval-shaped patties, lightly breaded and shallow-fried in a half-inch of vegetable oil. The similarly named Japanese dish, menchi katsu, is always deep-fried and heavily breaded, being essentially a mincemeat croquette, while the Russian version is always shallow-fried.|$|R
50|$|The test {{consisted}} of a genomic sequence analysis on 258 hamburgers, which revealed {{that three of the}} patties sampled contained rat DNA, and one contained human DNA. While the contamination of the samples was determined to most likely come from rat feces and human hair rather than the meat, the report showed other discrepancies. Many burgers labelled as <b>pure</b> <b>beef</b> product included chicken, turkey, and pork. Additionally, 23.6% of vegetarian patties were found to contain traces of meat, one of the bean burgers was found to contain no beans, and 4% of the sample group were found to have pathogens. Clear Labs also found the burgers to contain more calories than advertised on the label.|$|R
40|$|The Michaelis {{constants}} and {{the maximum}} velocities in the aminoacylation reaction of tRNATrp from beef liver, yeast and E. coli by <b>pure</b> <b>beef</b> pancreas tryptophan-tRNA ligase {{show that this}} mammalian enzyme recognizes and charges the two eucaryotic tRNAs with the same efficiency. The rate of aminoacylation of the procaryotic tRNATrp by the enzyme is three orders of magnitude lower. The pH optimum of aminoacylation is 8 for both eucaryotic tRNAs. The optimum magnesium concentration is different. The rate is maximum when magnesium concentration is stoichiometric to ATP concentration for tRNATrp from beef liver and 10 mM above ATP concentration for tRNATrp from yeast.

40|$|Counterfeit food {{products}} {{are starting to}} become a new problem around the people of Indonesia. Problems that are getting special attention especially the concern of contamination of {{food products}} by non-halal meat. For example rat meat on meatballs. This research {{is expected to be}} one of the basis for the guarantee of non-halal meatballs products. The study of Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR) combined with chemometrics can be used to identify the presence of rat meat in meatballs qualitatively and quantitatively. Samples of meatballs are made by preparing pure rat and <b>pure</b> <b>beef</b> meat. The calibration samples were prepared by making meatballs containing beef - rat with variations of 0 %, 25 %, 35 %, 65 %, 75 %, and 100 % rat meat in dough meatballs. Validation samples were prepared from a number of meatballs prepared in the laboratory containing rat meat in a certain concentration and 5 samples of meatballs in the market. Cow and rat fat contained in meatballs were extracted with Soxhlet at ≤ 70 oC for 7 hours with n-hexane solvent. Quantitative analysis was performed on wave number 750 - 1600 cm- 1 using multivariate partial least square (PLS) and qualitative analysis with principal component analysis (PCA).

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the reason of beef production for human food {{security and the}} necessity of special dairy and beefbreeds in order to balance the milk and the meat production in cattle farming. That is a difficult target for manycountries since they don’t dispose of large natural pastures to extensively feed the beef cattle herds. At the same timemany European countries breed only dual purpose cattle breeds. So the idea of intensive farming with beef breeds orcrosses is developed. To speed up this kind of programs Open MOET (Multiple Ovulation Embryo Transfer) Farmtechnology is proposed and it is completed with the needed facilities for production and preservation of embryos. Concerning the MOET Farm which confers directly <b>pure</b> bred <b>beef</b> calves, emphases is put on veterinary quarantineand heifer receptors conditioning. Concerning embryo conservation the direct transfer (DT) technique isrecommended.

40|$|Economic {{values for}} {{production}} (sale weight in steers, SWs, kg and heifers, SWh, kg; dressing percentage, DP; consumable meat percentage, CMP and milk yield, MY, kg) and functional (cow weight, CoWT, kg; cow survival rate, CoSR, %; postweaning survival rate, PSR, %; feed intake of cows, FIc, heifers, FIh and steers, FIs, kg DM) traits were estimated for six production systems utilizing the Boran breed in Kenya. The {{influence of the}} estimated economic values on genetic improvement was also assessed using different selection indices. The six production systems were described according to their sale age, levels of input and final goal, namely, short-fed medium input beef (SMB); long-fed medium input beef (LMB); short-fed high input beef (SHB); long-fed high input beef (LHB); long-fed low input dual purpose (LLD); and long-fed medium input dual purpose (LMD). Two evaluation bases were considered: fixed herd size and fixed pasture input. In the fixed herd-size situation, the economic values for production (except MY in beef systems) and functional traits (except FI in all systems) were positive meaning a unit increase in genetic merit of these traits had greater influence on revenues than costs. As expected, the economic value for MY was negative in the <b>pure</b> <b>beef</b> systems (SMB, LMB, SHB and LHB) and positive in the dual-purpose systems (LLD and LMD). When compared with the economic values estimated in the fixed herd-size situation, in the fixed pasture input situation they were lower for feed intake in the three classes of livestock and other traits related to it in all systems. These traits were CoSR, CoWR, PSR, CoWT, SWh and MY. The economic values for CoWT in LLD and LMD were negative (KSh − 11. 14 and − 15. 33 respectively). The economic values did not influence much {{the direction of the}} genetic response in each trait in the different production systems. However, the magnitude of the actual gain was dependent on the index applied. The magnitude of the economic values for production and functional traits estimated in this study suggest that genetic improvement of these traits will {{have a positive effect on}} profitability of Boran cows kept in dual-purpose systems and when herd size is restricted. In beef systems, genetic improvement of MY will have a negative effect on profitability, especially when restrictions on herd size and feed exists...|$|R
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} and antioxidant {{effect of}} Majorana syriaca extract, obtained by ethyl acetate, to Yellowfin tuna was examined. The extract {{was added to}} refined corn oil at different concentrations (0 - 3900 ppm). Minced tuna was mixed with corn oil containing the extract (tuna/oil: 3 / 1 w/w); the mixture was packed aerobically and stored at 0 °C. Microbial growth and lipid oxidation were determined periodically. Majorana syriaca extract delayed the microbial growth (total viable count, Pseudomonas sp. and lactic acid bacteria) as compared with <b>pure</b> <b>minced</b> tuna, with an increasing effect as concentration increased. Oxidation was monitored through measurement of peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. Both tests showed inhibition of tuna oxidation as the concentration of the extract increased.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results {{obtained}} with the pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (P-NMR) technique applied for determining fat content in fresh meat. The interfering moisture content of meat was removed by microwave drying and the dried residue was quantitatively transferred into the P-NMR tubes. The total analysis time was about 50 min. Experiments were performed with rendered <b>pure</b> pork, <b>beef</b> and goose fats, sunflower oil and with lean pork - fat and lean beef - tallow mixtures (batters). The regression (prediction) equations (intensity of P-NMR signal vs. fat content determined with the Soxhlet reference method) of the sunflower oil and fat samples did not differ appreciably. Consequently, contrary to the results obtained with the CW-NMR technique, the variability of the fatty acid composition of the examined fats and oil had no substantial effect on the regression (prediction) equations in this case. On the other hand, there was a considerable difference between the regression lines of the lean pork-fat and lean beef-tallow mixtures. Therefore, due to the interfering effect of the non-fat dry matter {{and the type of}} meat on the intensity of P-NMR signal, this technique can only have a restricted practical application in the in-line process control of fat content of meats. ...|$|R
