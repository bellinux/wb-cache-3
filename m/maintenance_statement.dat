40|$|The {{place is}} {{important}} in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of the region’s history. A The Ceratodus Rest Area {{is important in}} demonstrating {{the pattern of the}} region’s history, by providing tangible and intangible evidence of two key historical processes that were significant in the region, namely the use of Native Police and the construction of the railway in the early twentieth century. The site is also important in demonstrating the emergence of community interest {{in the history of the}} locality, illustrated by the erection of the cairn to the Native Police and the relocation of the former Ceratodus Railway Station building and its ongoing <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Statement</b> The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in the region’s history. H The Ceratodus Rest Area has a special association with two community groups, the Eidsvold and District Historical Society and the Ceratodus Relocation Committee, both of which were (and in the case of the historical society, remain) important community organisations committed to preserving and communicating the history of the region...|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand PPSR is {{a wholly}} {{electronic}} register {{available to the}} public 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It provides online searching, registration and <b>maintenance</b> of financing <b>statements.</b> The Australian PPS Register commenced operation on 30 January 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Linus Pauling Institute is a {{research}} institute located at the Oregon State University {{with a focus on}} health <b>maintenance.</b> The mission <b>statement</b> of the institute is three-fold. First, to determine the functional roles of micronutrients and phytochemicals in promoting optimal health and to treat or prevent human disease. Second, to determine the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in health and disease processes, and determine how dietary antioxidants and anti-inflammatories may have protective effects. Lastly, to help people live a full and productive life, free of disease. There are several major areas of research occurring at the institute, focused on many vitamins, minerals and other compounds found in the diet.|$|R
50|$|Within the IAG, {{each member}} agency {{has its own}} billing and {{customer}} service center, and each establishes its own fee and discount structures. The agencies also set their own customer account policies. Areas of variation include the refundable deposit or nonrefundable charge for a tag, periodic <b>maintenance</b> fees, paper <b>statement</b> fees, the low account threshold, and replenishment amounts. E‑ZPass is usually offered as a debit account: tolls are deducted from prepayments made by the users. Users may opt to have prepayments automatically deposited when their account is low, or they may submit prepayments manually, either by phone or a toll authority's web portal, depending on the agency. For commercial accounts, some agencies allow postpaid plans with a security deposit (which effectively renders them prepaid accounts, with a different replenishment policy).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the software development workbench WSDW (Web structure-oriented Software Development Workbench) {{together with the}} tool development language TDL. WSDW is an integrated structure-oriented software environment which contains several tools for software evolution. The integration of tools is achieved by sharing a program representation which {{is based upon the}} mathematical concept of relation: the web structure is the basic high level representation of programs within the environment. The TDL language is a structure-oriented language that supports the creation {{of a wide variety of}} tools both for software development and <b>maintenance.</b> The elementary <b>statements</b> in a TDL program are web rewriting rules and manipulations of programs are expressed as web transformations. Moreover, to make program transformations more intuitive to the tool programmer, web rewriting rules are expressed graphically. Each tool in WSDW performs a sequence of web transformations and new software tools can be implemented as TDL programs and integrated into WSDW...|$|R
