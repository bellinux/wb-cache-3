40|$|To improve {{animal health}} and welfare of veal calves, since 1997, the European Union made {{mandatory}} the provision of a minimum daily amount (50 to 250 g) of fibrous feed in addition to the milk replacer diet. However more recently, the high costs of milk replacer ingredients have become an economic incentive {{to increase the amount of}} fibrous feed provided to the calves as partial substitute of the milk replacer. Solid feed provision has been shown to decrease abnormal behaviours such as oral stereotypes and improving calves rumination and rumen development. Moreover, increasing labour cost and herd sizes of the Italian veal sector have supported a growing interest by the calf producers towards the mechanization of the solid feed delivery. The main purpose of this paper is to show how the implementation of mechanized feeding systems can improve feed intake control, feeding rate and delivery efficiency if compared to the <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> of the solid portion of calves diet. Indeed, manual feeding is the most diffused system in veal calves dairy farm but exhibits many disadvantages in terms of distribution homogeneity and labour costs for the livestock farm. The study focuses on the results of an electric self-propelled prototype tested in a veal calves farm, allowing mixing of all solid feed ingredients and control of the weight of the feed delivered to each manger. It is shown how nutritional homogeneity can be improved, reducing deviations by a factor of 4 with respect to <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> in the case of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber. Additionally it is shown how single ration quantity variability can be reduced from over 30 % in the case of <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> to less than 10 % in the case of mechanized delivery...|$|E

Methods: Time and motion data, staff and surgery schedules, and cost accounting reports were collected across three sites located in the US, France, and Canada. Time and motion data were collected for manually loaded IOL processes and preloaded IOL delivery systems over four surgery days. Staff and surgery schedules and cost accounting reports were collected during the 2  months prior and after introduction of the preloaded IOL delivery system. Results: The study included a total of 154 routine cataract surgeries across all three sites. Of these, 77 surgeries were performed using a preloaded IOL delivery system, and the remaining 77 surgeries were performed using a <b>manual</b> IOL <b>delivery</b> process. Across all three sites, use of the preloaded IOL delivery system significantly decreased mean total case time by 6. 2 %– 12. 0 % (P< 0. 001 for data from Canada and the US and P< 0. 05 for data from France).

40|$|Right paraduodenal hernia (RPH) {{has been}} {{recently}} {{reported to be}} treated with laparoscopic surgery. We report a case of strangulated ileus that occurred as a result of RPH treated via a small umbilical incision. An 11 -year-old boy presented to our hospital with complaints of sudden upper abdominal pain associated with bilious vomiting and bloody stool. We preoperatively diagnosed the case to be strangulated ileus caused by an internal hernia and thus performed emergency surgery. After the entire small intestine was carefully exteriorized via a small umbilical incision, a strangulated ileus {{as a result of the}} internal hernia was observed. A large hernia sac with its orifice on the right side of the jejunal origin was found behind the right mesocolon, on the basis of which the diagnosis of RPH was made.

40|$|Abstract Continuous {{adjustment}} of Propofol in <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> of anesthesia for conducting a surgical procedure overburdens the workload of an anesthetist {{who is working}} in a multi-tasking scenario. Going beyond manual administration and Target Controlled Infusion, closed-loop control of Propofol infusion {{has the potential to}} offer several benefits in terms of handling perturbations and reducing the effect of inter-patient variability. This paper proposes a closed-loop automated drug administration approach to control Depth Of Hypnosis in anesthesia. In contrast with most of the existing research on anesthesia control which makes use of linear control strategies or their improved variants, the novelty of the present research lies in applying robust control strategy i. e. Sliding Mode Control to accurately control drug infusion. Based on the derived patient's model, the designed controller uses measurements from EEG to regulate DOH on Bispectral Index by controlling infusion rate of Propofol. The performance of the controller is investigated and characterized with real dataset of 8 patients undergoing surgery. Results of this in silico study indicate that for all the patients, with 0 % overshoot observed, the steady state error lies in between ± 5. Clinically, this implies that in all the cases, without any overdose, the controller maintains the desired DOH level for smooth conduction of surgical procedures...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the color Doppler and gray-scale sonographic {{appearance of the}} uterus after pregnancy, with {{special attention to the}} occurrence of areas of enhanced vascularity and placental remnants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study involving 385 consecutive women presenting at their first visit after pregnancy. The uterus was evaluated using ultrasound with color Doppler. In the presence of placental remnants, blood was sampled for measurement of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG), hemoglobin (Hb) and infectious parameters. If indicated, a dilatation and curettage was performed. RESULTS: In 8. 3 % of women, areas of enhanced vascularity were detected with color Doppler examination. Most cases (68. 9 %) were focal areas of one or more vessels. In 2. 6 % of patients abnormal vascularity extended over a large area of the whole myometrium. In 6. 75 % of cases, placental remnants were detected. In 46 % of these, blood sampling revealed beta hCG levels below 30 mIU/mL; serological infection parameters and Hb concentration were within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Areas of enhanced vascularity of the uterus, ranging from a focal vascular pedicle to a larger area of the myometrium, are relatively common after pregnancy. They are predominantly seen in the presence of placental remnants, in the early postpartum period and after instrumental or <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> of the placenta. There are no clear risk factors for retained placental tissue, besides the history of blood transfusion in the early postpartum, and perhaps multigravidity.

50|$|Although the Sensei {{system was}} {{initially}} {{tested in a}} range of ablation procedures including SVT and typical atrial flutter, there is most excitement about its role in complex ablation procedures such as for atrial fibrillation (AF), where the ability to manipulate catheters to precise locations within the heart and keep them stable in the desired position is crucial. Achieving adequate tissue contact, ideally {{with a small amount of}} pressure being applied by the catheter during ablation, is also essential to effectively destroy the heart tissue responsible for arrhythmia. The ability to titrate catheter contact force using the Sensei system’s built-in pressure sensor technology (called intellisense) may allow operators to maximise the chance of creating effective burns across the thickness of the atrial wall, whilst minimising the risk of complication. Intracardiac echocardiography has also demonstrated that greater catheter stability is achieved with robotic compared to <b>manual</b> catheter <b>delivery.</b> Consequently, there is evidence that robotic ablation causes more effective and more efficient burns.|$|R

40|$|Preanalytical {{uncertainty}} {{is attributable to}} variations in blood sample collection and sample handling before analysis. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a modelling framework for estimating preanalytical uncertainty. There is a need for standardization on which uncertainty sources that should be included, and how the preanalytical uncertainty should be estimated. In Paper I, an uncertainty budget was established based on differences in paired data between a standard method for handling blood samples and alternative methods used in current practice, considering the distribution of alternative methods. In Paper II and III, linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the between-venipuncture SD, the preanalytical SD (excluding the betweenvenipuncture SD), and the measurement repeatability when the phlebotomy and the sample handling were performed optimally, and any difference in preanalytical SD and fixed effects, between transporting blood samples in a pneumatic tube system vs <b>manual</b> <b>delivery,</b> using different needles or tubes, and mixing methods. When the combined biases from the uncertainty budget in Paper I and the significant biases between different treatments in Paper II and III were compared with defined quality specifications for analytical bias, glucose was the only analyte falling outside the quality specifications. Prolonged clotting and storage time were the greatest contributors to the bias for glucose, and the significant mean difference between SST vs RST tubes shows that choice of tube is important. The preanalytical SDs (excluding the between-venipuncture SD) for LD and potassium for optimally treated samples, were significantly higher than the measurement repeatability SDs, but for glucose, the between-venipuncture SD was the dominant source of variation. For most analytes, the preanalytical SDs were about the same in both studies II and III, indicating that the preanalytical variations are little influenced by different preanalytical handling. We have developed two models that can be used to estimate preanalytical uncertainty in clinical chemistry laboratories. Estimation of preanalytical uncertainty may improve diagnostic quality and patient treatment...|$|E
40|$|Goal-directed fluid therapy {{strategies}} {{have been shown}} to benefit moderate- to high-risk surgery patients. Despite this, these strategies are often not implemented. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess a closed-loop fluid administration system in a surgical cohort and compare the results with those for matched patients who received manual management. Our hypothesis was that the patients receiving closed-loop assistance would spend more time in a preload-independent state, defined as percentage of case time with stroke volume variation less than or equal to 12 %. Patients eligible for the study were all those over 18 years of age scheduled for hepatobiliary, pancreatic or splenic surgery and expected to receive intravascular arterial blood pressure monitoring as part of their anesthetic care. The closed-loop resuscitation target was selected by the primary anesthesia team, and the system was responsible for implementation of goal-directed fluid therapy during surgery. Following completion of enrollment, each study patient was matched to a non-closed-loop assisted case performed during the same time period using a propensity match to reduce bias. A total of 40 patients were enrolled, 5 were ultimately excluded and 25 matched pairs were selected from among the remaining 35 patients within the predefined caliper distance. There was no significant difference in fluid administration between groups. The closed-loop group spent a significantly higher portion of case time in a preload-independent state (95 [*]±[*] 6 % of case time versus 87 [*]±[*] 14 %, P = 0. 008). There was no difference in case mean or final stroke volume index (45 [*]±[*] 10 versus 43 [*]±[*] 9 and 45 [*]±[*] 11 versus 42 [*]±[*] 11, respectively) or mean arterial pressure (79 [*]±[*] 8 versus 83 [*]±[*] 9).

40|$|Background: Caesarean section {{involves}} {{making an}} incision in the woman's abdomen and {{cutting through the}} uterine muscle. The baby is then delivered through that incision. Difficult caesarean birth may result in injury for the infant or complications for the mother. Methods to assist with delivery include vacuum or forceps extraction or <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> utilising fundal pressure. Medication that relaxes the uterus (tocolytic medication) may facilitate {{the birth of the}} baby at caesarean section. Delivery of the impacted head after prolonged obstructed labour can be associated with significant maternal and neonatal complication; to facilitate delivery of the head the surgeon may utilise either reverse breech extraction or head pushing. Objectives: To compare the use of tocolysis (routine or selective use) with no use of tocolysis or placebo and to compare different extraction methods at the time of caesarean section for outcomes of infant birth trauma, maternal complications (particularly postpartum haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion), and long-term measures of infant and childhood morbidity. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials comparing the use of tocolytic agents (routine or selective) at caesarean section versus no use of tocolytic or placebo at caesarean section to facilitate the birth of the baby. Use of instrument versus <b>manual</b> <b>delivery</b> to facilitate birth of the baby. Reverse breech extraction versus head pushing to facilitate delivery of the deeply impacted fetal head. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: Seven randomised controlled trials, involving 582 women undergoing caesarean section were included in this review. The risk of bias of included trials was variable, with some trials not adequately describing allocation or randomisation. Three comparisons were included. 1. Tocolysis versus no tocolysis: A single randomised trial involving 97 women was identified and included in the review. Birth trauma was not reported. There were no cases of any maternal side-effect reported in either the nitroglycerin or the placebo group. No other maternal and infant health outcomes were reported. 2. Reverse breech extraction versus head push for the deeply impacted head at full dilation at caesarean section: Four randomised trials involving 357 women were identified and included in the review. The primary outcome of birth trauma was reported by three trials and {{there was no difference between}} reverse breech extraction and head push for this rare outcome (three studies, 239 women, risk ratio (RR) 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 42 to 5. 73). Secondary outcomes including endometritis rate (three studies, 285 women, average RR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 26 to 1. 05, Tau I² = 0. 22, I² = 56 %), extension of uterine incision (four studies, 357 women, average RR 0. 23, 95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 40), mean blood loss (three studies, 298 women, mean difference (MD) - 294. 92, 95 % CI - 493. 25 to - 96. 59; I² = 98 %) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) /special care nursery (SCN) admission (two studies, 226 babies, average RR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 23 to 1. 22, Tau I² = 0. 27, I² = 74 %) were decreased with reverse breech extraction. No differences were observed between groups for many of the other secondary outcomes reported (blood loss > 500 mL; blood transfusion; wound infection; mean hospital stay; average Apgar score). There was significant heterogeneity between the trials for the outcomes mean blood loss, operative time and mean hospital stay, making comparison difficult. However the operation duration was significantly shorter for reverse breech extraction, which may correspond with ease of delivery and therefore, the amount of tissue trauma and therefore, significantly less blood loss. Given the heterogeneity, we cannot define the amount of difference in blood loss, operative time or hospital stay however. 3. Instrument (vacuum or forceps) versus manual extraction at elective caesarean section: Two randomised trials involving 128 women were identified and included in the review. Only one trial reported maternal and infant health outcomes as prespecified in this review. This trial reported birth trauma as an outcome but there were no instances of birth trauma in either comparison group. There were no differences found in mean fall in haemoglobin (Hb) between groups (one study, 44 women, MD 0. 03, 95 % CI - 0. 53 to 0. 59), or in uterine incision extension (one study, 44 women, RR 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 13 to 3. 73). Authors’ conclusions: There is currently insufficient information available from randomised trials to support or refute the routine or selective use of tocolytic agents or instrument to facilitate infant birth at the time of difficult caesarean section. There is limited evidence that reverse breech extraction may improve maternal and fetal outcomes, though there was no difference in primary outcome of infant birth trauma. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to answer these questions. Heather Waterfall, Rosalie M Grivell, Jodie M Dod...|$|E

40|$|Innovative {{solutions}} for rapid and intelligent survey and assessment methods are required in maintenance, repair, retrofit and rebuild of enormous numbers of bridges in service throughout the world. Motivated by this need, a next-generation integrated bridge inspection system named SeeBridge is proposed. To frame the system, an Information <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manual</b> (IDM) was compiled {{to specify the}} technical components, activities and information exchanges in the SeeBridge process. The IDM supports development of the system by rigorously defining the information and data repositories that structure bridge engineers’ knowledge. The SeeBridge process is mapped, parts of the data repositories are presented and the future use of the IDM is discussed...|$|R
40|$|There are {{significant}} opportunities for Building Information Modelling (BIM) {{to address issues}} related to sustainable and energy efficient building design. While the potential benefits associated with the integration of BIM and BPA (Building Performance Analysis) have been recognised, its specifications and formats remain in their early infancy and often fail {{to live up to}} the promise of seamless interoperability at various stages of design process. This paper conducts a case study to investigate the interoperability between BIM and BPA tools, and discusses the limitations to suggest development of Information <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manual</b> (IDM) aiming to propose potential solutions for typical issues facing professionals in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new “extended Process to Product Modeling (xPPM) ” for efficient Information <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manual</b> (IDM) development. The current IDM development typically uses Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) {{to represent a}} Process Map (PM). However, the resultant Process Map is isolated from the development of Exchange Requirements (ERs) and Functional Parts (FPs). ERs and FPs specify the information required when information is exchanged between different activities. The extended Process to Product Modeling (xPPM) method is proposed to provide a tight connection between PMs, ERs, and FPs. The theoretical framework {{is based on the}} Georgia Tech Process to Product Modeling. An xPPM tool is being developed in Java to support several IDM development efforts in South Korea...|$|R
40|$|Time is an {{expensive}} resource {{and it is an}} asset to those who respect and use it efficiently. As regards information delivery services, there have been so much delay and loss of information packets in the process of delivery. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of a scheduling algorithm on the speed and reliability of information delivery. Anew decentralized scheduling algorithm and mail delivery and an example of <b>manual</b> mail <b>delivery</b> samples is presented to prove the effect of a proposed scheduling tool on information packets distribution. We useda set of mail information from a private mail bag as locations against some resource agents used in delivering the mail and we applied the algorithm on these locations to see its effects on the time of delivery. The time spam was studied from applying the algorithm and from manually sorting them. The comparism showed differences in the time duration. The research demonstrates the influence of scheduling algorithm on the delivery of mails. We concluded that handling mail procedures using a decentralized scheduling algorithm would have great effects on information management and transfer. These effects should be considered in setting up any information services especially, one with many users. Key words:information delivery, mail, scheduling packets, algorithm data sorting...|$|R
30|$|IFC {{specifies}} virtual {{representations of}} building objects {{as well as}} their attributes and relationships. It includes most types of geometry, supports many classes of attributes (Eastman, 2012). Although IFC is an open standard, its complex nature makes information retrieval from an IFC model difficult (Zhang & Issa, 2011). The richness and redundancy of the full IFC model constitute an obstacle for particular use cases, as it cannot be fully supported by many specialized applications, and useful IFC subsets should be identified. Model View Definition (MVD), the Information <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manual</b> (IDM), and Semantic Exchange Modules (SEM) concepts have been introduced to efficiently reduce the scope of the full IFC model (Zhang et al., 2013). There is the on-going research on semantically precise and reusable model views and their implementations in real projects.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry faces high demand for candidates with relevant Building Information Modelling (BIM) competency, yet higher education continues to struggle in providing such competencies. This conceptual paper explores {{the use of}} an integrated approach to implement BIM into the curriculum for undergraduates and graduates in engineering. The curriculum under study employed the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) pedagogical framework for integrating three BIM related standards and methods: the Information <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manual</b> (IDM), BIM-based Model Checker and BIM Execution Plan. As a case, this study uses the development of a 2 -year master’s program in structural engineering and building technology. We have developed a concept called iBIMe, an acronym for integrated BIM in education. This concept has the potential to enable universities to support industry demand for BIM competency within existing curricula and resources...|$|R
40|$|Since the Product-Service System (PSS) is {{accompanied}} by a paradigm shift towards the sustainability of the production process, it demands an advanced level of collaboration throughout the design and development process. This poses new challenges to enhance collaboration among cross-sectional, multi-disciplinary design teams in order to incorporate a variety of interdisciplinary services in a complex service-oriented system. Therefore, a new collaboration methodology is needed to reduce barriers to collaboration in a cross- organizational structure domain. This research work aims at highlighting the collaboration challenges that Meta-Product design teams face and also proposes a novel methodology to enhance collaboration among multi-disciplinary teams. The proposed methodology is a hybrid engineering model designed by integrating an Information <b>Delivery</b> <b>Manual</b> approach with a traditional software development process along with three interlinked collaboration services...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Postpartum {{endometritis}} is 1 - 8 % and cesarean {{section is}} one of its risk factor. Thepresent study was performed to compare the effect of manual removal and spontaneous delivery ofplacenta on post-cesarean endometritis and duration of cesarean operation. Materials and Methods: In this prospective (control–case) study, 280 pregnant women undergoingelective cesarean delivery in Shahid Sadoughi (Yezed, Iran) teaching hospital were randomly assignedto two groups: <b>manual</b> placental <b>delivery</b> (140 women) and spontaneous placental delivery (140 women). Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in both groups. The operation time concluded fromskin incision to skin repair. Endometritis was diagnosed in patients who developed clinical signs offever (> 38 °C) 24 h after delivery, supra-pubic tenderness and vaginal discharge. Data analysis wascarried out using t-test and chi square test by SPSS 15. 0. Results: The total rate of endometritis was 12. 1 % (34 women); 12 women in the spontaneousplacental delivery group (8. 6 %) and 22 women in the manual placental removal group (16 %). Thisdifference was statistically significant between two groups (P= 0. 006). There was no statisticallysignificant difference in duration of operation between two groups (P= 0. 1). Conclusion: Our finding indicate that manual removal of the placenta increased postpartumendometritis in compared with the spontaneous method of placental removal, but had no influence onthe duration of cesarean...|$|R
