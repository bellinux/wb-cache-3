25|$|A {{considerable}} part of {{the current}} knowledge on breast carcinomas is based on in vivo and in vitro studies performed with cell lines derived from breast cancers. These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating <b>material,</b> <b>free</b> of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from pleural effusions. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells {{with little or no}} contamination by fibroblasts and other tumor stroma cells.|$|E
500|$|The Director's Cut was {{described}} by Noyce as [...] "my own personal take on the <b>material,</b> <b>free</b> from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio or censorship ratings". Four minutes of film are added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes. More flashbacks are added, and the violence is amped up – for example Mike being drowned rather than shot to death. The ending is also different: in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious, and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US president had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying {{he is also a}} sleeper agent. Noyce has described this ending as [...] "an ending yet just a beginning – and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head".|$|E

2500|$|The actors {{remained}} in character {{for only a}} little while longer, the audience growing increasingly restive. In spite of their efforts, the stage hands could not snuff the fire out; instead they had inadvertently knocked burning <b>material</b> <b>free,</b> spreading fire to the rigging loft. Bits of flaming debris were beginning to fall, descending onto the box set and other properties spread around backstage. Dickinson, sitting in the center parquet, saw a thin wreath of smoke curling along {{the ceiling of the}} boxed-in scene. “Immediately afterward, one corner of the canvas ceiling was raised, and through the opening thus made I saw the flames, and saw men trying to rake the fire off the ceiling [...] with long poles.” With smoldering debris falling onto the stage, the actors fell out of character. Many in the audience, already restive, rose from their seats and commenced to crowd the aisles.|$|E

50|$|Lawrence Lessig {{describes}} permission {{culture in}} contrast with free culture.

An example Lessig cites in his book, Free Culture, is photography. In this example, if the legal environment surrounding the early stages of photography had been stricter with what constituted ownership and leaned more towards permission culture, photography would have developed in a drastically different manner and would be limited.|$|E

5000|$|When an {{electric}} field {{is applied to}} a <b>material,</b> <b>free</b> electrons will drift slowly through the material as described by the electron mobility. For low-energy electrons, faster drift implies higher friction so the drift speed tends to stabilize. For electrons with energy above about 100 keV, however, higher speeds imply lower friction. An electron with a sufficiently high energy therefore may be accelerated by {{an electric}} field to even higher and higher energies, encountering less and less friction as it accelerates. Such an electron {{is described as a}} [...] "runaway." ...|$|E

These students usually stayed with him for many years, learning the various branches of Islamic knowledge, then return to their lands. Hundreds of his students have become savants of Islamic knowledge and spirituality in their own countries, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, and Yemen. After returning from the Al-Azhar University he was an appointed professor of Sharia at the Umm al-Qura University in Mecca, where he taught from 1970. In 1971, after his father’s death, the scholars of Mecca asked him to accept his father’s position as a teacher in the Masjid al-Haram, which he did. Thus, {{he sat on the}} Chair from which his family had taught for more than century. He also taught in the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina occasionally. His lessons were the largest attended lessons in the Two Masjids.
