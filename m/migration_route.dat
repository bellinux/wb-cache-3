5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to teach a <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> to a flock of birds, for example in re-introduction schemes. After a trial with Canada geese Branta canadensis, microlight aircraft {{were used in the}} US to teach safe migration routes to reintroduced whooping cranes Grus americana.|$|E
5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the <b>migration</b> <b>route.</b> This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|Often, the <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> of {{a long-distance}} migrator bird doesn't follow a {{straight}} line between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E

5|$|Spain {{contains}} {{several important}} areas—Monfragüe National Park, Sierra de Gredos Regional Park, National Hunting Reserve in Cíjara, Natural Park of the Sierra Hornachuelos and Doñana National Park—where black storks stop {{over on the}} western <b>migration</b> <b>route.</b> Pesticide use has threatened birdlife in nearby Doñana.

5|$|The area {{contains}} multiple {{species of}} wildlife, {{both in the}} federal lands {{at the southern end}} of the peninsula (managed in part as an ecological reserve) and in the developed suburban areas. Mammals include raccoons, skunks, possums, bats, rabbits, California ground squirrels, gray foxes, and occasional coyotes. More than 300 species of birds have been observed in Point Loma, which lies on the Pacific Flyway <b>migration</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, the {{corridor}} {{of what is}} now MD194 was the HanoverFrederick portion of the Monocacy Road, a <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> that connected Philadelphia and Winchester, Virginia via York, Frederick, Boonsboro, and Williamsport. The Frederick County portion of the highway later became the path of a pair of turnpikes. The Woodsboro and Double Pipe Creek Turnpike connected the namesake town and creek; the Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike extended from Woodsboro south to the junction with the Liberty and Frederick Turnpike in Ceresville. The two turnpikes issuing from Ceresville were connected to Frederick by the Frederick and Woodsboro Turnpike. The Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike was the last privately maintained toll road in Maryland when it was purchased by the Maryland State Roads Commission, the predecessor to the Maryland State Highway Administration, in 1921.|$|E

5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go about their business without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{park and}} the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild {{herbivore}} populations. The plains {{to the south of}} the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{patterns}} play {{a crucial}} role in determining the <b>migration</b> <b>route.</b> Birds like to travel so that the temperature, pressure and humidity work with the tailwinds. Strong winds can blow birds off of their regular <b>migration</b> <b>route.</b> For example, the effects of a large storm lead to a higher presence of the white-rumped sandpiper on the King George Islands.|$|E

25|$|The {{indigenous}} Papuan {{people of}} New Guinea have dark skin pigmentation and have inhabited {{the island for}} at least 40,000 years. Due to their similar phenotype {{and the location of}} New Guinea being in the <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> taken by Indigenous Australians, it was generally believed that Papuans and Aboriginal Australians shared a common origin. However, a 1999 study failed to find clear indications of a single shared genetic origin between the two populations, suggesting multiple waves of migration into Sahul with distinct ancestries.|$|E
25|$|The Tibeto-Burmans in Southeast Asia {{primarily}} took a <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> {{from western}} China, expanding southward into the Himalayas of Tibet, and southeast into Burma.

The Sino-Tibetan, Hmong–Mien, Tai, and Austronesian ethnicities all have a high incidence of Y-DNA haplogroup O, which suggests a common ancestral ethnicity along the lines of 35,000 years ago in an area within the borders of the present-day Peoples Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|After the {{breeding}} season, in March and April, birds breeding in Australia begin to migrate northwards to their wintering grounds in New Guinea and Indonesia. Birds breeding in New South Wales begin leaving earlier, in February and March. The <b>migration</b> <b>route</b> {{is across the}} Torres Strait, travelling individually or in small groups. From New Guinea they migrate across the nearby islands as far as Timor and the Moluccas. It is not known if the species breeds in New Guinea, as some birds are present there all year.
