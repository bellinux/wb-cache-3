5|$|A large <b>meteorite</b> fell near Buena Vista on March28, 1859, {{causing some}} panic in the area. The {{site of the}} impact {{and a part of}} the <b>meteorite</b> have been preserved.|$|E
5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers that Dr. Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the <b>meteorite</b> to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the <b>meteorite</b> from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the <b>meteorite</b> crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the <b>meteorite</b> by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{proposed}} that carbonate globules found in <b>meteorite</b> ALH84001, which {{is thought to have}} originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the <b>meteorite</b> was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15 million years ago. This proposal has been met with skepticism, and an exclusively inorganic origin for the shapes has been proposed.|$|E
40|$|This site {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} <b>meteorites,</b> stony or metallic bodies that fall to the Earth from space. Topics include what happens during their flight to Earth; types of <b>meteorites,</b> such as stony <b>meteorites</b> (chondrites and achondrites), stony-iron <b>meteorites,</b> and iron meteorites; and instructions for testing rocks that are suspected to be <b>meteorites.</b> There is also an extensive list of books on <b>meteorites,</b> impact craters, comets and asteroids, <b>meteorites</b> in history, and a few books about <b>meteorites</b> for children. Educational levels: Middle school, High school, Undergraduate lower division...|$|R
25|$|<b>Meteorites</b> have {{traditionally}} been divided into three broad categories: stony <b>meteorites</b> are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron <b>meteorites</b> that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and, stony-iron <b>meteorites</b> that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide <b>meteorites</b> into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. <b>Meteorites</b> smaller than 2mm are classified as micrometeorites. Extraterrestrial <b>meteorites</b> are such objects that have impacted other celestial bodies, {{whether or not they}} have passed through an atmosphere. They have been found on the Moon and Mars.|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of Antarctic <b>meteorites</b> of Lunar and perhaps Martian origin, {{belongs to the}} most important discoveries in planetology during the last years. There is such a wealth of new information on differentiated and undifferentiated planetary bodies deduced from Antarctic <b>meteorites</b> that it is at present not possible to even qualitatively foresee the impact that these <b>meteorites</b> {{will have on the}} understanding of the formation and differentiation of large and small planets in the solar system. Martian <b>meteorites,</b> Lunar <b>meteorites,</b> <b>meteorites</b> from the parent body of basaltic achondrites, and chrondritic <b>meteorites</b> are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{ruled out}} radiation {{as the cause}} of the illness. Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute stated that the medical conditions could have been caused by sulfur, arsenic or other toxins that may have melted in the extreme heat produced by the <b>meteorite</b> strike. Some unnamed Peruvian sources stated soon after the event occurred that it was indeed a <b>meteorite.</b> Later on 18 September, a Peruvian vulcanologist stated that the impact was caused by a chondrite <b>meteorite</b> arrival.|$|E
5|$|A {{report from}} three geologists at Peru's Geophysics Institute was {{released}} on Thursday 20 September. Astrophysicist Jose Ishitsuka confirmed {{that there had been}} a <b>meteorite</b> strike.|$|E
5|$|Close to the Peary, the Aurora {{receives}} an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help, but inquiries by Tintin expose that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the Peary expedition {{has reached the}} <b>meteorite</b> but not yet claimed it. While the Peary crew rows to the <b>meteorite,</b> Tintin uses the Auroras seaplane to parachute onto the <b>meteorite</b> and plant the expedition's flag. Tintin makes camp while the Auroras engines are repaired after developing trouble. The next day he discovers that Phostlite accelerates growth, and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly, and Tintin is menaced by a giant spider that escaped from his lunch box, and immense, explosive mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden seaquake shakes the <b>meteorite</b> to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the Aurora {{with a piece of}} Phostlite. Thereafter Bohlwinkel learns that he is expected to be tried for his crimes. As the Aurora returns home, Captain Haddock steers the ship toward land to refuel not with oil, but with whiskey.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meteorites</b> have {{traditionally}} been divided into three broad categories: stony <b>meteorites</b> are rocks, mainly composed of silicate minerals; iron <b>meteorites</b> that are largely composed of metallic iron-nickel; and, stony-iron <b>meteorites</b> that contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material. Modern classification schemes divide <b>meteorites</b> into groups according to their structure, chemical and isotopic composition and mineralogy. <b>Meteorites</b> smaller than 2 mm are classified as micrometeorites.

They have been found on the Moon and Mars.|$|R
50|$|Stony-iron <b>meteorites</b> or siderolites are <b>meteorites</b> that {{consist of}} nearly equal parts of {{meteoric}} iron and silicates. This distinguishes {{them from the}} stony <b>meteorites,</b> that are mostly silicates, and the iron <b>meteorites,</b> that are mostly meteoric iron.|$|R
40|$|Antarctic <b>meteorites</b> {{differ from}} <b>meteorites</b> fallen {{in other places}} in their mean {{terrestrial}} ages. Boeckl estimated the terrestrial half-life for the disintegration of stone <b>meteorites</b> by weathering under the climatic conditions of the Western United States to be about 3600 years. Antarctic <b>meteorites,</b> however, have terrestrial ages up to 70000 years, indicating larger weathering half-lives. The terrestrial ages of <b>meteorites</b> are determined by their concentration of cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides with suitable half-lives (C- 14, Al- 26, and Cl- 36). These radionuclides have yielded reliable ages for the Antarctic <b>meteorites.</b> The distribution of terrestrial ages of Allan Hills and Yamato <b>meteorites</b> are examined...|$|R
5|$|In 2013, a {{hypothesis}} suggested {{it was possible}} that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a <b>meteorite</b> around 3 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of <b>meteorite</b> and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo <b>meteorite</b> in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of <b>meteorite</b> types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the <b>meteorite</b> hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a <b>meteorite</b> represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
50|$|IVB <b>meteorites</b> are a {{group of}} ataxite iron <b>meteorites</b> {{classified}} as achondrites. The IVB group has the most extreme chemical compositions of all iron <b>meteorites,</b> meaning that examples of the group are depleted in volatile elements and enriched in refractory elements compared to other iron <b>meteorites.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lunar <b>meteorites</b> are <b>meteorites</b> that {{originated}} from the Moon.|$|R
50|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} (>90%) of the <b>meteorites</b> found are ordinary chondrites, ANSMET has provided many rare <b>meteorites,</b> including many of the known lunar and martian <b>meteorites</b> such as ALH84001.|$|R
5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a <b>meteorite</b> that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a <b>meteorite</b> crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the <b>meteorite,</b> they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
5|$|A non-supercharged {{version of}} the Merlin using a larger {{proportion}} of steel and iron components was produced for use in tanks. This engine, the Rolls-Royce Meteor, in turn led to the smaller Rolls-Royce <b>Meteorite.</b> In 1943, further Meteor development was handed over to Rover, in exchange for Rover's gas turbine interests.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} happened, and 100 to 200 people who got near to the <b>meteorite</b> crater soon {{reported}} feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to stop drinking from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the <b>meteorite</b> impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E
50|$|Troilite is {{regularly}} found in Martian <b>meteorites</b> (i.e. those originating from Mars). Similar to the Moon's surface and <b>meteorites,</b> {{the fraction of}} troilite in Martian <b>meteorites</b> is close to 1%.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the Geochron was mainly attributed to Clair Cameron Patterson’s application of Pb-Pb dating on <b>meteorites</b> in 1956. The Pb ratios of three stony and two iron <b>meteorites</b> were measured. The dating of <b>meteorites</b> would then help Patterson in determining not only the age of these <b>meteorites</b> but also the age of Earth’s formation. By dating <b>meteorites</b> Patterson was directly dating the age of various planetesimals. Assuming the process of elemental differentiation is identical on Earth {{as it is on}} other planets, the core of these planetesimals would be depleted of uranium and thorium, while the crust and mantle would contain higher U/Pb ratios. As planetesimals collided, various fragments were scattered and produced <b>meteorites.</b> Iron <b>meteorites</b> were identified as pieces of the core, while stony <b>meteorites</b> were segments of the mantle and crustal units of these various planetesimals.|$|R
40|$|Comets {{have been}} often {{considered}} as {{potential sources of}} <b>meteorites</b> [e. g., 1], {{but there are no}} <b>meteorites</b> currently believed to have come from comets. Recent developments, including the identification of comet-asteroid transition objects, new information on the collisional history of Jupiter-Family comets, and on the composition of cometary solids, provide new insights into the topic of cometary <b>meteorites.</b> We have revisited this question [2] and conclude that comets do indeed yield <b>meteorites,</b> which have either not been found or recognized. Here, we will summarize the arguments that we should have comets from <b>meteorites,</b> and consider the expected characteristics of cometary <b>meteorites...</b>|$|R
5|$|Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9 {{billion years}} ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few <b>meteorite</b> impact craters, but are {{otherwise}} quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a <b>meteorite</b> crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The <b>meteorite</b> brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V {{features}} five player characters, {{though only}} four of which are playable at a given time. Bartz Klauser is a traveling adventurer who becomes involved in the story when he investigates {{the site of a}} <b>meteorite</b> strike. Lenna Charlotte Tycoon is a princess of Tycoon who follows her father to investigate the Wind Shrine's Crystal. Early on, Bartz finds her unconscious and saves her from goblins. Galuf Doe is a mysterious old man who was discovered unconscious near the <b>meteorite</b> with a case of amnesia. Faris Scherwiz is a pirate captain who captures Bartz, Lenna, and Galuf when they try to steal her ship; she is revealed to be Sarisa Scherwill Tycoon in disguise. Krile Mayer Baldesion is the granddaughter of Galuf who journeys with him to the planet and receives his abilities.|$|E
50|$|Iron <b>meteorites</b> are <b>meteorites</b> that consist {{overwhelmingly}} of an iron-nickel alloy {{known as}} meteoric iron that usually {{consists of two}} mineral phases: kamacite and taenite. Iron <b>meteorites</b> originate from planetary cores of planetesimals.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} a hand-held energy dispersive XRF spectrometer for the preliminary classification of non-chondritic differentiated <b>meteorites.</b> The studied achondrites include nine lunar <b>meteorites,</b> seventeen Martian <b>meteorites,</b> five angrites and eighteen <b>meteorites</b> from asteroid 4 Vesta. Analytical precision and accuracy was tested on thirty-nine terrestrial igneous rock slabs {{with a wide range}} of composition. Replicate analyses, performed on the studied <b>meteorites,</b> show that Fe/Mn values together with Si and Ca/K ratio can be used in the discrimination of different achondrite groups. Fusion crust's Fe/Mn values of <b>meteorites</b> from Vesta and Mars are indistinguishable from those of the interior implying that even measurements on the fusion-crusted external surface could be sufficient to pigeonhole non-chondritic <b>meteorites.</b> Hand-held energy dispersive XRF spectrometer is a non-destructive but very effective technique for preliminary classification of achondrites in the field and in laboratory and for the identification of mislabelled <b>meteorites</b> in museum collections...|$|R
5000|$|ANSMET (Antarctic Search for <b>Meteorites)</b> is {{a program}} funded by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation that looks for <b>meteorites</b> in the Transantarctic Mountains. This {{geographical}} area serves as a collection point for <b>meteorites</b> that have originally fallen on the extensive high-altitude ice fields throughout Antarctica. Such <b>meteorites</b> are quickly covered by subsequent snowfall and begin a centuries-long journey traveling [...] "downhill" [...] across the Antarctic continent while embedded in a vast sheet of flowing ice. Portions of such flowing ice can be halted by natural barriers such as the Transantarctic Mountains. Subsequent wind erosion of the motionless ice brings trapped <b>meteorites</b> {{back to the surface}} once more where they may be collected. This process concentrates <b>meteorites</b> in a few specific areas to much higher concentrations than they are normally found everywhere else. The contrast of the dark <b>meteorites</b> against the white snow, and lack of terrestrial rocks on the ice, makes such <b>meteorites</b> relatively easy to find. However, the vast majority of such ice-embedded <b>meteorites</b> eventually slide undiscovered into the ocean.|$|R
5|$|In 2008 the ejected {{material}} from a <b>meteorite</b> impact crater was discovered near Ullapool in Wester Ross. Preserved within sedimentary layers of sandstone, {{this is the}} largest known bolide impact from what are now the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Meteorites from Antarctica are an {{important}} area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets. The first <b>meteorite</b> was found in 1912, and named the Adelie Land <b>meteorite.</b> In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.|$|E
5|$|Other genre {{productions}} {{that have}} been compared with the serial include the 1970 Doctor Who story Spearhead from Space. This serial features an alien entity falling to Earth in a <b>meteorite</b> shower; a factory taken over {{for the growth of}} the alien creature, and governmental institutions being infiltrated by servants of the aliens.|$|E
25|$|A few <b>meteorites</b> {{were found}} in Antarctica between 1912 and 1964. In 1969, the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition found nine <b>meteorites</b> on a blue ice field near the Yamato Mountains. With this discovery, came the {{realization}} that movement of ice sheets might act to concentrate <b>meteorites</b> in certain areas. After a dozen other specimens {{were found in}} the same place in 1973, a Japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated to the search for <b>meteorites.</b> This team recovered nearly 700 <b>meteorites.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Oman {{is one of}} {{the rare}} places on Earth where a number of lunar <b>meteorites</b> have been found. The largest strewn field of <b>meteorites</b> in the country is {{situated}} in Jiddat al-Harasis. According to the Meteoritical Bulletin of the International Society for <b>Meteorites</b> and Planetary Science there are 3,116 recorded <b>meteorites</b> from Oman out of which 1,385 are in Jiddat al-Harasis area; 41 approved <b>meteorites</b> are classified as Lunar <b>meteorites.</b> The [...] "Jiddat al Harasis 348" [...] sample found in 2006, was recovered at Al Wusta in Jiddat weighing 18.4 g, a Lunar feldspathic fragmental breccia.
