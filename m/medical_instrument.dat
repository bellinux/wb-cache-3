5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a <b>medical</b> <b>instrument.</b> This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{topic is}} {{identification}} of <b>medical</b> <b>instruments</b> and equipment using the images preserved in Serbian medieval painting. This topic {{has not been}} the subject of special study in the Serbian science. <b>Medical</b> <b>instruments</b> and equipment make an integral part of iconography of saint physicians. The following <b>medical</b> <b>instruments</b> have been displayed: knives, probes, spoons, tweezers, as well as various carrying boxes for equipment (square-like and cylindrical) and cases, and glass vessels for medical lubricants. Identification has been carried out owing primarily to late Roman remains of <b>medical</b> <b>instruments</b> and equipment, while such remains originating from Byzantine period are very rare.
