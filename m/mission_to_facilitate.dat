25|$|The highest {{posts in}} the newly {{established}} Bulgarian Church were held by Byzantines who preached in Greek language. Aware of the dangers that the spiritual dependency on the Byzantine Empire could pose for Bulgaria's independence, BorisI was determined to ensure {{the autonomy of the}} Bulgarian Church under a Patriarch. Since the Byzantines were reluctant to grant any concessions Boris I took advantage on the ongoing rivalry between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Papacy in Rome in order to prevent either of them from exerting influence in his lands through religion. In 866 he sent a delegation to Rome under the high-ranking official Peter declaring his desire to accept Christianity in accordance with the Western rites along with 115 questions to Pope Nicholas I. The Pope's detailed answers to BorisI's questions were delivered by two bishops heading a <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> the conversion of the Bulgarian people. However, neither NicolasI nor his successor Adrian II agreed to recognize an autonomous Bulgarian Church, which cooled the relations between the two sides. Bulgaria's shift towards Rome on the other hand, made the Byzantines much more conciliatory. In 870, at the Fourth Council of Constantinople, the Bulgarian Church was recognized as an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church under the supreme direction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E

In 1999, Hari Shankar Vyas promoted a mission which provided computer training in Hindi. Multilingual computer training programmes were launched across North India to encourage the use of Indian languages in IT.

40|$|Abstract: With CKS International Airport {{remains one}} the {{important}} gateways to Taiwan, the CKS International Airport rail link system {{would serve as}} a most crucial mass transportation tool that would poise to excel the competitiveness of the international airport and its adjacent metropolises. In light of which, how best to locate an optimal operating organization that offers a sustainable management would emerge as a pressing concern. Taking into account urban transit and airport rail link service, the study, upon analyzing using the FAHP and TOPSIS methods, has chosen the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit Corporate alternative as the optimized alternative, together with the alternative of setting up a new private-run company as the second best alternative. As derived from analyses conducting on various decision-making groups, an operator with actual transportation operations would emerge as a crucial determining factor to become the future airport rail link operator. The study findings are not only intended as references to government departments but also to recommend the government to expeditiously finalize the operator as an urgent <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> subsequent implementation in light of the complexity in the rail system’s interfacing logistical implementation...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{need to be}} able to take {{advantage}} of the torrents of data being produced by computational tools, making it imperative that libraries contribute to data literacy as part of their <b>mission</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> knowledge creation and innovation among their patrons. However, determining what data services should be and accessing the effectiveness of those services are new challenges. In order to offer meaningful, effective services and resources, librarians must assess how their patrons value data literacy skills and the note the language researchers use in discussing these issues. Without this, data librarians will be unable to adequately address the needs of their communities. Instruments currently exist to examine data literacy and data curation practices in academic settings. However, the application of such instruments in biomedical research settings is cumbersome [...] often times requiring lengthy interviews and worksheets that take many hours and multiple meetings to administer. Additionally, these tools do not aim to probe for information about socio-technical issues impacting data practices. Furthermore, no validated protocols yet exist that overtly address how perceptions and data practices among members of research teams conflict. Therefore, a new assessment tool was developed by the authors. This interview guide, is being administered at Weill Cornell Medical College to enable rapid assessment of perceptions surrounding data literacy competencies, socio-technical issues impacting data management practices, and data-related language used among biomedical research teams...|$|E
