5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E

5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E

Phineas leaves a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls—in the present—immediately spot the footprint and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize a T. rex returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{elements}} of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously {{referred to as a}} film noir, a horror film, a Künstlerroman, and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Despite disagreement over certain details of the work, Barton Fink continues to be positively received, with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman among its admirers.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E
5|$|On that day, Sihanouk was in Moscow meeting Soviet foreign {{minister}} Alexei Kosygin, {{who broke the}} news to him. From Moscow, Sihanouk flew to Beijing, where he was received by Zhou. Zhou arranged for the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong to fly to Beijing from Hanoi and meet with Sihanouk. Both Zhou and Dong encouraged Sihanouk to rebel against Lon Nol and promised him military and financial support. On 23March 1970, Sihanouk announced the formation of his resistance movement, the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK). He encouraged the Cambodian populace to join him and fight against Lon Nol's government. Khmer Rouge soldiers broadcast Sihanouk's <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cambodian countryside, which roused demonstrations rooting for his cause that were brutally suppressed by Lon Nol's troops. Sometime later, on 5May 1970, Sihanouk announced {{the formation of a}} government-in-exile known as the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK), leading Communist countries including China, North Vietnam, and North Korea to break relations with the Lon Nol regime. In Phnom Penh, a military trial convened on 2July 1970, whereby Sihanouk was charged with treason and corruption in his capacity as Head of State. After a three-day trial, the judges ruled Sihanouk guilty of both charges and sentenced to him death in absentia on 5July 1970.|$|E

25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E

25|$|In cryptography, a blind {{signature}}, as {{invented by}} David Chaum in 1983, {{is a form}} of digital signature in which the content of a message is disguised before it is signed.

Blind signatures are typically employed in privacy-related protocols where the signer and message author are different parties. Examples include cryptographic election systems and digital cash schemes.|$|E

25|$|The musical {{genre of}} Namdev's {{literary}} works {{was a form}} of Prabandha – itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is the music that dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual <b>message</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> words has a central role, and the structure resonates with the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units).|$|E
