40|$|In partial {{fulfilment}} of the National Diploma in Horticulture of the Royal New Zealand Institute of Horticulture. The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of anhydrous and aqua ammonia as <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. Anhydrous and aqua ammonia are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and usage of the various forms, particularly anhydrous and aqua ammonia. Also dealt with is the history of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that anhydrous and aqua ammonia fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas. Part III deals with the position in New Zealand. The types of nitrogen fertilisers used and the economic aspects of their usage. Prospects for anhydrous and aqua ammonia in New Zealand are looked at. In conclusion the general findings are summarised and recommendations are made with a view to future needs in New Zealand for anhydrous and aqua ammonia. This thesis attempts to tentatively answer the question, "Is there a place for anhydrous and aqua ammonia fertiliser in New Zealand, and what action should be taken to examine this subject more closely"...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} of nitrogen-fixing (NF) bacteria {{to form a}} symbiotic relationship with leguminous plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen has been exploited {{in the field to}} meet the nitrogen requirement of the latter. This phenom-enon provides an alternative {{to the use of the}} <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> whose excessive and imbalanced use over the decades has contributed to green house emission (N 2 O) and underground water leaching. Recently, it was observed that non-leguminous plants like rice, sugarcane, wheat and maize form an extended niche for various species of NF bacteria. These bacteria thrive within the plant, successfully colonizing roots, stems and leaves. During the association, the invading bacteria benefit the acquired host with a marked increase in plant growth, vigor and yield. With increasing population, the demand of non-leguminous plant products is growing. In this regard, the richness of NF flora within non-leguminous plants and extent of their interaction with the host definitely shows a ray of hope in developing an ecofriendly alternative to the <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> In this review, we have discussed the association of NF bacteria with various non-leguminous plants emphasizing on their potential to promote host plant growth and yield. In addition, plant growth-promoting traits observed in these NF bacteria and their mode of interaction with the host plant have been described briefly...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} effects of green cane harvesting with trash retention, compared with burning, on soil fertility were evaluated {{using data from the}} long-term trash management trial at Mount Edgecombe (BT 1). Total and potentially mineralisable soil N were greater under green cane harvesting than burning in the surface 0 - 10 cm layer of soil. As expected, fertiliser applications induced increases in extractable soil P and also some accumulation in soil organic P (particularly under trash retention). Both exchangeable and non-exchangeable soil K concentrations were higher in fertilised than non-fertilised treatments. Exchangeable K concentrations were also increased markedly by trash retention reflecting the large amounts of K that are returned in trash and demonstrating their positive effect on K fertility. Soil pH was lowered considerably by fertiliser applications and this effect was evident to 30 cm. Mean pH to a depth of 20 cm was 6. 0 for unfertilised plots and 5. 4 for those fertilised. Fertiliser induced acidification is attributed to annual applications of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> at a rate of 140 kg N/ha. Trash retention also tended to result in a decline in pH due to the greater amount of N cycling in the system.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of methane}} by methane-oxidising microorganisms {{is an important}} link in the global methane budget. Oxic soils are a net sink while wetland soils are a net source of atmospheric methane. It has generally been accepted that the consumption of methane in upland as well as lowland systems is inhibited by <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> additions. Hence, <b>mineral</b> nitrogen (i. e. ammonium/nitrate) has conceptually been treated as a component {{with the potential to}} enhance emission of methane from soils and sediments to the atmosphere, and results from numerous studies have been interpreted as such. Recently, ammonium-based fertilisation was demonstrated to stimulate methane consumption in rice paddies. Growth and activity of methane-consuming bacteria in microcosms as well as in natural rice paddies was N limited. Analysing the available literature revealed that indications for N limitation of methane consumption have been reported in a variety of lowland soils, upland soils, and sediments. Obviously, depriving methane-oxidising bacteria of a suitable source of N hampers their growth and activity. However, an almost instantaneous link between the presence of mineral nitrogen (i. e. ammonium, nitrate) and methane-oxidising activity, as found in rice soils and culture experiments, requires an alternative explanation. We propose that switching from mineral N assimilation to the fixation of molecular nitrogen may explain this phenomenon. However, there is as yet no experimental evidence for any mechanism of instantaneous stimulation, since most studies have assumed that <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is inhibitory of methane oxidation in soils and have focused only on this aspect. Nitrogen as essential factor on the sink side of the global methane budget has been neglected, leading to erroneous interpretation of methane emission dynamics, especially from wetland environments. The purpose of this minireview is to summarise and balance the data on the regulatory role of nitrogen in the consumption of methane by soils and sediments, and thereby stimulate the scientific community to embark on experiments to close the existing gap in knowledge.

Even after this time many growers still insist that pineapples can be grown without fertilisation on virgin soils. As the available virgin soil decreased, however, so the interest in fertiliser application increased.

The available advisory literature by le Roux (1951), Malan (1954) and Lewcock (1956) were based on overseas experience.

The usual application rate is between 55 and 110 kg/ha P and on poorer sites several dressings are required during the first rotation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} series of experiments designed to understand the potential anthelmintic properties of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> for control of gastrointestinal parasites. Anthelmintic administration is no longer considered the sole method for control of gastrointestinal parasites. Due to the increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance, alternative methods of parasite control are required. <b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> produce a number of potentially toxic compounds during their conversion to plant available forms, {{and there are some}} reports they may have anthelmintic properties, although there is a paucity of specific evidence. Therefore, this series of experiments investigated the effects of nitrogen-containing fertilisers on Trichostrongylus colubriformis eggs hatching and larval development. Experiment one (Chapter 3) consisted of topical application of either water or urea (Flow-Fert N, 20 % concentration) onto 100 g of faeces. The total number of larvae collected per 100 g of faeces was 25, 600 and 800 for water and urea respectively, a 97 % reduction in larvae following treatment with urea. Visual assessment of the faeces showed a white fungus growing on the faeces sprayed with water that was not present on the faeces sprayed with urea. The second experiment (Chapter 4) involved immersing T. colubriformis eggs in pH solutions ranging in whole number increments from 4 to 11, and in solutions of 20 % urea (pH of 8). pH had a significant effect on egg hatching at pH less than 6 (P< 0. 001), whilst above pH 6 there was no effect on egg hatching. Urea solutions suppressed 90 %+ of the eggs from hatching indicating that the effect on egg hatching was independent of pH. Experiment three (Chapter 5) determined the optimum concentration of urea required to inhibit eggs from hatching. T. colubriformis eggs were immersed in solutions of urea at various concentrations (1 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, 10 %, 20 %, 50 %). There was a significant effect of urea concentration on egg hatching with hatching decreasing as urea concentrations increased with less than 10 % of eggs hatching in concentrations greater than 10 %. Optimum concentrations estimated using an LD 90 and ROC analysis were determined to be 19. 6 % and 5. 5 %, respectively. The fourth experiment (Chapter 6) compared five nitrogen-containing fertilisers: urea (46 - 0 - 0 - 0), sulphate of ammonia (21 - 0 - 0 - 24), potato fertiliser (15 - 10 - 10 - 8), potassium nitrate (13 - 0 - 44 - 0) and nitrophoska blue (12 - 5. 2 - 14 - 0) at various concentrations (1 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 50 %) and their effects on eggs hatching. There was a fertiliser type X concentration interaction with all fertilisers, at concentrations greater than 10 % inhibiting eggs from hatching to less than 6 % (P< 0. 001). At a concentration of 1 %, sulphate of ammonia and potassium nitrate had the strongest effect on eggs hatched, viz 24 % and 48 %, respectively, in comparison with 90 % in the control. Regression analysis credited the variation in percentage of eggs hatched could be explained by both nitrogen percentage and electrical conductivity, but not phosphorous, potassium, sulphur levels or pH. The final experiment (Chapter 7) considered the implications of four of the fertilisers and whether exposure to the fertilisers was reversible. Following 24 hours of immersion in the solution, and a further 24 hours of incubation in water, no eggs had hatched under any of the fertilisers (20 % concentration), indicating a strong, irreversible effect on the eggs (P< 0. 001). <b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> have the potential to control ruminant GINs outside of the host, as an alternative to anthelmintics.

Soil sampling methods and interpretation of soil test results are outlined. Prescriptions based on soil test ratings have generally helped to maintain satisfactory growth in successive crops, while preventing cumulative excesses which could also adversely affect nursery stock.

We compute the nitrogen loss through leaching/runoff into the groundwater based on the nitrogen balance and the greenhouse gases emissions as a function of applied nitrogen and the number of beef cattle. We consider two scenarios for the non-accession and accession case, produced a market outlook throughout the year 2011 based on assumptions regarding full trade liberalisation between the EU and Romania and income change in Romania and analysed the impact on environment. The increase in beef imports in the accession scenario at a higher rate than in the baseline scenario corresponds to a decrease in the groundwater and air pollution caused by cattle production. agricultural trade, externalities, partial equilibrium model, Romania, Agricultural and Food Policy, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

Individuals exposed to the herbicide hatched at a larger size than controls, and this effect was especially clear when the fertiliser {{was added to the}} water. The absence of pollutant-related mortality or severe sublethal effects is in agreement with most studies indicating a high tolerance of amphibian embryos to agrochemicals. However, further research considering other life stages and additional natural factors (i. e., predators, food availability) is needed to estimate the ecological impact of chemical mixtures on C. lusitanica.

40|$|Foliage {{samples were}} {{collected}} regularly {{over a period of}} 13 months from three treatments of a nitrogen fertiliser trial established in 3 -year-old Eucalyptus fastigata Deane et Maiden on a yellow-brown pumice soil in Kaingaroa Forest. Treatments sampled were (1) control (no fertiliser), (2) 250 kg urea/ha, and (3) 500 kg urea/ha; (1) and (2) were sampled each month, and (3.) every third ·month. The first collection was made just before treatments were imposed in early November (spring). Samples were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. Both urea treatments gave a positive response in foliar nitrogen concentration. For Treatment (2) this response was shortlived (c. 10 months) and reached a peak about 2 months after treatment (2. 34 : % N compared with 1. 15 % N for control). Although data for (3.) are incomplete, it seems that the response in foliar nitrogen was greater than for (2) but still did not last beyond a year. <b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> significantly increased the N: P ratio in foliage for the 11 months following treatment. A large growth response to applied nitrogen, observed in the season following treatment, indicates that the change in N-P balance was beneficial. Nutrient concentrations in the foliage of untreated trees varied markedly with season. Fluctuations were relatively small for zinc, iron, nitrogen, and copper; intermediate for magnesium, boron, and potassium; and large for calcium, phos~horus, and manganese...|$|R
40|$|From a {{study of}} the {{variation}} of nitrates in the soil known as terra roxa misturada (mixed purple soil), the following conclusions were drawn : a) The nitrate content of this soil reveals a periodic variation through the year. The same kind of variation is expected in the majority of S. Paulo soils, because the climate, with minor exceptions, is fairly uniform over the State. b) As nitrification proceeds at a higher rate in the hot wet (September-May) than in the cool dry season (May-September), nitrates accumulate in the soil during the first period and disappear in the second. However, as an exception to the above rule, there appeared to be a fall in nitrates during December. This may have been due, either to leaching by rain, or to absorption by weeds, then in their growing period in the experimental fields. Since inorganic <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> do not generally give good results in the State of S. Paulo, when applied {{at the beginning of the}} rainy season, it is logical to attribute the decrease in nitrogen content to leaching, although the investigation did not lead to a conclusive explanation. c) This study did not support the view of an upward migration of salts in our soils during the dry months, since a steady level of nitrate content was observed during this period. d) Although the author was able to establish an association between nitrate losses and rainfall, it was not possible to determine the relation quantitatively...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{responses}} of bean are often {{limited by the}} nitrogen deficiency, being the most common limiting factor {{for the growth of}} the plants. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is often considered as a poor N 2 -fixing legume. Thus, it is often cultivated with a complement of <b>mineral</b> <b>nitrogenous</b> fertilization to correct this deficiency and to raise the yields. The symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) provides an ecologically acceptable alternative to the high applications of nitrogenous fertilizers, especially in Europe, and an economic alternative to the limited access to these fertilizers in the developing countries. The objectives of the work are i) to study the genotypic diversity represented by local populations of bean, ii) to identify those populations which can be useful to improve SNF potential as well as iii) to determine the degree of genetic diversity of the native populations of rhizobia that nodulate P. vulgaris in the soils of Galicia and their potential to fix N 2 with local populations of bean.

40|$|Without {{the input}} of {{fertiliser}} nitrogen {{it is estimated that}} only about half of the current global population can be supplied with sufficient food energy and protein. The anticipated increase in the population to 2050 will increase the dependency on fertiliser inputs. The paper examines the different potential sources of energy and hydrogen required for this essential fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into plant-available <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and concludes that methane from natural gas is clearly the most suitable source. In the absence of a cost-effective alternative source of hydrogen it is recommended that an on-going requirement for methane is acknowledged and that consideration be given to strategic reserves for the production of food. Phosphorus is also an essential and unsubstitutable nutrient for plants and animals, but while the global reserves of atmospheric nitrogen are effectively unlimited, the reserves of phosphate rock are finite. Recent estimates of the reserve suggest that at the current rate of use this resource will become exhausted within some hundreds of years. The annual increment of phosphorus contained in the human population is estimated to be in the order of 1 Mt/yr, which is a small proportion of the quantity mined. There is a clear requirement to ensure that phosphorus is recycled to a large extent, so that the rate of exhaustion of the reserves of phosphate rock is significantly reduced. Legislation relating to the management of phosphorus appears entirely associated with its potential to upset natural ecosystems, with apparently no regulations yet requiring the efficient use and reuse of a scarce resource.

40|$|<b>Nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> {{are under}} {{consideration}} for promoting {{the growth of}} nursery-reared hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn) seedlings in the establishment phase of second rotation (2 R) plantations. Using 15 N-labelled fertilisers, we investigated the effect of different forms (ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and urea) and rates of application (0, 150 and 300 mg N kg- 1 dried soil) of fertilisers on the growth, 15 N recovery and carbon isotope composition (d 13 C) of hoop pine seedlings in a 12 -month glasshouse trial in southeast Queensland, Australia. The 15 N-labelled fertilisers were applied to nursery-reared hoop pine seedlings, which were then grown in pots, containing ca. 1. 2 kg dried soil, under well watered conditions for 12 months. Four seedlings from each treatment were harvested at 4 -month intervals, divided into roots, stem and foliage, with a further subdivision for new and old foliage, and then analysed for 15 N, total N, d 13 C and total C. There was no significant response in the seedling growth to the form or rate of application of nitrogen (N) fertiliser within the 12 -month period, indicating that the seedlings did not experience N deficiency when grown on second rotation hoop pine soils. While the combined 15 N recovery from soil and plant remained at around 70 % throughout the experiment, the proportion of 15 N recovered from the plants increasing steadily over time. Nitrate containing fertilisers at 150 mg N kg- 1 soil gradually increased seedling foliage ? 13 C over the 12 -month period, indicating an increase in seedling water use efficiency.

40|$|In 1998, Wells (2001) {{conducted}} a national {{study of the}} total energy inputs of New Zealand dairy farms. The study demonstrated the superiority in energy efficiency of New Zealand dairy production {{compared to that of}} European farms. Over the past decade, New Zealand’s dairy industry has transformed. With the growth of the industry in nontraditional regions, as well as a significant increases in irrigation, <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> and supplementary feeds, there has been a substantial growth in milk production driven by an increasingly commodified export market. While the industry has experienced significant changes in the past 10 years, these changes have not yet been reflected in research. As a consequence, the impacts of these developments on the energy requirements of milk production are not yet fully documented. This study addresses that gap in data. This study is the first comprehensive, national assessment of energy requirements of New Zealand dairy farms since 1998. In this study, the total energy inputs of 135 New Zealand farms were calculated to determine their energy intensity and efficiency. Results were compared with energy input records from 1978 and 1998. Results of this study suggest that, in comparison with historical data, dairy farm energy intensity has significantly increased in all regions of New Zealand; energy efficiency has worsened in all but one geographical region. Despite this, New Zealand dairy farms are still more energy efficient than those of other major international competitors, which suggests the competitive advantage still remains. This research identifies the key drivers of changes to energy inputs, and offers recommendations for reducing the energy consumption of dairy production, to safeguard against energy vulnerability, and to reduce the environmental impacts of the dairy industry...|$|R
40|$|Pakistan has {{a history}} of subsidising {{agricultural}} inputs. Although none of the agricultural inputs were subsidised during the early 1950 s, the process was initiated {{in the second half of}} the decade by subsidising chemical fertilisers in order to popularise their use [Niaz (1984) ]. The list of subsidised inputs and the rate structure of the subsidies were expanded considerably throughout the Sixties. Towards the end of the Sixties, it was noted that almost all the agricultural inputs including fertilisers, insecticides, seeds, irrigation water, tubewell installations, and the operation and purchase of tractors and tractor-related equipment were subsidised in one form or another [Aresvik (1967) and Kuhnen (1989) ]. In the 1970 s, some curtailment of subsidies occurred as a result of input price increases which followed the worldwide recession, a major oil shock, the credit crunch, the war with India, and the consequent steep devaluation of Pakistani Rupee [Chaudhry (1982) ]. Although the subsidies had survived the onslaught of the Seventies and tended to persist on most inputs, the government became totally committed to their removal beginning with the 1980 s, under pressures from the IMF and the World Bank [Government of Pakistan (1980) ]. As a consequence, there was a total withdrawal of subsidy from seeds, insecticides, tubewells, and tractors. A phased-out withdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, culminating in 1984 - 85 in the case of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and in 1989 - 90 in the case of phosphatic and potash fertilisers, was also to be undertaken [World Bank (1986) ]. The purpose of the present paper is to highlight the progress of withdrawal of input subsidies in Pakistan, to study the nature of the input subsidies and possibly analyse the impact of the withdrawal of subsidies on the farm sector. Needless to add that the study is also intended to make policy recommendations on the various aspects of subsidy withdrawal. ...|$|R
40|$|NITROUS OXIDE (N 2 O) IS {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas and the predominant ozone-depleting substance in the atmosphere. Agricultural <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use {{is the major}} source of human-induced N 2 O emissions. A field experiment was conducted at Bundaberg from October 2012 to September 2014 to examine the impacts of legume crop (soybean) rotation as an alternative nitrogen (N) source on N 2 O emissions during the fallow period and to investigate low-emission soybean residue management practices. An automatic monitoring system and manual gas sampling chambers were used to measure greenhouse gas emissions from soil. Soybean cropping during the fallow period reduced N 2 O emissions compared to the bare fallow. Based on the N content in the soybean crop residues, the fertiliser N application rate was reduced by about 120 kg N/ha for the subsequent sugarcane crop. Consequently, emissions of N 2 O during the sugarcane cropping season were significantly lower from the soybean cropped soil than those from the conventionally fertilised (145 kg N/ha) soil following bare fallow. However, tillage that incorporated the soybean crop residues into soil promoted N 2 O emissions in the first two months. Spraying a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) onto the soybean crop residues before tillage effectively prevented the N 2 O emission spikes. Compared to conventional tillage, practising no-till with or without growing a nitrogen catch crop during the time after soybean harvest and before cane planting also reduced N 2 O emissions substantially. These results demonstrated that soybean rotation during the fallow period followed with N conservation management practices could offer a promising N 2 O mitigation strategy in sugarcane farming. Further investigation is required to provide guidance on N and water management following soybean fallow to maintain sugar productivity...|$|R
