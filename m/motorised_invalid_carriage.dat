Greeves was mowing the lawns {{of his home}} in Worcestershire {{when he had the}} idea of fitting the lawnmower engine to his disabled cousin's wheelchair and invented the Invacar. Invacar Ltd was set up and won a major contract to provide <b>motorised</b> three-wheeled <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> vehicles to the UK Government Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. in 1952 from a small factory in Church Road, Thundersley not far from Southend on Sea in Essex.|$|R

50|$|The Fend Flitzer was a {{three-wheeled}} <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> {{designed and}} built by Fritz Fend. The Flitzer established many of the basic concepts on which Fend's later Messerschmitt Kabinenroller microcars were developed.|$|R
5000|$|The tolls {{were last}} {{increased}} in 2013. [...] Tariffs are {{regulated by the}} Department for Transport. [...] Passage is free on Christmas Day and Boxing Day; three-wheeled <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> are exempt from tolls all year round.|$|R
25|$|Messerschmitt, {{temporarily}} {{not allowed}} to manufacture aircraft, had turned its resources to producing other commodities. In 1952, Fend approached Messerschmitt {{with the idea of}} manufacturing small motor vehicles. These were based on his Fend Flitzer <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s he was {{commissioned}} to do designs for specialist car production companies. These included the Jimp, {{a kind of}} mini Land Rover look alike, and the Salamander, intended {{as a replacement for}} the AC Cars <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: While the company's {{sporting}} cars won plaudits {{from many}} enthusiasts, {{it was the}} long-running contract with the UK government {{for the production of}} three-wheeled <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> that may have most impressed those concerned for the company's financial stability.|$|R
25|$|The Messerschmitt KR175 microcar (1953â€“1955) was {{the first}} vehicle built by Messerschmitt under its 1952 {{agreement}} with Fritz Fend. In concept, although not in actual design, it was an extended version of the Fend Flitzer <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b> Approximately 15,000 were built before it {{was replaced by the}} Messerschmitt KR200 in 1956.|$|R
50|$|Fend then {{designed}} the Flitzer, a larger, better-enclosed <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b> It was designed {{from the start}} to be powered by a gasoline engine. Whereas the earlier tricycle was both steered and powered by a single front wheel, the Flitzer {{had a pair of}} front wheels linked to the steering mechanism and a powered rear wheel.|$|R
25|$|When Tom Buxton was {{appointed}} Governor of South Australia, Kingston was angry {{that the government}} had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new Governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the UK {{mobility}} scooters {{are widely}} available with government subsidy under the Motability scheme. They are legally classified by the Use of <b>Invalid</b> <b>Carriages</b> on Highways Regulations 1988 as either Class II or Class III <b>Invalid</b> <b>Carriages</b> for legal purposes. A Class II scooter must be limited to 4 mph for use on a footway only, while a Class III scooter must be limited to 8 mph for road/highway use and have an additional 4 mph limiter for footway use. [...] a government consultation is under way {{to determine how the}} law should adapt to increasing scooter use, whether higher road speeds should be allowed and on a replacement for the archaic term [...] "invalid carriage". Due to concerns over safety issues and problems with bringing prosecutions against irresponsible users under existing laws, the consultation will also consider whether to make third party insurance mandatory, consider the introduction of compulsory training for users and discuss how to bring scooter users under wider road traffic legislations.|$|R
50|$|Fend then {{designed}} and built the Fend Flitzer, an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> designed from the start to be powered by an engine. He reversed the layout of his original tricycle, giving the Flitzer two front wheels and one rear wheel. As with usual convention, the front wheels were steered while the rear wheel was powered. About 250 Flitzers were built between 1948 {{and the end of}} production in 1951.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, Fend, {{a former}} aeronatical {{engineer}} and technical {{officer in the}} Luftwaffe, began production of a tricycle <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> in his workshop in Rosenheim, Germany. The tricycle had a front wheel that was steered by handlebars and powered by a mechanism actuated by pushing {{back and forth on}} the handlebars. Shortly afterward, it was offered with a [...] Victoria two-stroke proprietary engine normally used for motorizing bicycles.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} that robots with similar characteristics to <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> (e.g. 10mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.|$|R
5000|$|After the Second World War, Fend, who {{had been}} a {{technical}} officer with the Luftwaffe, opened a workshop in Rosenheim, Germany. In 1948, he devised an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> {{in the form of a}} tricycle. The front wheel of the tricycle was powered by pushing the handlebars back and forth. Originally designed with bicycle wheels, it was redesigned with scooter wheels in order to make the carriage lower. Fend later made a version that was powered by a [...] Victoria two-stroke engine.|$|R
50|$|The Kabinenroller was {{designed}} and developed by Fritz Fend for Messerschmitt AG. Fend had earlier designed and built a series of unpowered and powered <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages,</b> leading up to his Fend Flitzer. Fend noticed that able-bodied people were buying Flitzers for use as personal transport. This led him {{to believe that a}} mass-produced two-seat version of the Flitzer would have a ready market. A search for a manufacturer interested in the project led him to Messerschmitt, who had him develop the project for production in their Regensburg factory.|$|R
50|$|About 250 Flitzers {{had been}} built when {{production}} stopped in 1951. Many of these <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> had been bought by able-bodied individuals seeking basic personal transport. This led Fend {{to believe that there}} would be a mass-market for a larger, transport-oriented version of the Flitzer. Fend began to design and develop a two-seat vehicle similar in concept to the Flitzer. He also began looking for a manufacturer to mass-produce this vehicle. He came to an agreement with Messerschmitt for them to build Fend vehicles in their factory at Regensburg Part of the agreement was that the cars carried the Messerschmitt name, with Fend's new design being designated the Messerschmitt KR175.|$|R
50|$|Richard Symons's {{documentary}} {{recounts the}} origins and rise to racing history of the AC Cobra, the car requested by Carroll Shelby. The film details {{the history of the}} Cobra and Carroll Shelby's racing career from its humble beginnings to the 1959 victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Roy Salvadori at the wheel of an Aston Martin DBR1. The story goes on to explain Shelby's motivation to take on the might of Ferrari with the help of Ford and AC of England (who were then manufacturing <b>invalid</b> <b>carriages</b> as well as sports cars) and why Carroll Shelby had to retire from racing.|$|R
50|$|When Buxton was {{appointed}} governor, the Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston was angry that the South Australian government {{had not been}} involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage).</b> Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill health of his wife.|$|R
60|$|Next {{day they}} carried him off in an {{ambulance}} through the crowded Strand, and presently he found himself at Liverpool Street, where he was put into an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b> He asked the orderly where he was going, but the man {{did not seem to}} know, or had forgotten the name. So troubling no more about it he took a dose of medicine as he had been ordered, and presently went to sleep, as no doubt it was intended that he should do. When he woke up again it was to find himself being lifted from another ambulance into a house which was very dark, perhaps because of the lighting orders, for now night had fallen. He was carried in a chair up some stairs into a very nice bedroom, and there put to bed by two men. They went away, leaving him alone.|$|R
60|$|Young {{children}} of her own class were not exactly what her dream of usefulness had devised; but she had already a decided theory of education, and began to read up with all her might, whilst taking the lead in all the details of house taking, servant hiring, &c., to which her regular occupations of night school in the evening and reading to the lacemakers by day, became almost secondary. In due time the arrival of the ship was telegraphed, a hurried and affectionate note followed, and, on a bright east-windy afternoon, Rachel Curtis set forth to take up her mission. A telegram had announced the arrival of the Voluta, and the train which would bring the travellers to Avonchester. The Homestead carriage was sent to meet them, and Rachel in it, to give her helpless cousin assistance in this beginning of English habits. A roomy fly had been engaged for nurses and children, and Mrs. Curtis had put under the coachman's charge a parcel of sandwiches, and instructed him to offer all the appliances for making her own into an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gendron Iron Wheel Company {{was founded}} in 1872 in Toledo, Ohio by Peter Gendron (born Pierre Gendron 1844-1910). Gendron {{produced}} wire wheels for baby carriages originally.

6000|$|... "Dr. Pearson {{brought a}} Dr. Leeds here with him this morning. He {{says he is}} very clever. His term as house surgeon at Guy's or St. Bartholomew's, I forget which, has just expired, and as he had not made any {{definite}} plans {{he was glad to}} accept the doctor's offer to take charge of my uncle. He seemed, from what little I saw of him, a pleasant man, and spoke in a cheerful voice, which will be a great thing for uncle. I should think that he is six or seven and twenty. Dr. Pearson said he was likely to become a very distinguished man in his profession some day. He is going to begin at once. He will not sleep here, but will spend most of his time here, partly because he wants to study the case, and partly because he wants uncle to get accustomed to him. He will travel down with us, which will be a great comfort to me, for there is no saying how uncle may stand the journey. I suggested that we should have another <b>carriage,</b> as the <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> has room for only one inside besides the patient, but he laughed, and said that he would ride on the box with Tom Roberts; there will be room for two there, as we are going to post down. Of course, you and your aunt will go down by train, and be there to meet us; it will make it so much brighter and more cheerful having you to receive us than if we had to arrive all alone, with no one to say welcome." ...|$|R
60|$|A dreary time it {{had indeed}} been. His memory glanced lightly over the long {{monotonous}} years {{with a sort of}} shuddering recoil. He thought of his father's frequent absences, and of his return from one of them {{in the middle of a}} winter's night, propped up in an <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage,</b> with a surgeon in attendance, and blood-stained bandages around his leg. And he thought of a night when he had sat up with him while the nurse rested, and one name had ceaselessly burst from those white feverish lips, laden with fierce curses and deep vindictive hate, a name which had since been written into his memory with letters of fire. Further and further on his memory dragged him, until he himself, a boy no longer, had stood upon the threshold of man-hood, and on one awful night had heard from his father's lips that story which had cast its shadow across his life. Then for the first time had sprung up of some sort of sympathy between them, sympathy which had for its foundation a common hatred, a common sense of deep, unpardonable wrong. The oath which his father had sworn with trembling lips the son had echoed, and in dread of the vengeance of these two, the man against whom they had sworn it cut himself off from his fellows, and skulked in every out-of-the-way corner of Europe, a hunted being in peril of his life. There had come a great change over their lives, and they had drifted farther apart again. He himself had gone out into the world something of a scholar and something of a pedant, and he had found that all his ideas of life had lain rusting in his country home, and that he had almost as much to unlearn as to learn. With ample means, and an eager thirst for knowledge, he had passed from one to another of the great seats of learning of the world. But his lesson was not taught him at one of them. He learned it not amongst the keen conflict of intellect at the universities, not in the toils of the great vague disquiet which was throbbing amongst all cultured and artistic society, but in the eternal silence of Mont Blanc and her snow-capped Alps, and the whisperings of the night winds which blew across the valleys. At Heidelberg he had been a philosopher, in Italy he had been a scholar, and in Switzerland he became a poet. When once again he returned to the more feverish life of cities he was a changed man. He looked out upon life now with different eyes and enlarged vision. Passion had given place to a certain studied calm, a sort of inward contemplativeness which is ever inseparable from the true artist. Life became for him almost too impersonal, too little human. Soon it threatened to become one long abstraction, accompanied necessarily with a weakened hold on all sensuous things, and a corresponding decline in taste and appreciation. One thing had saved him from relapsing into the nervous dreamer, and the weaver of bright but aimless fancies. He had loved, and he had become a man again, linked to the world and the things of the world by the pulsations of his passion and his strong deep love. Was it well for him or ill, he wondered. Well, it might have been save for the deadly peril in which he lived, and which seemed closing fast around him. Well, it surely would have been....|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{purpose of this study}} was to discover the use made by old people of postal and telephone services and also their personal health and social contacts. Main Topics : Section on telephone ownership and use: reason for having telephone installed, whether respondent's telephone bills are subsidised, if so, from what source. (If respondent has no telephone, nearest telephone to his home (6 categories), whether anyone is available to take messages or fetch him to the telephone and whether respondent has ever owned a telephone, is recorded.) Data are given on the use made of telephone during last year (i. e. frequency of use, whether respondent receives more calls than he makes, person to whom he most often speaks on telephone). Any difficulty in actually using a telephone is recorded (6 categories - e. g. deafness, fear of telephones etc.). Finally, if respondent could choose between having an extra $ 20 per annum and having a free telephone, which he would prefer. Use of post: whether respondent writes letters, if so, to whom he most often writes, frequency of writing, whether he receives more personal letters than he sends. The address of the person with whom he is most in postal contact is recorded. Main difficulty respondent experiences when writing letters is recorded (i. e. poor eyesight, illiteracy etc. - 5 categories) and, finally, respondent is asked whether he would like to receive more letters (3 -point scale). Personal physical information: state of eyesight and hearing of respondent is given (4 categories for each), whether he suffers from any disability which makes it difficult to go out (if yes, nature of disability is recorded together with length of time he has suffered). Whether respondent is able to go out unaided, if so, how often. Frequency of use of various methods of transportation (8 categories - e. g. train, bus, <b>invalid</b> <b>carriage</b> etc.), whether the railway station, tube station (London), bus stop, post office, local shopping centre, doctor, are within walking distance of respondent's home. Frequency of visits to clubs, cinema, bingo and places of religious worship are also given (over past year) and, finally, whether respondent would like to go out more often. Social contacts: number of children, brothers and sisters still alive, other relatives and friends respondent is still in contact with, whether he has seen any of them in last week or month, whether any live within a ten-mile radius (information given is precisely defined), respondent is asked whether he would like to see children, relatives or friends more often, also whether he considers neighbours to be friendly (3 -point scale) and whether he has chatted with neighbours in past week - or to any of the people already talked about (i. e. children relatives, friends). The number of these people who have telephones is recorded. Amount of time spent alone (5 categories). Problem considered by respondent to be the greatest facing elderly people (i. e. lack of money, loneliness or boredom). Whether respondent prefers to use telephone or letter for keeping in touch with someone he cannot see regularly. Whether respondent is ever lonely (3 -point scale). Readiness of access to help in case of emergency (9 categories). Finally, respondent's attitudes towards devices for calling help, such as bells, whistles etc. are assessed on a 3 -point scale. Ownership of television, radio, record player, refrigerator, washing machine and motor vehicle recorded. As a 'coda' to the survey, respondents' knowledge of the Samaritan Organization is tested (i. e. whether they have heard of the Samaritans, perception of their role, whether they know where the nearest branch is or know the telephone number) ...|$|R
