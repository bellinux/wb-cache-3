40|$|Lateral transition-metal dichalcogenide {{and their}} heterostructures have {{attracted}} substantial attention, but there lacks a simple approach to produce large-scaled optoelectronic devices with <b>graded</b> <b>composition.</b> In particular, {{the incorporation of}} substitution and doping into heterostructure formation is rarely reported. Here, we demonstrate growth of a <b>composition</b> <b>graded</b> doped lateral WSe 2 /WS 2 heterostructure by ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition in a single heat cycle. Through Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the monolayer heterostructure exhibits a clear interface between two domains and a <b>graded</b> <b>composition</b> distribution in each domain. The coexistence of two distinct doping modes, i. e., interstitial and substitutional doping, was verified experimentally. A distinct three-stage growth mechanism consisting of nucleation, epitaxial growth, and substitution was proposed.

40|$|With the {{addition}} of the sintering additives Ni and Cu, highly dense Mo-Ti alloys with various Mo:Ti ratios were obtained by hot-pressing method. Under the same conditions a Mo-Ti green body with continuously <b>graded</b> <b>composition,</b> formed by the particle settling method, was sintered. The longitudinal and transverse ultrasonic velocities of Mo-Ti alloys were tested in order to calculate the residual stresses that develop during cooling of the Mo-Ti functionally graded material (FGM). By using an axisymmetric finite element method, the fabricated thermal stress in a disk-shaped Mo-Ti FGM was calculated. The results show that the residual stress continuously changes with the smooth change of <b>graded</b> <b>composition</b> and the maximum value of residual tensile stress is far lower than that of the bending strength of Mo-Ti alloys.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a method of {{material}} design of functionally graded material (FGM) plates with a function of electromagnetic noise suppression under an incidence of electromagnetic plane wave.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, {{a kind of}} Mo-Ti system {{functionally}} graded material with a continuous change of composition was formed via particle settling method at first, {{and then it was}} desified by hot-press under 1473 K- 30 MPa- 1 h.
