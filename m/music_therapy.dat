5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; acupuncture, the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E

25|$|Another meta-study {{examined}} the proposed neurological mechanisms behind <b>music</b> <b>therapy's</b> effects on these patients.

25|$|Two main {{methods for}} <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> are group {{meetings}} and one-one sessions.

Group therapy, however, {{is not always the}} best choice for the client. Ongoing one-on-one <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> has also been shown to be effective.

25|$|Studies are {{considering}} whether <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> {{can have a}} beneficial effect on people with Parkinson's Disease. A 3-month study investigated whether there was any motor benefit of <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> and physical therapy on Parkinson's Disease patients, and whether the therapies had any effect on their emotional well being and their quality of life. The <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> consisted of choral singing, voice exercise and rhythmic and free body movements, whereas the physical therapy consisted of stretching exercises, specific motor tasks and ways to improve balance and gait. The study concluded that <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> had a beneficial effect on the patient's emotions, it showed an improvement in bradykinesia, and in quality of life. <b>Music</b> <b>therapy</b> however lacked any motor benefit, whereas physical therapy showed that it improved the rigidity of the patients.|$|E

25|$|<b>Music</b> <b>therapy</b> {{finds its}} roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which {{described}} the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> program. The goal {{of the study was to}} understand whether ‚Äúmusic presented according to a specific plan‚Äù influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders. Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of <b>music</b> <b>therapy</b> services in the recovery of military service personnel.|$|E
