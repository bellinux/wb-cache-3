5|$|The game's story {{revolves}} around creatures known as Tikis, which {{are new to}} the series. The different types of Tikis fill {{the role of the}} antagonists in the story, replacing the Kremlings from Donkey Kong Country. Cranky Kong, who owns shops throughout the island, is the only Kong family member that appears other than Donkey and Diddy. The story begins when a group of evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe arrive on Donkey Kong Island after being awoken by a volcanic eruption, and play music to hypnotize the animals on the island into stealing Donkey Kong's bananas. Since Donkey Kong is resistant to the Tikis' music, he works with Diddy Kong to retrieve his hoard of bananas from the Tikis. Throughout the game, the pair travel through eight worlds to recover their stolen bananas: the Jungle, the Beach, the Ruins, the Cave, the Forest, the Cliff, the Factory, and the Volcano. In each world, they must defeat a Tiki Tak Tribe leader: Kalimba, the <b>Maraca</b> Triplets, Gong, Banjo, Panflute, Xylophone, Accordion (who hypnotizes other animals in the jungle to fight the Kongs), and Tiki Tong, the king of the Tiki Tak Tribe. After Tiki Tong is defeated, the Kongs are launched into space where they punch down on the Moon, crushing Tiki Tong's base and sending bananas flying everywhere.|$|E

25|$|Some zemís are {{accompanied}} by a small table or tray, which {{is believed to be}} a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called cohoba, prepared from the beans of a species of Piptadenia tree. These trays have been found with ornately carved snuff tubes. Before certain ceremonies, Taínos would purify themselves, either by inducing vomiting with a swallowing stick or by fasting. After communal bread was served, first to the zemí, then to the cacique, and then to the common people, the people would sing the village epic to the accompaniment of <b>maraca</b> and other instruments.|$|E

Then the man with his leg straddling the cross and seeming to add to Christ' difficulty in lifting the cross, has a piece of rope in his right hand and in his left hand what appears to be a form of <b>maraca</b> to add to the rhythm of the music being played. The sixth soldier also appears to be pushing the cross down to add to the weight.|$|E
500|$|The 808 generates {{sounds in}} {{imitation}} of acoustic percussion: the bass drum, snare, toms, conga, rimshot, claves, handclap, <b>maraca,</b> cowbell, cymbal, and hi-hat (open and closed). It is completely analog, meaning its sounds are generated by hardware rather than sampled; the TR in TR-808 stands for [...] "Transistor Rhythm". Users can program up to 32 patterns using the step sequencer, chain up to 768 measures, and place accents on individual beats, a feature introduced with the CR-78. Users can also set the tempo and time signature, including unusual signatures such as 5/4 and 7/8.|$|E
500|$|The fruit are {{dispersed}} by animals; fruit {{which are}} not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles. Certain species of Attalea have been mentioned as examples of [...] "anachronistic" [...] species which are adapted for dispersal by now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna. On <b>Maracá</b> Island, Roraima, in the Brazilian Amazon, Attalea maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs, collared peccaries, deer and primates. Rodents, including agoutis, fed upon the fruit and, as the fruit availability declined, they fed on the seeds. Other dispersers of Attalea fruit include Crested Caracaras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A.phalerata in the Brazilian Pantanal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Maracas</b> (...) , {{sometimes}} called rumba shakers, shac-shacs, {{and various other}} names, are rattles which appear in many genres of Caribbean and Latin music. Players hold them by their handles, usually in pairs, and shake them. <b>Maracas</b> can't be tuned.|$|R

500|$|The slowed pace is {{complemented by}} the lyric ("Gotta keep those loving good {{vibrations}} a-happening with her"), sung once {{first as a}} solo voice, with the melody repeated an octave higher the second time with an accompanying harmony. This two-part vocal fades as a solo harmonica plays a melody {{on top of the}} persistent quarter-note bass line and <b>maraca</b> that maintain the only rhythm throughout Episode 2. The section ends with a five-part harmony vocalizing a whole-note chord that is sustained by reverb for a further four beats. Lambert calls it the song's [...] "wake-up chord {{at the end of the}} meditation that transports the concept into a whole new realm: it's an iconic moment among iconic moments. As it rouses us from a blissful dream and echoes into the silence leading into the chorus, it seems to capture every sound and message the song has to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{tape splice}} occurs at 2:13, {{transitioning}} to an electric organ playing sustained chords {{set in the}} key of F accompanied by a <b>maraca</b> shaken on every beat. Sound on Sound highlights this change as the [...] "most savage edit in the track ... most people would go straight into a big splash hook-line section. Brian Wilson decided to slow the track even further, moving into a 23-bar section of church organ ... Most arrangers would steer clear {{of this kind of}} drop in pace, {{on the grounds that it}} would be chart suicide, but not Brian." [...] Harrison says: [...] "The appearance of episode 1 was unusual enough but could be explained as an extended break between verse and refrain sections. Episode 2 however, makes that interpretation untenable, and both listener and analyst must entertain the idea that 'Good Vibrations' develops under its own power, as it were, without the guidance of overdetermined formal patterns. Brian’s own description of the song—a three-and-a-half-minute 'pocket symphony'—is a telling clue about his formal ambitions here." ...|$|E

2500|$|A key {{difference}} between such early machines and more modern equipment {{is that they}} use sound synthesis rather than digital sampling in order to generate their sounds. For example, a snare drum or <b>maraca</b> sound would typically be created using a burst of white noise whereas a bass drum sound would be made using sine waves or other basic waveforms. This meant that while the resulting sound was not very close {{to that of the}} real instrument, each model tended to have a unique character. For this reason, many of these early machines have achieved a certain [...] "cult status" [...] and are now sought after by producers for use in production of modern electronic music, most notably the Roland TR-808.|$|E
2500|$|Merengues {{are fast}} {{arrangements}} with a [...] beat. The traditional instrumentation for a conjunto típico (traditional band), the usual performing group of folk merengue, is a diatonic accordion, a two–sided drum, called a tambora, {{held on the}} lap, and a güira. A güira is a percussion instrument {{that sounds like a}} <b>maraca.</b> It is a sheet of metal with small bumps on it (created with hammer and nail), shaped into a cylinder, and played with a stiff brush. The güira is brushed steadily on the downbeat with a [...] "and-a" [...] thrown in at certain points, or played in more complex patterns that generally mark the time. Caballito rhythm, or a quarter and two eighths, is also common. The double headed drum is played on one side with a stick syncopation {{and on the other side}} with the palm of the hand.|$|E
2500|$|The term is {{also used}} to refer to the best known of the dancers of the Fiesta Grande. The Parachicos dress in a mask, a helmet or wig made of ixtle, a Saltillo style sarape. [...] The mask is carved of wood and {{decorated}} with lacquer to mimic a Spanish face. Originally the masks had beards, but over time they evolved and many have an almost childlike look. The ixtle head covering is supposed to mimic blonde hair. The dancers carry a type of <b>maraca</b> made of metal called chinchin to make noise along with the taping of their boot heels. These carry a guitar and/or whip (the latter used by encomenderos in the colonial period). The dancers use the whips to lightly tap children, youths, old men and even some women. These dancers appear a number of times during the days of the Fiesta Grande. These processions visit the various churches on their path, which are decorated with branches, on which are hung breads, sweets, fruits and plastic decorations.|$|E

Ringo Starr in Anthology stated: [...] "On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I {{remember}} that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a <b>maraca</b> {{in one hand and}} a tambourine in the other." [...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds only because we were so tired the night we did Love Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and when we came to the question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right. We are conscientious about our work and we don't like to rush things." ...|$|E
