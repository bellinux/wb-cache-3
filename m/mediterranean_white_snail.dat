40|$|The {{provenance}} {{of white}} sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in the Mediterranean {{is both a}} conundrum and an important conservation issue. Considering this species's propensity for natal philopatry, any evidence that the Mediterranean stock {{has little or no}} contemporary immigration from the Atlantic would suggest that it is extraordinarily vulnerable. To address this issue we sequenced the mitochondrial control region of four rare <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>white</b> sharks. Unexpectedly, the juvenile sequences were identical although collected at different locations and times, showing little genetic differentiation from Indo-Pacific lineages, but strong separation from geographically closer Atlantic/western Indian Ocean haplotypes. Historical long-distance dispersal (probably a consequence of navigational error during past climatic oscillations) and potential founder effects are invoked to explain the anomalous relationships of this isolated ‘sink’ population, highlighting the present vulnerability of its nursery grounds...|$|R

As a consequence of this "exotic diet", the algal bisindolic alkaloid caulerpin accumulates in the fish tissues. Although the compound shows structural similarity to endogenous indolamines that modulate animal behaviour, the potential impact of caulerpin on fish behaviour still remains unexplored. In this report, behavioural experiments both on groups and on single fish responding towards a mirror were performed under different doses of dietary caulerpin. Differences between treated and control groups for each behaviour and for the overall aggressive pattern during the different experimental phases showed that the aggressiveness of D. sargus decreased with the administration of caulerpin. These results call the attention to a still unexplored potential ability of bioactive metabolites from marine invasive species, to alter the behaviour on native species, with putative negative effects on patterns of fish growth and population dynamics...|$|R
40|$|On April 3 rd 2016 three empty {{shells of}} the Pulmonate two-toothed <b>white</b> <b>snail</b> were found washed ashore in a shell grit bank {{at the eastern}} border of the nature reserve Baai van Heist (municipality Knokke-Heist). One subadult {{specimen}} was clearly an old shell, very probably of fossil Pleistocene or Holocene origin. The other two snails (1 subad. and 1 juvenile) showed small traces of weathering but certainly had a recent appearance. This prompted our presumption that the species could possibly live in situ in the Baai van Heist. On September 19 th 2016 we searched for the species along the eastern mole of the outer port of Zeebrugge, situated within the reserve. At two localities in the mediolittoral zone we could find various live specimens of A. bidentata under stones. The features of the habitats {{in which they have}} been found were in conformity with those known from the literature. Moreover we could ascertain that two-toothed <b>white</b> <b>snails</b> living nearer to the coastline occurred lower beneath the mean tide level than their congeners from a more seaward finding spot. Most of the snails were dwelling on the substrate under stones. We also noticed that larger shell fragments, mainly from mussels, created small cavities under the stones. These could serve as shelter or air-chamber to provide oxygen for respiration. For the first time A. bidentata is now recorded alive along the Belgian coast. On the same day we found a fresh empty shell of the multi-toothed mouse-eared snail Myosotella denticulata in a shell grit bank at the shore of the Baai van Heist. We presume that this species may also live in this nature reserve under similar environmental conditions as the two-toothed <b>white</b> <b>snail.</b> So far however, it has not been discovered in situ. In Belgium this species is known from the IJzer estuary, but it is new to {{the eastern part of the}} coast. From the late 1960 s until the 1990 s the beach area of the Baai van Heist was repeatedly raised with sand dredged offshore of the harbour of Zeebrugge. In grit banks consisting of shells and debris washed out from these sediments, empty specimens of the mouseeared snail Myosotella myosotis have been found on rare occasions. These were clearly old shells of a fossil nature, presumed of Pleistocene (Eemian) and/or Holocene age. Nowadays an embryonic saltmarsh is developping in the Baai van Heist which will create potential habitats for mouse-eared snails. Up to now the species has not yet been observed living on this site. Regarding the foraging behaviour of A. bidentata it is assumed that she is a selective deposit feeder, mainly browsing on sediment particles (epipsammic browsing). Perhaps the snail also browses the epilithic microflora and -fauna from stones, on which she often dwells. Characteristic for the three Ellobiidae is that specimens as from 2. 5 whorls onward the columella in the top of the spire is resorbed. By this a small cavity develops in the snail's shell. We wonder if this cavity has a function in the life of the animals. For instance it may serve as a kind of float for local dispersal or as an air reservoir for respiration during flood at high tide. We further ask ourselves how A. bidentata, considering her non-planktonic life cycle, could have colonized the Baai van Heist. We suggest two possible dispersal mechanisms: rafting and kinds of zoochory. The latter can take place via birds foraging in the snail's habitat, especially turnstones and rock pipits. Also other bird species may be eligible for zoochory, e. g. oystercatcher, curlew, herring gull and possibly some songbirds which occasionally dwell in the intertidal area during migration or in the winter season...|$|R

40|$|The common <b>white</b> <b>snail</b> (Cernuella virgata) (da Costa) is {{an exotic}} pest of grain crops in {{southern}} Australia. In {{order to better}} control these snails and develop optimal management strategies, {{it is important to}} understand how their breeding behavior is influenced by soil moisture and soil type. Pairs of adult snails were placed into vials containing either a calcareous or a non-calcareous soil at five moisture levels along their soil moisture retention curves: no-water; permanent wilting-point; mid-point; field-capacity; and saturation. Survival analysis was used to estimate the tendency of C. virgata to lay an egg cluster. ANOVA showed that there was no two-way interaction between soil moisture and soil type, however, one-way ANOVA showed that the tendency of C. virgata to deposit the first egg cluster was greater in the non-calcareous soil and increased as soil moisture increased. There was a higher total number of egg clusters laid in the non-calcareous soil. The total number of egg clusters laid in the two soil types increased as soil moisture content increased. No eggs were laid in the no-water treatment. C. virgata breed more frequently in moist soils, and egg laying is greater in wet seasons. Therefore the risk of grain contamination in spring is predicted to be greater following a relatively wet autumn and spring. V. L. Carne-Cavagnaro, M. A. Keller and G. H. Bake...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>white</b> sea bream Diplodus sargus {{includes}} the invasive green alga Caulerpa cylindracea in its diet, with consequent metabolic and enzymatic alterations. As a result of this novel alimentary habit, the bioactive algal red pigment caulerpin has been detected in its tissues. However, this may not be an isolated case: other fish species have also been reported to feed on C. cylindracea, although the possible accumulation of caulerpin in their tissues has not yet been investigated. In this report, we analysed stomach contents and caulerpin levels in the native sparid species Spondyliosoma cantharus, Sarpa salpa, and Diplodus vulgaris, and in the scarid Sparisoma cretense, along with the Lessepsian siganid Siganus luridus. C. cylindracea was found in the stomachs of all but one fish species, the exception being S. cretense, in which prey items could not be determined due to the high degree of digestion. Chemical analysis of fish tissues revealed that only S. cantharus and S. salpa accumulated caulerpin, while no traces of the compound were detected in the other species. Despite intense research efforts on natural products obtained from C. cylindracea, a complete picture of the impacts caused by fish including this alga in their diet has not been elucidated. The identification of caulerpin in other Mediterranean native fish suggests a need for further research in order to assess the possible transfer of such molecules to humans through seafood consumption...|$|R

40|$|Italy sandy coasts are characterised {{by a great}} {{diversity}} of habitats and, at the same time, many of these coastal stretches are in erosive condition. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand, in areas where marine erosion is particularly strong, which are the most vulnerable and most threatened habitats. The paper sets out data from the survey of foredune habitats (annual vegetation of drift lines, embryonic dunes, <b>mediterranean</b> <b>white</b> dunes, sensu Directive 92 / 43 /EEC) in the San Rossore Estate sandy coast (Northern Tuscany, Italy) strongly subjected to erosion. The surveys, in addition to updating the information collected, aim to point out the arrangement of these habitats in relation to coastal retrogradation and foredune erosion, in order to identify appropriate management tools for mitigating disturbance factors. The surveys, conducted in the field and by photo-interpretation, revealed the presence of foredune plant communities hardly referable, from the phytosociological point of view, to known associations of neighboring coasts. The Cakile maritima plant communities of annual vegetation of drift lines, the Elymus farctus/ Othantus maritimus phytocoenosis of embryonic dune and the Ammophila arenaria/Euphorbia paralias communities of white dunes, are markedly altered in their floristic composition; the coverage and distribution of the different plant communities are in a highly differentiated manner according to erosion gradients. The understanding of dynamics of alteration of psammophilous plant communities in relation to coastal erosion may suggest potential aid in the management actions aimed at containing the transformations or and/or useful for the restoration of the same habitats...|$|R

The inhibition kinetic studies using deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and butanol as inhibitors were preceded.

This was {{evident from the}} increased V(max) tr value with no change of the apparent K(m) tr. In contrast, butanol exhibited a competitive inhibition to the transglycosylation reaction and non-competitive inhibition to the hydrolysis.
