We show that when the first <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has a small dwell-time and is switching slowly {{in the spirit of}} average dwell-time switching, all the states of the closed loop are bounded.

When the uncertain plant {{takes the form of a}} <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> with an unknown switching signal, we show that all the states of the closed-loop control system are guaranteed to be bounded provided that the plant’s switching signal varies slowly enough.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{composed}} of components. The components do not interact with one another. Rather, they all interact with the same environment, which switches one of them on at each moment in time. In standard concurrency, a component restricts {{the environment of the}} other components, thus the concurrent system has fewer behaviors than its components. On the other hand, in a <b>switched</b> <b>system,</b> a component suggests an alternative to the other components, thus the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> has richer behaviors than its components. We study finite-state <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> where each of the underlying components is a finite-state transducer. While the main challenge, namely compositionality, is similar in standard concurrent <b>systems</b> and in <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> the problems and solutions are different. In the verification front, we suggest and study an assumeguarantee paradigm for <b>switched</b> <b>systems,</b> and study formalisms in which satisfaction of a specification in all components imply its satisfaction in the <b>switched</b> <b>system.</b> In the synthesis front, we show that while compositional synthesis and design are undecidable, the problem of synthesizing a switching rule with which a given <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> satisfies an LTL specification is decidable. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} discuss the method of {{computing}} the viability kernel conveniently, we present some important features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> are dynamical systems that consist of {{a finite number of}} subsystems and a logical rule that orchestrates switching between these subsystems. Therefore, one of the features of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> is multi-subsystem. In addition, <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> could not be guaranteed to be stable even if all subsystems are stable. Switching rule may be designed to stabilize <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> even if all subsystems are unstable. According to the discussion above, the computation of the viability kernel is affected by the switching rules and subsystems.|$|R

30|$|A <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is {{a hybrid}} {{dynamical}} system {{consisting of a}} finite number of subsystems and a logical rule that manages switching between these subsystems. <b>Switched</b> <b>systems</b> have drawn {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years; see [1 – 37] and references therein. The motivation for studying <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> comes partly from the fact that <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>switched</b> multicontroller <b>systems</b> have numerous applications in control of mechanical systems, process control, automotive industry, power systems, aircraft and traffic control, and many other fields. An important qualitative property of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> is stability [1 – 3]. The challenge of analyzing the stability of <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> lies partly in the fact that, even if the individual systems are stable, the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> might be unstable. Using a common quadratic Lyapunov function on all subsystems, the quadratic Lyapunov stability facilitates the analysis and synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the obtained results within this framework have been recognized to be conservative. In [10], various algorithms both for stability and performance analysis of discrete-time piece-wise affine systems were presented. Different classes of Lyapunov functions were considered, and how to compute them through linear matrix inequalities was also shown. Moreover, the tradeoff between the degree of conservativeness and computational requirements was discussed. The problem of stability analysis and control synthesis of <b>switched</b> <b>systems</b> in the discrete-time domain was addressed in [11]. The approach followed in [11] looked at the existence of a switched quadratic Lyapunov function to check asymptotic stability of the <b>switched</b> <b>system</b> under consideration. Two different linear matrix inequality-based conditions allow to check the existence of such a Lyapunov function. These two conditions have been proved to be equivalent for stability analysis.|$|R
