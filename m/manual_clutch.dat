2500|$|In USSR, a {{deficiency}} of any {{vehicles in the}} market and low personal incomes led to great increasing of cheap 50cc mopeds and kits production. It achieves approximately a half million per year at the later 70s. As to technical level, it was analogous to pre-WW2 German models, with minimal changes made to later 80s. The only clip-on kit engine was [...] "D" [...] series ("Д-4" ... "Д-8Э"), a single-speed chain-driven 45cc 2-stroke motor with <b>manual</b> <b>clutch</b> and a rotary slide valve in a crankschaft. It was destined for clipping into a classic twin-diamond bike frame. At 2010s, it's still widely produced by some Chinese factories like Jiangdu in a piston distribution version, and has some popularity even in United States.|$|E
2500|$|In 1896, the Armstrong Phaeton was {{developed}} by Harry E. Dey and built by the Armstrong Company of Bridgeport, CT for the Roger Mechanical Carriage Company. Though there were steam, electric, and internal combustion vehicles introduced in the early days, the Armstrong Phaeton was innovative with many firsts. Not only did it have a gasoline powered 6.5-liter, two-cylinder engine, but also a dynamo flywheel connected to an onboard battery. [...] The dynamo and regenerative braking were used to charge the battery. Its electric starter was used 16 years before Cadillac's. The dynamo also provided ignition spark and powered the electric lamps. The Phaeton also had the first semi-automatic transmission (no <b>manual</b> <b>clutch).</b> The exhaust system was an integrated structural component of the vehicle. [...] The Armstrong Phaeton's motor was too powerful; the torque damaged the carriage wheels repeatedly.|$|E

50|$|The Wilson gearbox was {{produced}} {{with a variety}} of clutches. The best-known is the fluid flywheel, used for touring cars such as the Daimler and the Armstrong-Siddeley. Sports cars used a Newton centrifugal clutch. This was a multiple plate dry clutch, similar to racing <b>manual</b> <b>clutches</b> of the time, but with the pressure plate centrifugally actuated to engage at around 600rpm. Pure racing cars, such as the ERA, avoided a clutch altogether and relied on the progressive engagement of the gearbox's band brake on lowest gear when starting.|$|R
30|$|Usage of <b>manual</b> gearbox: <b>Clutch</b> wear {{is reduced}} by {{choosing}} a low starting gear and a correct handling of the clutch pedal. When cruising, the vehicle should be operated at a high gear.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{chainsaws}} used a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch</b> instead, {{but this}} is long obsolete.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, the <b>manual</b> <b>clutch</b> {{variant of}} the T135 was discontinued, as the T-150 made its debut. The {{automatic}} clutch variant is still sold.|$|E

5000|$|As Volkswagen's first 4-door saloon, the Type 4 also {{introduced}} unibody construction, coil springs, trailing wishbone rear suspension, hydraulic <b>clutch</b> <b>manual</b> transmission [...] - [...] {{as well as}} MacPherson strut front suspension, subsequently adapted to the VW Type 1 1302/1303 ("Super Beetle").|$|R
50|$|The ATC250R is a {{high-performance}} ATV produced by Honda from 1981 to 1986. Early models (1981-1984) used an air-cooled, 248 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine. Fuel was fed through a 27 mm (1981-1982) or 30 mm (1983-1984) round-slide carburetor. Power was accessed through a close-ratio five-speed transmission with a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch.</b> Later models (1985-1986) used a liquid-cooled, 246 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine with a 34 mm round (1985) or flat (1986) slide carburetor. The biggest engine downfall {{was the lack}} of a power valve. The 85-86 models were upgraded with a close-ratio six speed transmission again with a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The NSR50 has a 49cc water-cooled, {{two-stroke}} engine, and a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch</b> {{with six}} gears. It typically falls into class with other two-stroke 50cc road bikes {{such as the}} Yamaha YSR50, but is also commonly classed with up to 110cc four-stroke bikes.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, the T135 was facelifted with a {{new body}} design. The {{transmission}} of the Malaysia's and Indonesia's <b>manual</b> <b>clutch</b> variant was revised to 5-speed transmission from the previous 4-speed as an upgrade. Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia produced a cut-off from the CDI which limits the motorcycle's performance for the facelifted version.|$|E
5000|$|Engines {{complied}} with Euro 3 emission standards. They included: 1.6 L in two states of tune and 1.9 L petrol engines, {{as well as}} a 1.7 L diesel. Three 5-speed transmissions were available: a <b>manual,</b> an automated <b>clutch</b> system called ACS, and a regular automatic called [...] "TouchShift." ...|$|R
25|$|In simple terms, a DSG is two {{separate}} <b>manual</b> gearboxes (and <b>clutches)</b> contained within one housing and working as one unit. It {{was designed by}} BorgWarner and is licensed to the Volkswagen Group, with support by IAV GmbH. By using two independent clutches, a DSG can achieve faster shift times and eliminates the torque converter of a conventional epicyclic automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|Torque {{transfer}} solutions from TREMEC (Transmisiones y Equipos Mecanicos SA de CV, formerly Transmission Technology Corporation - TTC) {{are found}} in products ranging from supercars and high-performance sports cars to severe duty, vocational and commercial vehicles worldwide. The portfolio of products includes <b>manual</b> transmissions, dual <b>clutch</b> transmissions, gears, shafts, clutches, friction materials, shift systems, synchronizers, mechatronic systems, transmission control units, and control software.|$|R
50|$|The 220S was {{available}} with a 4-speed column shift manual transmission, with an optional Hydrak automatic clutch. This {{made use of}} small microswitches on the gear selector that automatically disengaged the clutch when the driver changed gears. Many cars have subsequently been converted to use a regular <b>manual</b> <b>clutch,</b> due to the high maintenece costs of continuing to use the Hydrak clutch.|$|E
50|$|There were {{variants}} of the PC50 {{which were not}} available to the UK market including a standard model with telescopic front forks and the sports-like PS50. This was introduced as a sports variant of the OHC machine. The PS50 had 3-speed gearbox with handlebar twist-grip selection, a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch,</b> a motor cycle style petrol tank, a dual seat and telescopic forks. Overhead valve (OHV) versions were also listed for the PS50.|$|E
50|$|By its nature, a {{freewheel}} mechanism acts as {{an automatic}} clutch, {{making it possible to}} change gears in a manual gearbox, either up- or downshifting, without depressing the clutch pedal, limiting the use of the <b>manual</b> <b>clutch</b> to starting from standstill or stopping. The Saab freewheel can be engaged or disengaged by the driver by respectively pushing or pulling a lever. This will lock or unlock the main shaft with the freewheel hub.|$|E
30|$|Buscemi {{discussed}} that, today, drivers {{could have}} more transmission options than before as automatics and manuals {{are accompanied by}} automated <b>manuals</b> (AMT), dual <b>clutch</b> transmissions (DCT), and continuously variable transmissions (CVT). The author stated {{that the most important}} objective and the main goal for transmission engineers would be to improve fuel efficiency and to perk up overall drivetrain efficiency by reducing drag losses [13].|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, the 2.0L Ti-VCT GDI Sport five door {{hatchback}} {{with either}} the five speed, dual <b>clutch</b> <b>manual</b> transmission, or the six speed [...] "Power Shift" [...] automatic transmission was the only model currently offered. The assembly changed from the Saarlouis Body & Assembly to the AutoAlliance Thailand facility. Its width dimensions at 1810 mm are not within the favorable Japanese compact car tax classification.|$|R
50|$|There is {{essentially}} {{no difference in}} efficiency between the technique of bypassing the throttle butterfly and operating the butterfly itself. The IAC allows the ECU to maintain minimum RPM irrespective of changes in engine load, {{sometimes referred to as}} anti-stall feature. Thus the driver can more easily move the car from stand-still by merely releasing the <b>clutch</b> (<b>manual</b> transmission) or the brake (automatic transmission) without having to simultaneously press the accelerator.|$|R
5000|$|A {{preselector}} or self-changing gearbox {{is a type}} {{of manual}} gearbox (US: transmission) used on a variety of vehicles, most commonly in the 1930s. The defining characteristic of a preselector gearbox is that the manual shift lever is used to [...] "pre-select" [...] the next gear to be used, then a separate control (a foot pedal) is used to engage this in one single operation, without needing to work a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Glas {{produced}} {{three models}} on the Goggomobil platform: the Goggomobil T sedan, the Goggomobil TS coupé, and the Goggomobil TL van. The engine was an air-cooled, two-stroke, two-cylinder unit originally displacing 250 cc, but later available in increased sizes of 300 cc and 400 cc. It had an electric pre-selective transmission built by Getrag and a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch.</b> The engine {{was behind the}} rear wheels. Suspension was independent all round using coil springs with swing axles.|$|E
50|$|A {{freewheel}} {{also produces}} slightly better fuel economy on carbureted engines (without fuel turn-off on engine brake) and less wear on the <b>manual</b> <b>clutch,</b> but {{leads to more}} wear on the brakes {{as there is no}} longer any ability to perform engine braking. This may make freewheel transmissions dangerous for use on trucks and automobiles driven in mountainous regions, as prolonged and continuous application of brakes to limit vehicle speed soon leads to brake-system overheating followed shortly by total failure.|$|E
40|$|The Waterman vehicle, a four {{passenger}} Renault 5 GTL, {{performance test}} {{results are presented}} and characterized the state-of-the-art of electric vehicles. It was powered by sixteen 6 -volt traction batteries through a two-step contactor controller actuated by a foot throttle to change the voltage applied to the 6. 7 -kilowatt motor. The motor output shaft was connected to a front-wheel-drive transaxle that contains a four-speed <b>manual</b> transmission and <b>clutch.</b> The braking system was a conventional hydraulic braking system...|$|R
50|$|The Easytronic {{system allows}} for a {{computer}} to assume control of the <b>manual</b> gearbox and <b>clutch</b> via electromechanical means. As of Easytronic 3.0, the gearbox can be operated in either full automatic, or sequential semi-automatic mode. In the former, the car behaves much like a traditional automatic transmission, selecting gears with no driver input; in the latter, the gears can be selected sequentially (using the gear select lever) by the driver. It also offers a traditional automatic-like 'creep' mode for low-speed maneuvering.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{sequential}} transmissions {{that use the}} rotation of a drum to switch gears, much {{like those of a}} typical fully manual motorcycle. These can be designed with a <b>manual</b> or automatic <b>clutch</b> system, and may be found both in automobiles (particularly track and rally racing cars), motorcycles (typically light [...] "step-thru" [...] type city utility bikes, e.g., the Honda Super Cub) and quadbikes (often with a separately engaged reversing gear), the latter two normally using a scooter-style centrifugal clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda Motosport 90 or Honda SL90 was a street/trail Honda {{motorcycle}} {{with a high}} fender. Its {{engine was}} a single cylinder 89 cc, single overhead cam configuration. It had a 4-speed transmission and a <b>manual</b> <b>clutch.</b> It was produced only during the 1969 model year and was available in two colors: Candy Ruby Red and Candy Blue. It came with a silver fuel tank stripe and a chrome exhaust system. Its frame was silver with the front wheel measuring 19" [...] and 17" [...] for the rear wheel. The steel fenders matched the basic colors (red or blue).|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycle {{engines are}} {{typically}} two-stroke or four-stroke internal combustion engines, but other engine types (such as Wankels and electric motors) {{have been used}} in small numbers. Although some mopeds had friction drive to the front tyre, a motorcycle engine invariably drives the rear wheel, power being sent to the driven wheel by belt, chain or shaft [...] Most engines have a gearbox with up to six ratios. Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy tourers [...] and sidecar motorcycles. [...] Gear changes are normally effected using a foot-pedal and <b>manual</b> <b>clutch,</b> but early models had hand-levers. Some bikes have automatic or semi-automatic gearboxes.|$|E

40|$|A <b>manual</b> {{friction}} <b>clutch</b> {{has been}} modified by applying a dc-motor actuator, {{such that the}} clutch can be operated electronically. In order for this electro-mechanical clutch suits for CVT applications, the fundamental research to study the characterisation of the clutch needs to be carried out. This study focused on the clutch dynamic behaviours, especially during the engagement and disengagement processes when the clutch was operated manually in open loop system without any control strategy applied to it. The observed parameters were torques, speeds and powers of both engine and output clutch. The experimental results show that during engagement process, small overshoot occurred at output clutch speed, but significant overshoots occurred at input and output torque as well as power. The output torque overshoot was not only directly proportional to the initial engine speed but also inversely proportional to the output load torque...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "100th anniversary limited edition" [...] version [...] is {{intended}} for the Australian and South African markets;, and coloured Rosso Alfa, Atlantic Blue, Black e Ice White. The “100th Anniversary Limited Edition” was produced in 130 pieces: 100 for the Australian market and 30 for the South African one. Following the overhauling in fashion in that market, that GTs are equipped with the 3.2 V6 with a <b>manual</b> 6 speed <b>clutch.</b> A centenario version is made for the French market. It had a rear view camera, Blue&Me, 1.9 JTDm 16V 150 CV engine.|$|R
50|$|A {{fourth-generation}} Scénic {{was unveiled}} at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The car, {{based on the}} R-Space concept, is slightly larger than its predecessor and adds some crossover design elements but, according to Renault, it is still an MPV. It will be powered by six diesel and two petrol engines. For the models with 6-speed manual transmission and Energy dCi 110 diesel engines it will incorporate an optional hybrid unit (Hybrid Assist).The Scénic will be offered with <b>manual</b> or double <b>clutch</b> gear box.The Scénic offer a 572 l trunk and the Grand Scénic 765 l with five seats.|$|R
