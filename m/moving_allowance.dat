Included in the deal was a tenured professorial appointment with a $192,000 salary, and a housing assistance allowance of up to $50,000 for her partner, Gretchen Kalonji.|$|E
5000|$|Aid to {{displaced}} families: The act {{created a}} new program to assist states in aiding families displaced by urban highway construction. Families could only be relocated with federal funds if the new housing {{was not in a}} crime-ridden neighborhood, was environmentally sound, and had good-quality sanitation (plumbing, sewage, etc.). States wishing to participate in this program were required to enact enabling legislation by July 1970. States were also required to comply with the provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The federal government assumed 100 {{percent of the cost of}} property acquisition, up to $25,000. It also provided up to $5,000 for a one-, two-, or three-family dwellings (provided the displaced person purchased a new home within the year), and $1,500 for apartment dwellers. Property owners were also reimbursed (tax free) for recording fees, transfer taxes, and any early mortgage payments they were forced to make after purchasing new property consequent to highway construction. Displaced persons were able to apply for 100 percent reimbursement of their relocation moving costs, or in lieu of actual costs a $200 <b>moving</b> <b>allowance</b> and $100 dislocation allowance. Businesses or farms which were relocated were eligible to receive their average annual net earnings or $5,000, whichever was less. (Businesses could only apply if relocation caused a [...] "substantial loss" [...] of patronage and it was a single-site operation.) States were also required to provide relocation counseling for free.|$|E
40|$|In this {{step-by-step}} guide, we {{show you}} how to use the Free Rent Calculator, which provides an accurate, visual means to quantify the impact of concessions in commercial leases based on the market conditions and landlord’s risk profile. The calculator allows both landlords and tenants to benchmark the impact of free rent, tenant improvements, and <b>moving</b> <b>allowance</b> on a given set of the asking and offering rents. The calculator determines the resulting effective rent, which is equivalent to the tenant paying a constant base rent over the entire lease term. 1 The effective rent serves as a comparison benchmark, allowing users to quickly see the impact of changes to the asking rent and concession package. The tool works by allowing users to specify the structure of the rental payments, tenant improvements (TIs), and the <b>moving</b> <b>allowance,</b> and then computes the maximum free rent period in light of the specified lease terms and concessions. Landlords can use the tool to fine-tune the concession package by determining the appropriate level of free rent that seems attractive without increasing exposure to tenant default. Tenants can use the tool to optimize the free rent and concession structure to create the most desirable pattern of monthly cash outflows from the available options...|$|E

50|$|Moving Attendance Allowance {{from the}} welfare system into {{mainstream}} health and care has been proposed {{by a number of}} commentators, including the 2014 Barker commission {{on the future of the}} NHS and social care, set up by the King's Fund. The commission said that <b>moving</b> Attendance <b>Allowance</b> to local government would “help create the simpler, graduated pathway of support that we seek”. In 2015 the government proposed to give local councils responsibility for paying the benefit.|$|R
30|$|A {{question}} that then must be answered is why single term governors do not adjust to lax monitoring {{in the same}} way as multi-term governors–i.e. why do single term governors appear to reduce allowance rates even when monitoring is relatively low. A key issue may be the information governors have about the targeted rate from the SSA and what allowance rate level constitutes a small versus a large deviation from the targeted rate. Second term and later governors have much more information having had signals from the SSA about the likelihood of detection and therefore adjust DI rates much more as economic/political needs arise. First-term governors may be wary of <b>moving</b> DI <b>allowance</b> rates in because they do not have enough information about how the Social Security Administration will react. Thus we see much more movement and larger differences by governor term length during periods of little scrutiny and reduced monitoring.|$|R
