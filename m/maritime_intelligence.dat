2500|$|According to {{the head}} of the UN's counter-piracy division, Colonel John Steed, the Al-Shabaab group in 2011 {{increasingly}} sought to cooperate with the pirate gangs in the face of dwindling funds and resources for their own activities. Steed, however, acknowledged that he had no definite proof of operational ties between the pirates and the Islamist militants. Detained pirates also indicated to UNODC officials that some measure of cooperation with Al-Shabaab militants was necessary, as they have increasingly launched maritime raids from areas in southern Somalia controlled by the insurgent outfit. Al-Shabaab members have also extorted the pirates, demanding protection money from them and forcing seized pirate gang leaders in Harardhere to hand over 20% of future ransom proceeds. It has been suggested that al-Qaeda have received funding from pirate operations. A <b>maritime</b> <b>intelligence</b> source told CBS News that it was [...] "'inconceivable' to Western intelligence agencies that al Qaeda would not be getting some financial reward from the successful hijackings". They go on to express concern about this funding link being able to keep the group satisfied as piracy gains more publicity and higher ransoms.|$|E

Using a participatory design approach, the researchers partnered with federal and commercial stakeholders to assess the information sharing needs of security personnel in this port region. The research design included an issues workshop, field studies of port personnel, and local networking events. The findings indicate the need for increased interagency collaboration in maritime domain awareness (MDA) and highlight local recommended practices and incentives for information sharing with the private sector. In addition, we gathered usability data on two federal policies/programs. The Maritime Information Sharing Taskforce (MIST) is an interagency effort to capture best practices in information sharing, create a structure for collaborative problem solving, and convey unique local issues to national policy makers. The MIST team is led by the Maritime Defense and Security Research Program (MDSRP) at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in partnership with several federal agencies: the Maritime Administration (MARAD), the Office of Global Maritime Situational Awareness (OGMSA), Global <b>Maritime</b> and Air <b>Intelligence</b> Integration (GMAII), the U.

40|$|March 29, 2007 The National Academies {{have defined}} Spatial Literacy as constituting {{proficiency}} {{in terms of}} spatial knowledge and skills, spatial ways of thinking, and spatial capabilities.

Geospatial and Remote Sensing technologies are necessary components to fulfilling USCG???s <b>Maritime</b> Domain Awareness, <b>Intelligence,</b> and Command and Control mission requirements, have become a integral part of our Deepwater platforms and Sector Command Centers, and are used for situational awareness and effective communications during every phase of emergency/disaster planning and response by our local, state, and federal partners. Therefore, USCG watchstanders and decision-makers will need technical expertise in these systems {{in order to understand}} their effective use for mission accomplishment, and the need for officers {{with a high degree of}} spatial literacy and proficiency in these technologies will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. To meet this need for ???spatially literate??? officers, the U. S. Coast Guard Academy Science Department began offering an Introduction to Geospatial Sciences course for students in its Marine and Environmental Sciences (MES) major in the spring of 2003. To further develop the spatial literacy of students in the MES major, the faculty within the Science Department have embarked on an effort to examine the development of spatial literacy in a more systematic fashion across the MES curriculum. Future efforts and activities are aimed at examining the development of spatial literacy across the entire Coast Guard Academy curriculum. The overall goal of these efforts is not to develop Geographic Information System (GIS) Technicians fully proficient in the use of GIS. Rather, the aim of these efforts is to develop ???spatially literate???
