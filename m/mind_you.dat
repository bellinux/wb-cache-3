Everything else is human weakness. Accepting prizes is showing weakness.” The article is accompanied by a full page cartoon that has garnered controversy, discussed below.|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{preceding the}} Act II finale, starting with [...] "Here, take her sir, and <b>mind</b> <b>you</b> treat her kindly", was originally recitative. The music for this passage was {{printed in the}} first edition of the vocal score as No. 20a. Shortly after opening night, the recitative was dropped, and the lines thereafter were performed as spoken dialogue. In modern productions, the recitative is occasionally restored in place of the dialogue.|$|E

500|$|This {{species is}} often listed in field guides as inedible, or not {{recommended}} for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is {{not as bad as}} I {{thought it was going to}} be.

500|$|Nelson and his {{partners}} settled on the beach by the Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the late 1920s. Bessie DuBois, wife of John DuBois, recalled seeing {{him for the first}} time in 1927 or 1928. The DuBoises owned a restaurant that Nelson would frequent, and Bessie made note of his eccentric eating habits: [...] "He would order a pie—not a piece of pie, <b>mind</b> <b>you,</b> but a pie—and he'd eat the whole thing right in front of me." [...] He ate ice cream by the half-gallon, and there were stories that he once ate 18 eggs for breakfast.|$|E

500|$|While calling Undone MercyMe's [...] "most satisfying" [...] {{record to}} date, Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today {{regarded}} the songwriting as [...] "monotonous" [...] {{and felt that}} MercyMe was [...] "beginning to sound like they're repeating themselves". Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars, opining that [...] "Frankly, {{this is the same}} stuff they were doing three years and two albums ago... If you’re a diehard MercyMe fan, this disc will be music to your ears. But {{for those of us who}} long for change (Not drastic ones, <b>mind</b> <b>you.</b> But small, significant ones.), Undone seems redundant. It’s still good, but it’s beginning to become stale".|$|E

[...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave it 3 out of 5, while commenting, [...] "Agneepath, less of a remake, more of a tribute. The makers of Agneepath should have just called it Dharmapath." [...] Kunal Guha of Yahoo.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that, [...] "The biggest dilemma of remaking a movie is how much to retain and what to retain. If the new story takes violent shifts, you lose the {{audience}} who came to revisit the original. If you photocopy scene-by-scene, you risk failing to connect with the audience who is accustomed to present sensibilities. The only safe bet: a ‘khichdi’ of the past and the present, like this one." ...|$|E
500|$|During development, Mahito Yokota, who was {{in charge}} of the musical direction, {{originally}} wanted Super Mario Galaxy to have a Latin American style of music; and even had composed 28 tracks in that style. Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous Super Mario instalments, such as steelpans, bongo drums, and congas. For Super Mario Galaxys theme, Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films. The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi, the game's director and designer, but when Yokota presented it to the game's sound supervisor, Koji Kondo, he stated that it was [...] "no good". When asked why his music was rejected, Kondo responded: [...] "if somewhere in your <b>mind</b> <b>you</b> have an image that Mario is cute, please get rid of it". Incensed by the rejection, Yokota almost resigned from his job, but Kondo implied that Mario's character was [...] "cool" [...] and instructed him to try again.|$|E

500|$|Ruby later {{starts to}} have {{feelings}} for Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell). Of the storyline Breeds states: [...] "It's {{going to be}} the easiest thing I've ever had to do. There's no acting involved at all. But he's got a girlfriend so Ruby has {{to find a way to}} justify going after someone who has a girlfriend. So that's kind of hard. But he's the hero. She believes he's the love of her life. I guess with that in <b>mind</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't let anything get in the way of that. Who knows, he might be." [...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E
500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with Kerrang! magazine, Manson described {{the sound of}} the album as being [...] "very cinematic", saying that the [...] "redneck in me comes out in my voice" [...] owing to the album's inclusion of blues influences, while still retaining the harder elements of previous work. The album has been compared to the music which was used to soundtrack Sons of Anarchy. Manson called himself [...] "a man of few words" [...] , opting to allow melody to be its primary focus, instead of using characters or extended metaphors to compose lyrics. Lyrics for the album were all derived from a single notebook, with Manson admitting that the content of previous work was too scattered, as they were composed of material taken from up to 20 different notebooks. He has described it as being intentionally sparse lyrically, elaborating that blues music stems from the [...] "guttural, visceral element of music. I [...] holes in these stories so it becomes your story, it becomes more cinematic. For example in the film Rosemary's Baby, you don't see the baby but in your <b>mind</b> <b>you</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|Keenor's {{abilities}} {{were described}} as scant. A 'terrible' shot and unable to reliably run with the ball, his strength lay in {{his commitment to the}} cause and in his uncompromising tackling. Fred Stewart, who coached Keenor for over 15 years at Cardiff City stated [...] "I honestly do not believe the word [...] "beaten" [...] is in his vocabulary." [...] Former team mate, Ernie Curtis said of him: [...] "He was one of the hardest tacklers in the game, some said he was dirty but he was just hard. Nobody took liberties with old Fred... could run all night, he couldn't run with the ball <b>mind</b> <b>you,</b> but he could run all day." [...] Charlie Buchan, captain of the opposing Arsenal side in the 1927 FA Cup final, described Keenor as having [...] "a store of energy (that) seemed inexhaustible in defending his goal". His hard tackling style made him a target for opposition fans, even being assaulted after a match for Crewe Alexandra during the later years of his career after a physical performance against an opposition side angered some of their fans.|$|E

500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's <b>mind.</b> <b>You</b> can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E

2500|$|According to Michael Tomasello, the key {{cognitive}} capacity distinguishing Homo sapiens {{from our}} ape cousins is [...] "intersubjectivity". This entails turn-taking and role-reversal: your partner strives {{to read your}} <b>mind,</b> <b>you</b> simultaneously strive to read theirs, and each of you makes {{a conscious effort to}} assist the other in the process. The outcome is that each partner forms a representation of the other's mind in which their own can be discerned by reflection.|$|E

If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; {{but if you have}} the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced <b>mind,</b> <b>you</b> will say 'frumious'." ...|$|E
