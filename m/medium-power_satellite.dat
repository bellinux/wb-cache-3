5000|$|After {{withdrawing}} from politics in 1984, Pierre Werner continued to assume some official duties and pursue cultural activities.From 1985 to 1987, he was Chairman of the Governing Board of the Compagnie luxembourgeoise de télédiffusion (CLT, Radio Luxembourg). Werner placed Luxembourg {{on the map}} of global satellite communications.From 1989 to 1996, he was Chairman of the board directors of the Société européenne des satellites, becoming Honorary chairman in 1996. During this last term of office, he had laid the ground {{for the establishment of}} this company. He worked hard both within Luxembourg [...] and abroad to realise his vision for a <b>medium-power</b> <b>satellite</b> in Luxembourg, enabling his country to become a forerunner in global satellite telecommunications.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the {{government}} involved itself in an up-and-coming sector, satellite broadcasting. At {{a conference of}} the members of the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva in 1977, Luxembourg was attributed five channels for direct satellite broadcasting. The Luxembourgish State initially intended to allocate them to the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion (CLT). However, the company's shareholders feared the risks and expenses involved with a satellite. At the same time, the French government exerted strong pressure to the extent that Luxembourg abandoned its own plans, and offered CLT the possibility of being involved in the French satellite TDF-1. This led the Luxembourgish government to turn to an American expert, Clay T. Whitehead, who advocated the concept of a <b>medium-power</b> <b>satellite</b> and created a consulting group, Coronet Research. His satellite plan was finally taken up by the Santer government, and its realisation entrusted to the Société européenne des satellites (SES).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, four large American cable {{companies}} launched PrimeStar, a direct broadcasting company using <b>medium-power</b> <b>satellites.</b> The relatively strong transissions allowed {{the use of}} smaller (90 cm) dishes {{for the first time}} in North America. Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of Hughes' DirecTV. DirecTV acquired USSB on 14 December 1998 for $1.3 billion and PrimeStar in 1999 for $1.83 billion.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} attempt for a North American {{digital signal}} encryption and compression standard was DigiCipher 1, {{which was used}} most notably in the now-defunct PrimeStar <b>medium-power</b> direct broadcast <b>satellite</b> (DBS) system during the early 1990s. The DCII standard predates wide acceptance of DVB-based digital terrestrial television compression (although not cable or satellite DVB) and therefore is incompatible with the DVB standard.|$|R
