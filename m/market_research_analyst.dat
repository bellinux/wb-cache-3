USDA publications and data are {{the primary source of}} information. Regression analysis, ben-efit/cost analysis, and present value/rate of retum analysis are skills desired for either type of <b>analyst</b> position. <b>Market</b> <b>research</b> <b>analysts</b> require kills for id ntifying groups with similar buying habits and preparing marke ¡ plans.

Producers are increas-ingly expected to manage their own risk, and commerdal producers are becoming more spedalized with respect o production operations. In a 1998 survey, Akridge et al. reported that almost 60 % of large commerdal crop producers who responded to a survey used a paid consultant and expected that by the year 2003, 75 % would be using a paid consultant. Marketing, management, and environmental consul-tants had the highest expected growth over the next five years. The tasks and responsibilities performed by these consultants would likely include price analysis and other skills typically taught in agricultural economics curricula. An increased understanding of consumer needs is being used by firms to help reduce marketing costs.

In April 2009, the <b>Market</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Analyst</b> reported that the DoD is set to spend $ 47 billion in healthcare in 2010. Our analysis delves into the medical services procurement practices as well as the surveillance and training measures for the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

The pilot survey gathered empirical data from military organizations responsible for the management and oversight of Federal Service Code Q, medical services. The pilot survey was conducted from October 26 to November 6, 2009 and obtained an 85 % response rate. The results show the Services all use personal and non-personal medical services contracts, and the majority of the contracts are fixed-price. Additionally, the majority of Medical Contracting Commands identified manning shortfalls, healthcare provider salary cap issues, and shortage of trained and experienced contracting personnel as challenges in contracting for medical services.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how {{innovation in}} services is being organised in the telecommunication industry after the bubble burst {{in the beginning}} of the 2000 ’s and how BT is applying the concept of ‘open innovation’ in order to sustain its competitiveness. After the bubble burst {{in the beginning of}} the 2000 ’s, the telecommunications industry is trying to find its way to growth. Internet services and broadband have changed the way customers perceive communication services. Traditional telecommunication companies, like BT, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom have been urging to change in order to survive and sustain its competitiveness. One outcome of the industry was that the traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telecommunications Network) technology was not suitable anymore to deliver the multimedia services demanded by customers. The IP (Internet Protocol) has become an unprecedented agreement in the telecommunications industry and the traditional telecommunications companies started to transform its infrastructure based on this Internet-based technology. While this infrastructure transformation is under way, another huge challenge is to change the way these traditional telecommunications companies create, integrate and deliver new services. Service innovation on top of the IP platform is the ultimate challenge. The research was conducted through interviews and analysis of documents such as reports, newspaper articles and official Internet websites. The reports included annual reports of suppliers and incumbent service providers, and documents of regulators. The interviews were conducted with senior managers, managers and other practitioners of incumbent telecommunications service providers and suppliers, regulators, consultants and <b>market</b> <b>research</b> <b>analysts.</b> Initial findings suggest that incumbent telecommunications firms will be increasingly extracting value from platform and software sharing, exposing its ‘capabilities’ to third parties and developing business models to interoperate with other companies, co-creating new services. Thus, the ability to expose their capabilities in services, not to hide them, will be determinant of its success. Also important is the ability to offer integrated solutions to large firms as part of the service portfolio. And, in this context, the concept of open innovation and value innovation also find a fertile ground to be applied in services in the communication industry. Important dynamic capabilities identified in this context are strategic planning, project management, new product/service development (especially software development), supported by systems integration...|$|R
