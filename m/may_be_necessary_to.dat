5|$|Surgical {{exploration}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> {{obtain a}} suitable biopsy and to accurately stage {{a patient with}} cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy {{can be used for}} staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some patients. Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.|$|E

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping {{the rest of the}} paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it was time}} to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A {{significant proportion of}} bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2â€“20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E

5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E
5|$|TBI is {{frequently}} difficult to diagnose and treat. Early diagnosis {{is important to}} prevent complications, which include stenosis (narrowing) of the airway, respiratory tract infection, and damage to the lung tissue. Diagnosis involves procedures such as bronchoscopy, radiography, and x-ray computed tomography to visualize the tracheobronchial tree. Signs and symptoms vary based on the location and severity of the injury; they commonly include dyspnea (difficulty breathing), dysphonia (a condition where the voice can be hoarse, weak, or excessively breathy), coughing, and abnormal breath sounds. In the emergency setting, tracheal intubation {{can be used to}} ensure that the airway remains open. In severe cases, surgery <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> repair a TBI.|$|E
5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
