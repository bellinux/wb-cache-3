500|$|Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. The {{gameplay}} {{centers around}} Sonic's {{ability to run}} at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and vertical loops. The levels are populated with hazards {{in the form of}} robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. [...] Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game. The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by <b>moving</b> <b>walls</b> or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents. Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rotates, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground.|$|E

Mahffey Elementary was built one million dollars under budget, while Klein Cain High School was built 27 million dollars under budget. Additionally, Central Office water and {{sanitary}} facilities were renovated in 2016. Construction of Intermediate School No. 10, located next to Metzler Elementary will be finished by Fall 2018. The building's foundation and walls is currently being built and will feature a robotics space as well as emphasizing small group instruction and transparency. The school {{is estimated to be}} built 1.85 million dollars under budget. Also, Elementary School No. 33's planning has begun with architecture firm IBI Group being awarded to design the school. The campus will be built in August 2019 and will be located across from Zwink Elementary. Another project being currently completed is the new Northcrest Agriculture Facility, which will be built in November 2017. 41,500 square feet of classroom space and a 10,700 square foot gym addition with <b>moving</b> <b>walls</b> for group collaboration is currently being added to Wunderlich Intermediate School, and Klein Forest High School is modernizing CTE classrooms and programs. There will also be new dance and AFJROTC facilities built at Klein Forest.|$|E

Starck, {{known for his}} occasionally risqué design choices, also added a secret [...] "nookie room" [...] hidden behind mirrored panels. Mirrored surfaces feature extensively throughout the interior, along with Baccarat crystal which is used {{not only for the}} glassware and tableware, but for the furniture too. There are six guest suites, although they have <b>moving</b> <b>walls</b> and can be converted to four larger staterooms. Much of the interior design was completed by Aleksandra Melnichenko who, as the owner's new wife, battled with designer Starck over features commissioned when her husband was still a bachelor. The original discothèque was down-sized, while the suites' decor was toned down, although she still featured leather or white stingray hides on the walls and ceilings, and crocodile-skinned furniture. Above-deck there is a helipad and swimming pool forward of the superstructure and two more pools aft, one of which is glass-bottomed and can be viewed from the below-deck disco.|$|E

40|$|A {{modification}} of the one-dimensional Fermi accelerator model is considered in this work. The dynamics of a classical particle of mass m, confined to bounce elastically between two rigid walls where one is described by a non-linear van der Pol type oscillator while {{the other one is}} fixed, working as a re-injection mechanism of the particle for a next collision, is carefully made by the use of a two-dimensional non-linear mapping. Two cases are considered: (i) the situation where the particle has mass negligible as compared to the mass of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> and does not affect the motion of it; (ii) the case where collisions of the particle does affect the movement of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall.</b> For case (i) the phase space is of mixed type leading us to observe a scaling of the average velocity {{as a function of the}} parameter (ḩi̧) controlling the non-linearity of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall.</b> For large ḩi̧, a diffusion on the velocity is observed leading us to conclude that Fermi acceleration is taking place. On the other hand for case (ii), the motion of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> is affected by collisions with the particle. However due to the properties of the van der Pol oscillation, the <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> relaxes again to a limit cycle. Such kind of motion absorbs part of the energy of the particle leading to a suppression of the unlimited energy gain as observed in case (i). The phase space shows a set of attractors of different periods whose basin of attraction has a complicate organization...|$|R

30|$|The {{shortening}} {{rate that}} {{was observed in}} the natural subduction zone and the shortening rate in this model were set to be equal in the normalized timescale by the displacement of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall.</b> The wedge deformations in the natural geological structures and the numerical simulation were derived from the shortening of the plate subduction zone and the <b>moving</b> <b>wall,</b> respectively. The shortening rate in the plate subduction zone was 4 [*]cm/year in the Nankai Trough, southwest Japan (Seno et al. 1993), whereas the shortening rate of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> was 0.9 [*]cm/step in our simulation timestep. Therefore, to calibrate the shortening rate in this model with that observed in nature, the timescale should be maintained to be 0.225 [*]years/step. Hereafter, the heating duration in the DEM model is maintained to be 0.225 [*]years/step. This normalized timescale reconciles the deformation rate during the simulation of DEM and the heating duration from the thermal model by imitating the deformation rate and heating duration that are observed in nature.|$|R

Because the Doom engine uses the binary space {{partitioning}} system for rendering, {{it does not}} enable <b>moving</b> <b>walls.</b> Hexens <b>moving</b> <b>walls</b> are actually one-sided lines built somewhere else on the map and rendered at the desired start spot when the level is loaded. This enables a pseudo-moving wall, but does not allow moving sectors (such as seeing the tops of moving doors). This often creates problems in sectors containing more than one node, however, explaining the relatively limited use of polyobjects.|$|E

5000|$|If the {{velocity}} {{law of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> is differentiable enough, according to KAM theorem invariant curves in the phase space [...] exist. These invariant curves act as barriers that do not allow for a particle to further accelerate and the average velocity of a population of particles saturates after finite iterations of the map. For instance, for sinusoidal velocity law of the <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> such curves exist, while they do not for sawtooth velocity law that is discontinuous. Consequently, at the first case particles cannot accelerate infinitely, reversely to what happens at the last one.|$|R

40|$|A {{premise of}} {{continuous}} flow electrophoresis is that removal of buoyance-induced thermal convection caused by axial and lateral temperature gradients results in ideal performance of these instruments in space. Although these gravity dependent phenomena disturb the rectilinear {{flow in the}} separation chamber when high voltage gradients or thick chamber are used, distortion of the injected sample stream due to electrodynamic effects cause major broadening of the separated bands. The electrophoresis separation process is simple, however flow local to the sample filament produced by the applied electric field were not considered. These electrohydrodynamic flows distort the sample stream and limit the separation. Also, electroosmosis and viscous flow combine to further distort the process. A <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> concept is being proposed for space which will eliminate and control the disturbances. The <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> entrains the fluid to move as a rigid body and produces a constant residence time for all samples distributed across the chamber thickness. The <b>moving</b> <b>wall</b> electrophoresis chamber can only be operated in space {{because there is no}} viscous flow in the chamber to stabilize against thermal convection...|$|R
