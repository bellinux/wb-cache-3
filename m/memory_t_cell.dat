Both naive and <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were found to recirculate through the gut, although only <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> migrated through the skin. However, when <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from the gut were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate and assessed for their migration back to the gut, it was the memory population which showed a tropism for the gut. Gut-tropic <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> migrated poorly through the skin, indicating that these cells were distinct from skin-tropic <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> This was confirmed by phenotypic analysis.

Here, we show that pronounced recall proliferation potential is indeed key for protection against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which replicates in central lymphoid organs and is controlled by contact-dependent lysis of infected cells. In contrast, recall proliferation competence is not sufficient for protection against vaccinia virus, which is replicating in peripheral solid organs and is controlled by cytokines. To protect against vaccinia virus, high numbers of effector-like <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were required to be present in peripheral tissue before viral challenge.

50|$|Immunological memory: While the {{property}} of memory in the adaptive system had been known for decades, it was Lanzavecchia’s laboratory that described in humans a fundamental division of <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> into two major subtypes, central memory and effector <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> which play distinct roles in secondary immune responses (11). He proposed that central <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> which migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, represent memory stem cells responsible for recall responses and the long-term maintenance of the memory pool. In contrast, effector <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that home to peripheral tissues provide immediate protection but have shorter lifespan and reconstitution capacity. Based on original studies on the roles of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor triggering, sustained signalling and costimulation in <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation (12-14), Lanzavecchia also proposed a progressive model of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation to explain the generation of central and effector <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> within a single clone of antigen-primed <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> (15).

5000|$|A {{subsequently}} expanding {{field of}} research confirmed that TNF is a mediator of septic shock (similar {{to the effects of}} directly administering TNF to mammals), but not sepsis. This prompted Tracey to search for another mediator of sepsis, culminating in 1999 with the identification of HMGB1, a protein previously known as a DNA-binding transcription factor, as a mediator and drug target in sepsis. [...] Reasoning that evolution must have favored physiological mechanisms to maintain homeostasis, Tracey proposed a mechanism for neural control of TNF and HMGB1 to maintain immunological homeostasis. Termed the [...] "inflammatory reflex", action potentials carried in the vagus nerve inhibit cytokine release and innate immunity. The neurophysiological mechanism is dependent upon action potentials transmitted in the vagus nerve which activate release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that interacts with alpha-7 nicotinic receptors expressed on the cell surface of macrophages that produce TNF and other cytokines. The interaction of acetylcholine with alpha-7 nicotinic receptors prevents cytokine release by downregulating nuclear activation of NFkB. Stimulating the vagus nerve inhibits potentially damaging cytokine responses, and protects against organ damage caused by unregulated or excessive cytokine release. In 2011 Tracey and his colleagues Mauricio Rosas-Ballina and Peder Olofsson discovered a <b>memory</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subset that secretes acetylcholine in the spleen when activated by signals arising in the vagus nerve.
