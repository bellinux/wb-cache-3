The {{interest}} in photochromic molecules {{and the study}} of their conformation changes upon irradiation with light, is motivated mainly by the potential influence of these changes on the molecular physical properties. Indeed, diarylethene based ligands have lately received much attention as they are promising candidates to build magnetic molecular switches. Complexes of such ligands are envisaged to change reversibly their magnetic properties as the diarylethene moiety undergoes the cyclization and vice versa under UV-vis light irradiation. On the other hand, molecular complexes exhibiting spin crossover (SCO) are receiving a renewed interest since it is now possible to control the SCO phenomena not only by temperature but also by other external stimuli such as light or pressure. The majority of SCO complexes are of Fe, and many pyrazolyl-pyridine diimine groups coordinated to the metal are often used. Hence an N-based photochromic ligand with similar pyrazolyl-pyridine <b>moeities</b> might provide multifunctional coordination compounds. To this aim, a new diarylethene based ligand (L) has been synthesized and characterized (Figure 1). The ligand exhibits photoswitching both in solution and in the solid state, changing from brown to purple when the cyclization takes place. This ligand has been used in a coordination reaction with Fe(II) leading to the dinuclear complex helicate in Figure 2. The magnetic and optical properties of this novel multifunctional assembly will be presented. We are grateful to the Spanish and Catalan governments for financial support. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Tamm Horsfall mucoprotein (THP) is a {{powerful}} inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystallisation. Since urolithiasis in South African blacks is extremely rare, this study was undertaken to compare the relative inhibitory and biochemical properties of this protein in South African black and white healthy and stone—forn 1 ing male subjects. THP was isolated by salt precipitation, puriﬁed by column chromatography and veriﬁed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} the molecular weights of the protein from each group and their respective amino acids were analysed. All four THP groups were subjected to tryptic ﬁnger printing digestion and matched those of the database. The secondary structures of the four THP proteins were also determined using circular dichroism. The carbohydrate <b>moeities</b> of the four THP groups were analysed for and O-linked oligosaccharides. THP from each of the four groups were subjected to a series of crystallisation experiments using a crossover design in which the protein was added to the urine from which it had been originally isolated, {{as well as to the}} urines from the other three groups. This process generated a 4 x 4 protein-urine grid for investigation of the inhibitory properties of THP in different urine environments. Calcium oxalate crystallization was induced by administration of aqueous sodium oxalate and was monitored Using a Coulter Counter. In another series of experiments 14 C-oxalate was used to initiate crystallization. Monitoring in these experiments was achieved by scintillation counter techniques. Calcium oxalate crystal aggregation was investigated in the presence and absence of THP using zeta potential measurements and crystal sedimentation experiments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRas {{proteins}} regulate cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Their activities {{depend on}} their anchorage to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, which is promoted by their common carboxy-terminal S-farnesylcysteine and either a stretch of lysine residues (K-Ras 4 B) or S-palmitoyl moieties (H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras 4 A). We previously demonstrated dislodgment of H-Ras from EJ cell membranes by S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), and proposed that FTS disrupts the interactions between the S-prenyl moiety of Ras and the membrane anchorage domains. In support of this hypothesis, we now show that FTS, {{which is not a}} farnesyltransferase inhibitor, inhibits growth of NIH 3 T 3 cells transformed by the non-palmitoylated K-Ras 4 B(12 V) or by its farnesylated, but unmethylated, K-Ras 4 B(12) CVYM mutant. The growth-inhibitory effects of FTS followed the dislodgment and accelerated degradation of K-Ras 4 B(12 V), leading in turn to a decrease in its amount in the cells and inhibition of MAPK activity. FTS did not affect the rate of degradation of the K-Ras 4 B, SVIM mutant which is not modified post-translationally, suggesting that only farnesylated Ras isoforms are substrates for facilitated degradation. The putative Ras-recognition sites (within domains in the cell membrane) appear to tolerate both C 15 and C 20 S-prenyl <b>moeities,</b> since geranylgeranyl thiosalicylic acid mimicked the growth-inhibitory effects of FTS in K-Ras 4 B(12 V) -transformed cells and FTS inhibited the growth of cells transformed by the geranylgeranylated K-Ras 4 B(12 V) CVIL isoform. The results suggest that FTS acts as a domain-targeted compound that disrupts Ras–membrane interactions. The fact that FTS can target K-Ras 4 B(12 V), which is insensitive to inhibition by farnesyltransfarase inhibitors, suggests that FTS may target Ras (and other prenylated proteins important for transformed cell growth) in an efficient manner that speaks well for its potential as an anticancer therapeutic agent...|$|R
