50|$|Reproduction {{for this}} {{parasite}} is unique {{because of the}} hermaphroditic nature of this cestode. When it comes to <b>mating,</b> <b>S.</b> solidus has three options: (1) self-fertilization (2) breeding with a sibling (3) breeding with an unrelated individual. There are advantages and disadvantages {{to each of these}} three options. For example, self-fertilization is advantageous when no mating partners are around but it is disadvantageous because of inbreeding depression—the reduced fitness of offsprings because of the unmasking of deleterious recessive alleles due to the breeding of closely related individuals. Another disadvantage of self-fertilization is not having the ability to exchange genes with other cestodes which leads to increased genetic variation.|$|R

40|$|Analytic {{solutions}} are {{obtained for the}} equilibria of a simple two-locus, heterotic selection model with mixed selfing and random outcrossing. Two general phenomena are possible, depending upon the viabilities {{and the degree of}} selfing: (1) Negative disequilibrium potential, under which only gametic disequilibrium is possible; and (2) positive disequilibrium potential, which can result in permanent gametic disequilibrium provided that linkage is sufficiently tight. Under random <b>mating</b> (<b>s</b> = 0), these two situations correspond to negative and positive additive epistasis, respectively. With partial self-fertilization, however, this is no longer true, and a more appropriate measure of gametc disequilibrium potential, Δ(s), is introduced. A numerically aided examination of the model results in the discovery of two new properties of partial selfing with selection: (1) With negative disequilibrium potential (Δ(s) 0), the opposite is true. (2) Gametic disequilibrium can increase or decrease as the degree of selfing is increased. Therefore, it is apparent that partial selfing and linkage are not analogous as regards the maintenance of disequilibrium...|$|R

Under physiological conditions, nonequilibrium dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton leads to 1. 5 -fold enhancement of the long-time mitochondrial diffusion coefficient and a transient subdiffusive temporal scaling of the mean-square displacement (MSD ∝ τα, with α =  2 / 3). We find that nonequilibrium forces associated with actin polymerization are a predominant factor in driving mitochondrial transport.

Domestic deliveries of tropical (light-meat) tuna (bigeye, blackfin, bluefin, skipjack, and yellowfin) were 251, 000 tons, up 12 percent. Contract prices for tuna delivered by U. S. vessels to U.

Depending {{on the size of}} fish in the delivery, ex-vessel prices of white-meat tuna increased as much as 27 percent, and prices of light-meat tuna increased as much as 47 percent. U. <b>S.</b> cannery <b>receipts</b> of imported and domestically caught raw frozen tuna for canning totaled 532, 704 tons in 1987, up 2 percent from 1986 levels. U. <b>S.</b> cannery <b>receipts</b> of white-meat tuna were 104, 197 tons, down 10 percent from 1986. Imports made up 97 percent of the total cannery supply.

40|$|Saccharomyces kluyveri is a heterothallic yeast {{with two}} allelic mating types denoted as a-k and α-k by analogy with Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{and from the}} work {{described}} here. <b>S.</b> kluyveri produces <b>mating</b> pheromones analogous to those of S. cerevisiae, but which appear to have different specificity. S. kluyveri thus differs from S. cerevisiae, Hansenula wingei, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe in that it exhibits both strong constitutive agglutination and mating pheromones. α-k cells produce a pheromone (“α-k-factor”) which causes a-k cells to arrest in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle and to undergo a morphological change. After {{a period of time}} dependent on the concentration of α-k-factor, cells exposed to the factor resume cell division. α-k-factor has no effect on a-k/α-k diploids or on α-k cells, but at high concentration does induce G 1 arrest of S. cerevisiaea cells (a-c). a-k cells produce a pheromone (“a-k-factor”) which causes α-k cells to exhibit a morphological change. In addition, a-k cells exhibit the Bar phenotype with respect to α-k-factor. Partially purified preparations of S. cerevisiae α-factor are more active in inducing G 1 arrest of a-k cells than of a-c cells. A more purified preparation of α-c-factor is less active against a-k cells than a-c cells, suggesting that an additional factor (KRE, kluyveri response enhancer) may be lost during purification. Attempts to <b>mate</b> <b>S.</b> kluyveri and S. cerevisiae cells by prototroph selection and by cell-to-cell mating have been unsuccessful with all combinations of <b>mating</b> types.

40|$|The {{market for}} the {{licensing}} of intellectual property and other intangibles is growing rapidly in the United States. At {{the same time there}} is increasing interest in the value of these intangible assets and their impact on economic growth, productivity, and competitiveness. Despite this interest there are large gaps in the available data to track and evaluate the impact of intangibles and intellectual property on the economy. This paper describes the measurement challenges and presents both aggregate and industrial sector preliminary estimates of receipts of royalties and license fees. These estimates can be used to better assess the macroeconomic impact of intangibles and to trace the flows and impacts across industries. This paper uses previously unpublished estimates of BEA International Services trade data for royalty and licensing fees by industry sector to improve the current output measures for domestic producers of intellectual property by estimating the share of royalty income earned by different types of intangible assets for 2002. These assets are patents and trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, and franchised business formats. The estimates show that U. <b>S.</b> <b>receipts</b> for the use of these intellectual property assets totaled approximately $ 92 billion dollars in 2002; this compares with rental and leasing receipts for automobiles, machinery, computers, and other equipment of $ 95. 1 billion dollars in 2002...|$|R
40|$|Zebra finches are monogamous birds {{living in}} large assemblies, which {{represent}} {{a source of}} confusion for recognition between mates.

By analysing the acoustic structure of male calls, we investigated the existence of an individual signature and identified the involved acoustic cues. We tested to see if females can identify their mates {{on the basis of their}} calls alone, and performed preliminary experiments using modified signals to investigate the acoustic basis of this recognition. Playback tests carried on six individuals showed that a female zebra finch is able to perform the call-based recognition of its mate. Our experiments suggested that the female uses both the energy spectrum and the frequency modulation of the male signal.
