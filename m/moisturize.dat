25|$|Patients {{are usually}} given {{a course of}} {{antibiotic}} and anti-inflammatory eye drops. These are continued in the weeks following surgery. Patients are told to rest and are given dark eyeglasses to protect their eyes from bright lights and occasionally protective goggles to prevent rubbing of the eyes when asleep and to reduce dry eyes. They also are required to <b>moisturize</b> the eyes with preservative-free tears and follow directions for prescription drops. Occasionally after the procedure a bandage contact lens is placed to aid the healing, and typically removed after 3–4 days. Patients should be adequately informed by their surgeons {{of the importance of}} proper post-operative care to minimize the risk of complications.|$|E
25|$|Africans {{captured}} {{as slaves}} {{no longer had}} the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. Slaves adapted as best they could under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece carding tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and infestations due to their deplorable living conditions. Slaves used varying remedies for disinfecting and cleansing their scalps, such as applying kerosene or cornmeal directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. For field work, male slaves shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. House slaves had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore wigs mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or braided their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as lard, butter and goose grease, were used to <b>moisturize</b> the hair. Female slaves sometimes used hot butterknives to curl their hair.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} {{changes of}} humidity and compressive force values in pea seeds <b>moisturized</b> {{and subjected to}} thermal processing using IR radiation vs. thermally unprocessed ones. Seeds were heated in a device designed for IR processing. The material prepared {{in such a way}} was <b>moisturized</b> at different temperatures. During <b>moisturizing,</b> the humidity and compression force were recorded. The achieved data revealed a consider-able impact of IR heating on the pea seeds <b>moisturizing</b> process. The preliminarily heated by IR radiation peas absorbed water faster during <b>moisturizing</b> and were characterized by lower resistance to compression. Key words: compression strength, IR radiation, moisture content, pea seeds...|$|R
50|$|A natural <b>moisturizing</b> factor (NMF) and {{humectant}} {{that attracts}} and binds {{moisture in the}} stratum corneum (outer-most layer of epidermis), helping to keep it hydrated. It is commonly used as an <b>moisturizing</b> agent in lotions, creams, and cosmetics.|$|R
500|$|It {{is normal}} {{for a white}} or {{slightly}} yellow discharge to be noticeable on the jewellery, as the sebaceous glands produce an oily substance meant to protect and <b>moisturize</b> the wound. While these sebum deposits may be expected for some time, {{only a small amount}} of pus, which is a sign of inflammation or infection, should be expected, and only within the initial phase. While sometimes difficult to distinguish, sebum is [...] "more solid and cheeselike and has a distinctive rotten odour", according to The Piercing Bible.|$|E

2500|$|The lack of hair {{leads to}} a {{reputation}} for being clean, for being easy to wash with a sponge, and for a natural lack of fleas or other parasites. They also do not cause typical allergic reactions to dog-sensitive humans because they lack the normal dog dander. [...] Despite this, the dog needs care, but in another way. The skin should be washed {{from time to time to}} remove dirt and prevent clogging of pores. Baby cleaners are a good choice provided that they do not contain lanolin. Some dogs are prone to have acne or at least blackheads. The skin sometimes becomes too dry and can then be treated with moisturizing cream. Again, baby lotion without lanolin is a good product choice to soften and <b>moisturize</b> cleansed skin. [...] The dogs themselves seem to prefer olive, vegetable or coconut oil, possibly because of the perfumes and other chemicals found in commercial moisturizing creams.|$|E
50|$|Corneocytes contain small {{molecules}} called natural <b>moisturizing</b> factors, which absorb {{small amounts of}} water into the corneocytes thereby hydrating the skin. The natural <b>moisturizing</b> factor {{is a collection of}} water-soluble compounds produced from the degradation of histidine-rich proteins called filaggrin, which are responsible for aggregating keratin filaments to form keratin bundles that maintain the rigid structure of the cells in stratum corneum. When filaggrin is degraded, urea, pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (1,2), glutamic acid and other amino acids are produced. These are collectively referred to as the ‘natural <b>moisturizing</b> factor’ of the skin. The components of the natural <b>moisturizing</b> factor absorb water from the atmosphere to ensure that the superficial layers of the stratum corneum stay hydrated. As they are water-soluble themselves, excessive water contact may leach them and inhibit their normal functions which is why prolonged contact with water makes the skin drier. The intercellular lipid layer helps prevent the loss of natural <b>moisturizing</b> factor by sealing the outside of each corneocyte.|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: A Stereomicroscopic Test for <b>Moisturizing</b> Efficacy {{has been}} developed, {{which is based}} upon the ability of moisturizers to prevent or {{alleviate}} soap-induced dry skin using the back of the hand as a substrate. The method is founded on objective definitions of the terms "dry skin " and "moisturizer. " These definitions do not apply any particular etiology of the condition, nor do they imply any particular mechanism of efficacy in treatment. One advantage of this procedure is that it permits comparative efficacy measurements on <b>moisturizing</b> preparations regardless of their form or water content. Another is, that by means of this test using panels of small size, information is generated, which could otherwise be obtained only through clinical testing on large populations. A numerical grading system for relative skin dryness has been developed by means of which a numerical measure of <b>moisturizing</b> efficacy is obtained. Computerized statistical analysis of the data is performed when two materials are compared for <b>moisturizing</b> efficacy...|$|R
