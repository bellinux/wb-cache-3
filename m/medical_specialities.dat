25|$|To {{a certain}} extent, medical {{practitioners}} {{have always been}} specialized. According to Galen, specialization was common among Roman physicians. The particular system of modern <b>medical</b> <b>specialities</b> evolved gradually during the 19th century. Informal social recognition of medical specialization evolved before the formal legal system. The particular subdivision {{of the practice of}} medicine into various specialities varies from country to country, and is somewhat arbitrary.|$|E
25|$|The EEG is read by a {{clinical}} neurophysiologist or neurologist (depending on local custom and law regarding <b>medical</b> <b>specialities),</b> optimally {{one who has}} specific training {{in the interpretation of}} EEGs for clinical purposes. This is done by visual inspection of the waveforms, called graphoelements. The use of computer signal processing of the EEG—so-called quantitative electroencephalography—is somewhat controversial when used for clinical purposes (although there are many research uses).|$|E
25|$|Pediatric {{endocrinology}} {{became a}} recognizable specialty in the 1950s, {{but did not}} reach board status in the U.S. until the late 1970s. Even 10 years later, as a cognitive, procedureless specialty dealing with mostly rare diseases, {{it was one of}} the smallest, lowest-paid, and more obscure of the <b>medical</b> <b>specialities.</b> Pediatric endocrinologists were the only physicians interested in the arcana of GH metabolism and children’s growth , but their previously academic arguments took on new practical significance with major financial implications.|$|E

25|$|As midwifery {{began to}} develop so did the {{profession}} of obstetrics {{near the end of}} the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But the specialty was still behind in its development stages in comparison to other <b>medical</b> <b>specialities,</b> and remained a generality in this era. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in asepsis and anaesthesia, which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the Caesarean Section.|$|E

25|$|The {{course of}} study lasts 6 years or 12 semesters. During the first 3 years, {{students}} are engaged in pre-clinical courses (Anatomy, Histology, Chemistry, Physics, Cell Biology, Genetics, Physiology, Biochemistry, Immunology, Pathologic Physiology And Anatomy, Pharmacology, Microbiology, etc.). Contact with patients begins at the third year. The remaining 3 years are composed of rotations at various departments, such as Internal Medicine, Neurology, Radiology, Dermatology, Psychiatry, Surgery, Pediatrics, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Anesthesiology, and others. During each academic year, students also enroll into two or three elective courses. After each rotation, the students take {{a total of about}} 60 exams. In the end, the students must pass a final multiple-choice exam comprising questions about clinical courses, after which they finally gain an MD, and the title of Doctor of Medicine, which they put after their name. Now the doctors must complete a one-year, supervised, paid internship in a hospital of their choice, after which they take the state (license) examination, which is an eight-part oral examination containing the eight most important clinical branches. After that, the doctors are eligible to practice medicine as general practitioners. Residencies are offered at various hospitals throughout Croatia, and at numerous <b>medical</b> <b>specialities.</b>|$|E
