Finishing work must be original and to correspond magistracy work situation and requirements. This work beginning (introduction) from work purpose and its problems. At first chapter is write about women’s assortment was do construction analyse {{and how it}} was did. In second chapter (Exploratory and results) we can ready about what kind of women assortment will be exploratory and what country methods is selected. Exploration was doing three steps: analytic and graphics analyse and expert’s poll. In this chapter generalize get results. In third chapter write requirements what have correspond assortment and in this chapter can find women’s jackets analogue. This analogue was choose designer create jackets. For analogy was created collection. Shortly write what was make designing. We can find <b>mould</b> <b>table.</b> In final section presents conclusions, which must be reflected was to do in this work...|$|E

50|$|St Mary's is {{constructed}} in flint with stone dressings and tiled roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} two-bay nave, north and south transepts, a chancel with a north vestry, and a west tower. The tower has angle buttresses, and a west doorway over which is a two-light window. On {{the north and south}} sides are lancet windows. Towards the top of the tower is a <b>moulded</b> corbel <b>table.</b> There are semicircular single-light windows above and below the corbel table. At the summit of the tower is a shallow gable and a moulded parapet. Along the sides of the nave are two-light windows. In the transepts are single-light windows on the east and west sides, and two-light windows on the north and south sides. The chancel has a south blocked doorway, and a large east window. Above the east window is a plaque inscribed with a date.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of brick masonry {{are influenced by}} the properties of bricks and mortar. This paper attempts at studying the properties of brick masonry using <b>table</b> <b>moulded</b> bricks and wire-cut bricks of India with various types of mortars. The strength and elastic modulus of brick masonry under compression have been evaluated for strong-brick soft-mortar and soft-brick strong-mortar combinations. Various sizes of prisms and wallettes have been tested during these experiments to study the size effect and different bonding arrangements. The failure mechanisms of such specimens have been studied. Attempts are also made to derive empirical relationships for masonry strength as a function of brick and mortar strength in the Indian context...|$|R
40|$|Single {{table grape}} berries (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Italia) were {{irradiated}} with ultraviolet-C (UV-C) doses ranging from 0. 125 to 4 kJ m(- 2) and inoculated with Botrytis cinerea. The pathogen was inoculated on artificial wounds {{at different times}} (0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 144 h) after irradiation and the berries were stored either at 21 or 3 degrees C. To check the influence of UV-C irradiation on the wound-healing processes, trials using berries wounded just before the UV-C irradiation and inoculated at different times were also performed. Significantly lower numbers of infected berries and lesion diameter were found in berries treated with UV-C doses ranging from 0. 125 to 0. 5 kJ m(- 2). There was also a significantly lower level of disease in berries inoculated after 24 - 48 h than in those inoculated just after (10 - 15 min) the UV-C treatment. Thus, pretreatment with low UV-C doses followed by artificial inoculation with B. cinerea reduces postharvest grey <b>mould</b> of <b>table</b> grapes, suggesting induced resistance to the disease, both in berries wounded before and after irradiation. The microbial epiphytic population on UV-C-treated berries was also monitored. Results showed a significantly higher increase in the population of yeasts (including yeast-like fungi) and bacteria on berries irradiated with 0. 25 and 0. 5 kJ m(- 2) than on unirradiated control berries.

2500|$|The {{interior}} {{dimensions are}} [...] [...] Its present appearance dates from a reordering in 1877. [...] Across {{the east end}} is a panelled timber gallery and a cornice with decorative moulding. [...] There was originally a baptistery (no longer extant) on the south side. [...] The roof is of the king post type. [...] Fixtures include a 17th-century <b>moulded</b> oak Communion <b>table,</b> wooden pews with straight backs in the gallery, and an 18th-century clock which was originally in Southwick General Baptist Chapel in Wiltshire. [...] As well as the graves and monuments in the burial ground, there are memorials in and on the outside walls of the chapel. [...] Michael Marten (d. 1775), his wife (d. 1785) and six children are commemorated on a stone inside, and {{on the outside of}} the north wall are memorial stones to Josiah (d. 1802) and Sarah (d. 1813) Dancy and an unknown member (whose mid 18th-century memorial is badly weathered).|$|R
40|$|The use {{of plant}} {{extracts}} {{could be a}} useful alternative to synthetic fungicides {{in the management of}} rot fungi during postharvest handling of fruit and vegetables. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the in vitro and in vivo activity of extracts obtained from nine wild edible herbaceous species (Borago officinalis, Orobanche crenata, Plantago coronopus, P. lanceolata, Sanguisorba minor, Silene vulgaris, Sonchus asper, Sonchus oleraceus, and Taraxacum officinale) against some important postharvest pathogens, i. e. Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia taxa, Penicillium digitatum, P. expansum, P. italicum, Aspergillus carbonarius, and A. niger. Phenolic composition of all extracts was evaluated by HPLC. Several derivatives of caffeic acid, of the flavones apigenin and luteolin, and of the flavonols kaempferol and quercetin, were identified. Extracts from S. minor and O. crenata showed the highest efficacy in all the trials. In particular, S. minor completely inhibited in vitro the conidial germination of M. laxa, P. digitatum, P. italicum, and A. niger and strongly reduced those of B. cinerea; O. crenata extract showed a lower but still significant reduction of conidial germination on all the tested fungi. Moreover, the extracts from both species were effective in reducing the germ tube elongation also when a slight inhibition of conidial germination was observed. In many cases, a dose effect was observed, with an increase of antifungal activity as the phenolic concentration increased. In trials performed on wounded fruit, S. minor extract completely inhibited brown rot on apricots and nectarines; O. crenata extract strongly reduced grey mould, brown rot, and green <b>mould</b> on <b>table</b> grapes, apricots and nectarines, and oranges, respectively. The inhibition efficacy of extracts was ascribed to the presence of some caffeic acid derivatives and/or flavonoids. HPLC phenolic analyses provided useful information to identify the possible active compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved...|$|R
