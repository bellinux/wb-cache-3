5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 <b>millimeter</b> anthers hang from recurved, 2 <b>millimeter</b> filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' {{contracts with the}} Defense Department. <b>Millimeter</b> wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities from the late 1950s, when the first military-designation <b>millimeter</b> wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's highest frequency microwave radar. EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{headwaters}} of Little Catawissa Creek and T431, there are 799 brook trout per square kilometer that are shorter than 175 <b>millimeters</b> and 23 per kilometer that are longer. There are 2997 brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 88 that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. In the creek between T431 and T435, there is one brook trout per kilometer that is less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and one per kilometer {{that is more than}} 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. On the other hand, there are 197 brown trout per kilometer less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 25 per kilometer that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. There is one brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and one that is more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. [...] There are 230 brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 31 that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long.|$|R
5000|$|After {{entering}} the human host the larvae mature into adults, commonly in subcutaneous tissue. Adult females measure about 40 to 70 <b>millimeters</b> {{in length and}} 0.5 <b>millimeters</b> in diameter. Males measure some 30 to 34 <b>millimeters</b> by 0.35 to 0.43 <b>millimeters.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest. Doctors {{said that if the}} bullet had been only one <b>millimeter</b> higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.|$|E
5|$|Each shot in {{an artistic}} billiards match is played from a {{well-defined}} position (in some venues within an exacting two <b>millimeter</b> tolerance), and each shot must unfold in an established manner. Players are allowed three attempts at each shot. In general, the shots {{making up the}} gameeven 4-point shotsrequire {{a high degree of}} skill, devoted practice and specialized knowledge to perform.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one <b>millimeter.</b> Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|The biomass of wild {{brook trout}} in Dark Run is 6.85 {{kilograms}} per hectare, including 0.98 kilograms per hectare of brook trout less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 5.87 kilograms per hectare {{that are more}} than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. These trout range from 50 to 249 <b>millimeters</b> in length. There are 30 brook trout per kilometer that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 20 per kilometer that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. There are 105 brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 76 per hectare that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long.|$|R
50|$|The {{male and}} female are similar in size; the male having an abdomen 45 to 46 <b>millimeters</b> long and a hindwing 34 to 38 <b>millimeters</b> long and the female with an abdomen 43 to 50 <b>millimeters</b> long and a hindwing 36 to 39 <b>millimeters</b> long.|$|R
50|$|The violet-purple {{flowers are}} 30 to 48 <b>millimeters</b> (1 ¼-2 in.) long, {{and have a}} deeply bilabiate corolla, with an 2-lobed upper lip and a 3-lobed lower lip. The upper lobes are 10-14 <b>millimeters</b> (⅜-⅝ in.) long by 5-9 <b>millimeters</b> (-⅜ in.) wide and {{generally}} oblong-obovate. The outer lower lobes are oblong-lanceolate, 11-16 <b>millimeters</b> (¼-¾ in.) long by 4-7 <b>millimeters</b> (- in.) wide, narrowing at the tip. The central lower lobe is slightly longer than its neighbors, 15-19 <b>millimeters</b> (⅝-¾ in.) long by 4-5 <b>millimeters</b> (- in.) wide, and is marked with a white stripe at its base. The floral tube that houses the reproductive organs and is visible {{at the base of}} corolla lobes is short 3-4 <b>millimeters</b> (⅛- in.) long and lacks a palate.|$|R
5|$|The white, porous {{hymenium}} has a {{thickness of}} 1–2mm and turns brown when bruised. Per <b>millimeter,</b> {{there are two}} to three square pores. When dried, the hymenium's color becomes pinkish-brown. The hymenium extends slightly down the stipe, and is sharply defined. Dried tissue smells similar to fenugreek. The morphology of the mycorrhiza {{has not yet been}} described; however, as with all other types of Boletopsis {{it is likely to be}} ectomycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic <b>millimeter</b> of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{acetic acid}} was {{discovered}} in 1996 by {{a team led by}} David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former <b>Millimeter</b> Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
50|$|The biomass of wild {{brook trout}} in Rattling Run is 56.64 {{kilograms}} per hectare. This includes 35.30 kilograms per hectare of brook trout {{that are less}} than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 21.34 kilograms per hectare of brook trout that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. The brook trout in the stream range from 25 to 224 <b>millimeters</b> in length. There are 819 brook trout per kilometer that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 94 per kilometer that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. There are 2729 brook trout per hectare that are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 314 per hectare that are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long.|$|R
50|$|This {{damselfly}} {{is about}} 35 to 42 <b>millimeters</b> long, the generally {{longer than the}} females. The males' wingspan is about 45 <b>millimeters</b> and the females' about 47 <b>millimeters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The queen is 15 to 16 <b>millimeters</b> {{long and}} 6 <b>millimeters</b> wide at the abdomen. It is black with pale {{hairs on the}} head and yellow on the abdomen. The worker is up to 13 <b>millimeters</b> long and 5 <b>millimeters</b> wide. It is similar to the queen except the tip of the abdomen is black. The male is 10 to 13 <b>millimeters</b> long and 5 to 6 <b>millimeters</b> wide. It has long hairs, yellow {{on the head and}} part of the abdomen and black {{at the end of the}} abdomen.|$|R
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a <b>millimeter</b> in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a <b>millimeter.</b> Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a <b>millimeter,</b> as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E
50|$|Rainfall varies regionally, {{with the}} highest amounts—3,700 <b>millimeters</b> (145.7 in) annually—recorded on the Bolovens Plateau in Champasak Province. City {{rainfall}} stations have recorded that Savannakhét averages 1,440 <b>millimeters</b> (56.7 in) of rain annually; Vientiane receives about 1,700 <b>millimeters</b> (66.9 in), and Louangphrabang (Luang Prabang) receives about 1,360 <b>millimeters</b> (53.5 in).|$|R
50|$|There are 2315 {{brook trout}} per {{kilometer}} on Crooked Run, of which 2215 {{are less than}} 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 100 are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. There are 11,576 brook trout per hectare, of which 11,076 are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 500 are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long.|$|R
5|$|The {{total biomass}} of wild trout in Scotch Run in its upper reaches is 2.98 {{kilograms}} per hectare. 2.93 kilograms per hectare come from brook trout (2.42 kilograms per hectare {{of which are}} less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 0.51 kilograms per hectare of which are more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long). The remaining 0.05 kilograms per hectare come from brown trout, {{all of which are}} less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. This segment of the stream contains 66 brook trout less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and 3 brook trout more than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long per kilometer. It contains only three brown trout per kilometer, all less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long. There are 174 brook trout per hectare, 166 of which are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long and eight brown trout per hectare, all of which are less than 175 <b>millimeters</b> long.|$|R
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 <b>millimeter</b> for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she owned it prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to <b>millimeter</b> size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The tooth is {{recurved}} with {{a backward}} bend, and is oval in cross-section. Its {{front and back}} cutting edges are finely serrated, extending two-thirds down each edge. There are six denticles per <b>millimeter</b> (0.04in), and each denticle is square and chiseled. The overall form of the tooth, its width and shape in cross-section and its curvature resemble those in the maxilla (upper jawbone) and mandible of the species Dromaeosaurus albertensis from North America. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, also similar to Dromaeosaurus, and differing {{from members of the}} Velociraptorinae subfamily. Dromaeosauroides differs from Dromaeosaurus in that the cutting edge at the front side is further {{from the middle of the}} tooth. Although the tooth is larger and the denticles similar, each denticle was smaller than those of Dromaeosaurus, which had only 13–20 denticles per , instead of Dromaeosauroides 30. The second known tooth is smaller——with the same features as the holotype.|$|E

5|$|The BP-540 HEAT {{projectile}} was {{not used}} during World War II. It had an armour penetration of 250 <b>millimeters</b> at an incident angle of 90°, 220 <b>millimeters</b> at 60°, 120 <b>millimeters</b> at 30°.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the Egyptians {{had planned}} a coordinated drive from Sadah to the southwest, below the Razih mountains, hoping {{to link up}} with the force coming from Haradh. They were {{counting}} on a local sheik, whose forces were to supposed to join 250 Egyptian parachutists. The sheik failed to deliver, and the parachutists made {{their way back to}} Sadah, suffering losses from snipers on the way. Al-Badr had sent radio messages and summonses by runner in all directions calling for reinforcement. He asked reserve forces training in the Jawf to arrive in trucks mounting 55- and 57-millimeter cannon and 81 <b>millimeter</b> mortars and heavy machine guns. They arrived within forty-eight hours, in time to face the attackers. They outflanked the Egyptian columns, still stuck in mud in the ravines. They later announced they had knocked out ten of the Egyptian tanks and about half of their armored cars, and claimed to have shot down an Ilyushin bomber. The royalists also carried out two supporting movements. One was a raid on Jihana, in which several staff officers were killed. The second was an attempt, involving British advisors and French and Belgian mercenaries from Katanga, to bombard San'a from a nearby mountain peak. Other diversionary operations included raids on Egyptian aircraft and tanks at the south airport of San'a and a mortar at the Egyptian and republican residence in a suburb of Taiz. Although the Egyptians managed to drive al-Badr out of his headquarters to a cave on Jabal Shedah, they could not close the Saudi border. They declared victory on the radio and on the press, but were obliged to agree to a ceasefire on the upcoming Erkwit conference on November 2.|$|E
