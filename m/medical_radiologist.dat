40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{cross-sectional}} {{diagnostic study}} was conducted in two sessions. OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare {{the reliability and validity of}} contraindications to chiropractic treatment (infections, malignancies, inflammatory spondylitis, and spondylolysis-listhesis) detected by chiropractors, chiropractic <b>radiologists,</b> and <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists</b> on plain lumbosacral radiographs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Plain radiography of the spine is an established part of chiropractic practice. Few studies have assessed the ability of chiropractors to read plain radiographs. METHODS: Five chiropractors, three chiropractic <b>radiologists</b> and five <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists</b> read a set of 300 blinded lumbosacral radiographs, 50 of which showed an abnormality (prevalence, 16. 7 %), in two sessions. The results were expressed in terms of reliability (percentage and kappa) and validity (sensitivity and specificity). RESULTS: The interobserver agreement in the first session showed generalized kappas of 0. 44 for the chiropractors, 0. 55 for the chiropractic radiologists, and 0. 60 for the <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists.</b> The intraobserver agreement showed mean kappas of 0. 58, 0. 68, and 0. 72, respectively. The difference between the chiropractic <b>radiologists</b> and <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists</b> was not significant. However, there was a difference between the chiropractors and the other professional groups. The mean sensitivity and specificity of the first round, respectively was 0. 86 and 0. 88 for the chiropractors, 0. 90 and 0. 84 for the chiropractic radiologists, and 0. 84 and 0. 92 for the <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists.</b> No differences in the sensitivities were found between the professional groups. The <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists</b> were more specific than the others. CONCLUSIONS: Small differences with little clinical relevance were found. All the professional groups could adequately detect contraindications to chiropractic treatment on radiographs. For this indication, there is no reason to restrict interpretation of radiographs to <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists.</b> Good professional relationships between the professions are recommended to facilitate interprofessional consultation in case of doubt by the chiropractors. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. A {{cross-sectional}} diagnostic accuracy {{study was}} conducted in 2 sessions. Objective. It is important to know whether it is possible to accurately detect "specific findings" on lumbosacral magnetic resonance (MR) images and whether the results of different observers are comparable. Summary of Background Data. Health care providers frequently use magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnostic process of patients with low back pain. The use of MR scans is increasing. This leads to an increase in costs and to an increase in risk of inaccurately labeling patients with an anatomical diagnosis that might not be the actual cause of symptoms. Methods. A set of 300 blinded MR images was read by <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists,</b> chiropractors, and chiropractic radiologists in 2 sessions. Each assessor read 100 scans in round 1 and 50 scans in round 2. The reference test was an expert panel. For all analyses, the magnetic resonance imaging findings were dichotomized into "specific findings" or "no specific findings. " For the agreement, percentage agreement and ê values were calculated and for validity, sensitivity, and specificity. Sensitivity analysis was done for classifications A and B (prevalence of 31 % and 57 %, respectively). Results. The intraobserver ê values for chiropractors, chiropractic <b>radiologists,</b> and <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists</b> were 0. 46, 0. 49, and 0. 69 for A and 0. 55, 0. 75, and 0. 64 for B, respectively. The interobserver ê values were lowest for chiropractors (0. 28 for A, 0. 37 for B) and highest for chiropractic radiologists (0. 50 for A, 0. 49 for B). The sensitivities of the <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists,</b> chiropractors, and chiropractic radiologists were 0. 62, 0. 71, and 0. 75 for A and 0. 70, 0. 74, 0. 84 for B, respectively. The specificities of <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists,</b> chiropractic radiologists, and chiropractors were 0. 82, 0. 77, and 0. 70 for A and 0. 74, 0. 52, and 0. 61 for B, respectively. Conclusion. Agreement and validity of MR image readings of chiropractors and chiropractic and <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists</b> is modest at best.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{clinical}} staging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging for oral cancer, and to assess inter-observer agreement between oral and medical radiologists. A total of 10 patients diagnosed with oral cancer were assessed before treatment. A head and neck surgeon performed clinical TNM staging. Two medical radiologists and two oral radiologists performed a new staging assessment by interpreting MRI scans, without prior knowledge of the clinical staging. They evaluated the extent of the primary tumor (T), metastasis to regional lymph nodes (N) and grouping by stages. The data were analyzed using the Kappa Index. There was significant agreement (p < 0. 05) between the clinical and MRI staging assessments made by one oral radiologist for N stage, and between those made by one <b>medical</b> <b>radiologist</b> for the T and N stages and for the grouping by stages. In the MRI assessment, there was significant agreement among all four observers for both T stage and grouping by stages. For the N stage, there was no significant agreement between one oral radiologist and one <b>medical</b> <b>radiologist</b> or between both medical radiologists. There was significant agreement among the remaining radiologists. There was no agreement between the clinical and MRI staging. These results indicate the importance of using MRI for the diagnosis of oral cancer. Training initiatives and calibration of medical and oral radiologists should be promoted to provide an improved multidisciplinary approach to oral cancer...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to verify}} the {{concordance}} of CT evaluation among four radiologists (two oral and maxillofacial and two <b>medical</b> <b>radiologists)</b> at the TN (tumour/node) stage and in the follow-up of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients. The study also compared differences between clinical and CT examinations in determining the TN stage. Methods: The following clinical and tomographic findings of 15 non-treated oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer patients were compared: tumour size, bone invasion and lymph node metastases. In another 15 patients, who had previously been treated, a clinical and tomographic analysis comparison {{for the presence of}} tumoural recurrence, post-therapeutic changes in muscles and lymph node metastases was performed. The concordances of tomographic evaluation between the radiologists were analysed using the kappa index. Results: Significant agreement was verified between all radiologists for the T stage, but not for the N stage. In the group of treated patients, CT disclosed post-therapeutic changes in muscles, tumour recurrence and lymph node metastases, but no concordance for the detection of lymph node metastases was found between radiologists. In the first group, for all radiologists, no concordance was demonstrated between clinical and tomographic staging. CT was effective for delimitating advanced lesions and for detecting lymph node involvement in N 0 stage patients. CT revealed two cases of bone invasion not clinically detected. Conclusions: Interprofessional relationships must be stimulated to improve diagnoses, and to promote a multidisciplinary approach to oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer. Although CT was important in the diagnosis and follow-up of cancer patients, differences between medical and dental analyses should be acknowledged.
