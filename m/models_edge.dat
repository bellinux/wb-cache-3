40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a robust image segmentation method {{based on a}} variational formulation using edge flow vectors. We demonstrate the nonconservative nature of this flow field, a feature that helps in a better segmentation of objects with concavities. A multiscale version of this method is developed and is shown to improve the localization of the object boundaries. We compare and contrast the proposed method with well known state-of-the-art methods. Detailed experimental results are provided on both synthetic and natural images that demonstrate that the proposed approach is quite competitive.

We {{consider the case}} of a space-time series aggregated into a single time series and the more general instance of a space-time series aggregated into a coarser spatial partition. We extend in various directions the outcomes found in the literature by including the consideration of larger datasets and the treatment of edge effects and of negative spatial correlation. The outcomes obtained provide operational suggestions on how to choose between alternative forecasting methods in empirical circumstances.

30|$|Cristinacce and Cootes {{have also}} {{proposed}} a Shape Optimized Search algorithm where the feature responses {{corresponding to the}} landmark shape models are learned using the ASM [80]. Three types of landmark features are used, namely, (i) Gray-level information (15 × 15 windows reduced with PCA), (ii) Orientation maps resulting from Sobel edge operator, (iii) Features resulting from a boosted classifiers, e.g., [38]. The concatenation of these three feature sets forms the landmark shape vector. The shape vector is then used in a shape-guided search to select the best candidate among possible configurations while the positions of missing points are predicted by the shape model. The Shape Optimized Search method, where in effect templates are learned under configurational constraints, outperforms AAM approach [79]. Several variants of ASM/AAM have recently been proposed. One {{of them is the}} boosted regression ASM [81]. The main difference of this variant is that it uses landmark detectors based on Haar features and boosted classifiers [38] instead of eigen models. In another variant [82], separate boosted cascade detectors, one for each landmark, model shapes implicitly by learning the pairwise distribution of all true feature locations. This approach can be thought as a combination of multiple detectors, called pairwise reinforcement of feature responses (PRFR). Finally an AAM which <b>models</b> <b>edge</b> and corner features instead of normalized pixel values is used for refinement.|$|E

However, traditional edge-based approaches have difficulty handling occluding contours of curved surfaces, {{since they are}} not static <b>model</b> <b>edges</b> but change with the viewpoint. In this {{paper we propose a}} unified approach to edge-based tracking where 3 D edges including occluding contours are utilized. This is achieved through an analysis of local surface differential geometry, which provides the foundation for incorporating occluding contours of curved surfaces into edge-based tracking. This approach uses a simple parametrization of both types of <b>model</b> <b>edges</b> within the same framework. The proposed method has been tested within the context of an existing edge-based tracking system. The system can track both types of <b>model</b> <b>edges</b> in a very fast and robust manner.

40|$|Context: What determines mammal {{occurrence}} across wildland-urban edges? A {{better understanding}} of the variables involved will help update edge effects theory and improve our ability to conserve biota in urbanizing landscapes. Objectives: For the first time, we tested whether the occurrence of mammals across urban-forest edges and forest interiors was best predicted by: (1) edge variables (i. e. edge type and distance to an urban boundary), (2) local habitat structure (e. g. proportion of understory cover), or (3) edge variables after accounting for local habitat structure. Methods: Using 77 camera stations in South-Eastern Australia, we quantified the factors influencing the occurrence of five native mammals (brown antechinus, bush rat, common brushtail possum, black wallaby and long-nosed bandicoot) and three non-native mammals (red fox, cat, and dog). Results: The occurrence of most native and non-native mammals was best predicted by local habitat structure rather than by edge variables. Although edge variables had effects on most species occurrences, local habitat structure outweighed the impacts of edge effects. Conclusions: Our findings are important for management and urban planning as they suggest that local-scale management of habitat and habitat retention at urban edges will mitigate urban impacts on fauna. Our work reveals a critical mismatch in the spatial scale of predictive variables commonly used in edge effects <b>models</b> (<b>edge</b> types and distance to a boundary) compared with the smaller scale of local habitat variables, which underlie most species occurrence. We emphasize the need to consider heterogeneity within patches in predictive frameworks of edge effects...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel global pose {{estimation}} method to detect body parts of articulated objects in images based on non-tree graph models.

We express optimal part localization as a multiple shortest path problem in a set of correlated trellises constructed from the graph <b>model.</b> Strong <b>model</b> <b>edges</b> generate the trellises, while weak <b>model</b> <b>edges</b> prohibit implausible poses by generating exclusion constraints among trellis nodes and edges.

The {{problem of how to}} represent the <b>edge</b> <b>model</b> is typically neglected, {{despite the fact that the}} representation is a bottleneck for both computational cost and accuracy. We propose to represent <b>edge</b> <b>models</b> by a partition of the edge manifold corresponding to the <b>edge</b> <b>model,</b> where each local element of the partition is described by its principal components.

40|$|We {{present a}} markerless {{tracking}} approach for augmented reality in poorly textured environments. The approach enables a robust and accurate camera pose estimation merely on {{basis of a}} coarse <b>edge</b> <b>model.</b> The <b>edge</b> <b>model</b> of the object to be tracked is enhanced and refined during the tracking process. New edges {{are added to the}} <b>edge</b> <b>model</b> and already existing ones are refined. A collection of reference poses with a set of corresponding edges, called keyposes, enables a selection of good edges to track depending on the current view and makes the tracking process robust and accurate. Keyposes are also used to reinitialize automatically after tracking failures, e. g. the object to be tracked is occluded. Therefore, the proposed method overcomes the limitations of traditionally used edge based tracking approaches in terms of reinitialization and <b>edge</b> <b>model</b> creation. Evaluation on synthetic and real image sequences demonstrates the significant improvement of the proposed method over a standard edge based tracking...|$|R
40|$|Corner {{models in}} the {{literature}} have lagged behind <b>edge</b> <b>models</b> with respect to color and shading.

The first part is based on the theory of minimal paths, where the selection of an energy and a set of sources determines a partition of the domain.

From training examples the algorithm utilizes the randomized forest model to learn a posteriori distribution of correspondence given the descriptor. In a new frame, the edge pixels are classified using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.
