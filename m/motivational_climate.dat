The two major types of motivational climates coaches can create are task-oriented and ego-oriented. While winning is the overall goal of sports competitions regardless of the <b>motivational</b> <b>climate,</b> a task-orientation emphasizes building skill, improvement, giving complete effort, and mastering {{the task at hand}} (i.e., self-referenced goals), while an ego-orientation emphasizes demonstrating superior ability, competition, and does not promote effort or individual improvement (i.e., other-referenced goals). Effective coaching practices explore the best ways coaches can lead and teach their athletes.

In this study we examined a model of mental toughness development based on achievement goal theory, assessing the relations between <b>motivational</b> <b>climates,</b> goal orientations, and mental toughness. Five hundred ninety-nine varsity athletes, representing 13 different sports from six different high schools in a southwestern United States school district, participated in the study. Athletes completed self-report measures assessing parent, peer, and coach <b>motivational</b> <b>climates,</b> goal orientations, and their mental toughness. Initially, I examined the measurement model and found it fit the data well both in the exploratory (SRMR =. 06; CFI =. 94) and confirmatory (SRMR =. 06; CFI =. 95) samples. Second, the structural model was examined and found to fit the data well in both the exploratory (SRMR =. 08; CFI =. 93) and confirmatory samples (SRMR =. 07, CFI =. 95). Parent task-involving climate, (β =. 55; p <. 05) and coach task-involving climate (β =. 32; p <. 05), but not peer task-involving climate (β =. 05), were associated with task goal orientation (R 2 =. 57). Ego goal orientation (R 2 =. 32) was explained by peer ego-involving climate (β =. 15; p <. 05), parent ego-involving climate (β =. 39; p <. 05), and coach ego-involving climate (β =. 16; p <. 05).

It was hypothesized that CEB and TLB would influence <b>motivational</b> <b>climate</b> development, while coaches' background characteristics would correlate with CEB, TLB, and <b>motivational</b> <b>climate</b> development. The 60 coaches who participated reported an average of thirteen (SD= 8) years of experience and 51 were Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists. Coaches reported high efficacy, frequent use of TLB, and development of a moderately high task- and somewhat ego-involving <b>motivational</b> <b>climate.</b> Correlations between demographic variables and CEB, TLB, and <b>motivational</b> <b>climate</b> development revealed three significant relationships: years of experience with CEB, and professional development activities and athlete to coach ratio with ego-involving climate development.

Method: A sample of 424 Estonian team-sport athletes (Mage = 13. 19; SD = 1. 56) completed the Peer <b>Motivational</b> <b>Climate</b> in Youth Sport Questionnaire, the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale, and the Sport Motivation Scale. Results: A structural equation model demonstrated that youth athletes' task-involving peer <b>motivational</b> <b>climate</b> indirectly influenced their intrinsic motivation and persistence in sport via their perceived need satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Task-oriented peer <b>motivational</b> <b>climate</b> was the only significant distal predictor of intrinsic motivation and sport persistence among the athletes. Conclusion: The findings underline the importance of peer-created <b>motivational</b> <b>climate</b> on youth sport persistence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Within an {{achievement}} motivation theoretical framework, there are factors thought to most heavily influence performance and task difficulty selection. More specifically, <b>motivational</b> <b>climates,</b> feedback, confidence, and anxiety {{have all been}} identified as important factors influencing outcomes within performance settings. Much of the literature {{in the area of}} achievement motivation has focused on on the effects of mastery- and ego-oriented feedback on performance within academic settings and has received limited attention in the sport psychology literature within an athletic setting. Given the demonstrated effects of mastery- and ego-oriented feedback on performance, the importance of performance within the athletic context, and the scant literature examining the effects of feedback on athletic performance, the influence of feedback on sport performance needed to be empirically examined. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} provide a clearer understanding of the relationship of factors influencing athletic performance, with the ultimate goal of moving research toward a greater understanding of how optimal performance is achieved. As a result, this research may prove applicable to researchers, coaches, and athletes working toward optimal performance. In this study, I examined how mastery- and ego-oriented feedback influenced youth athletes' soccer performance, task difficulty selection, confidence, and anxiety. Youth soccer athletes (n = 71) participated in a soccer kicking task consisting of two trials. Between subjects ANCOVA analyses revealed athletes receiving mastery-oriented feedback performed significantly better on the soccer kicking task than athletes receiving ego-oriented feedback. No differences were discovered on task difficulty selection, confidence, or anxiety. Providing athletes mastery-oriented feedback before or after skill execution could be helpful in the development of athletic skill development and performance. Limitations of the present study and questions to examine in future research are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{association}} between psychosocial factors and organized physical activity (PA) in urban children and adolescents. Data on organized PA, psychosocial variables, and demographic characteristics were collected via questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were {{used to examine the}} relationship between psychosocial correlates and organized PA. Analyses were run separately for different age groups. Results showed that children and adolescents with a greater positive attitude toward PA were more likely to be involved in organized PA. Ego orientation was associated with organized PA at the age of 13 - 15 years. Task orientation was related to PA participation at the age of 13 - 15 and 16 - 18 years. Perception of competence was related to participation at the age of 10 - 12 and 13 - 15 years. These findings suggest that interventions to increase the level of participation in organized PA in youth should focus on increasing students' perceived physical competence, attitude toward PA, and establishing a strong <b>motivational</b> task/mastery <b>climate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mediante un diseño de investigación descriptivo correlacional se exploran las relaciones entre bienestar psicológico (BP), prácticas docentes con efectos motivacionales orientadas al aprendizaje (PDEM-A) y clima motivacional de clase orientado al aprendizaje (CMC-A), en un grupo de 46 {{profesores}} y 1. 266 estudiantes. Las medias de las tres variables se ubicaron significativamente por sobre el punto central del rango de respuestas. Se encontró correlación significativa entre BP y PDEM-A r(46) =. 61, p =. 010; y no hubo relación entre PDEM-A y CMC-A, ni entre BP y CMC-A. Considerar el BP del profesor {{puede ser}} relevante para facilitar su disposición hacia las PDEM-A, aunque la relación de estas prácticas con la percepción de los alumnos debe considerarse con mayor detalle. Relationships between psychological well-being (PWB), learning-oriented motivational teaching practices (LMTP) and learning-oriented <b>motivational</b> classroom <b>climate</b> (LMCC) was explored using co-relational design, in 46 teachers and 1, 266 students. The {{means of the}} three variables were significantly located above the central point of the response range. Correlation was found between PWB and LMTP r(46) = 0. 61, p < 0. 01, {{but there was no}} significant relationship between LMTP and LMCC, nor LMCC and PWB. To take into account teachers PWB could be relevant to facilitate their disposition toward LMTP, although the relationship of these practices with student’s perceptions should be considered in more detail...|$|R
