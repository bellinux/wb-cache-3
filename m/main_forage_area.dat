40|$|International audienceSeabird {{movements}} during foraging {{trips and}} their preference for particular areas {{have recently been}} the focus of many studies aimed at gaining {{a better understanding of the}} ecological requirements of several species. During the last decade, the use of new devices, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) devices and geo-locator loggers, has allowed researchers to perform more investigations of this type. GPS devices were used on Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) breeding on Aride Island, Seychelles, to identify the <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> used during early chick-rearing and to assess at-sea foraging habitat selection. Thirteen foraging trips were recorded, 61. 5 % of which lasted 1 day. One <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>area,</b> located approximately 100 km east of the colony just outside a granitic bank characterized by upwelling and higher values of primary production compared to surrounding areas, was identified. The <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> size (3, 313 km 2) was much smaller than that identified during late chick-rearing (160, 000 km 2) in a previous study. This is probably due to the exigency to feed chicks more regularly and hence to find <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> closer to the colony during the early chick-rearing. The identification of key marine conservation areas, like those identified in this study, is a priority for designating marine Important Bird Areas and identifying habitat management measures. The results of this study should be relevant for the development of conservation plans for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and for other seabirds in the area...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{approach}} to quantifying habitat use within the foraging ranges of satellite-tracked seabirds. We applied kernel estimation techniques to 167 days (3738 locations) of data from Black-browed and Grey-headed albatrosses Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma during the chick-rearing period of the breeding cycle at South Georgia. At this time the activity range of these two species covers an estimated 440   000 and 640   000 km 2, respectively, with very substantial overlap. In contrast, kernel estimation reveals that the <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> of these two sympatric, congeneric species are very distinct.

40|$|There {{are three}} major {{breeding}} populations of southern elephant seals centered on Macquarie Island, Kerguelen-Heard Islands and South Georgia-Antarctic Peninsula. The {{composition of the}} diet differs between these populations based on published data from Signy Island and data presented here from Macquarie and Heard Islands.

The major food remains consisted of cephalopod beaks and fish eye lenses. More benthic material was found at Heard Island than at Macquarie Island. The diet at Macquarie Island differed between summer and winter and between young animals and adults.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} {{movements}} of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus breeding on Isla Martillo during the early chick-rearing period. Foraging paths were reconstructed using GPS loggers that registered the penguins 0 geographic position, water temperature and depth at regular intervals. The relationship between penguins 0 movements and search strategies, tide and tidal currents were assessed. Mean trip duration was on average 14. 7 ± 6. 9 h (33 % overnight), and the maximum distance reached was 24 ± 10 km. All penguins studied foraged {{to the east of}} the colony. We identified three phases based on the sinuosity and speed of the trajectory: transit, central and return. Foraging effort was higher during the central phase, followed by the transit phase, and lower in the return phase. Foraging success, measured as the percentage of time at the bottom during each phase, was also highest during the central phase. In all birds studied, the central phase of the foraging trip took place during ebb tide, and birds travelled to the <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> with flow tide running in the same direction of displacement. Our study suggests that penguins take advantage of tidal currents to facilitate their movements to and from the <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>area,</b> thereby reducing the energy expended. Moreover, we suggest that piscivorous diving birds may enhance their catch rate during ebb tide when fish are more concentrated near the channel bed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLong-finned pilot {{whales in}} the Strait of Gibraltar are {{distributed}} over the main shipping routes. This exposes them to risks of collisions and probable acoustic and physical disturbance. This species {{is also the}} target of whale-watching operations. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the annual population size, survival rate, and population growth rate of pilot whales occurring in the Strait and their inter-annual variation using photo-identification. A robust design was used to estimate all three parameters. A total of 10, 784 individual pilot whale fins were photographed and analyzed. The population size estimation in summer ranged from a low of 147 individuals in 1999 to a high of 265 individuals in 2003. The annual population growth rate was estimated from mark recapture models to be 5. 5 %. The survival rate of adults was estimated at 0. 982 (95 % CI: 0. 955 – 0. 993). The same individuals have been observed between years. This suggests that this population is resident in the Strait, at least during summer.

40|$|Populations of Lesser Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis canadensis) {{have been}} {{increasing}} {{during the last}} decades in Eastern Siberia, an area historically known as breeding grounds of endangered Siberian Cranes (G. leucogeranus). Significant overlap in niche dimensions between the two species may occur and could lead to competition between them. Therefore, this study of comparative breeding ecology of common Lesser Sandhill Cranes and endangered Siberian Cranes was performed. From late May to early August 2000, I studied Lesser Sandhill and Siberian cranes within a 30, 000 -ha part of Kytalyk Resource Reserve in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia. My main objective was to compare dispersion patterns and resource use of breeding Lesser Sandhill and Siberian cranes in areas of distribution overlap. Lesser Sandhill Cranes used moderate-wet (polygon) areas as their nest sites and <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> where terrestrial foods were scattered. In contrast, Siberian Cranes were nesting and foraging on low-basin wet areas, where aquatic foods were concentrated and dominant. Inter-nest distances were less for heterospecific cranes than for conspecific cranes, and more territorial behavior was projected toward conspecifics than toward heterospecifics. Lesser Sandhill Cranes were more mobile and used moderate-wet (polygon) areas more than Siberian Cranes; however, both species spent similar time foraging and being alert. The two crane species used different vegetation types for nesting and foraging, had different time-activity budgets, and used different resources in the Siberian tundra. While the population of Lesser Sandhill Cranes {{in the study area}} has the potential to increase, both species may simultaneously share the same geographic area due to differences in ecological requirements...|$|R

Substantial gaps remains in {{our knowledge of the}} turtle behaviour during the remaining inter-reproductive period, that spans over 2 – 3 years. We report the results of a prolonged tracking experiment on loggerhead turtles nesting along the Ionian Calabria, the main breeding ground in Italy. Argos satellite transmitters were deployed on eight females, a sample representing a substantial fraction of the overall population (20 – 25 nesting females). All turtles but one were tracked for > 300 days (range: 313 – 1523 days), revealing their spatial behaviour during a complete reproductive cycle and providing novel information on a number of poorly-known aspects of loggerhead spatial ecology: i) the post-nesting migratory strategy resulted in accordance with that of most adult loggerheads tracked so far, as the nine routes of six turtles were directed towards specific sites all located in the Tunisian continental shelf, a <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> for Mediterranean turtles; ii) the pre-breeding migratory routes were rather variable, likely deriving from different navigational strategies adopted by migrating turtles, and their temporal pattern indicates that mating occurred away from the nesting area; iii) the 10 inter-nesting movements of four turtles revealed unusual long-distance loops mostly in oceanic waters (median of maximum distance from nesting location: 145. 5 km); iv) while at the foraging grounds, four turtles occupied distinct areas during summer and winter, making directed movements between the two sites, seasonal core areas were separated and their size was larger in winter than in summer (median: 498 km 2 vs. 258 km 2); v) individual females displayed an high fidelity to both sites in successive years. These findings further highlight the plasticity in loggerhead spatial behaviour and the importance of the Central Mediterranean and of the Tunisian shelf for loggerhead conservation...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} areas {{used by the}} {{foraging}} wandering albatross, Diomedea exulans, its prey and overlap with longline fisheries is important information {{not only for the}} conservation of this species but also for furthering our understanding of the ecology of its prey. We attached satellite-tracking devices and activity recorders to wandering albatrosses between May and July of 1999 and 2000 (years of differing food availability around South Georgia) in order to assess inter-annual variation in the <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> association with oceanographic features (i. e. fronts, bathymetry), diet and interactions with fisheries. The overall foraging patterns of the tracked birds were similar in 1999 and 2000, ranging between southern Brazil (28 degreesS) and the Antarctic Peninsula (63 degreesS) and between the waters off Tristan da Cunha (19 degreesW) and the Patagonian Shelf and oceanic waters south of Cape Horn (68 degreesW) in the South Atlantic. In 1999, wandering albatrosses spent most time in sub-Antarctic oceanic waters, their trip durations were significantly longer and they fed on fish and cephalopods (53 and 42 % by mass, respectively). In contrast, in 2000, they spent more time in Antarctic waters, foraging trips were shorter and the diet was predominantly fish (84 % by mass). Wandering albatrosses were associated with the sub-Antarctic Front (SAF; both years), Subtropical Front (STF; in 1999) and the Tropical Front (TF; in 2000) suggesting that this species exploits prey concentrated at oceanic fronts. Fisheries discards also seemed to provide a very good source of food. Several fish species that are targeted (e. g. Patagonian toothfish, Dissostichus eleginoides) or are available as offal/discards from commercial fisheries (e. g. the macrourids, Antimora rostrata and Macrourus holotrachys) were mainly associated with the South Georgia shelf and the Patagonian Shelf, respectively. Wandering albatross <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> overlapped with longline fisheries in three different regions: around South Georgia, at the Patagonian Shelf and in oceanic waters north of 40 degreesS. Females commuted more frequently to the Patagonian Shelf and to oceanic areas where longline fisheries were operating. Males, on the other hand, spent more time on the shelf/shelf slope of South Georgia where they were more at risk from the local Patagonian toothfish fishery, particularly in 2000. These results emphasize that inter-annual variation in foraging preferences could lead to increased incidental mortality of this vulnerable species. Potential evidence for this is provided by a satellite-tracked wandering albatross (male; 1. 8 -day trip), whose diet contained a Patagonian toothfish head and a longline hook, and who spent extensive time in the water (44 % of the time wet; 0. 3 days of the trip) where a Patagonian toothfish longline fishing vessel was operating...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} first data on hawksbill turtle post-nesting migrations and {{behaviour}} in the Arabian region. Tracks from 90 post-nesting turtles (65 in the Gulf and 25 from Oman) revealed that hawksbills in the Arabian region may nest up to 6 {{times in a}} season {{with an average of}} 3 nests per turtle. Turtles from Qatar, Iran and the UAE generally migrated south and southwest to waters shared by the UAE and Qatar. A smaller number of turtles migrated northward towards Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and one reached Kuwait. Omani turtles migrated south towards Masirah island and to Quwayrah, staying close to the mainland and over the continental shelf. The widespread dispersal of hawksbill foraging grounds across the SW Gulf may limit habitat protection options available to managers, and we suggest these be linked to preservation of shallow water habitats and fishery management. In contrast, the two <b>main</b> <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> in Oman were small and could be candidates for protected area consideration. Critical migration bottlenecks were identified at the easternmost point of the Arabian Peninsula as turtles from Daymaniyat Islands migrate southward, and between Qatar and Bahrain. Overall, Gulf turtles spent 68 % of the time in foraging ground with home ranges of 40 – 60 km 2 and small core areas of 6 km 2. Adult female turtles from Oman were significantly larger than Gulf turtles by ~ 11 cm x¯= 81. 4 CCL and spent 83 % of their time foraging in smaller home ranges with even smaller core areas (~ 3 km 2), likely due to better habitat quality and food availability.

Fishery bycatch was determined for two of the 90 turtles. These spatio-temporal findings on habitat use will enable risk assessments for turtles in the face of multiple threats including oil and gas industries, urban and industrial development, fishery pressure, and shipping. They also improve our overall understanding of hawksbill habitat use and behaviour in the Arabian region, and will support sea turtle conservation-related policy decision-making at national and regional levels...|$|R

Those colonies are located at {{the north and south}} of the Northwestern Pacific’s Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area where high seasonal temperature changes are observed, and where, consequently, birds may show comparable responses to such changes. Our results showed that streaked shearwaters from both colonies shifted their <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> northwards as the season progressed.

There was stability in <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> between years due to colony persistence. Food supplementation did not alter the <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> of the nest. There was some evidence that the extra resources were channelled into producing more sexuals. Food denial caused the denied nest to expand its <b>foraging</b> <b>area.</b> The amount of honeydew collected by F. rufa was experimentally determined.

Coastal {{ecosystems}} are under intense pressure from anthropogenic and environmental factors in California. Human development, pollution and climate change continue to degrade coastal habitats. Marine predators such as marine mammals that depend on nearshore ecosystems are at risk from these anthropogenic and environmental factors. The Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) {{is one of the}} most common marine mammals along the coast of northern California and likely to be heavily impacted by changes in the coastal environment, yet little is known about their foraging behavior or habitat use. To accurately predict the response of local marine predators to changes in the coastal environment an understanding of their foraging behavior is required. This study aimed to develop baseline data on the foraging habitat and foraging behavior of the Pacific harbor seal in northern California. I radio tagged 12 seals from haul-out sites in Humboldt Bay, California and recorded their at-sea distribution between September 2005 and June 2006. I used fixed kernel analysis to measure the size and identify the locations of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas.</b> I characterized <b>foraging</b> behavior by measuring the distance from haul-out sites to <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> the spatial overlap of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> the water depth at <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>foraging</b> trip duration. <b>Foraging</b> <b>area</b> size ranged from 10. 2 to 37. 4 km 2 (mean= 26. 7 ?? 3. 5 km 2, ??SE). Seals used <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> both within and outside of Humboldt Bay. Seventy-seven percent of the seals foraged within 13 km of the capture site (mean= 21. 1 ?? 13. 4 km) and 88...|$|R

The {{activity of the}} ants did not show any daily pattern; foragers were active day and night. The type of prey captured by O. bauri supports the idea that in higher Odontomachus and Anochetus species, the high speed of mandible closure serves more for generating power than capturing elusive prey.

30|$|The {{fact that}} the {{absolute}} differences in δ 13 C values between the species and between incubating and chick-rearing boobies were relatively small {{may be explained by}} the fact that, despite spatial segregation in foraging habitat, there is still overlap in <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> as the opportunistically foraging birds (see below) will also take prey close to the island on their way to and from their more distant <b>foraging</b> <b>areas.</b> Moreover, the actual differences in distance between the different <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> might be small relative to the mobility of the prey and the relatively weak δ 13 C gradient in tropical waters (Catry et al. [2008, 2009]; Cherel et al. [2008]). Thus, while the isotopic methods {{used in the present study}} suggest spatial segregation, further investigations using tracking devices would be helpful to quantify the habitat segregation/overlap between the species and breeding stages.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe radio-tracked in Upper Bavaria, Germany to {{identify}} the key-foraging habitats and to enable an adequate habitat management for this endangered species. The studied females foraged {{at a distance of}} up to 8. 1  km around their colony roost. The average distance of the <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> was 3. 7  km, where 70 % of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> were located within a distance of 5  km and 90 % within 6  km of the nurseries. Moreover, these bats spent about 75 % of their foraging time within 5  km and 85 % within a 6 -km radius. To reach the <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> the bats usually used riparian woodlands, hedges and tree lines as flight paths. Specifically, 46. 9 % of the <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> were located in forests, 24. 5 % in cow sheds, 18. 4 % in riparian woodlands along streams and 10. 2 % in fields, villages, orchards, hedges and groves on open land. On average, the bats foraged in forests for 56. 2 % of the time, during which habitat allocation was possible. In cow sheds the percentage was 29. 2 %, in riparian deciduous woodland 11. 5 % and in the other habitats 3. 1 %. Within forests avoided foraging in spruce monocultures. Pure stands of spruce covered 45 % of the total forest area, but only 10 % of the <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> were located in this forest type. Deciduous forests on the other hand were much more common as foraging sites (40 % versus 11 %).

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} to study milk fatty acid (FA) profile in dairy cows in response to changes in dietary nutrient composition in relation to supplementation of fat sources, their technological form, addition of fish oil and <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> type in the basal diet. Data comprised 151 treatment means from 50 experiments, which {{were included in the}} database when diet composition, nutrient composition, FA composition, dry matter (DM) intake, milk yield, milk composition and milk FA profile were reported. Mixed model regression analysis including a random experiment effect and unequal variances among experiments was used. Least squares means were obtained for the different fat sources (unsupplemented, rapeseed, soybean+sunflower, linseed, or fish oil), technological form including addition of fish oil (oil, seed, protected and added fish oil), and <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> type (lucerne silage, barley silage, maize silage, grass silage, maize silage combined with haylage, or haylage) in the basal diet. Results showed that the technological form of supplemental rapeseed, soybean, sunflower, or linseed significantly influenced the effect of dietary nutrient composition on milk fat content and milk FA profile resulting in significant differences between technological forms within the different fat sources. Protected rapeseed and linseed increased C 18 : 2 n 6 and C 18 : 3 n 3 proportions in milk fat, respectively, whereas soybean and sunflower seed increased transfer efficiencies for C 18 : 2 n 6 and C 18 : 3 n 3 and their proportions in milk fat. Soybean, sunflower, or linseed supplied as oil increased trans- 11 -C 18 : 1 proportions in milk fat, whereas the addition of fish oil to a diet containing soybean or sunflower decreased C 18 : 0 and cis- 9 -C 18 : 1 proportions in milk fat. The <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> type in the diet also significantly influenced the effect of dietary nutrient composition on milk fat content and milk FA profile, resulting in significant differences between <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> types in the diet within the different fat sources. Maize silage as the <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> type increased trans- 11 -C 18 : 1 in unsupplemented diets or diets supplemented with a source of soybean or sunflower. For rapeseed supplemented diets, barley silage increased transfer efficiency and milk fat proportion of C 18 : 2 n 6, whereas grass silage increased proportion of C 18 : 3 n 3 in milk fat. For soybean or sunflower supplemented diets, haylage increased proportions of saturated FA, cis- 9 -C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2 n 6, whereas the combination of maize silage and haylage increased transfer efficiency and milk fat proportion of C 18 : 3 n 3. For linseed supplemented diets, grass silage as the <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> type resulted in the highest C 18 : 3 n 3 proportion, whereas cis- 9 -C 18 : 1 proportion was comparable for grass silage, lucerne silage and maize silage as the <b>main</b> <b>forage</b> type.

Areas of predictable prey yield are of conservation importance and telemetry data aid in identifying such areas. This study examined colony specific and intra-individual foraging site fidelity of lactating Subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis) from Marion Island (46 ° 54 ‟S, 37 ° 45 ‟E) during summer and winter, comparing commitment to <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> across seasons. Thirty-one females were tracked in 2009 - 2013 resulting in 111 foraging trips for analyses. Inter-annually, preferred <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> in summer were consistently ≈ 200 km due east of Marion Island towards the Gallieni Rise. Summer individuals' core utilization areas overlapped by an estimated 32. 84 % (CI: 24. 53 % - 41. 94 %). Seals {{responded to a}} decrease in regional productivity in winter by foraging in more distant alternative areas. In winter, individuals changed their travelling direction to north-east of Marion Island and foraged further afield, around the Del Caño Rise and along the South-west Indian Ridge. Despite preferring some <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> in winter, there was a low amount of overlap 6. 03 % (CI 4. 02 % - 9. 16 %) of individual core utilization <b>areas.</b> The <b>foraging</b> grounds identified in this study have not been included in prior conservation assessments and are important in conserving for this globally significant, and currently declining, population of Subantarctic fur seals and perhaps other toppredators breeding at Marion Island as well.
