40|$|In this research, a {{functionally}} graded microbeam bonded with piezoelectric layers is analyzed under electric force. Static {{and dynamic}} instability {{due to the}} electric actuation is studied because of its importance in micro electro mechanical systems, especially in micro switches. In order to prevent pull-in instability, two piezoelectric layers are used as sensor and actuator. A current amplifier is used to supply input voltage of the actuator from {{the output of the}} sensor layer. Using Hamilton’s principle and Euler-Bernoulli theory, equation of motion of the system is obtained. It is shown that the load type (distributed or concentrated) applied to the <b>micro</b> <b>beam</b> from the piezoelectric layer, depends on the shape of the actuator layer (E. g. rectangle, triangular). Finite element method is implemented for evaluation of displacement field in the <b>micro</b> <b>beam</b> and dynamic response of the <b>micro</b> <b>beam</b> under electric force is calculated using finite difference method. Effect of squeeze film damping on pull-in voltage and time-response of the system is considered using nonlinear Reynolds equation. Effect of several parameters such as gain value between piezoelectric sensor and actuator layer, profile of functionally material, and geometry of the system is considered on dynamic behavior of the <b>micro</b> <b>beam</b> especially on pull-in instability...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, Modified couple stress {{theory is}} {{developed}} for third-order shear deformation functionally graded (FG) <b>micro</b> <b>beam.</b> Classical Continuum theories {{are not able}} to capture size effects while higher order continuum theories consider material length scale parameters to improve the results in micro scales by interpreting size dependencies. By applying Hamilton’s principle, governing equations, boundary and initial conditions are derived for a FG <b>micro</b> <b>beam.</b> It is assumed that properties of the FG <b>micro</b> <b>beam</b> follow a power law form through thickness. In addition, Poisson’s ratio is assumed constant in the current model. Bending and free vibration of the simply supported FG <b>micro</b> <b>beam</b> is analyzed to illustrate size effects. It is observed that if the thickness of the beam is in the order of the material length scale parameter, size effects are more considerable. It is shown that size dependencies of FG micro beams are quite different from isotropic homogeneous beams as they have maximum and minimum size effects for certain values of power index of material distribution and Poisson’s ratio. Moreover, it is shown that the results obtained by the present model deviates significantly from those in which Poisson's effect is neglected. Also, the effect of Poisson’s ratio on the deflection and natural frequency based on modified couple stress theory is proven to be different from Classical one. The numerical results for simply supported thin beams show that the first natural frequency estimated by the current model is higher than the classical one. In addition, it is observed that size effect is more significant for higher vibration modes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Buckling {{analysis}} of functionally graded <b>micro</b> <b>beams</b> based on modified couple stress theory is presented. Three different beam theories, i. e. classical, {{first and third}} order shear deformation beam theories, are considered to study the effect of shear deformations. To present a profound insight {{on the effect of}} boundary conditions, beams with hinged-hinged, clamped–clamped and clamped–hinged ends are studied. Governing equations and boundary conditions are derived using principle of minimum potential energy. Afterwards, generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method is applied to solve the obtained differential equations. Some numerical results are presented to study the effects of material length scale parameter, beam thickness, Poisson ratio and power index of material distribution on size dependent buckling load. It is observed that buckling loads predicted by modified couple stress theory deviates significantly from classical ones, especially for thin beams. It is shown that size dependency of FG <b>micro</b> <b>beams</b> differs from isotropic homogeneous <b>micro</b> <b>beams</b> as it is a function of power index of material distribution.

The following paper present a novel MEMS microphone architecture that is developed in the frame of the ANR MADNEMS project.

Accurate simulations based on the Finite Element Method of the discussed transducer couple acoustic, mechanical and electric behavior of the system. A 3 D model of the microsystem would be too expensive in terms of computation time and memory with a poor mesh quality. This type of model is not suitable for the design of the MEMS microphone where numerous geometry parameters have to be revised. That is why a major effort has been devoted to modeling the microsystem by a 2 D model. In particular, as the system is not symmetrical due to the deflection of the beams, a mechanical equivalent 2 D model was proposed. This paper presents the modeling approach used to taken into account mechanical and thermal boundary condition at the walls, and the phenomena of viscous and thermal diffusion involved in the air. Its implementation in a finite element code allows the numerical calculation of the pressure sensitivity of the microphone. The numerical results were validated by an analytical model.
