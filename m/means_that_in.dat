5|$|According to the 2000 census by INEGI, Nahuatl {{is spoken}} by an {{estimated}} 1.45million people, some 198,000 (14.9%) {{of whom are}} monolingual. There are many more female than male monolinguals, and females represent nearly {{two thirds of the}} total number. The states of Guerrero and Hidalgo have the highest rates of monolingual Nahuatl speakers relative to the total Nahuatl speaking population, at 24.2% and 22.6%, respectively. For most other states the percentage of monolinguals among the speakers is less than 5%. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> most states more than 95% of the Nahuatl speaking population are bilingual in Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the NBA {{agreed with}} the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an {{arrangement}} that has remained the same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. Teams can also trade their picks, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E

5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This <b>means</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> any given year, there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} four drafts the Rockets participated in, each team had a total of 90 draft choices (14 in 1967, and 19 each from 1968 to 1971). For two drafts in 1972 and 1973, there were eight rounds, and from 1974 to 1985, the draft was 10 rounds long. However, in 1985, the draft was {{shortened}} to seven rounds, and in 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season.

5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

The Raptors {{began as an}} expansion team in 1995 and first participated in the NBA draft on June 28, 1995 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time.

25|$|The acid must be {{stronger}} {{in aqueous solution}} than hydronium ions, so strong acids are acids with a pKa < minus&1.74. An example is HCl for which pKa = −6.3.

25|$|Commercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 {{weeks of}} age, {{although}} production gradually declines soon after from approximately 25 weeks of age. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> many countries, by approximately 72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production, although chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years. In some countries, hens are force moulted to re-invigorate egg-laying.|$|E
25|$|There are clues {{which are}} {{sometimes}} taken {{to indicate that}} the local peoples in former Eburonic territories spoke or adopted Gaulish, or some form of it. One of the basic influences on the pronunciation of Dutch is a Gallo-Romance accent.

25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for more happiness among extraverts {{comes from the fact}} that extraverts are able to better regulate their affective states. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> ambiguous situations (situations where positive and negative moods are introduced and mixed in similar proportions) extraverts show a slower decrease of positive affect, and, as a result, they maintained a more positive affect balance than introverts. Extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness (e.g., recalling pleasant vs. unpleasant memories) more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks.|$|E
25|$|Transponder – In practice, {{the signal}} {{inputs and outputs}} will not be {{electrical}} but optical instead (typically at 1550nm). This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> effect wavelength converters are needed instead, {{which is exactly what}} a transponder is. A transponder can be made up of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550nm optical signal to/from an electrical signal, and the second transceiver converting the electrical signal to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don't use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E
