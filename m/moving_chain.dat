50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{extraction}} process is to break or remove all of the cappings. This may be accomplished using an automated uncapper machine or with a manually-operated uncapping knife. Usually, these tools are used together, along with a pronged cappings fork. To facilitate cutting off these wax cappings, the knife is often heated. The removed bits of wax, called cappings, are rich in honey which can be slowly drained off with the help of some heating. This 'cappings wax' is very valuable and often used to make candles or other products. Automated uncapping machines normally work by abrading the surface of the wax with <b>moving</b> <b>chains</b> or bristles or hot knives. This, while messy, makes the process easier than doing this task manually.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{entanglements}} using monomer {{contacts between}} pairs of chains in a Browniandynamics simulation of a polymer melt. A map of contact positions {{with respect to}} the contacting monomer numbers (i, j) shows clustering in small regions of (i, j) which persists in time, as expected for entanglements. Using the “space”-time correlation function of the aforementioned contacts, we show that a pair of entangled chains exhibits a qualitatively different behavior than a pair of distant chains when brought together. Quantitatively, about 50 % of the contacts between entangled chains are persistent contacts not present in independently <b>moving</b> <b>chains.</b> In addition, we account for several observed scaling properties of the contact correlation function. Since the first theories of rubber elasticity, the notion of entanglement between polymer chains has been a central component [1]. Conceptually these entanglements are viewed as discrete constraints that limit the configurations of the chains, reduce their randomness, and thus contribute to the entropic stress in the rubber.

50|$|Chain brakes prevent {{movement}} of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the driven clutch drum. Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, {{it can be used}} to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a cold saw, which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a <b>moving</b> <b>chain</b> is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.|$|E

50|$|Kevlar is {{well known}} as a {{component}} of some bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component, as do their replacements. Civilian applications include Kevlar reinforced clothing for motorcycle riders to protect against abrasion injuries. Kevlar in non-woven long strand form is used inside an outer protective cover to form chaps that loggers use while operating a chainsaw. If the <b>moving</b> <b>chain</b> contacts and tears through the outer cover, the long fibers of Kevlar tangle, clog, and stop the chain from moving as they get drawn into the workings of the drive mechanism of the saw. Kevlar is used also in Emergency Service's protection gear if it involves high heat (e.g., tackling a fire), and Kevlar such as vests for police officers, security, and SWAT. The latest Kevlar material that DuPont has developed is Kevlar XP. In comparison with 'normal' Kevlar, Kevlar XP is more light-weight and more comfortable to wear, as it is quilt stitch is not required for the ballistic package.|$|E

40|$|We {{define a}} number of new {{combinatorial}} operations on skew semistandard domino tableaux, which together with constructions introduced earlier by C. Carre and B. Leclerc, define an elegant structure on the set of these tableaux, that closely parallels the structure defined in [math. CO/ 9908099] for ordinary skew semistandard tableaux, that is related to the Littlewood-Richardson rule. These operations are: (1) a bijection between semistandard domino tableaux and certain pairs of ordinary tableaux of the same weight that together fill the same shape; (2) a weight preserving transformation of domino tableaux to ordinary tableaux of a related shape (the correspondence involves 2 -quotients) with the property that Yamanouchi domino tableaux correspond precisely to Littlewood-Richardson tableaux; (3) a correspondence between Yamanouchi domino tableaux of shape λ and weight μ and Yamanouchi domino tableaux of shape μ' and weight λ, where μ' is μ scaled by a factor 2. The property {{at the heart of the}} structure so defined is that operations (1) and (2) commute with the coplactic operations (implicitly) defined by Carre and Leclerc. (1) elucidates their bijection analogous to that of Robinson (a. k. a. the Robinson-Schensted correspondence), while the operation of <b>moving</b> <b>chains</b> in domino tableaux underlying (2) is very similar to jeu de taquin.

In the late 1940s, he began to apply his mechanical engineering knowledge to inventing a device that he believed would be in great demand, once it was produced.

Malzahn's idea {{was to create a}} compact trencher that would dramatically reduce the time and effort of this process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{characterize}} the modal parameters and transverse vibrations of a monochain ropeway system for hilly orchards. The <b>moving</b> <b>chain</b> is modeled with uniform distribution and concentrated inertial loads. In order to study the dynamical behavior of the <b>moving</b> <b>chain,</b> Hamilton’s principle is applied to obtain the homogenous differential equation of transverse vibration. With the boundary conditions subjected to the polygonal action caused by chain-support engagement, the coupling effect of concentrated load, variable tension, and time-dependent speed on transverse vibration is investigated. The contribution of residue of singularity to total vibrations in phase space is numerically analyzed by using the Laplace transform method. The influence of the boundary condition considering the polygonal action is investigated in terms of excitation frequency and amplitude coupled with transport speed. The transverse vibrations are calculated numerically and measured experimentally. The numerical results are in agreement with the experimental data, which suggest that the amplitude and frequency of vibration are proportional to the value of propagation speed. The analytical solution to the <b>moving</b> <b>chain</b> problem provides a feasible reference for its stability analysis and wind-induced vibration control...|$|E
40|$|Sound {{propagation}} {{within certain}} non-relativistic condensed matter models obeys a relativistic wave equation despite such systems admitting entirely non-relativistic descriptions. A natural question that arises upon consideration of this is, "do devices exist that will experience the relativity in these systems?" We describe a thought experiment in which 'acoustic observers' possess devices called sound clocks {{that can be}} connected to form chains. Careful investigation shows that appropriately constructed chains of stationary and moving sound clocks are perceived by observers on the other chain as undergoing the relativistic phenomena of length contraction and time dilation by the Lorentz factor, with c the speed of sound. Sound clocks within <b>moving</b> <b>chains</b> actually tick less frequently than stationary ones and must be separated by a shorter distance than when stationary to satisfy simultaneity conditions. Stationary sound clocks appear to be length contracted and time dilated to moving observers due to their misunderstanding of their own state of motion {{with respect to the}} laboratory. Observers restricted to using sound clocks describe a universe kinematically consistent with the theory of special relativity, despite the preferred frame of their universe in the laboratory. Such devices show promise in further probing analogue relativity models, for example in investigating phenomena that require careful consideration of the proper time elapsed for observers.
