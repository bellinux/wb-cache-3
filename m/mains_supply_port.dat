40|$|Modern {{so-called}} {{energy efficient}} equipment often draw current only during {{a very short}} period of the period of a power <b>supply</b> <b>mains.</b> This is causing unwanted non-sinusoidal and harmonic currents. In some cases even a single diode is used for rectification causing direct current (DC) in the <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> To reduce dissipation the semiconductor components switch very fast, which is causing interference, especially in medium- and high-frequency communication systems. The pollution in the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> due to energy efficient LED and compact florescent lamps is shown and discussed...|$|R
500|$|Prior to 2007 {{there was}} no <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> of {{drinking}} water on the island, water being supplied instead from wells and springs. In that year the then Scottish Executive announced plans for a <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> to be provided {{at a cost of}} £1million: a pipe was laid under Loch Linnhe and work was to begin on laying about [...] of pipes across Lismore. However, Scottish Water later decided to supply water from boreholes instead.|$|R
50|$|Originally this {{referred}} to units {{which could be}} used directly by AC <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> (<b>mains</b> radio); it can also refer to units which do not require a power source at all, except for the power that they receive from radio waves.|$|R

50|$|An AC {{power supply}} {{typically}} takes the voltage from a wall outlet (<b>mains</b> <b>supply)</b> and lowers {{it to the}} desired voltage. Some filtering may take place as well.|$|R
40|$|Australia has an {{electricity}} <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> that {{differs from}} those of most countries. Safety standards relating to both the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> and mains-powered apparatus also differ. This paper describes the mechanism of electric shock and methods of shock protection — core-balance relays, protected earth-free supplies and equipotential earthing are considered. Australian safety standards as applied to earthed mains-powered apparatus are summarized. Particular attention is given to class A and B treatment areas and electromedical apparatus having a patient circuit. Class A, B and Z patient circuits are described...|$|R
5000|$|All {{films and}} other filmed {{material}} shot at 24 {{frames per second}} must be transferred to video frame rates using a telecine {{in order to prevent}} severe motion jitter effects. Typically, for 25 frame/s formats (European among other countries with 50 Hz <b>mains</b> <b>supply),</b> the content is PAL speedup, while a technique known as [...] "3:2 pulldown" [...] is used for 30 frame/s formats (North America among other countries with 60 Hz <b>mains</b> <b>supply)</b> to match the film frame rate to the video frame rate without speeding up the play back.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{exposes the}} {{barriers}} to rainwater harvesting for domestic use in Koonibba Aboriginal community. Although the community is supplied with a potable <b>mains</b> <b>supply,</b> when asked about their water supply the community said ‘There is no water’; this being a reflection of their dry domestic rainwater tanks {{as a result of}} a season of decreased rainfall, and also highlights their preference for drinking rainwater rather than the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> which has a total dissolved salt content of 891 mg/L. In the past, and in addition to domestic rainwater harvesting, rainwater was collected for potable use from the roofs of a conglomeration of administrative buildings; in years with adequate rainfall it provided water to the community for several months. When an upgraded, potable, <b>mains</b> water <b>supply</b> became operational in 1997, the rainwater harvesting system was disconnected from the system by the project managers. The community is eager to reinstate the rainwater harvesting system to alleviate pressure on the aquifer system and lower the salinity of the <b>mains</b> <b>supply,</b> however, concerns over the microbiological quality of the rainwater, and questions of institutional responsibility for managing the rainwater harvesting systems are hindering its progression...|$|R
50|$|The voltage {{distribution}} {{has changed}} around the tube heaters but the total {{is still a}} little more than the 120 volt <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> This line-up is for an Admiral radio.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s {{the water}} {{treatment}} method for the pool changed to <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> A heating system was installed, but never used. The pool {{was closed to}} the public in 1974.|$|R
50|$|Voltage {{optimisation}} is {{an electrical}} energy saving technique which is mainly installed {{in series with}} the <b>mains</b> electricity <b>supply</b> to provide a reduced supply voltage for the site's equipment. Typically, voltage optimisation can improve power quality by balancing phase voltages and filtering harmonics and transients from the supply, although not always. Voltage optimisers are essentially transformers used to deliver power at a reduced voltage from the raw <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{countries}} chose {{their television}} vertical synchronization rate to approximate the local <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> frequency. This helped to prevent power line hum and magnetic interference from causing visible beat frequencies in the displayed picture of analogue receivers.|$|R
50|$|Failure of the {{switching}} transistor is common. Due {{to the large}} switching voltages this transistor must handle (around 325 V for a 230 VAC <b>mains</b> <b>supply),</b> these transistors often short out, in turn immediately blowing the main internal power fuse.|$|R
50|$|The {{isolation}} {{between the}} <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> circuitry and the 36V DC C-Bus circuitry {{is greater than}} 3.5kV. This is achieved using double wound transformers and opto isolators. This means the C-Bus wiring, connections and circuitry can be considered Extra Low Voltage.|$|R
50|$|Unwanted turn-ons can {{be avoided}} by using a snubber circuit (usually of the resistor/capacitor or resistor/capacitor/inductor type) between MT1 and MT2. Snubber {{circuits}} are also used to prevent premature triggering, caused for example by voltage spikes in the <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For several decades, much rock-and-roll {{and other}} {{lighting}} used [...] "Par Cans", each containing a 120 volt PAR 64 lamp. As the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> is 240 volts these must be connected in series, via an adapter lead or box featuring two sockets.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the steps taken {{for the design}} and testing of a 50 Hz solar powered DC to AC inverter. The inverter has two modes of operation. The first mode will link {{the output of the}} inverter across the mains, assisting the <b>mains</b> to <b>supply</b> a load. The second mode of operation should be capable of supplying a load, independent of the <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> The batteries used to power the inverter would be kept charged up by use of solar panels...|$|R
25|$|On 8 September 2003, two of {{the last}} {{remaining}} places in Ireland unconnected to the national grid – Inishturbot and Inishturk islands (off the coast of Galway)- were finally connected to the <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> Some islands are still powered by small diesel-run power stations.|$|R
50|$|The TXE1 {{required}} power supplies of −18 V, +50 V and −50 V DC. These were {{provided in the}} usual manner by lead-acid rechargeable batteries charged from the 240-volt AC <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> and backed up by a diesel generator in case of mains power failure.|$|R
50|$|A modern {{computer}} {{power supply}} is a switch-mode power supply that converts AC {{power from the}} <b>mains</b> <b>supply,</b> to several DC voltages. Switch-mode supplies replaced linear supplies due to cost, weight, and size improvement. The diverse collection of output voltages also have widely varying current draw requirements.|$|R
50|$|Electric burr {{grinders}} are {{powered by}} electricity from a battery or <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b> An electric motor drives the grinding elements against each other. Electric grinders grind faster than manual grinders with no effort, butfriction and waste {{heat from the}} motor may heat the ground product slightly.|$|R
50|$|Given the 120V±5% <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> {{used in the}} United States and Canada, these {{higher ratings}} permit devices with C6 and C8 inputs to draw more than 114&times;2.5 = 285 W from the mains, and devices with C14 inputs to draw more than 1140 W from the mains.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1954, the 600 series was {{introduced}} with its 'slide-rule' type dial and a <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> cord which coils inside the set on a spring-loaded reel. This model stayed in production, with minor changes, {{until the end of}} the T/O tube era in 1962.|$|R
50|$|A key {{concept of}} this system is the {{possibility}} of creating an electrical micro-system that is not dependent on the grid-tie to provide a high level quality of service. If the <b>mains</b> <b>supply</b> of the region is unreliable, the local generation system can be used to power important equipment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{water power}} found a {{practical}} use generating Chatsworth's electricity from 1893. [...] Gilkes of Kendal installed 3 vortex turbines and a generator in an underground chamber, approximately 400 feet {{down the hill}} from the Emperor lake. From 1936 the house was then connected to the <b>mains</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} a <b>mains</b> water <b>supply,</b> and {{boreholes}} are also used. Flotta didn't have a <b>mains</b> electricity <b>supply</b> until 1977, although most households had {{had their own}} electricity generators for many years beforehand. Mains electricity is supplied by Scottish Hydro Electric. The island {{is connected to the}} BT telephone network. Mobile phone connections can be an issue. Broadband internet connection is possible on the island. There is no <b>mains</b> gas <b>supply</b> on Flotta, although coal and heating oil are delivered regularly, and Calor Gas is stored at the shop.|$|R
