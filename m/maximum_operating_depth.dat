5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
25|$|The {{fraction}} of the oxygen determines the greatest depth at which the mixture can safely be used to avoid oxygen toxicity. This depth is called the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pure oxygen {{is mainly}} used {{to speed the}} shallow {{decompression}} stops {{at the end of}} a military, commercial, or technical dive and is only safe down to a depth of 6 meters (<b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth)</b> before oxygen toxicity sets in. It was much used in frogmen's rebreathers.|$|E

25|$|Analyzing nitrox {{mixtures}} for : The {{safe use}} of nitrox mixtures depends on using them at depths where the partial pressure of oxygen is within acceptable limits, and this requires {{knowledge of the}} oxygen fraction, so the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> can be calculated. Recreational divers are responsible for analysis of their own breathing gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} {{partial pressure}} of oxygen {{due to the}} higher oxygen content of nitrox {{increases the risk of}} oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.|$|E
25|$|To dive safely with nitrox, the diver {{must learn}} good {{buoyancy}} control, {{a vital part}} of scuba diving in its own right, and a disciplined approach to preparing, planning and executing a dive to ensure that the ppO2 is known, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> is not exceeded. Many dive shops, dive operators, and gas blenders require the diver to present a nitrox certification card before selling nitrox to divers.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{variants}} of rebreather [...] - [...] semi-closed circuit rebreathers, and fully closed circuit rebreathers, which include the subvariant of oxygen rebreathers. Oxygen rebreathers have a <b>maximum</b> safe <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> of around 6 m, but several types of fully closed circuit rebreathers, when using a helium-based diluent, can be used deeper than 100 m. The main limiting factors on rebreathers are {{the duration of the}} carbon dioxide scrubber, which is generally at least 3 hours, increased work of breathing at depth, reliability of gas mixture control, and the requirement to be able to safely bail out at any point of the dive.|$|R

25|$|Nitrox is {{a mixture}} of oxygen and air, and {{generally}} refers to mixtures which are more than 21% oxygen. It {{can be used as a}} tool to accelerate in-water decompression stops or to decrease the risk of decompression sickness and thus prolong a dive (a common misconception is that the diver can go deeper, this is not true owing to a shallower <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> than on conventional air).|$|E
25|$|The diver {{must be able}} to {{positively}} {{identify the}} gas supplied by any one of the several demand valves that these configurations require, to avoid potentially fatal problems of oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, nitrogen narcosis or divergence from the decompression plan which may occur if an inappropriate gas is used. One of the conventions puts the oxygen rich gases to the right, Other methods include labelling by content and/or <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> (MOD), and identification by touch. Often several or all of these methods are used together.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} mixing a known nitrox mix with helium allows {{analysis}} of the fractions of each gas using only an oxygen analyser, since {{the ratio of the}} oxygen fraction in the final mix to the oxygen fraction in the initial nitrox gives the fraction of nitrox in the final mix, hence the fractions of the three components are easily calculated. It is demonstrably true that the END of a nitrox-helium mixture at its <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> (MOD) is equal to the MOD of the nitrox alone.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{configurations}} {{used for}} increased primary gas supply are manifolded or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple side mounted cylinders, or rebreathers. Bailout and decompression gas may {{be included in}} these arrangements, or carried separately as side-mounted stage and decompression cylinders. Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and {{where they will be}} used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger number of cylinders is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> and if applicable, minimum operating depth.|$|E
25|$|The maximum safe ppO2 in a {{breathing}} gas depends on exposure time, {{the level of}} exercise and {{the security of the}} breathing equipment being used. It is typically between 100 kPa (1 bar) and 160 kPa (1.6 bar); for dives of less than three hours it is commonly considered to be 140 kPa (1.4 bar), although the U.S. Navy has been known to authorize dives with a ppO2 of as much as 180 kPa (1.8 bar). At high ppO2 or longer exposures, the diver risks oxygen toxicity which may result in a seizure. Each breathing gas has a <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> that is determined by its oxygen content. For therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy partial pressures of 2.8 bar are commonly used in the chamber, but there is no risk of drowning if the occupant loses consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Many {{training}} {{agencies such}} as PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the value written on the cylinder by the gas blender, the scuba diver must either recalculate his or her bottom times with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under IANTD and ANDI rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen partial pressure before taking delivery), and finally a calculation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> for that fill/cylinder. All of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations (for example, personalized cylinders for each diver must generally be kept track of on dive boats with nitrox, {{which is not the}} case with generic compressed air cylinders).|$|E

500|$|Scuba divers {{take great}} care to avoid {{breathing}} oxygen enriched [...] "deco gas" [...] at great depths {{because of the}} high risk of oxygen toxicity. To prevent this happening, cylinders containing oxygen-rich gases must always be positively identifiable. One way of doing this is by marking them with their <b>maximum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>depth</b> as clearly as possible. Other safety precautions may include using different coloured regulator housing, flavoured mouthpieces, or simply placing a rubber band vertically across the mouthpiece as an alert.|$|E
500|$|Exposures, from {{minutes to}} a few hours, to partial {{pressures}} of oxygen above —about eight times normal atmospheric partial pressure—are usually associated with central nervous system oxygen toxicity and {{are most likely to}} occur among patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and divers.

500|$|Stage {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{which are}} stored by scuba divers along the return route containing decompression and emergency gas.

2500|$|Diving {{with and}} {{handling}} nitrox raise {{a number of}} potentially fatal dangers due to the high partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2).
