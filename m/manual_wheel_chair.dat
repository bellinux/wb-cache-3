40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to design and {{fabricate}} a device that is capable of aiding handicapped children to learn how to use a powered wheel chair. In order to do this the device must use the same control interface as an actual wheel chair. This trainer is composed of a 30 in. x 38 in. platform that stands approximately 6 in. off the ground. A <b>manual</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> with user is rolled onto the device, and secured. The user is then able to develop their wheel chair driving skills by driving this device much like a powered wheel chair...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] -An {{automated}} {{system is to}} be developed to control the motor rotation of <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> based on head and finger movement of physically challenged person. In order to facilitate these people for their independent movement, an accelerometer device is fitted on persons head and a flex sensor is fixed in a glove {{which is to be}} wear by the person. Based on the head and finger movements the accelerometer and the flex sensor will drive the motor fitted to the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair.</b> The <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> can be driven in any of the four directions. The automated wheelchair is based on simple electronic control system and the mechanical arrangement that is controlled by a Programmable Interface Controller. This automatic <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> also helps people who have various other disabilities to sit on the chair and just hold the accelerometer and move it over to control the vehicle movements. In this paper the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> has been mimicked using a robot...|$|R

40|$|The commercially {{available}} <b>wheel</b> <b>chairs</b> for amputees donot have the functionality for climbing staircases. In our project, we have designed a manually operated wheelchair that can travel on both plane terrains {{and also in}} the staircases. In our project, instead of using normal wheels we have used penta wheel. The steel rod is penta shaped and each rod is equally inclined of 72 ° from each other. At the time of climbing, one wheel that is the idle wheel will be in contact with the ground and the another wheel will be in contact with the stair. The motion takes place only when we pull the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> backwards towards the staircase. The main aim of our project is to provide stability to the person who travels in the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> (i. e., a large support base and maintain the overall centre of gravity as low as possible). The main aim of our project is to afford this stair climbing facilities for middle class people. The main drawback of electric powered stair climbing <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> is its cost and weight. In our project, we tried to fabricate a low cost stair climbing <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> that can be bought by a middle class people...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. People with {{disability}} {{have to face}} a lot {{of problems}} in their day-to-day life due to the flexibility issues. One such issue is using the shopping cart in the grocery stores. Using shopping cart becomes very difficult, as they have to control the movement of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> and shopping chair at the same time while placing the grocery in the shopping cart, which is an extra burden on the user. They would have to constantly control the movement of the cart, as there would be lot of obstacles in the store which becomes a very big problem for the user. The aim of my project is to design a device to connect a <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> with a shopping cart. The device would be designed {{in such a way that}} the user would be able to connect the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> with the shopping cart sitting in the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> without anyone???s help. This would give them that flexibility to do the things on their own instead of depending on others. This would also help them to place the grocery in the cart easily as the length of the device is smaller than the length of the average arm. The user does not have to apply a lot of effort in controlling the movement of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> and shopping cart as the shopping cart would act just like an extension of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair,</b> which makes it very easy to control. The device is portable and the cost would also be very cheap as the individual parts used in the device are easily manufactured. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{challenging}} problem {{faced by}} the paralyzed people is their independent mobility. They need an external help to perform their daily activities. The main objective of this project is to rehabilitate the disabled people who cannot perform their voluntary movement. The hardware implementation of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> will be a mobility aid for the patients who are extremely suffering from the quadriplegia. The <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> will work based on the head movement of the user. The recognized gestures are used to generate motion control commands to the controller {{so that it can}} control the motion of the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> according to the users intention. Head movement is one of the natural gestures which can be easily tracked. The head movement is the gesture which can be performed by the quadriplegic patients whose body parts below the neck is paralysed. So the head movement is possible for the patients. The wheelchair includes the accelerometer sensor which detects the movement of head and the controller will process the signal and will transmit to the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> for its navigation. This is will offer a small relief to the patients who are tolerating from this condition. The <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> is implemented in a cost effective way which reduces the complexity in the design. It is intended {{to be used as a}} human-friendly interface for elderly and disabled people to operate wheelchair using their head gestures rather than their hands. This autonomous navigation ensures safety, flexibility, mobility, obstacle avoidance and an intelligent interface for the users...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} to develop a <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> control which is useful to the {{physically}} disabled person with his hand movement or his hand gesture recognition using Acceleration technology. Tremendous leaps {{have been made in the}} field of wheelchair technology. However, even these significant advances haven‟t been able to help quadriplegics navigate wheelchair unassisted. It is wheelchair which can be controlled by simple hand gestures. It employs a sensor which controls the wheelchair hand gestures made by the user and interprets the motion intended by user and moves accordingly. In Acceleration we have Acceleration sensor. When we change the direction, the sensor registers values are changed and that values are given to microcontroller. Depending on the direction of the Acceleration, microcontroller controls the <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> directions like LEFT, RIGHT, FRONT, and BACK. The aim of this {{paper is to}} implement <b>wheel</b> <b>chair</b> direction control with hand gesture reorganization. Keywords...|$|R
