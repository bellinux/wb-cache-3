25|$|In 1975, 15-year-old Martha Moxley {{was murdered}} in the gated {{community}} of Belle Haven in Greenwich. In 2002, a jury in Norwalk found Michael Skakel guilty of the crime. The murder was depicted in 1993 in the book A Season in Purgatory by Dominick Dunne and in Murder in Greenwich in 1998 by <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> which was later made into a movie of the same title.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> was {{not called}} to testify, and Simpson was subpoenaed to testify {{on his own}} behalf. In addition, a photo of Simpson, taken while he was {{attending}} a Buffalo Bills game in 1993, was presented at trial that showed him wearing Bruno Magli shoes, {{the same type of}} shoes which investigators said the killer of Goldman and Brown was wearing when the murders were committed. The photo was presented as evidence against him, as Simpson had previously denied ever wearing such shoes.|$|E
25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. Detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found under the bed at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E

2500|$|Simpson's {{defense was}} said to have cost between US$3million and $6million. Simpson's defense team, dubbed the [...] "Dream Team" [...] by reporters, argued that LAPD detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> had planted {{evidence}} at the crime scene. LAPD criminalists Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola were subject to strong scrutiny.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1995, Detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> {{testified to}} driving over to Simpson's house to {{question}} him {{on the night of}} the murders. [...] After getting no response when buzzing the intercom of the house, which appeared empty, he scaled one of the outer walls to enter the property. He found blood marks on the driveway of Simpson's home, as well as a black leather glove on the premises near the location of Kaelin's bungalow. It was later found to have the blood of both murder victims on it, as well as Simpson's, matched through DNA analysis.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2010 review, the Metropolitan News {{said that}} Garcetti had [...] "micromanaged" [...] the trial, {{and that he}} had decided to have Simpson try on the bloody leather gloves in open court that had been {{recovered}} at the murder scene and at Simpson's estate. Simpson's apparent difficulty in getting the gloves on was highly damaging to the prosecution's case. Both Darden and Clark decided to let Simpson try on the gloves. Also, pundits criticized the prosecution for calling <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> to the witness stand in the first place; they criticized the prosecution for lack of due diligence, which should have discovered his earlier racist statements. The D.A.'s office argued that the defense would have called Fuhrman anyway and that no one knew of the existence of the McKinny tapes until after the trial started.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the incriminating {{evidence}} — bloody glove, bloody socks, blood in {{and on the}} Bronco — was discovered by Los Angeles Police Detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman.</b> He was later charged with perjury for falsely claiming during the trial {{that he had not}} used the word [...] "nigger" [...] within 10 years of the trial. Later during the trial, with the jury absent, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination when asked [...] "did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?" [...] In a 2016 interview, defense attorney Alan Dershowitz suggested that Detective Philip Vannatter (not Detective Fuhrman) may have planted evidence on socks, based upon the presence of anti-coagulant in the blood discovered on the socks. Dershowitz said that the jury may have concluded that if the bloody socks evidence was fabricated by the police, then other evidence may have been fabricated as well. F.B.I. expert testimony said that the defense exaggerated the significance of the presence of the anti-coagulant.|$|E

5000|$|Bailey {{joined the}} O. J. Simpson defense team {{just before the}} {{preliminary}} hearing. Bailey held numerous press conferences to discuss {{the progress of the}} case. In a press conference prior to his cross-examination of <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman,</b> Bailey said, [...] "Any lawyer in his right mind who would not be looking forward to cross-examining <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> is an idiot." [...] His famous cross-examination of Fuhrman is {{considered by many to be}} the key to Simpson's acquittal. In front of a jury composed predominantly of people of color, Bailey got the detective to claim, [...] "marine to marine", he never used the word nigger to describe blacks at any time during the previous ten years, a claim the defense team easily found evidence to refute. Ultimately, the statement that Bailey drew from the detective forced Fuhrman to plead the Fifth in his next courtroom appearance, thereby undermining his credibility with the jury and the otherwise devastating evidence he allegedly found. Bailey also attracted minor attention for keeping a silver flask on the defense table, which fellow defense attorney Robert Kardashian claimed contained only coffee.|$|E
50|$|From 1994 until 2008, KGA relied {{mostly on}} nationally {{syndicated}} talk shows from commentators such as Bill O'Reilly, Laura Ingraham and Michael Savage, {{along with several}} local programs. Former Los Angeles police detective and author <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman,</b> who lives in nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, hosted a local morning show on weekdays until his program was discontinued in November 2007. In April 2008, KGA's news/talk format moved to sister station 970 KJRB, with KJRB's sports format switched to KGA.|$|E

50|$|Ito {{presided over}} the 1995 murder trial of O.J. Simpson, at which Simpson was acquitted.

Lee Bailey's cross-examination of <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> with respect to his use of racial epithets.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{press conference}} leading up to his {{cross-examination}} of Fuhrman, Bailey said, [...] "any lawyer {{in his right mind}} who would not be looking forward to cross-examining <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> is an idiot." [...] During the cross-examination, Bailey was able to get Fuhrman to plead the Fifth in response to key aspects of the case, including planting evidence, thereby undermining Fuhrman’s credibility as a witness. This cross-examination is believed by many {{to be one of the}} keys to Simpson’s acquittal.|$|E

5000|$|Key {{prosecution}} witness Detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman,</b> of the Los Angeles Police Department - who denied using racist language on duty - impeached {{himself with his}} prolific use of nigger in tape recordings about his police work. The recordings, by screenplay writer Laura McKinney, were from a 1985 research session wherein the detective assisted her with a screenplay about LAPD policewomen. Fuhrman excused {{his use of the}} word saying he used nigger in the context of his [...] "bad cop" [...] persona. The popular press reporting and discussing Fuhrman's testimony substituted the N-word for nigger.|$|E
50|$|Bugliosi writes {{at length}} about the {{allegations}} that LAPD detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> had planted a bloody glove in order to frame Simpson. He argues {{that in order for}} Fuhrman to do this, there would have had to have been a vast conspiracy between Fuhrman and the other officers who worked the case. Bugliosi points out that it was highly improbable that Fuhrman or anyone else involved in the case would have tried to frame Simpson, as California law at the time provided that anyone who planted evidence in a death penalty case could have faced the death penalty themselves (though prosecutors ultimately did not seek the death penalty).|$|E
50|$|In March 2003, former LAPD officer Brian S. Bentley {{wrote an}} article for StreetGangs.com in which he claimed Detective Poole and the LAPD {{deliberately}} covered up the true circumstances of Kevin Gaines's death. Bentley alleges that Detective Lyga {{had a history of}} being over-aggressive with African American suspects, and hailed from the same West Los Angeles police station that produced <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman,</b> a station that Bentley believes to be racist. Bentley claims that Lyga was overheard bragging in the lobby of this police station that Internal Affairs had told him they would do everything possible to defame Officer Gaines to clear Lyga of wrongdoing.|$|E
50|$|A key {{piece of}} {{evidence}} against Simpson {{was a pair of}} bloody gloves, one found at the crime scene and the other near a guest house at his mansion. DNA tests matched the blood on both to the victims. Simpson's lawyers alleged that the glove found at his home had actually been with its mate at the crime scene, where LAPD detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman</b> hid it in his sock and planted it in Simpson's yard during a search of the latter. They also raised questions about how the gloves were handled and processed by the LAPD crime lab, suggesting some of the blood was planted at that stage of the investigation as well.|$|E
50|$|Darden {{initially}} {{became involved}} in the O. J. Simpson murder case after being asked by Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman to lead the prosecution of Al Cowlings, Simpson's friend and the driver of the white Ford Bronco during the infamous car chase. Although that particular case fell through due to lack of evidence to prove criminal intent, Clark requested Darden join the Simpson team as case manager since she and Hodgman were bogged down by various motions and filings from the defense. Darden was also tasked by Clark to prepare for testimony, among others, Detective <b>Mark</b> <b>Fuhrman.</b> After Hodgman's medical incapacitation shortly before opening statements, Darden was named co-prosecutor.|$|E
