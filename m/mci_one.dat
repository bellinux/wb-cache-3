Material and methods: In this study, the validity and reliability of our VRT system were investigated in fifteen healthy aged adults (HAA) and seven aged subjects with mild cognitive impairment (<b>MCI).</b> <b>One</b> implicit session was designed through two virtual environments (VEs) in order to induce the adapted activities associated with balance and postural control. In comparison, the same activities were achieved in explicit sessions with a physiotherapist. This cross-over study made use of a qualitative method to collect participants' feelings in both implicit and explicit sessions. Results: The results allowed us to validate the embedded technologies in our system and also the VE features for MCI subjects and their healthy counterparts. The analysis of participants' feelings showed that implicit tasks were preferred to explicit ones. Conclusion: This study highlighted {{that the use of}} VRT generated a competitive spirit in all participants. This point underlines the major role of reward motivation in motor learning processes in rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Weight loss {{is common}} in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{and it could be}} a marker of {{impending}} AD in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and improve prognostic accuracy, if accelerated progression to AD would be shown. To assess weight loss as a predictor of dementia and AD in <b>MCI.</b> <b>One</b> hundred twenty-five subjects with MCI (age 73. 8 ± 7. 1 years) were followed for an average of 4 years. Two weight measurements were carried out at a minimum time interval of one year. Dementia was defined according to DSM-IV criteria and AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Weight loss was defined as a ≥ 4 % decrease in baseline weight. Fifty-three (42. 4 %) MCI progressed to dementia, which was of the AD-type in half of the cases. Weight loss was associated with a 3. 4 -fold increased risk of dementia (95 % CI = 1. 5 - 6. 9) and a 3. 2 -fold increased risk of AD (95 % CI = 1. 4 - 8. 3). In terms of years lived without disease, weight loss was associated to a 2. 3 and 2. 5 years earlier onset of dementia and AD. Accelerated progression towards dementia and AD is expected when weight loss is observed in MCI patients. Weight should be closely monitored in elderly with mild cognitive impairment...|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{clinical}} studies, {{such as the}} Aging Brain {{study of}} Vascular Dementia, generate large amounts of imaging and non-imaging clinical data. Traditional approaches of analysis have tended to separate the non-imaging from the imaging clinical data with little integration between the two[1 - 7]. I intend to use simple ROI- based regression analysis to correlate diffusion MRI metrics, such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD), with behavioral parameters relating to memory function. In order to achieve the needed Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) to do this analysis, I have to improve the qualify of our tissue diffusivity measurements (1) by removing the undesired partial volume noise signal of the Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) [8], [8], [9] and (2) by using a two tensor model to recover two different measurements of tissue statuses in voxels where there are fiber crossings[10], [11]. This approach {{is in line with}} the hypothesis that {{there are two types of}} mild cognitive impairment (<b>MCI),</b> <b>one</b> that has an amnestic component and another without. The type with the amnestic component ishypothesized to be pre- Alzheimer Disease (AD) [12]. This novel approach aims to allow researchers elucidate differential damage to white matter pathways in vivo, in hopes that this will eventually allow us to investigate the different degenerative patterns that separate AD and non- AD MCI...|$|E
40|$|Hurthle cell {{carcinoma}} represents about 5 % of differentiated thyroid carcinomas. The prognosis of the malignant type of the tumour {{is still under}} debate as some Authors have reported that Hurthle cell adenoma occasionally behaves like Hurthle {{cell carcinoma}}. Aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate previously reported data and personal experience on the clinical and pathological features of patients affected by Hurthle cell tumour that may predict disease progression and death. In the literature, factors potentially associated with decreased survival were identified and include: age, disease stage, tumour size, extra-glandular invasion, lymph node disease, distant metastases, extensive surgery, radioiodine treatment. From 1992 to 2003, the Authors identified 28 patients affected by Hurthle cell tumour, 9 with Hurthle cell adenoma and 19 with Hurthle cell carcinoma. Of these, 22 were females and 6 males. Mean age of patients affected by adenoma was 49. 7 years (range 30 - 72) vs. 49. 3 years (range 15 - 72) in Hurthle cell carcinoma patients. In all patients, total thyroidectomy was performed. At histology, 9 adenomas, 5 "minimally invasive" and 14 invasive carcinomas were found. Post-operatively, in Hurthle cell carcinoma patients, TNM staging showed 9 patients with stage I, 5 stage II, 4 stage III and one stage IVa (UICC, 2002). All invasive carcinomas underwent (131) I therapy (91 - 585 <b>mCi).</b> <b>One</b> Hurthle cell carcinoma patient received external beam radiotherapy. The mean follow-up period was 62 months (range 6 - 324). Relapse was not observed in any of the cases with adenoma. Only one Hurthle cell carcinoma patient showed distant lung metastases at 60 months' follow-up. In conclusion, Hurthle cell carcinoma was not found to present a more aggressive behaviour than follicular carcinoma, when risk factors, including extent of tumour invasion, were taken into account. None of the patients with Hurthle cell adenoma showed a relapse or death caused by the tumour...|$|E
40|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} (TLE) {{and mild}} cognitive impairment (MCI) are both subject to intensive memory research. Memory problems are a core characteristic of both conditions and we wonder if there are analogies which would enrich the two distinct research communities. In this review we focus on memory decline in both conditions, that is, the most feared psychosocial effect. While {{it is clear that}} memory decline in MCI is highly likely and would lead to the more severe diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, it is a debate if TLE is a dementing disease or not. As such, like for <b>MCI,</b> <b>one</b> can differentiate progressive from stable TLE subtypes, mainly depending on the age of onset. Neuroimaging techniques such as volumetric analysis of the hippocampus, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortex show evidence of pathological changes in TLE and are predictive for memory decline in MCI. Several studies emphasize {{that it is necessary to}} extend the region of interest - even whole-brain characteristics can be predictive for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease. Electroencephalography is increasingly subject to computational neuroscience, revealing new approaches for analyzing frequency, spatial synchronization, and information content of the signals. These methods together with event-related designs that assess memory functions are highly promising for understanding the mechanisms of memory decline in both TLE and MCI populations. Finally, there is evidence that the potential of such markers for memory decline is far from being exhausted. Similar structural and neurophysiological characteristics are linked to memory decline in TLE and MCI. We raise the hope that interdisciplinary research and cross-talk between fields such as research on epilepsy and dementia, will shed further light on the dementing characteristics of the pathological basis of MCI and TLE and support the development of new memory enhancing treatment strategies. <br/...|$|E
