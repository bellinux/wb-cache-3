40|$|Carbon-carbon bond {{lengths and}} C[dbnd]C {{vibrational}} frequencies are {{reported for the}} linear, all-trans unsubstituted C 2 nH 2 n + 2 (n = 2 – 15), <b>methyl</b> <b>capped</b> C 2 nH 2 nMe 2 (n = 2 – 13), and tert-butyl capped C 2 nH 2 n(tert-butyl) 2 (n = 2 – 5) polyenes (C 2 h) calculated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level. The C[dbnd]C/C–C bond length alternation remains evident at this level for the unsubstituted and <b>methyl</b> <b>capped</b> polyenes as the chain length increases; the center-most difference in {{the length of the}} C–C/C[dbnd]C bonds is ∼ 0. 06 Å for C 30 H 32 and C 26 H 26 Me 2. The Ag, in-phase, harmonic C[dbnd]C Raman frequency for the unsubstituted polyenes decreases from 1699. 2 cm− 1 (n = 2) to 1528. 9 cm− 1 (n = 15); the anharmonic frequency decreases from 1651. 5 cm− 1 (n = 2) to 1547. 7 cm− 1 (n = 8). The harmonic C[dbnd]C frequency for the <b>methyl</b> <b>capped</b> polyenes decreases from 1717. 9 cm− 1 (n = 2) to 1539. 6 cm− 1 (n = 13), and the anharmonic C[dbnd]C frequency decreases from 1675. 0 cm− 1 (n = 2) to 1562. 8 cm− 1 (n = 7).

40|$|Two {{synthesis}} pathways {{were employed}} throughout this work {{to create a}} variety of unique carbon materials. The first of these routes involves the photo-dissociation of liquids by direct irradiation with ultrashort laser pulses; while the second entails the bombardment of polycrystalline chemical layers by a pulsed laser induced carbon plasma. The pulsed laser irradiation (PLI) of liquid benzene (C 6 H 6) was found to result {{in the formation of}} amorphous carbon nanoparticles consisting of clusters of sp 2 -bonded aromatic rings bridged by sp hybridized polyyne functionalities. In a complimentary experiment, liquid toluene (C 6 H 5 CH 3) was irradiated under similar conditions leading to the synthesis of a series of free floating <b>methyl</b> <b>capped</b> polyynes, with chain lengths ranging from C 10 – C 20. The synthesis of polyynes is an active and cutting edge topic in material science and chemistry. In a more complex experiment, solutions of ferrocene and benzene were irradiated by fs-laser pulses resulting in highly ordered mesoscale structures exhibiting four unique geometries; ribbons, loops, tubes, and hollow spherical shells. After a purification process, the higher order structures were destroyed and replaced with nanoparticles consisting of three distinct species including; pure iron, and two phases in which part of the ferrocene molecule was bound to either carbon or iron/carbon complexes. This material is extremely interesting because it exhibits properties similar to that of an electret and is also ferromagnetic over a large temperature range. In the final liquid phase laser irradiation experiment, a new hybrid deposition technique was originated and used to coat stainless steel electrodes with disordered mesoporous nanocrystalline graphite. This method involves the laser induced breakdown of benzene and the subsequent electrodeposition of the resulting carbon ions. Another focus in this work involved the synthesis of a special class of polymer-like carbon nanomaterials using a new method that augments traditional pulsed laser deposition. This technique involves the plasma processing of frozen materials with a pulsed laser initiated graphitic plasma. We call this technique "pulsed laser induced plasma processing" or "PLIPP". Various thin film compositions were created by processing alkane and alkene ices. Finally, in a slight departure from the previous experiments, the effects of carbon ion bombardment on water ice were examined in an effort to understand certain astrophysical processes...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is a process}} integral to cell proliferation. The E 2 F family of transcription factors upregulates expression of transcripts whose products are essential for cell cycle progression. Here, we report that E 2 F 1 promotes gene expression by an additional mechanism, that is, formation of the <b>methyl</b> <b>cap</b> on RNA pol II transcripts. The <b>methyl</b> <b>cap</b> is required for mRNA maturation, expression and stability. We demonstrate that E 2 F 1 increases RNA pol II phosphorylation, which promotes recruitment of the <b>methyl</b> <b>cap</b> synthetic enzymes. Upregulation of RNA pol II phosphorylation is required for E 2 F 1 -dependent <b>methyl</b> <b>cap</b> formation...|$|R
40|$|The c-myc {{proto-oncogene}} {{regulates the}} expression of 15 % to 20 % of all genes, depending on the cell type, and the regulation is usually modest (1. 5 - to 2. 0 -fold). The authors discovered {{that in addition to}} regulating mRNA abundance, c-Myc regulates the formation of the 7 -methylguanosine cap on many mRNAs, including transcriptional target genes and others not transcriptionally activated. Because the 7 -methylguanosine cap is required for effective translation, enhanced <b>methyl</b> <b>cap</b> formation leads to increased protein production from Myc-responsive genes that exceeds the transcriptional induction. Increased cap methylation is linked to Myc-dependent enhanced activity of 2 critical kinases, TFIIH and p-TEFb, which phosphorylate the RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Phosphorylation of the CTD recruits RNGTT and RNMT, the enzymes involved in mRNA capping, to the nascent transcript. Evidence is accumulating that enhanced cap methylation makes a significant contribution to Myc-dependent gene regulation and protein production...|$|R
40|$|Quercetin is {{a member}} of the {{flavonoid}} family, found in fruits and vegetables, and has shown cytotoxic effects on many cancers, including breast cancer. Quercetin’s methylated derivatives, 3 -O-methyl quercetin, pentamethyl quercetin, isorhamnetin, and tamarixetin, differ in their substitution patterns of the <b>methyl</b> <b>capping</b> at the 5 -hydroxyl groups. Cell death assays performed on MDA-MB- 231 cells showed increased cytotoxicity with quercetin and all its methylated derivatives, except pentamethyl quercetin, after 72 hours of treatment. Loss of the mitochondrial outer membrane potential (MOMP) was seen using a JC- 1 assay after 15 min incubation with compounds, except for pentamethyl quercetin. We saw no change in MOMP after 24 hours of treatment with all quercetin derivatives. Treatment with compounds showed no change in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the generation of ROS by TBHP, positive control, was decreased after treatment, indicating that these compounds can function as an anti-oxidant by decreasing cellular ROS. The quercetin derivatives showed cell cycle arrest at various phases. Our data from the cell viability assay suggest that a structure-function relationship exists between methylation of the hydroxyl groups available on the quercetin molecule and its cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells, where the presence of at least one hydroxyl group is necessary for the compound to exert a cytotoxic effect...|$|R
40|$|The steps between {{transcription}} and translation in eukaryotes {{are very}} complicated. In the simplest cases, the primary transcript must acquire a 3 poly-adenine tail and a 5 <b>methyl</b> guanine <b>cap</b> {{in order to}} be transported to the cytoplasm, undergo translation, and remain stable long enough to produce a functional amount of protein. Additionally, in multicellular eukaryotes, most primary transcripts must undergo splicing reactions, in which exons are joined together and non-coding intervening sequences (introns) are removed (see poster). Genes may produce several protein products by the use of alternative mRNA splicing, in which different exons and different intron/exon junctions may be alternatively used in different splice products from the same primary transcript. Alternative splicing is a highly regulated process, and is recognized increasingly as a player in cancer development...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} and photoelectrochemical {{detection of}} tyrosinase (TR) activity (an indicative marker for melanoma cancer cells) is reported, using Pt nanoparticles (NPs) or CdS NPs as electrocatalytic labels or photoelectrochemical reporter units. The Pt Nps or CdS NPs are modified with tyrosine <b>methyl</b> ester, <b>capping</b> layer. Oxidation of the capping layer by TR/O 2 yields the respective L-DOPA and dopaquinone products. The {{reduction of the}} resulting mixture of products with citric acids yields the L-DOPA derivative, as a single product. The association of the L-DOPA derivative funtionalized Pt NPs or CdS NPs to a boronic acid monolayer-modified electrode enables the electrochemical transduction of H 2 O 2 or the photoelectrochemical transduction of TR activity by the generation of photocurrents {{in the presence of}} triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor. The detection limits for analyzing TR corresponds to 1 U and 0. 1 U by the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods, respectively. The association of the Pt NPs or CdS NPs to the functionalized monolayer electrode is followed by quartz crystal microbalance measurements...|$|R
25|$|Because of {{its central}} role in {{controlling}} eukaryotic gene expression, P-TEFb is subject to stringent regulation {{at the level of}} transcription of the genes encoding the subunits, translation of the subunit mRNAs, turnover of the subunits, and also by an unusual mechanism involving the 7SK snRNP. As shown in Figure 3 P-TEFb is held in the 7SK snRNP by the double stranded RNA binding protein HEXIM (HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 in humans). HEXIM bound to 7SK RNA or any double stranded RNA binds to P-TEFb and inhibits the kinase activity. Two other proteins are always found associated with 7SK RNA. The <b>methyl</b> phosphase <b>capping</b> enzyme MEPCE puts a methyl group on the gamma phosphate of the first nucleotide of the 7SK RNA and the La related protein LARP7 binds to the 3' end of 7SK. When P-TEFb is extracted from the 7SK snRNP, 7SK RNA undergoes a conformation change, HEXIM is ejected and hnRNPs take the place of the factors removed. The re-sequestration of P-TEFb requires another rearrangement of the RNA, binding of HEXIM and then P-TEFb. In rapidly growing cells the 7SK snRNP is the predominate form of P-TEFb. For review.|$|R
40|$|This {{memorandum}} summarizes {{decisions made}} by the Environmental Monitoring and Worker Health & Safety (WHS) Branches regarding a method to determine a <b>methyl</b> bromide use <b>cap</b> to protect against unacceptable intermediate-term ambient exposures. Background Common sense, as well as previous work, strongly suggests a relationship between use and intermediate-term air concentrations (Johnson 1995, Cryer and van Wesenbeeck 2001, Li et al. 2001). Higher use causes higher air concentrations. If the relationship between air concentration and use can be established based on regression analysis, then {{it may be possible}} to solve the fitted regression equation to find a use level that, with a specified degree of confidence, will result in average air concentrations at or below the regulatory level of 9 ppb. Such a use level can be described as a ‘cap’, since the purpose would be to restrict use levels to be less than the cap in order to control intermediate-term air concentrations. Air concentrations from regional monitoring by the Air Resources Board (ARB) and possibly, pending final review, by the Alliance of the Methyl Bromide Industry (AMBI) will be used in this analysis. Measurements from both groups consist, with some exceptions, of 24 -hr averag...|$|R
40|$|The {{exponential}} {{increase in}} engineered nanoparticles (ENP) warrants {{the need for}} a battery of well-defined cytotoxicity and genotoxicity screening tests across several organisnn groups. This study aimed to evaluate these effects in vitro using the RTG- 2 cell line as a prelude to further aquatic testing in vivo. Extensive characterisation of the Ti 02 nanoparticles (NP) enabled the synthesis of an efficient dosing strategy in which exposure in PBS gave optimal ENP agglomeration effects when in contact with the cells. Furthermore, when UVillumination was applied there was a much reduced inherent photo-genotoxic activity with PBS than exposing cells in MEM (10 % FBS, 1 % NEAA). Only with a UVA co-exposure were any NP-associated increases in DNA strand breaks recorded, and only with a 4 - 24 hour exposure to 50 mg 1 "^. Supplementation with Fpg (bacterial endonuclease specific for oxidised purine bases) produced elevated strand breakage in all but the highest doses. Micronucleus incidence was not affected by a 48 -hour incubation with the same dose in the dark. The neutral red retention assay results indicate significant cytotoxic effects with a 24 -hour exposure to 50 mg in the dark, but produced a shielding effect from excessive lysosomal damage caused by UVB irradiation. Cells observed using SEM following a 50 mg T^exposure were comprehensively covered in NP. The effect of this extracellular distribution is discussed in terms of inhibited cytoplasmic movement, mitosis and cell-cell communication. Thiol-terminated <b>methyl</b> polyethylene glycol <b>capped</b> CdS and Ag 2 S NPs were found to be innocuous following a 4 -hour exposure in the absence of UVillumination.

40|$|Here {{we present}} a genetic {{analysis}} of the yeast cap-methylating enzyme Abd 1 p. To identify individual amino acids required for Abd 1 p function, we introduced alanine mutations at 35 positions of the 436 -amino acid yeast protein. Two new recessive lethal mutations, F 256 A and Y 330 A, were identified. Alleles F 256 L and Y 256 L were viable, suggesting that hydrophobic residues at these positions sufficed for Abd 1 p function. Conservative mutations of Asp- 178 established that an acidic moiety is essential at this position (i. e., D 178 E was viable whereas D 178 N was not). Phe- 256, Tyr- 330, and Asp- 178 are conserved in all known cellular cap methyltransferases. We isolated temperature-sensitive abd 1 alleles and found that abd 1 -ts cells display a rapid shut-off of protein synthesis upon shift to the restrictive temperature, without wholesale reduction in steady-state mRNA levels. These in vivo {{results are consistent with}} classical biochemical studies showing a requirement for the <b>cap</b> <b>methyl</b> group in cap-dependent translation. We explored the issue of how cap methylation might be regulated in vivo by conducting a genetic screen for high-copy suppressors of the ts growth defect of abd 1 mutants. The identification of the yeast genes SAM 2 and SAM 1, which encode AdoMet synthase, as abd 1 suppressors suggests that Abd 1 p function can be modulated by changes in the concentration of its substrate AdoMet. We also identified the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc 34 p as a high-copy abd 1 suppressor. We show that mutations of Cdc 34 p that affect its ubiquitin conjugation activity or its capacity to interact with the E 3 -SCF complex abrogate its abd 1 suppressor function. Moreover, the growth defect of abd 1 mutants is exacerbated by cdc 34 - 2. These findings suggest a novel role for Cdc 34 p in gene expression and engender a model whereby cap methylation or cap utilization is negatively regulated by a factor that is degraded when Cdc 34 p is overexpressed...|$|R
