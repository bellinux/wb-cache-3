40|$|Energetic {{frustration}} in protein folding is minimized by evolution {{to create a}} smooth and robust energy landscape. As a result the geometry of the native structure provides key constraints that shape protein folding <b>mechanisms.</b> <b>Chain</b> connectivity in particular {{has been identified as}} an essential component for realistic behavior of protein folding models. We study the quantitative balance of energetic and geometrical influences on the folding of SH 3 in a structure-based model with minimal energetic frustration. A decomposition of the two-dimensional free energy landscape for the folding reaction into relevant energy and entropy contributions reveals that the entropy of the chain is not responsible for the folding mechanism. Instead the preferred folding route through the transition state arises from a cooperative energetic effect. Off-pathway structures are penalized by excess distortion in local backbone configurations and contact pair distances. This energy cost is a new ingredient in the malleable balance of interactions that controls the choice of routes during protein folding...|$|R

The most challenging task in VoD applications is to satisfy various peers request for distinct videos with available resources without compromising the quality of video streams by invoking various QoS parameters. Therefore we have proposed a quality of service in <b>chaining</b> <b>mechanism</b> for peer to peer video on demand system. We have also considered the transmission of video streams among the peers and then compared with our proposed mechanism {{with some of the}} existing techniques such as standard, advanced, optimal and accelerated <b>chaining</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> To our proposed VoD architecture we have proposed the quality of service parameters like delay, jitter calculation between the peers.

In this paper we use the method of correctly aligned windows to show that, under the assumptions (a), (b) (c), there are orbits that move a significant amount. As a matter of fact, the method presented here does not require that the tori are exactly invariant, only that they are approximately invariant. Hence, compared with the previous papers, we do not need to use KAM theory. This lowers the assumptions on differentiability. Also, the method presented here allows to produce concrete estimates on the time to move, which were not considered in the previous papers. 1...|$|R
