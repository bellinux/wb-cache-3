500|$|A {{severe mental}} illness {{abruptly}} ended Trott's Test {{career at the}} age of 31. [...] After a series of seizures in 1898, he suffered from insomnia, apathy, and memory loss. [...] Failing to recover lucidity, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital for over a year. After he was discharged, he eventually returned to cricket, and continued to play for his state, Victoria, and club, South Melbourne, into his forties. After his retirement, Trott served as a selector for Victoria for a number of years. Outside of cricket, he worked as a postman and <b>mail</b> <b>sorter.</b> He died of cancer in 1917, aged 51.|$|E
500|$|Trott {{spent his}} entire working life in the Post Office, {{employed}} as a postman and <b>mail</b> <b>sorter.</b> [...] He married Violet Hodson in Fitzroy on 17 February 1890 and the couple had one son. In 1911, Trott became a selector for the Victorian team when Hugh Trumble resigned to take the secretaryship of the Melbourne Cricket Club. [...] Trott's high standing in the cricket community saw the other candidate for the position withdraw rather than oppose him. [...] In 1912, Trott took {{the side of the}} [...] "Big Six", the Australian cricketers opposed to the newly formed Australian Board of Control for International Cricket's attempt to wrest control of touring Australian sides from the players. [...] At an [...] "indignation meeting" [...] at the Athenaeum Hall on Collins Street in Melbourne, the Argus reported Trott as saying that [...] "to say he was disgusted with the Board of Control was to put it mildly" [...] and that [...] "e would like to shake hands with the six men who had stood out against the Board".|$|E

50|$|With the U.S. Postal Service {{introduction}} of postal worksharing, ZIP + 4 and the POSTNET barcode in 1980, companies {{were given an}} incentive to sort their mail prior to inducting it at the Post Office. Today, presort and automation discounts can save companies up to 50% or more on postage—and many companies use <b>Mail</b> <b>Sorters</b> to sort both incoming and outgoing mail.|$|R
50|$|First used by postal {{services}} to expedite and automate mail processing, mail sorting systems are now also used by corporations and other mailers to presort mail {{prior to delivery}} in order to earn discounts on postage. In the United States, for example, presort discounts can {{reduce the cost of}} First-Class Mail from $0.42 to as low as $0.324.

50|$|For {{much of the}} 20th Century, mail was sorted by hand {{using what}} is called a “pigeon-hole messagebox” method. Addresses were read and {{manually}} slotted into specific compartments. While early forms of a mechanical <b>mail</b> <b>sorter</b> were developed and tested in the 1920s, the first sorting machine was put into operation in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|Job {{enlargement}} expands a job horizontally. It increases job scope; that is, {{it increases}} the number of different operations required in a job and {{the frequency with which}} the job cycle is repeated. By increasing the number of tasks an individual performs, job enlargement increases the job scope, or job diversity. Instead of only sorting the incoming mail by department, for instance, a <b>mail</b> <b>sorter's</b> job could be enlarged to include physically delivering the mail to the various departments or running outgoing letters through the postage meter.|$|R

He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the <b>mail</b> <b>sorters</b> made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the February 1986 People Power Revolution which ousted President Ferdinand Marcos, incoming president Cory Aquino appointed Banayo as Postmaster General, succeeding Roilo Golez who had resigned to run for the Senate in the 1987 elections. As Postmaster General, Banayo instituted reforms aimed at reducing employee pilferage, in particular installing one-way mirrors at the Manila International Airport Airmail Distribution Center. He resisted calls to conduct a purge of Marcos-era employees, though he did aim to make executive cuts while expanding the number of <b>mail</b> carriers, <b>mail</b> <b>sorters,</b> and other base-level employees. He also investigated corruption and malfeasance as part of a [...] "big cleanup", in some cases finding that allegations of corruption against certain people were in fact false rumors spread by political opponents, while in other cases finding genuine wrongdoing such as a mail-pilfering syndicate operating in the Ilocos and Cagayan Valley regions. Banayo was also responsible for the push to establish the Philippine Postal Corporation, a government-owned company, to replace the old Bureau of Posts. However, his predecessor Golez' Senate campaign was unsuccessful, and in July 1987 Golez was appointed back to Banayo's post.|$|R
40|$|The first {{epidemiological}} studies to link lack {{of physical activity}} with adverse health outcomes were published in England in 1953 —they identified higher rates of cardiovascular events in occupationally sedentary bus drivers and <b>mail</b> <b>sorters</b> than in occupationally active bus conductors and postal delivery workers. The focus in these early {{epidemiological studies}} was on the health consequences of inactivity, especially time spent sitting at work. In the 1970 s and 1980 s, epidemiological studies {{began to focus on}} activity, particularly in leisure time, and the vast range of health benefits associated with it. This focus on leisure time physical activity has continued to dominate the field of physical activity and public health research into the 21 st century (and indeed forms the raison d’etre for many SMA professionals). We are now starting to focus on understanding and influencing physical activity in all domains of life as we endeavor to reduce the burden of disease and illness attributable to inactivity and overweight in Australia. This presentation will provide a critical overview of the evidence on physical inactivity and adverse health outcomes, from its early focus on sitting at work, through the benefits of leisure time and transport-related activity, to the emerging concept of sedentary physiology. The presentation will introduce a paradigm shift in {{the way we think about}} the balance of activity and inactivity in everyday life. Just how much activity will be necessary, and when must it occur, to keep us merry and bright in our old age...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{intended}} to be another of Johnson's famous organs, this device was adapted into a <b>mail</b> <b>sorter</b> (through such implements as a hopper {{and the presence of}} imps) in his continual striving for functional improvement.

5000|$|Eek the Cat (voiced by Bill Kopp) - Eek always puts others' safety, needs, {{and comfort}} before his own.

[...] His motto is that [...] "It never hurts to help!", although, with Eek this is frequently not the case. The major running gag within {{the show is}} that Eek's selfless nature usually gets him caught up in painful situations such as getting caught in <b>mail</b> and baggage <b>sorters</b> (both of which appear designed to intentionally damage their contents) and screaming [...] "Oh Gosh It Hurts!" [...] while the show's guitar riff theme played. Despite Eek's misfortunes, episodes would usually end with Eek rewarded in some way for facing the adversity squarely and being selfless towards others.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{assumed to}} be dead {{in the time of}} most of the books, Johnson is never seen, but was {{certainly}} alive {{around the time of the}} main events of Night Watch: Lord Snapcase took up the Patricianship in the course of the events chronicled at that time, and he could only have commissioned the Ornamental Cruet Set from Johnson after becoming Patrician. This is also approximately when Johnson must have created the ill-fated <b>mail</b> <b>sorter,</b> as dates in Going Postal suggest that this occurred 30 years before the events chronicled there. Given the nature of the sorter, though, timing may not be a problem.|$|E
