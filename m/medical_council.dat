5|$|In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General <b>Medical</b> <b>Council</b> (GMC) {{for having}} {{released}} medical details about Roger Sylvester, {{a man who}} had died in police custody. In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had {{died of a heart attack}} with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on her thigh. Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.|$|E

In 1892 he was given honorary {{membership}} of the Royal Medical Society; he also became president of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. He was appointed to the General <b>Medical</b> <b>Council</b> in 1883 and remained a member until 1891. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1894. In 1895 he was made president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh; he held the position for two years. In 1898, he was knighted (as Sir John Struthers) by Queen Victoria for his service to medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} the herbal extends beyond {{medicine}} to botany and horticulture. Herbal medicine is still practiced {{in many parts of}} the world but the traditional grand herbal, as described here, ended with the European Renaissance, the rise of modern medicine and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs. The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways. Firstly, discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General <b>Medical</b> <b>Council</b> brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. Secondly, at a more popular level, there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens, medicinal and useful plants. Finally, the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that echo the herbals of the past, an example being Maud Grieve's A Modern Herbal, first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> {{grading system}} has served through decades for the {{evaluation}} of muscle strength and has been recognized as a cardinal feature of daily neurological, rehabilitation and general medicine examination of patients, despite being respectfully criticized due to the unequal width of its response options. No study has systematically examined, through modern psychometric approach, whether physicians are able to properly use the <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> grades. The objectives of this study were: (i) to investigate physicians' ability to discriminate among the <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> categories in patients with different neuromuscular disorders and with various degrees of weakness through thresholds examination using Rasch analysis as a modern psychometric method; (ii) to examine possible factors influencing physicians' ability to apply the <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> categories through differential item function analyses; and (iii) to examine whether the widely used <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> 12 muscles sum score in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy would meet Rasch model's expectations. A total of 1065 patients were included from nine cohorts with the following diseases: Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 480); myotonic dystrophy type- 1 (n = 169); chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (n = 139); limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (n = 105); multifocal motor neuropathy (n = 102); Pompe's disease (n = 62) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined related polyneuropathy (n = 8). <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> data of 72 muscles were collected. Rasch analyses were performed on <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> data for each cohort separately and after pooling data at the muscle level to increase category frequencies, and on the <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> sum score in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Disordered thresholds were demonstrated in 74 - 79 % of the muscles examined, indicating physicians' inability to discriminate between most <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> categories. Factors such as physicians' experience or illness type did not influence these findings. Thresholds were restored after rescoring the <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> grades from six to four options (0, paralysis; 1, severe weakness; 2, slight weakness; 3, normal strength). The <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> sum score acceptably fulfilled Rasch model expectations after rescoring the response options and creating subsets to resolve local dependency and item bias on diagnosis. In conclusion, a modified, Rasch-built four response category <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> grading system is proposed, resolving clinicians' inability to differentiate among its original response categories and improving clinical applicability. A modified <b>Medical</b> Research <b>Council</b> sum score at the interval level is presented and is recommended for future studies in Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropath...|$|R
