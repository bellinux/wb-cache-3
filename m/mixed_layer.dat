25|$|When {{conditions}} turn unfavourable, usually upon {{depletion of}} nutrients, diatom cells typically increase in sinking rate and exit the upper <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> ("bust"). This sinking is induced by either {{a loss of}} buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy resting spores. Sinking out of the upper <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell metabolism). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the thermocline.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, diatom {{cells in}} these resting populations {{re-enter}} the upper <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients {{in the upper}} <b>mixed</b> <b>layer,</b> setting the scene for {{the next round of}} diatom blooms. In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous upwelling), this cycle of bloom, bust, then return to pre-bloom conditions typically occurs over an annual cycle, with diatoms only being prevalent during the spring and early summer. In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.|$|E

25|$|This {{acceleration}} of the current {{takes place in the}} direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the quasi permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the Thermocline.|$|E

25|$|Krill {{typically}} {{follow a}} diurnal vertical migration. It has been assumed that they {{spend the day}} at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the <b>mixed</b> <b>layer.</b> As they sink they produce feces which implies {{a role in the}} Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. Vertical migration may be a 2–3 times daily occurrence. Some species (e.g., Euphausia superba, E. pacifica, E. hanseni, Pseudeuphausia latifrons, and Thysanoessa spinifera) form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E

2500|$|Mixing {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in the limitation of primary production by nutrients.

[...] This is exacerbated where summertime solar heating and reduced winds increases vertical stratification and leads to a strong thermocline, since this makes it more difficult for wind mixing to entrain deeper water. [...] Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the <b>mixed</b> <b>layer,</b> and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light).

The surface zone usually ranges between depths of [...] to [...] below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the surface zone can be entirely non-existent. The surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature.

2500|$|Most krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, form large swarms, {{sometimes}} reaching {{densities of}} 10,000–60,000 individual animals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators {{that would like}} to pick out single individuals. The largest swarms are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm was observed to cover an area of 450 square kilometers (175 square miles) of ocean, to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet) and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface. Until recently it has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. It has been found that the deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the <b>mixed</b> <b>layer.</b> As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators. Dense swarms may elicit a feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy.

Indeed, the salt has been so far precipitated already that there is now five times as much chloride of magnesium left in the water as there is common salt. By the way, it is a lucky thing for us that these various soluble minerals are of such constitution as to be thrown down separately at different stages of concentration in the evaporating liquid; for, if it were otherwise, they would all get deposited together, and we should find on all old salt lake beds only a <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> of gypsum, salt, and other chlorides and sulphates, absolutely useless for any practical human purpose.

Over a 15-day study period in Australia, the diurnal <b>mixed</b> <b>layer</b> cycle repeated in a consistent manner with decaying turbulence throughout the day.|$|E

In a single-mode approximation, the mean flow field and the dependence of the <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> growth rate on the free stream velocity ratio have been determined. The results show evidence for adequacy of the proposed wave model for the description of a turbulent <b>mixing</b> <b>layer.</b> DOI: 10. 1134 /S 1063785013010380...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of dense and {{homogeneous}} canopies, it is well-known that canopy flows are similar to <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> flows (so-called <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> analogy). When the canopy becomes sparser, a transition between the <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> and the boundary layer perturbed by interactions between element wakes occurs. This transition has still to be fully understood and characterized. An experimental work has been developed in order to study this transition for various density canopies...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation of}} the two-dimensional, droplet-laden, turbulent <b>mixing</b> <b>layers</b> at isothermal and non-isothermal conditions has been conducted. The isothermal gaseous <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> was characterized using hot film anemometry {{and the effect of}} shear was assessed. The results showed good agreement with previous investigations. ^ The droplet-laden <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> was then studied and measurements of the droplet field were conducted using a single component phase doppler particle anemometer providing a full characterization of the two-phase <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> in terms of velocity, volume flux and droplet concentration. The higher nonlinear spread rate of the droplet-laden <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> was attributed to the size-dependent droplet dispersion and was correlated to the local Stokes number and relevant time scales of both the droplets and the flow. Droplet dispersion mechanisms inside the <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> were analyzed and supported by a full documentation of the evolution of size-based probability distributions across the layer at different shear. ^ An experimental study targeting dispersion and evaporation of droplets in a differentially-heated <b>mixing</b> <b>layer</b> followed. Differential heating was found to alter droplet and flow time scales ending with a Stokes number modification. The combined effect of small droplet disappearance and large droplet size reduction, shifted more droplets into the dispersed Stokes regime. The interplay between dispersion and evaporation at different heating and shear, was completely described by the evolution of the pdf histograms of droplet size distribution across the differentially heated <b>mixing</b> <b>layer.</b> High shear appeared to balance out the heating effect on size based growth, overwhelm it for intermediate shear and fall short of it at low shear. ^ Visualization using Mie scattering from water droplets and laser induced fluorescence from acetone vapor gave a qualitative confirmation of all the features of the <b>mixing</b> <b>layers</b> under investigation. ...|$|R
