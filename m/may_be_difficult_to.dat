5|$|C.mutica closely {{resemble}} Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native of}} East Asian waters. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), {{as well as the}} elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|In some countries, {{the need}} for more land for housing is {{threatening}} small airfields. These airfields may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> accommodate. This can limit the number of available airfields and so it can require longer drives to reach them.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Seborrheic-like {{psoriasis}} is {{a common}} form of psoriasis with clinical aspects of psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from the latter. This form of psoriasis typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp, forehead, skin folds next to the nose, skin surrounding the mouth, skin on the chest above the sternum, and in skin folds.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent {{studies have shown that}} the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E

5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> train. Training methods {{should always be}} gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about {{six months after the}} decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine {{does not need to be}} unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, hospice care <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in hospice, the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having {{most of their}} care managed directly by the hospice. As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the hospice. Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{resemble}} several edible species commonly {{consumed by}} humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can {{be confused with the}} edible A. velosa, A. lanei or Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, while immature specimens <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from edible Agaricus mushrooms or puffballs. Similar in toxicity to the death cap (A. phalloides) and destroying angels of Europe (A. virosa) and eastern North America (A. bisporigera), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California. Its principal toxic constituent, α-amanitin, damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally, and has no known antidote, though silybin and N-acetylcysteine show promise. The initial symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. These subside temporarily after 2–3days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common; symptoms of jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma may follow with death from liver failure 6–16days post ingestion.|$|E
