50|$|The burden in a CT <b>metering</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{the largely}} {{resistive}} impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 can tolerate an impedance {{of up to}} 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit before its accuracy falls outside of its specification. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT's rated burden. Items {{that contribute to the}} burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices.|$|E
40|$|To {{decrease}} throttling {{losses in}} mobile hydraulic systems {{a number of}} new system architectures have been introduced in recent years. The concept of independent metering (IM), developed in the seventies, shows a lot of promise [1]. By allowing the meter-in as well as meter-out edges to be controlled separately, additional operating modes are created allowing a more efficient adaptation of system pressure to load pressure [2, 3]. Despite these advantages IM circuits have yet to find their way into industrial applications. This is mainly due to the related increase in component costs and more demanding control strategies. Additionally, the effect of mode switching on actuator motion and operator comfort is still unclear and considered to be a challenge. The STEAM mobile hydraulic system currently being developed in Aachen, Germany uses {{a number of new}} features to improve total machine efficiency [4]. Among others is the use of a new independent <b>metering</b> <b>circuit</b> called single edge meter-out control. Unlike other IM configurations, only one proportional valve is used to control cylinder motion. This paper introduces the new concept and discusses its advantages...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the behaviour of an independent <b>metering</b> <b>circuit</b> architectures equipped with electro-hydraulic controlled multi-spools valves. The analysis is performed with reference to the hydraulic circuit and operating conditions usual of the auxiliary utilities of a mid-size power tractors. The increasing interest to reduce pollutant emissions drives the research to alternative solutions for the hydraulic circuit aimed to decrease power dissipation. From this point of view the independent metering architecture is a potentially energy saving system if compared with the traditional single spool valve architecture. This general feeling has however to be proved in the single application field because the amount of energy saved strongly depends on the kind of duty cycle involved in the analysis. For this work, a typical duty cycle for auxiliary utilities has been used, previously obtained through experimental measurement on a tractor equipped with a front loader. The duty cycle adopted involves two linear actuators, working togetherwith different loads and requiring different flows; this general condition cannot be considered favourable from the point of view of the energy saving potential of the new system but it highlights the fact that if there is an amount of energy saved in this condition, the investment need in time and costs is worth. The modelling is based on a lumped parameter approach and the independent metering valves are created developing a distributor block where any single metering element is modelled on the basis of the commercial EHPV Husco. Different control algorithms have been developed in C++ language to test different control strategy,evidencing the amount of energy saved with respect to the traditional architecture...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To form realizations of the {{calculated}} disturbances {{for studying the}} dynamic properties of railway vehicles. Methodology. Records of the track-test car {{for one of the}} typical track sections of the Pridneprovsk railroad are the basic data for building the disturbance components. To derive the true geometric parameters of the railway gauge the records of the track-test car using a double-point <b>metering</b> <b>circuit</b> are transformed considering the transfer function of the measuring system. A model of {{the calculated}} disturbances is presented as the four components: a symmetric vertical irregularity determined as a semi-sum of vertical irregularities of the right and left rails; an oblique-symmetric vertical irregularity of the track determined as a semi-difference of vertical irregularities of the right and left rails; horizontal irregularities of the right and left rails. Acceptability criterion of the constructed disturbances is a relationship between the values of the dynamical properties factors of cars and the corresponding experimental data. Findings. The three techniques for the calculated disturbances forming are proposed. The first technique uses records of the track-test car for the track with a sufficiently high amount for given track conditions as components of the calculated disturbances. In so doing symmetrical vertical components of disturbances resulting from records of settling are corrected with the mass and stiffness parameters of the car under consideration. The second technique uses building and applying the theoretical realizations of irregularities corresponding to a real track according to a spectral analysis. The third technique ensures a polyharmonic model of disturbances, the parameters of which are the values of the basic frequencies and amplitudes that are typical for irregularities of a railway track. A possibility of practical applying of the constructed models of disturbances are presented using an example for defining the standardized factors of the dynamical properties of empty and loaded open cars. Comparison of the calculated factors and experimental data demonstrated its assurance. Originality. The three models of the calculated disturbances {{that can be used for}} calculating estimation of the maximal values of the standardized dynamical factors of freight vehicles are proposed.

An error was found in calculations for the band pass amplifier discussed in Group 9 of the Electronics Progress Report,MLM- 306, March 1 [...] 31, 1949, on the Cathode-Follower Probe. New calculations have been made and a band pass filter constructed to match the new values. Work on the cathode-follower circuit for coupling a Boron-wall tube to its linear amplifier indicated that the limit to the sharpness of a pulse which could be achieved was possibly caused by poor amplitude versus frequency response of the linear amplifier. To check this theory, modifications were made on an existing scaler {{which resulted in a}} frequency response flat up to 4. 5 megacycles.

50|$|It is true the finder {{does not}} go black during exposure, but at small lens apertures, the eye has no time {{to adjust to the}} dark finder. The {{operating}} noise from the Pellix is surprisingly {{similar to that of the}} Canon FX using a moving reflex mirror. Canon made two fast lenses, the FL 50mm 1:1.4 and the FL 58mm 1:1.2, in order to compensate for the light loss, but fast lenses might increase the risk of the sun burning holes in the shutter curtain not being protected by a solid mirror; a fact anticipated and solved by providing the Pellix with a metal shutter curtain. Another obstacle is the risk of light finding its way into the camera by way of the finder window during exposure, since there is no mirror to block the path in its up-position. This was also anticipated, and a finder blind is provided which is operated by turning the ring under the rewind knob, especially useful when leaving the camera on a stand. The <b>Meter</b> <b>circuit</b> is susceptible to breakage due to the CdS meter arm being moved into position behind the pellicle mirror during exposure reading. A special lens was made available for the Canon Pellix, the FLP 38mm 1:2.8, utilising the fact the camera has a stationary mirror that will not hit the lens' rear element. The FLP code indicates that this lens is exclusively to be used on Pellix camera.|$|R
