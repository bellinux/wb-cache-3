Greinke turned down a scholarship offer from Clemson University to sign with the Royals for a $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{engaged in}} {{protracted}} {{negotiations with the}} Marlins, during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College, but he eventually signed on August 28, 1999 to a four-year $7 million contract that included a $3.625 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus. His signing bonus was larger than what the Marlins were paying everyone on the Major League roster, except pitcher Alex Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|After the draft, Latos {{demanded a}} $3 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus from the Padres. When the Padres {{did not meet}} his demands, Latos {{enrolled}} at Broward College, a junior college, to pitch for their baseball team. As the Padres retained the right to sign Latos until {{the start of the}} 2007 MLB draft, the Padres sent scout Joe Bochy to observe every start Latos made. Latos had a 10–3 win–loss record and a 2.03 ERA. Feeling that Latos was worth the gamble, the Padres paid Latos $1.25 million a few days before he would have re-entered the draft in 2007.|$|E

[...] With Drill providing additional direction and the POPS business established, {{the company and the}} POPS program grew quickly, reaching 1 <b>million</b> <b>signs</b> in 2001 and 40 <b>million</b> <b>signs</b> in 2011.

5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he would sign if offered a $1.8 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E
5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus ($2.5 million paid in the first year and $500,000 in the second). The deal paid him $4.3 million the first year, $6.633 million the second year and $6.933 for the third and fourth.|$|E
5|$|First {{base was}} the highest paid {{position}} in 2010; regular starters at that position earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average of $3,014,572.

Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989, while 2010 was the first season where the MLB average salary rose above that same mark. Five of the twenty highest paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB.|$|E

Cain earned a $5 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus, and earned $20 million each season from 2013–17. His $21 million option for 2018 would vest automatically {{if he was not}} on the disabled list to an elbow or shoulder injury in 2017 and if he reached 400 innings in 2016 and 2017 combined. If the option failed to vest, the Giants could either pick up the $21 million option or pay a $7.5 million buyout. Cain was scheduled to become a free agent after the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E
5|$|Stoke won {{automatic}} {{promotion to}} the Premier League {{on the final}} day of the 2007–08 season, finishing in 2nd place in the Championship. On 18 July 2008, the club broke their transfer record to purchase striker Dave Kitson for £5.5 million from Reading. A 3–1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2008–09 season saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. The following weekend, the Britannia Stadium hosted its first ever top-flight game, against Aston Villa, with a home win courtesy of Mamady Sidibe's injury-time goal from a Rory Delap throw-in, giving Stoke City their first ever Premier League points. The club went on to record a 12th-place finish in their first season back in the Premier League. A much cited aspect of the team's style of play has been the utilisation of Rory Delap's long throw to create goal-scoring opportunities. Pulis signed Robert Huth and Tuncay Şanlı from Middlesbrough for a combined fee in the region of £10 million, in a bid to establish the club in the Premier League prior to the 2009–10 season. This feat was achieved comfortably as the club finished in 11th place, thereby securing a third season in the Premier League. Pulis bolstered his squad for 2010–11 season with the club record £8 <b>million</b> <b>signing</b> of Kenwyne Jones.|$|E
