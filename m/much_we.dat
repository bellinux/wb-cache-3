25|$|It is {{no secret}} {{that there have been}} some {{difficult}} episodes in our past – Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however <b>much</b> <b>we</b> might sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.|$|E
25|$|The {{apartment}} {{resembles a}} prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily {{on all of}} us. As none of us do <b>much,</b> <b>we</b> haven’t got much to tell each other. Incapable of sharing our emotions, we each enclose ourselves in our own fear and distress. Since everyone {{is in the same}} black pit, there isn’t much point in repeating time and again that we can’t see clearly.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that <b>much.</b> <b>We</b> just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

Glover said: We {{not only have}} great respect for each other as athletes but we are great friends on and off the water.

25|$|This <b>much</b> <b>we</b> know: William (Gen. 2) Carpenter's {{admission}} as a Massachusetts Bay Colony freeman from Weymouth in 1640 required church membership. The {{minister at}} Weymouth was Rev. Samuel Newman, most of whose congregation accompanied him to Rehoboth, {{where he was}} also the minister. William (Gen. 2) Carpenter was one of Rehoboth's fifty-eight original proprietors and is buried in Old Rehoboth (Newman Church) Cemetery. (While records of the time provide no direct evidence as to the religious affiliation of William (Gen. 2) Carpenter of Rehoboth, he was certainly not a Baptist, even though other Carpenters in New England were. In this regard, he is sometimes confused with William Carpenter (Rhode Island) of Providence and others.|$|E

500|$|Alison Halsall said [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] is {{the strongest}} example {{of a history of}} scatology, the study of excrement, {{throughout}} the South Park series. Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character, and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved, directly confronts the viewer with [...] "the inherent dirtiness of the human body, no matter how <b>much</b> <b>we</b> try to aestheticize it, Mr. Hankey's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order. [...] South Park refuses sanitization through the gross-out factor." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing about}} this, {{conductor}} Michael Gielen stated: [...] "When {{he said he}} knew what was happening at Sirius, I turned away from him in horror.

I cannot imagine that there is anything senseless in the universe. There is <b>much</b> <b>we</b> do not understand" [...]|$|E

We're {{going to do it}} through music and the celebration of rock and roll." [...] The artwork on the deluxe edition released in Target stores added gold foil to the patterns.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{summarised}} {{the importance}} of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying, [...] "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian". In his 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented that Epstein's death {{marked the beginning of}} the end for the group: [...] "I knew that we were in trouble then... I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian would really be happy to hear how <b>much</b> <b>we</b> loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} to publicise the final episode of Voyager, [...] "Endgame", Beltran said, [...] "We all had a great relationship {{with each other and}} we've all said how <b>much</b> <b>we</b> enjoy our crew. We have a terrific crew. But at the same time, I'm looking forward to what's next. It's exciting to know that something unknown is next." [...] The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay. Ryan found this confusing for the characters, as although it had been suggested in the episode [...] "", the producers told the pair to forget about the relationship in the in-between episodes until the finale.|$|E

500|$|Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures {{experienced}} financial difficulties. Spielberg {{estimated the}} film would cost $2.7million {{to make in}} his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, but the final budget came to $19.4million. Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, [...] "If {{we knew it was}} going to cost that <b>much,</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't have greenlighted it because we didn't have the money." [...] Spielberg hired Joe Alves, his collaborator on Jaws, as production designer. In addition the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to Alabama. A large portion of the sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike. Columbia raised $7 million from three sources: Time Inc., EMI, and German tax shelters.|$|E

[...] However, Becky Bain of Idolator thought the [...] "pulsating dance song" [...] was underwhelming. [...] "We have to admit, we’re not bowled over by this one, which pretty much follows a standard, predictable dance-pop formula from the double shout-out at the start to the 'woosh'ing fade-out finish". However Bain also pointed out that current trends on the US Billboard Hot 100 were unpredictable, [...] "then again, since when has the Hot 100 shyed away from generic pop tunes we’ve heard over and over again? This one could go either way, folks." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call on April 17, 2001, then-Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Skilling {{verbally}} attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman, who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied [...] "Well, thank you very <b>much,</b> <b>we</b> appreciate that...asshole." [...] This became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness, with slogans such as [...] "Ask Why, Asshole", a variation on Enron's official slogan [...] "Ask why". However, Skilling's comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, as he had previously disdained criticism of Enron coolly or humorously.|$|E

500|$|Robert Smith's {{personal}} favourite is {{the cover}} recorded by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., which was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US).

The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it we liked it so <b>much</b> <b>we</b> didn't {{want to give it}} to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has [...] "influenced how we play it live".|$|E
500|$|Apparently {{scientists}} are still discovering {{hundreds of new}} {{plant and animal species}} there every year, which goes to show that there is still so <b>much</b> <b>we</b> don't know about the region. I just fell in love with it; it gets under your skin. Woodside Petroleum are planning to build one of the world's biggest LNG (liquified natural gas) processing plants on the Kimberley coast, just north of Broome. They would be drilling for the gas out at sea and bringing it onshore at this plant, which would just be devastating for the region. The question everyone is asking is, why not process it offshore or pipe it to one of the mining towns down south that already have the infrastructure in place? Why ruin the Kimberley if there's an alternative? ...|$|E
500|$|Parker said {{following}} the tremendous success of [...] "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", {{much of the}} direct feedback he received for [...] "Damien" [...] was negative.
