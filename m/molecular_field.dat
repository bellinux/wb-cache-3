40|$|C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), {{secreted}} by vascular endothelial cells, {{belongs to}} a family of peptides that includes atrial and brain natriuretic peptides. CNP exhibits many vasoprotective effects against pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis [...] In lungs of CNP-treated mice, expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, S 100 A 8, and E-selectin genes was significantly lower than that in vehicle-treated mice. CNP had a protective effect on ALI induced by LPS by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration. CNP may hold promise in therapeutic strategies for ALI after pulmonary resection surgery. The continuous <b>molecular</b> <b>fields</b> (CMF) approach {{is based on the}} application of continuous functions for the description of <b>molecular</b> <b>fields</b> instead of finite sets of molecular descriptors (such as interaction energies computed at grid nodes) commonly used for this purpose. These functions can be encapsulated into kernels and combined with kernel-based machine learning algorithms to provide a variety of novel methods for building classification and regression structure-activity models, visualizing chemical datasets and conducting virtual screening. In this Research and Scientific Project, the CMF approach is applied to building 3 D-QSAR models for 8 datasets through the use of five types of <b>molecular</b> <b>fields</b> (the electrostatic, steric, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor ones), the linear convolution molecular kernel with the contribution of each atom approximated with a single isotropic Gaussian function, and the kernel ridge regression data analysis technique.

40|$|Calculated {{molecular}} properties from 3 D <b>molecular</b> <b>fields</b> {{of interaction}} energies {{have become a}} valuable approach to correlate 3 D molecular structures with physicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties. In contrast, their use in correlations with pharmacokinetic properties is still poorly explored and exploited. 3 D <b>molecular</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be obtained from}} ab initio, semiempirical or molecular mechanics levels of calculation. The newly developed procedure called VolSurf is able to compress the relevant information present in 3 D maps into a few descriptors characterised by the simplicity of their use and interpretation. These descriptors can be quantitatively compared and used to build multivariate models correlating 3 D molecular structures with biological responses. The VolSurf procedure is applied here to generate descriptors and models of structure-permeation relationships. The VolSurf procedure, which was originally designed to handle a medium amount of data, can easily be applied to problems of large size such as bioisostere databases, CombyChem databases and related approaches.
