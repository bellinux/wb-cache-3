5|$|During Tkach's tenure, {{the changes}} that he {{implemented}} stirred <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> and significant dissent among those who continued to follow Armstrong's theology. The dissenters labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, some have hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from the fringe to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.|$|E

5|$|The 1976 All Blacks tour of {{apartheid}} South Africa generated <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> {{and led to}} the boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal by 33 African nations after the IOC refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall {{of apartheid}}. The 1976 tour contributed to the Gleneagles Agreement being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.|$|E
5|$|The former England home strip {{was white}} with {{a strip of}} red around the neck, and the away strip was black (causing <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> due to the famous All-Black kit of New Zealand), both kits had a ground {{breaking}} new technology {{in the form of}} a gripper print. A special strip was worn during the match versus Wales in the 2010 Six Nations Championship which replicated that worn in 1910 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Twickenham.|$|E
5|$|After the Portland Rosebuds, an American-based team, {{joined the}} PCHA in 1914, the {{trustees}} {{issued a statement}} that the Cup was no longer for {{the best team in}} Canada, but now for {{the best team in the}} world. Ice hockey in Europe was still in its infancy at this time, so it was without <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> that winners of the Stanley Cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball. Two years later, the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1917, the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup. After that season, the NHA dissolved, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place.|$|E

50|$|Secular {{schooling}} sparked <b>much</b> <b>controversies</b> {{among the}} Hong Kong Governor and religious leaders. In many occasions, the Governor personally scrutinized and intervened the school operations. The Government later established a grant program to put religious schools {{at the same}} funding level as the Central School.On 26 April 1884, Sir George Bowen, Governor from 1883 to 1887, administered the stone-laying ceremony for the new school building at Aberdeen Street.

5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck {{structure}} indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about <b>much</b> <b>controversy.</b> An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E

Croatian wartime documents discovered in the Military History Institute in Belgrade after his death show that the ZNDH credited him with 44 confirmed kills. At least one other source indicates a tally of 40 confirmed kills with five unconfirmed. The ZNDH total of 44 included 18 LaGG-3s, 12 Ilyushin Il-2s, three P-39s, two DB-3s, two Yak-1s, and one each of the following aircraft; II-16, MiG-3, Spitfire, La-5, Yak-9, Pe-2, and A-20.

Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused <b>much</b> <b>controversy.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>controversy</b> has {{surrounded}} the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that {{do not meet the}} current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has {{been the source of}} <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E

He subsequently participated in Batory's Livonian campaign, fighting at Polotsk, Rossony (Sokół), Velizh and at the Siege of Pskov. Żółkiewski maintained his political alliance with the Zamoyski family after those campaigns ended, particularly in their conflict with the Zborowscy. On the night of 11 to 12 May 1584 he captured Samuel Zborowski, whose subsequent execution caused <b>much</b> <b>controversy.</b> Żółkiewski became notorious {{for his role in}} the incident, and was the subject of heated debates during the Sejm of 1585.|$|E
5|$|John White Stevenson {{was born}} May 4, 1812, in Richmond, Virginia. He {{was the only}} child of Andrew and Mary Page (White) Stevenson. His mother—the granddaughter of Carter Braxton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence—died during childbirth. Stevenson was sent to live with his {{maternal}} grandparents, John and Judith White, until he was eleven; by then, his father had remarried. His father, a prominent Virginia lawyer, rose to political prominence during Stevenson's childhood. He was elected to Congress, eventually serving as Speaker of the House and was later appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James's (now called the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom) by President Martin Van Buren, where he engendered <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> by his pro-slavery practices. Because of his father's position, young Stevenson had met both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Ethel & Millie then {{abandoned}} their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and <b>much</b> <b>controversy</b> exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion {{at the time was}} that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew or abandoned at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.|$|E

50|$|Slavic {{languages}} {{are not considered}} agglutinative but fusional. However, extreme derivations similar to ones found in typical agglutinative languages do exist. A famous example is the Bulgarian word непротивоконституциослователствувайте, meaning don't speak against the constitution and secondarily don't act against the constitution. It is composed of just three roots: против against, конституция constitution, a loan word and therefore devoid of its internal composition and слово word. The remaining are bound morphemes for negation (не, a proclitic, otherwise written separately in verbs), noun intensifier (-ателств), noun-to-verb conversion (-ува), imperative mood second person plural ending (-йте). It is rather unusual, but finds some usage, e.g. newspaper headlines on 13 July 1991, {{the day after the}} current Bulgarian constitution was adopted with <b>much</b> <b>controversies,</b> debate and even scandals.|$|R
