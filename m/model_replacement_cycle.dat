50|$|During {{the period}} from 1997-2006, 45 eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycles</b> were {{observed}} in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean, 12 in the Eastern North Pacific and 2 in the Western North Pacific. 12% of all Atlantic storms and 5% of storms in the Pacific underwent eyewall replacement during this time period.

In the Pacific, 33% of major hurricanes and 16% of all hurricanes had an eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle.</b> Stronger storms have a higher probability of forming a secondary eyewall, with 60% of category 5 hurricanes underwent an eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle</b> within 12 hours.|$|R

50|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Funso {{turned toward}} the southwest due to a building ridge to its east. Late on January 24, the cyclone began an eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle,</b> which initiated a brief weakening trend. MF remarked that Funso weakened below intense tropical cyclone intensity early on January 25. At the same time, the JTWC estimated the cyclone intensified further to peak 1 minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph), based on estimates via the Dvorak technique. The agency noted that the eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle</b> finished and produced a well-defined eye 28 km (17 mi) in diameter. At 1200 UTC on January 25, MF again upgraded Funso to an intense tropical cyclone, and later that day the cyclone began another eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle,</b> and developed a larger eye measuring 55 kilometers across. Funso underwent another eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle</b> on January 27 as it started weakening. On January 27, the government of Mozambique formally announced that the cyclone had begun to gradually weaken in the early-morning hours. Cyclone Funso is slated to pose no imminent threat to the northeastern coast of South Africa. On January 28, Funso weakened rapidly and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, due to strong vertical wind shear, and colder sea surface temperatures below 25°C.|$|R

50|$|While {{secondary}} eyewalls {{have been}} seen as a tropical cyclone is nearing land, none have been observed while the eye is not over the ocean. July offers the best background environmental conditions for development of a secondary eyewall. Changes in the intensity of strong hurricanes such as Katrina, Ophelia, and Rita occurred simultaneously with eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycles</b> and comprised interactions between the eyewalls, rainbands and outside environments. Eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycles,</b> such as occurred in Rita as it approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, can greatly increase the size of tropical cyclones while simultaneously decreasing in strength.|$|R

5000|$|Small/minuscule eyes—those {{less than}} 10 nmi (19 km, 12 mi) across—often trigger eyewall <b>replacement</b> <b>cycles,</b> where a new eyewall begins to form outside the {{original}} eyewall. This {{can take place}} anywhere from fifteen to hundreds of kilometers (ten to a few hundred miles) outside the inner eye. The storm then develops two concentric eyewalls, or an [...] "eye within an eye". In most cases, the outer eyewall begins to contract soon after its formation, which chokes off the inner eye and leaves a much larger but more stable eye. While the <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle</b> tends to weaken storms as it occurs, the new eyewall can contract fairly quickly after the old eyewall dissipates, allowing the storm to re-strengthen. This may trigger another re-strengthen <b>cycle</b> of eyewall <b>replacement.</b>|$|R

Comparable efforts with consumer durable goods, however, are generally absent. This paper presents an application of the brand switching model proposed by Colombo and Morrison (1989) to a set of four major home appliances. Appliance brand loyalty, however, is shown to be a function of the timing of replacements, a factor that has not entered into the modelling of packed goods.

40|$|Many durable goods, {{particularly}} in the high technology sector of the economy, experience rapid quality improvement. As a result, replacement is typically due to obsolescence rather than breakdown, and <b>replacement</b> <b>cycles</b> are relatively short. When these goods are vertically differentiated, consumers must make two important, inter-related choices upon making a purchase: what quality level to buy, and how long to wait between purchases. In this paper, we analyze how these two decisions relate to underlying preferences and to each other both theoretically and empirically. We demonstrate how a single, tenuous assumption in a commonly used theoretical model can drive the relationships we would predict when we take this model to the data. This highlights {{the necessity of a}} more direct empirical analysis. In our empirics, we show that quality choice and <b>replacement</b> <b>cycle</b> length (RCL) are generally positively correlated. We also find evidence of non-monotonic relationships between quality choice and marginal utility of quality and RCL choice and marginal utility of money. That is, households who value quality more don't always buy higher-quality PCs, and households who value money less don't always buy more frequently, ceteris paribus. Our results provide new insights into the nature of durable goods demand, the proper characterization of markets and market segments, and welfare measures.
