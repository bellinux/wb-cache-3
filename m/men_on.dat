5|$|In {{the next}} match, <b>Men</b> <b>on</b> a Mission {{challenged}} The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked <b>Men</b> <b>on</b> a Mission before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel {{but did not}} get a pinfall. <b>Men</b> <b>on</b> a Mission regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, to pull his wrestlers out of the ring. <b>Men</b> <b>on</b> a Mission won the match by countout, but they did not win the belts.|$|E

5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen <b>men</b> <b>on</b> board perished in the attack.

5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
