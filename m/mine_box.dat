50|$|Goldfields is an {{abandoned}} community in Division No. 18, Saskatchewan, Canada. It previously held {{the status of}} a village until April 1, 1950. The community was informally founded in 1936 by prospectors after the 1934 discovery of gold on the north shore of Lake Athabasca. The <b>Box</b> <b>Mine,</b> operated by Consolidated Mining & Smelting Company of Canada (Cominco) operated from 1939-1942. With the closure of the <b>Box</b> <b>Mine</b> during World War II, Goldfields became a ghost town. Uranium was then discovered in 1948 and a new mining community was built at Uranium City, a few kilometers to the north of Lake Athabasca. Many buildings from Goldfields were salvaged and moved to the new town in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} wooden <b>box</b> <b>mines,</b> the mine has a {{relatively}} short lifetime since the box is vulnerable to rotting and splitting, disabling the mine. It is, however, more dangerous, {{due to the fact}} that it can't be found with a metal detector.|$|R

5000|$|Leo McCarey {{graduated}} from the University of Southern California law school and besides the law tried <b>mining,</b> <b>boxing,</b> and songwriting before becoming an assistant director to Tod Browning in 1919. It was McCarey's boyhood friend, the actor and future fellow director David Butler, who referred him to Browning. Browning convinced McCarey, despite his photogenic looks, {{to work on the}} creative side as a writer rather than as an actor. McCarey then honed his skills at the Hal Roach Studios. Roach had hired him as a gagman in 1923, after McCarey had impressed him with his sense of humor, following a game of handball together at a sports club. McCarey initially wrote gags for the Our Gang series and other studio stars, then produced and directed shorts, including two-reelers with Charley Chase. Chase would in fact become McCarey's mentor. Upon the comedian's death in 1940, McCarey was quoted as saying, [...] "Whatever success I have had or may have, I owe to his help because he taught me all I know." [...] The two men were especially compatible, as they both enjoyed a hobby on the side trying to write popular songs. While at Roach, McCarey, according to later interviews, cast Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy together and guided development of their onscreen characters, thus creating one of the most enduring comedy teams of all time. He only officially appeared as director of the duo's shorts We Faw Down (1928), Liberty (1929) and Wrong Again (1929), but wrote many screenplays and supervised the direction by others. By 1929, he was vice-president of production for the studio. Less well known from this period are the shorts he directed with Max Davidson when Roach put together the Irish-American McCarey with the Jewish-American actor for a series of [...] "dialect comedies." [...] These shorts such as Pass The Gravy have been rediscovered in recent years, after their exhibition in 1994 at the Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone Italy. Pass The Gravy was added to the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress in 1999.|$|R

40|$|In this study, data <b>mining</b> using <b>box</b> {{plots and}} multivariate {{statistical}} analysis using factor analysis are employed for a spatio-temporal analysis of coastal water quality data from Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong. The analysis of box plots reveals pronounced spatial heterogeneity of the parameters studied. The spatial analysis clearly shows monitoring station TM 2 in the Harbour Subzone {{to be most}} susceptible to eutrophication with the highest nutrient and algal biomass concentrations. The factor analysis brings to light dominant parameters to the ecological system under the coastal marine environment. The temporal analysis confirms the considerable decline in nutrient levels in recent years. In spite of this decline, the factor analysis indicates that nutrient processes {{play an important role}} even in recent years, suggesting an adequate supply of nutrients. It seems that they are being released from sources other than known point sources, possibly from nutrients accumulated in the sediments, necessitating steps to be undertaken for their control also.

50|$|Exports {{continued}} to increase to the point where, in 1986, New Hope's market mix had about-faced to 90% export and 10% domestic sales. Despite the district's increase in exports through QBH, which reached 1.6 million tonnes, the reduced requirements for the Swanbank Power Station and cessation of supplies to the Brisbane power stations resulted in a drop in production of close to 12%. Total production from the Ipswich area was 2.8 million tonnes (1.54 from open cut mines and 1.28 from underground operations). Two <b>mines,</b> Westfalen and <b>Box</b> Flat were forced to close due to the termination of their supply agreements with the Swanbank Power Station.|$|R
50|$|Using a sluice box {{to extract}} gold from placer {{deposits}} {{has long been}} a very common practice in prospecting and small-scale <b>mining.</b> A sluice <b>box</b> is essentially a man made channel with riffles set in the bottom. The riffles are designed to create dead zones in the current to allow gold to drop out of suspension. The box is placed in the stream to channel water flow. Gold-bearing material is placed {{at the top of the}} box. The material is carried by the current through the volt where gold and other dense material settles out behind the riffles. Less dense material flows out of the box as tailings.|$|R

We include numerous examples of highly discriminative features that model either biological reality or common linguistic constructs. Finally, we discuss a number of insights from our FS analyses that will provide the opportunity to considerably improve upon current text mining tools.

5000|$|In 1969, William A. Brown and French {{oceanographer}} Jacques Cousteau and {{his team}} explored Truk Lagoon. Following Cousteau's 1971 television documentary about the lagoon and its ghostly remains, the place became a scuba diving paradise, drawing wreck diving enthusiasts {{from around the world}} to see its numerous, virtually intact sunken ships. The shipwrecks and remains are sometimes referred to as the [...] "Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon". Scattered mainly around the Dublon, Eten, Fefan and Uman islands within the Truk group, a number of the shipwrecks lie in crystal clear waters less than 15 m below the surface. In waters devoid of normal ocean currents, divers can easily swim across decks littered with gas masks and depth charges and below deck can be found evidence of human remains. In the massive ships' holds are the remnants of fighter aircraft, tanks, bulldozers, railroad cars, motorcycles, torpedoes, <b>mines,</b> bombs, <b>boxes</b> of munitions, radios, plus thousands of other weapons, spare parts, and other artifacts. Of special interest is the wreck of the submarine I-169 Shinohara which was lost when diving to avoid the bombing. The submarine had participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.|$|R
40|$|A {{major impact}} of {{eutrophication}} is the stimulation of algal {{growth and the}} production of harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs can have profound negative effects on the environment, which include severe dissolved oxygen depletion, fish kills, discoloration of marine water, beach closures, etc. Owing to the extremely complicated ecological processes, previous research efforts indicate that it is far from accurately unravelling the causality and dynamics of HABs and predicting their occurrence with acceptable accuracy and lead-time. Thus, techniques to better understand the complex interrelated processes in the ecosystem are needed. In this study, visual data <b>mining</b> using <b>box</b> plots and multivariate statistical analysis using factor analysis are employed for a spatio-temporal analysis of coastal water quality data from Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong (Figure 1). To study spatial patterns, data from the seven monitoring stations (shown in Figure 1) are used. To study temporal patterns, two datasets from different periods were used: one when the water quality in Tolo Harbour was at its worst (in the late eighties) and the second dataset being more recent, when the water quality had improved significantly. This study demonstrates the use of data mining techniques to exhibit prominent spatial and temporal patterns and to reveal dominant variables governing key ecological processes and thus provide further insight into the HAB dynamics...|$|R
500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these <b>mines</b> used rockers, <b>boxes</b> that moved {{back and forth like a}} cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|R

Gunner Mills {{was known to}} his comrades as 'Paddy' and was strong member of the regimental football team. On 5 December 1944, after the fighting for Blerick in the Netherlands, the regiment was in convoy and halted in a taped route through a minefield. [...] "The story goes that Paddy had found most of a German Machine Gun and was keen to complete his trophy … Suddenly Paddy was heard to shout 'That's just what I'm looking for' or words to that effect. He {{jumped out of the}} lorry, and into the minefield. It's not clear whether he stepped on a <b>mine,</b> or the <b>box</b> he picked up was booby-trapped, but Paddy was killed instantly." [...] He left a widow, Lucy, and is buried in Venray War Cemetery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{relational}} data model has simple and clear foundations on which significant theoretical and systems research has flourished. By contrast, most research on data mining {{has focused on}} algorithmic issues. A major open question is: what's an appropriate foundation for data mining, which can accommodate disparate mining tasks? We address this problem by presenting a database model and an algebra for data mining. The database model {{is based on the}} 3 W-model introduced by Johnson et al. [2000]. This model relied on black <b>box</b> <b>mining</b> operators. A main contribution {{of this article is to}} open up these black boxes, by using generic operators in a data mining algebra. Two key operators in this algebra are regionize, which creates regions (or models) from data tuples, and a restricted form of looping called mining loop. Then the resulting data mining algebra MA is studied and properties concerning expressive power and complexity are established. We present results in three directions: (1) expressiveness of the mining algebra; (2) relations with alternative frameworks, and (3) interactions between regionize and mining loop...|$|R
