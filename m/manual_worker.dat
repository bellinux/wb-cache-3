40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} handgrip data for right hand dominant normal Chinese subjects. Sixty-four males were studied for their power grip and lateral pinch strengths. They were categorized into non-manual and <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> Standardized procedure and instructions were used for handgrip testing. Results showed that both the non-manual and <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> demonstrated stronger power grip and lateral pinch strengths in their dominant hands. The 10 % rule was applicable only for power grip strength of non- <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> and lateral pinch strength of <b>manual</b> <b>workers.</b> No significant difference was found between the dominant grip strengths in these two groups of subjects. It was recommended that when assessing the progress and outcome of hand rehabilitation, the occupation and demand level of hand use of the patient must be taken into consideration when using the uninjured hand for comparison...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Candidate {{risk factors}} for {{idiopathic}} rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) include heavy manual handling (requiring Valsalva’s maneuver). We assessed incidence rates of surgically treated idiopathic RRD among <b>manual</b> <b>workers,</b> non-manual workers and housewives resident in Tuscany, Italy. Methods We retrieved all hospital discharge records bearing a principal diagnosis corresponding to RRD coupled with retinal surgery for any resident of Tuscany during 1997 – 2009. After elimination of repeated admissions and patients with coexistent, associated conditions (including recent trauma), subjects aged 25 – 59 years were classified as <b>manual</b> <b>workers,</b> non-manual workers or housewives. Population data were extracted from the 2001 census. Results We identified 1, 946 eligible cases (1, 142 men). Among men, <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> experienced a 1. 8 -fold higher age-standardized rate per 100, 000 person-years than non-manual workers [17. 4 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 16. 1 – 18. 7) vs. 9. 8 (95 % CI 8. 8 – 10. 8) ]. Age-standardized rates among women were 1. 9 -fold higher for <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> [11. 1 (95 % CI 9. 8 – 12. 3) ] and 1. 7 -fold higher for housewives [9. 5 (95 % CI 8. 3 – 10. 8) ] than in non-manual workers [5. 7 (95 % CI 4. 8 – 6. 6) ]. Conclusions This large population-based study suggests that <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> are affected by idiopathic RRD requiring surgical treatment more often than non-manual workers. The higher rates of surgically treated RRD experienced by <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> are {{in accord with the}} hypothesis that heavy manual handling may have a causal role. <br/...|$|R
25|$|Between 1964 and 1968, {{benefits}} in kind were significantly progressive, in that over the period those in {{the lower half of}} the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half. On average those receiving state benefits benefited more in terms of increases in real disposable income than the average <b>manual</b> <b>worker</b> or salaried employee between 1964 and 1969. From 1964 to 1969, low-wage earners did substantially better than other sections of the population. In 1969, a married couple with two children were 11.5% per cent richer in real terms, while for a couple with three children, the corresponding increase was 14.5%, and for a family with four children, 16.5%. From 1965 to 1968, the income of single pensioner households as a percentage of other one adult households rose from 48.9% to 52.5%. For two pensioner households, the equivalent increase was from 46.8% to 48.2%. In addition, mainly as a result of big increases in cash benefits, unemployed persons and large families gained more in terms of real disposable income than the rest of the population during Wilson's time in office.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{treating}} people equally is not {{by itself}} enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment. According to Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA disabilities involve an impairment [...] "which hinders {{the participation of the}} person concerned in professional life". This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound to do as much as reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make [...] "reasonable adjustments". For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the [...] "disability" [...] if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person's handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, Archibald v Fife Council, it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Mrs Archibald, previously a road sweeper, had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a <b>manual</b> <b>worker,</b> in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in O’Hanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners the Court of Appeal rejected {{that it would be a}} reasonable adjustment, as Ms O'Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim is always to ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible.|$|E

The high ratio of professional to <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> is clearly the reason for the industry having fewer observed than expected deaths and the inverse relation with dose for less privileged workers is probably a sign that there has been selective recruitment of the most highly paid <b>manual</b> <b>workers</b> [...] that is, skilled craftsmen into the more dangerous occupations.

60|$|The giants {{come soon}} enough; and Freia flies to Wotan for {{protection}} against them. Their purposes are quite honest; {{and they have}} no doubt of the god's faith. There stands their part of the contract fulfilled, stone on stone, port and pinnacle all faithfully finished from Wotan's design by their mighty labor. They have come undoubtingly for their agreed wage. Then there happens what is to them an incredible, inconceivable thing. The god begins to shuffle. There are no moments in life more tragic than those in which the humble common man, the <b>manual</b> <b>worker,</b> leaving with implicit trust all high affairs to his betters, and reverencing them wholly as worthy of that trust, even to the extent of accepting as his rightful function the saving of them from all roughening and coarsening drudgeries, first discovers that they are corrupt, greedy, unjust and treacherous. The shock drives a ray of prophetic light into one giant's mind, and gives him a momentary eloquence. In that moment he rises above his stupid gianthood, and earnestly warns the Son of Light that all his power and eminence of priesthood, godhood, and kingship must stand or fall with the unbearable cold greatness of the incorruptible law-giver. But Wotan, whose assumed character of law-giver is altogether false to his real passionate nature, despises the rebuke; and the giant's ray of insight is lost in the murk of his virtuous indignation.|$|E
