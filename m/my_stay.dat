500|$|In the {{creation}} of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during <b>my</b> <b>stay</b> at One Life. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and fought passionately for {{his position on the}} show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from [...] "first frat boy" [...] to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) {{and at the same time}} slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal because they make women feel both the thrill of the [...] "bad" [...] and the lure of the hidden [...] "good": they can lead the man to change through love. [...] "I'll save him!" [...] Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always had that appeal.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, MacKay {{was accused}} of inappropriately using public funds when he {{combined}} {{the use of a}} Canadian Cormorant military helicopter for both a search and rescue demonstration, and to transport the minister from a private fishing camp in Newfoundland to Gander Airport. The cost of this to taxpayers was approximately $16,000. MacKay, then the Minister of National Defence, defended his use of the military helicopter stating, [...] "Three days into the visit I participated in a search and rescue demonstration with 103 squadron 9 Wing Gander. I shortened <b>my</b> <b>stay</b> by a day to take part in that demonstration".|$|E
2500|$|In 1501, Babur laid siege to Samarkand once more, but {{was soon}} {{defeated}} by his most formidable rival, Muhammad Shaybani, Khan of the Uzbeks. Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. He tried to reclaim Fergana but lost it too and escaping {{with a small}} band of followers, he wandered to the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants. He finally stayed in Tashkent, which was ruled by his maternal uncle. Babur wrote, [...] "During <b>my</b> <b>stay</b> in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!" [...] For three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of Badakhshan in particular. By 1502, he had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana; he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck someplace else.|$|E

2500|$|On July 27, 2010 it was {{announced}} by Hamilton during {{an interview that he}} had checked himself into a Psychiatric hospital stating: [...] "My stay here is like identical to <b>my</b> <b>stay</b> in the industry. As far as being the new guy in here having to deal with politics and people trying to control you. The critics would have to be the doctors and the rounds. So you can say this is like an experiment to see if the industry is really like an asylum or if I was the one bugging. Some say the industry is like high school but its just like a [...] All I wanted to do and still want to do is make music, he explained. It {{got to the point where}} I started talking in rhymes all the time, even in just regular conversations. And music just became me, so I thought it be a good idea if I checked into the hospital just to get my mind right." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately wanted to ask Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that <b>my</b> <b>stay</b> here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E

5000|$|April 10. â€” When I {{think of}} what I {{suffered}} with <b>my</b> <b>stays,</b> it seems very strange that they don't hurt me now. My waist is only 18 inches, and feels more comfortable than when I was squeezed in {{only a couple of}} inches. In fact, I think I enjoy the feeling of tightness. I know when I take off <b>my</b> <b>stays</b> to wash, I don't feel comfortable till I get them on again. And then I do guess my figure is sweet. Why, half the girls I know look like old dowdies. I guess my aunt was right, though I did think she was too horrid cruel.|$|R
5000|$|I {{found that}} this {{enforced}} wearing of the corsets at this period of the girl's growth begets an unwholesome appetite for tightlacing. Before leaving I found myself as anxious as the others to have <b>my</b> <b>stays</b> drawn in.|$|R
