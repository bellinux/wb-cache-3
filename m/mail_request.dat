Additionally, responses to open-ended questions regarding perceived effective interpersonal communication between clinical instructors and athletic training students were investigated. The researcher developed the Clinical Instructor Communication Survey (CI-CS) through a search of interpersonal communication and allied health education literature. The instrument included five subscales: Social Experience, Social Confirmation, Social Composure, Articulation, and Wit. The Clinical Instructor Communication Survey (CI-CS) was mailed to 35 CAAHEP-accredited undergraduate athletic training education programs in which the clinical instructors responded to an electronic <b>mail</b> <b>request</b> to participate.

40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of context on choice is an important goal, one which must result in communications giving greater weight to the framework to be created than to putting forward specific advantages. In this research, we study {{the influence}} of the price scale proposed to obtain a donation by a <b>mail</b> <b>request</b> on the donor's behavior. Factors which influence the behavior at the individual level, as past behavior, are controlled within an experimental frame and several price scales are tested. The results show that, at the agregate level, the price scale has only a small impact on the mailing efficiency. But, with a model explaining the donation distribution, we demonstrate first {{the influence of}} the ‘appeals scale ’ on donor behavior. Second, we show the need for controlling underlying heterogeneity as past behavior has a far more important role than the scale modification...|$|E

40|$|Charity {{organizations}} {{often use}} <b>mailed</b> <b>requests</b> to solicit donations from the public. This {{is not an}} efficient way to raise large amounts of money. The challenge addressed in this study was to use social psychology's knowledge of helping processes to make <b>mailed</b> <b>requests</b> more effective. Two constructs were identified as possibly useful: empathy and perceived effectiveness of helping. These were manipulated in a field experiment in a 2 times 2 × 2 factorial design (two levels of empathy, two of need extent, and two of need persistence—the last two factors operationalized perceived effectiveness). Letters soliciting donations to a well-known charity were mailed to a random sample of 2648 people in Perth, Western Australia. Manipulations of the three variables were embedded in the letters. The two effectiveness manipulations produced significant main effects, whereas the empathy manipulation was ineffective. We argue that social psychology's knowledge of helping processes is too confined to narrow, theoretical, laboratory-based phenomena to be directly and immediately applicable to the practices of charities...|$|R

40|$|Non-response bias {{is rarely}} {{explored}} in business research utilising annual reports. Such studies may reach incorrect conclusions in instances {{where there are}} systematic differences between companies who respond {{and those who do}} not. A global study into airline accounting practices by Tan, Tower, Hancock and Taplin (2002) enabled examination of this important research issue because a database provided an independent source of annual reports. The results indicate minimal response bias in a sample of annual reports obtained from a <b>mail</b> <b>request.</b> Publically listed airline companies that did not respond to a request for their annual report tended to use accounting methods that are considered least favourable by the industry. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised and the assumption that non-respondents' accounting policy choices are aligned with those of respondents should be tested. Increased availability of annual reports on the internet also raises questions of possible database bias...|$|E
40|$|Calculation of {{gravitational}} radiation during binary inspiral leading to possible {{formation of a}} Thorne-Zytkow (TZ) object (a neutron star inside a supergiant core) is performed. The calculations were done for polytropic density distributions with different indeces n, {{as well as for}} realistic models of supergiants. A maximum frequency of the emitted gravitational waves during this process was found to range from a few to 300 initial keplerian orbital frequensies, that is from 10 ^- 5 to ∼ 0. 1 Hz, depending on the model. A dimensionless strain metric amplitude can reach h∼ 10 ^- 23. 5 for a source lying 10 kpc away from the Sun. We conclude that TZ objects forming at a rate of 1 per 500 yrs in the Galaxy could be potential astrophysical targets for space laser intereferometers. Analysis {{of gravitational}} waveforms emitted during TZ-object formation could bring a unique information about stellar structure.

40|$|The {{physics of}} the {{fractional}} quantum Hall effect is the physics of interacting electrons confined to a macroscopically degenerate Landau level. In this Chapter we discuss {{the theory of the}} quantum Hall effect in systems where the electrons have degrees of freedom in addition to the two-dimensional orbital degree of freedom. We will be primarily interested in the situation where a finite number of states, most-commonly two, are available for each orbital state within a degenerate Landau level and will refer to these systems as multi-component systems. Physical realizations of the additional degree of freedom include the electron spin, the valley index in multi-valley semiconductors, and the layer index in multiple-quantum-well systems. The consideration of multi-component systems expands the taxonomy of incompressible states and fractionally charged excitations, and for example, leads to the appearance of fractions with even denominators. More interestingly, it also leads us to new physics, including novel spontaneously broken symmetries and in some cases, finite temperature phase transitions. We present an introduction to this rich subject.

40|$|The {{concept of}} port {{operations}} and environmental impact was formally {{based on the}} impact the environment {{will have on the}} ports, but due to envirormiental awareness the reverse is the case. Port operators now conduct environmental study before constructing a port or extending an existing one. There are environmental laws made either by local communities, national governments or intemational conventions {{for the protection of the}} environment especially pollution from ships at the sea. Port authorities are compelled to comply with the laws and they also formulate environmental policies, environmental management systems, environmental auditing monitoring. These systems are reviewed regularly in order to stand the test of time. The main objective with this study has been to discover how ports are sensitive to the environmental issues stated above. The survey has been carried out mainly as a quantitative study. A <b>mail</b> <b>request</b> for information on environmental issues was sent out to four ports and based on those answers additional interviews were carried out. IV The major finding firom the survey was that the ports in general are well prepared for the task ahead of them on envirormiental issues.
