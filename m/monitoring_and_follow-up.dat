50|$|Organizations {{working to}} help trafficked {{children}} continued to lament South Africa’s shortage of social workers, a situation resulting in inadequate case <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>follow-up,</b> and failure {{in some cases}} to accompany children to court. The government actively encouraged victims’ assistance in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers; South Africa’s witness protection program safeguarded at least ten Thai trafficking victims during the year to enable their involvement. The government provided these witnesses shelter and modest food stipends. Despite this positive development, the government continued to arrest and, at times, prosecute suspected trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} their being trafficked, as noted in the aforementioned case of the 27 Chinese women. In addition, extensive delays in scheduling court appearances have resulted in some alleged victims choosing not to testify during the trial of their traffickers. However, the new Sexual Offenses Act states that sex trafficking victims are not liable to stand trial for any criminal offense, including any migration-related offense, which was committed as a direct result of being trafficked. No similar provision exists for victims of labour trafficking. The lack of national coordination and procedures for victim protection continued to lead to deportation of most foreign victims before they were provided protective services or were able to give evidence in court. Immigration officials did not attempt to identify trafficking victims among the thousands of undocumented foreigners they detained—notably Zimbabweans and Mozambicans—before deporting them.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Especially for the {{prognosis}} of the patient {{it is important to}} <b>monitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>follow-up</b> the evolution of myocarditis with non-invasive yet fast and reproducible methods. To date only with endomyocardial biopsies can one reliably monitor the development of myocardial inflammation. The diagnosis of myocarditis is based on histological [1] and immunohistological [2] criteria defined by the presence of inflammatory cellular infiltration and myocardial necrosis. Due to the focal nature of the disease, the diagnostic techniques are hampered thus requiring multiple biopsies. Electrophysiological changes in the heart are known to be early markers for conduction disturbences in several heart diseases including myocarditis [3]. Magnetocardiography (MCG) shows promising results and could be used to identify early conduction disturbences in this patient group. 2 Materials and Methods Thirty five healthy volunteers and thirty five patients with suspected inflammatory heart disease wer...|$|R

30|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} efficient transport systems {{is the high}} level of interoperability of their various constituent elements. In the case of information systems, interoperability means their capacity to integrate with other systems belonging to transport companies that operate in the same transport network, and could even be based on technological products made by different manufacturers. In the case of the system presented here, the objective of interoperability is achieved by using ontology of entities based on a conceptual model of common data for the whole system. This data model is a European specification known as Transmodel [15], which establishes the different data entities to be used to develop information systems that intervene in different parts of public passenger transport activity, namely, service planning, resource availability, operations <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>follow-up,</b> passenger information, data gathering and management.

40|$|In recent years, the {{incidence}} of skin cancer caseshas risen, worldwide, mainly due to the prolonged exposure toharmful ultraviolet radiation.

Moreover, because there has been anincreased need to store medical data, for monitoring, comparativeand assisted-learning purposes, algorithms for data processingand storage have also become more efficient in handlingthe increase of data.

40|$|Ultrasound is the {{cornerstone}} for prostatic imaging and covers diagnostics, therapy <b>monitoring,</b> <b>and</b> <b>follow-up.</b> In the aspect of focal therapy, accurate prostate cancer localization is mandatory. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a promising imaging technique which has shown to greatly increase the chances to find prostate cancer in biopsies. At the moment, CEUS is only performed in expert centers because of difficult interpretation and steep learning curves. CEUS quantification techniques can make reliable and objective interpretation, with a high sensitivity, possible outside of expert centers. Focal therapy and active surveillance are increasingly used, but require to be supported by proper imaging techniques.

40|$|Objective. Justifiable {{concerns}} {{around the}} use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) amongst cancer patients are becoming increasingly prominent. The aim was to develop evidence-based guidelines to assist oncology health professionals (HP) to have respectful, balanced and useful discussions with patients about CAM. Methods. A systematic review was conducted, covering relevant literature from 1997 to 2007. The level of evidence was rated using a standardized rating system. The evidence was qualitatively synthesised into structured recommendations by a multidisciplinary team including a consumer. Results. The search identified 78 original papers; 36 directly related to discussing CAM. No randomized controlled trials specifically addressing the methods or benefits of discussing CAM were identified. Evidence based guidelines are presented as a sequence of recommended steps: (1) Elicit the person's understanding of their situation; (2) Respect cultural and linguistic diversity and different epistemological frameworks; (3) Ask questions about CAM use at critical points in the illness trajectory; (4) Explore details and actively listen; (5) Respond to the person's emotional state; (6) Discuss relevant concerns while respecting the person's beliefs; (7) Provide balanced, evidence-based advice; (8) Summarize discussions; (9) Document the discussion; (10) <b>Monitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>follow-up.</b> Conclusion.
