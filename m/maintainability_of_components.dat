40|$|Due to humanitarian, {{legal and}} {{economic}} grounds, safety {{is one of}} the most crucial goals to achieve through the development process of an elevator system. Safety standards are one of the main sources providing design and examination requirements to ensure safe operation of elevators. However, only fulfilling the technical requirements provided by safety standards do not guarantee a safe performance of elevator and additional engineering practices need to be applied throughout elevator’s lifecycle to ensure its safe performance. This study was undertaken to investigate such Good Engineering Practices (GEP) that enhance a proper application of safety standards and consequently elevator system’s safety. Qualitative research methods and more specifically Expert Interview along with Literature Research are the main approach for acquiring valuable information in this study. Primary research phase clarified that GEPs should be applied in almost every phase of an elevator’s lifecycle: Design, Manufacturing, Material Handling, Installation and Maintenance. Loading conditions that an elevator is subjected to during its lifetime, have a great impact on sound performance of the system; therefore, the influence should be taken into account for component and system design. In addition, it was found out that Reliability has a strong relation with Safety since failure of critical components in an elevator system can cause safety issues. Therefore applying design for reliability practices to predict potential failure modes, and take actions already in design process to eliminate them is vital for a proper application of safety standards. From production viewpoint, designers have to possess adequate knowledge on manufacturing capabilities and fabrication processes’ characteristics in order to achieve an efficient design. Furthermore, in order to ensure safety of maintenance and installation technicians, on one hand the factors attributed to installation and <b>maintainability</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> should be considered during the design process; on the other hand, precise maintenance/installation instructions should be developed based on component’s design. Lastly, applying even the highest safety margins during the design cannot guarantee safe performance of equipment if necessary evaluation checkpoints are not been placed in necessary milestones to check quality of work or manufactured parts. This issue provokes the need for Quality Control and having Quality Assurance system in the organization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Maintaining the {{availability}} of a system {{is one of the most}} critical and challenging tasks for industries during production. For maintaining {{the availability}} of the system, it is essential to maintain the reliability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>of</b> its subsystems. <b>Components</b> or subsystems in the system fail due to variety <b>of</b> reasons. Certain <b>components</b> in the system fail only due to severe vibration occurring in it. The acceptable limit of vibration velocity corresponds to the design value beyond that the component will fail. However, under normal operating conditions, most <b>of</b> the <b>components</b> will not fail just beyond the acceptable limit of vibration velocity. But if the velocity of vibration increases, beyond the acceptable limit, the failure rate also increases. The objective of this paper is to relate {{the availability of}} the system with mechanical vibration which causes the failure of certain subsystems. The developed equations are used to study the effect of mechanical vibration occurring in certain machines on plant availability, before and after the modification, in a typical industrial plant.

40|$|Instructional {{designers}} are under increasing pressure {{to enhance the}} pedagogical quality and technical richness of their learning content offerings, while the task of authoring for such complex educational frameworks is expensive and time consuming. Personalisation and reusability of learning contents are two main factors {{which can be used}} to enhance the pedagogical impact of e-learning experiences while also optimising resources, such as the overall cost and time of designing materials for different e-learning systems. However, personalisation services require continuous fine tuning for the different features that should be used, and e-learning systems need sufficient flexibility to offer these continuously required changes. The semantic modelling <b>of</b> adaptable learning <b>components</b> can highly influence the personalisation of the learning experience and enables the reusability, adaptability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>components.</b> Through the discrete modelling <b>of</b> these <b>components,</b> the flexibility and extensibility of e-learning systems will be improved as learning contents can be separated from the adaptation logic which results in the learning content being no longer specific to any given adaptation rule, or instructional plan. This thesis proposes an innovative semantic rule-based approach to dynamically generate personalised learning content utilising reusable pieces of learning content. It describes an ontology-based engine that composes, at runtime, adapted learning experiences according to learner’s interaction with the system and learner’s characteristics. Additionally, enriching ontologies with semantic rules increases the reasoning power and helps to represent adaptation decisions. This novel approach aims to improve flexibility, extensibility and reusability of systems, while offering a pedagogically effective and satisfactory learning experience for learners.

In this thesis, we propose a compliance requirement analysis method for early stages of software development based on a semantically-rich model, where a mapping can be established from legal and regulatory requirements relevant to system context to software system goals and contexts. This research {{is an attempt to}} address the requirement of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Article 25) (European Commission) for implementation of a "privacy by design” approach as part of organizational IT-systems and processes. It requires design of data protection requirements in the development of business processes for products and services. The proposed semantic model consists of a number of ontologies each corresponding to a knowledge component within the developed framework of our approach. Each ontology is a thesaurus of concepts in the compliance and risk assessment domain related to system development along with relationships and rules between concepts that compromise the domain knowledge. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is a novel ontology-based framework that demonstrates how description-logic reasoning techniques can be used to simulate legal reasoning requirements employed by legal professions against the description of each ontology. The semantic modelling <b>of</b> each <b>component</b> <b>of</b> framework can highly inﬂuence the compliance of developing software system and enables the reusability, adaptability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>of</b> these <b>components.</b> Through the discrete modelling <b>of</b> these <b>components,</b> the ﬂexibility and extensibility of compliance systems will be improved.

Using model-to-model transformations to {{generate}} analysis models or code from architecture models is sought to promote compliance and reuse <b>of</b> <b>components.</b> The <b>maintainability</b> <b>of</b> transformations {{is influenced by}} various characteristics- as with every programming language artifact. Code metrics are often used to estimate code <b>maintainability.</b> However, most <b>of</b> the established metrics {{do not apply to}} declarative transformation languages (such as QVT Re-lations) since they focus on imperative (e. g. object-oriented) coding styles. One way to characterize the <b>maintainability</b> <b>of</b> programs are code metrics. However, the vast majority of these metrics focus on imperative (e. g., object-oriented) cod-ing styles and thus cannot be reused as-is for transformations written in declara-tive languages.

We apply the presented set of metrics to several reference transformations to demonstrate how to judge transformation maintainability based on our metrics. ...|$|R
