It was found that a distinct enhancement {{in the amount of}} wave activity oc-curred at each of the three stations simultaneously while a tropospheric jet stream crossed the Arctic during mid-November of 1996. An interpretation is proposed in which the enhanced wave activity occurs as the tropospheric jet provides conditions that are favourable for the upward propa-gation of mountain waves.

40|$|A low cost, {{disposable}} {{instrument for}} measuring solar radiation during <b>meteorological</b> <b>balloon</b> flights through cloud layers is described. Using a photodiode detector and low thermal drift signal conditioning circuitry, the device showed less than 1 % drift for temperatures varied from + 20 °C to − 35 °C. The angular response to radiation, which declined less rapidly than the cosine of the angle between the incident radiation and normal incidence, {{is used for}} cloud detection exploiting {{the motion of the}} platform. Oriented upwards, the natural motion imposed by the balloon allows cloud and clear air to be distinguished by the absence of radiation variability within cloud, where the diffuse radiation present is isotropic. The optical method employed by the solar radiation instrument has also been demonstrated to provide higher resolution measurements of cloud boundaries than relative humidity measurements alone...|$|E
40|$|An {{instrument}} is described which carries three orthogonal geomagnetic field sensors {{on a standard}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>balloon</b> package, to sense rapid motion and position changes during ascent through the atmosphere. Because of the finite data bandwidth available over the UHF radio link, a burst sampling strategy is adopted. Bursts of 9 s of measurements at 3. 6 Hz are interleaved with periods of slow data telemetry lasting 25 s. Calculation of the variability in each channel is used to determine position changes, a method robust to periods of poor radio signals. During three balloon ascents, variability was found repeatedly at similar altitudes, simultaneously in each of three orthogonal sensors carried. This variability is attributed to atmospheric motions. It is found that the vertical sensor is least prone to stray motions, and {{that the use of}} two horizontal sensors provides no additional information over a single horizontal senso...|$|E

The reduction in gravity wave activity after the vortex breakdown is attributed pri-marily to increased critical level filtering of orographic waves and lowered stratospheric wind speeds...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{results of}} {{measurements}} of water-vapor vertical profiles in the upper troposphere and stratosphere on board a <b>meteorological</b> <b>balloon</b> with a FLASH-B optical fluorescent hygrometer (Russia) are presented. These data were obtained during two international field campaigns in West Africa (August 2006) and Central America (August 2007). Eleven high-resolution water-vapor vertical profiles measured {{in the course of}} these works make it possible to characterize the processes controlling humidity in the tropical tropopause region. Layers with increased humidity are detected in the lower stratosphere over West Africa {{to the level of the}} potential temperature 450 K. An analysis of satellite maps of the brightness temperature, balloon ozone measurements, and aerosol scattering, as well as trajectory modeling, display the relation between the observed layers with increased humidity and the phenomena of convective overshooting of the tropopause, as a result of which cold and ozone-depleted air penetrates into the lower stratosphere together with ice particles, which, rapidly sublimating, locally increase the water-vapor concentration. A comparison of the humidity data obtained in West Africa in 2006 and in Central America in 2007 reveals substantial distinctions in values and vertical structures of water vapor, both in the tropopause region and in the middle stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing number}} of space-borne {{instruments}} measures nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations in the troposphere, but validation of these instruments is hampered {{by the lack of}} ground-based and in situ profile measurements. The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) has developed a working NO 2 sonde. The sonde is attached to a small <b>meteorological</b> <b>balloon</b> and measures a tropospheric NO 2 profile. The NO 2 sonde has a vertical resolution of 5 m and a measurement range between 1 and 100 ppbv. The instrument is light in weight (0. 7 kg), cheap (disposable), energy efficient and not harmful to the environment or the person who finds the package after use. The sonde uses the chemiluminescent reaction of NO 2 in an aqueous luminol solution. The NO 2 -luminol reaction produces faint blue/purple light (at about 425 nm), which is detected by an array of silicon photodiodes. The luminol solution is optimised to be specific to NO 2. An on-ground comparison with measurements from a Photolytic Analyser of The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) shows that both instruments measure similar NO 2 variations in ambient air. During the Cabauw Intercomparison campaign of Nitrogen Dioxide measuring instruments (CINDI) in June/July 2009, six vertical profiles of NO 2 from the ground to a 5 km altitude were measured, which clearly show that the largest amount of NO 2 is measured in the boundary layer.

40|$|A {{total of}} 27 Ss from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, ages 19 - 34 yrs, volunteered to {{participate}} in the validation study of the Q-Plex I Cardiopulmonary Exercise System developed by the Quinton Instrument Company. Each S performed a constant speed, grade incremented treadmill test to volitional exhaustion. Simultaneous measurements of expired air ware performed with the Q-Plex and a <b>meteorological</b> <b>balloon</b> gas collection system to determine the validity of the Q-lex. Respiratory and metabolic assessments were made during at least 3 different levels of exercise; low steady state, medium steady state, and at maximal exertion. A total of 93 gas samples were collected and analyzed by the 2 methods. The means for FeO 2 and FeCO 2 were significantly (p 0. 85) different. However, the absolute mean differences were only 0. 5 % for FeO 2 and 0. 3 % for FeCO 2 which are within the accuracy of the reported error for the analyzers. These results indicated that the Q-Plex gas analyzers are as accurate as the micro-Scholander technique. Correlation coefficients between the 2 systems were. 9735 for FeO 2 and. 9729 for FeCO 2. After all the validation data were collected a final comparison was mule between a series of volumes obtained with the Parkinson-Cowan meter and the Tissot spirometer. These results indicated there was a much larger discrepancy in volumes obtained between these methods than those initially reported. These differences were of sufficient manitude to question the accuracy of using this meter to validate the volumes obtained with the Q-Plex. Since it was impossible to determine the cause of this error, or at what point in the study it occurred, the VE volumes of the Q-Plex could not be legitimately validated using the Parkinson-Cowan meter. Unfortunately, since the accuracy of measuring VO 2 and VCO 2 is dependent upon VE volumes, neither of these volumes could be compared. Within the limitations of the present study, it was concluded that the gas analyzers in the Q-Plex demonstrate accuracy comparable to that of the micro-Scholander technique...|$|E
40|$|We {{present in}} situ balloon-borne {{measurements}} of aerosols in a volcanic plume {{made during the}} Holuhraun eruption (Iceland) in January 2015. The balloon flight intercepted a young plume at 8 km distance downwind from the crater, where the plume is ~ 15 minutes of age. The balloon carried a novel miniature optical particle counter LOAC (Light Optical Aerosol Counter) which measures particle number concentration and size distribution in the plume, alongside a meteorological payload. We discuss the possibility of calculating particle flux by combining LOAC data with measurements of sulfur dioxide flux by ground-based UV spectrometer (DOAS). The balloon passed through the plume at altitude range of 2. 0 - 3. 1 km above sea level (a. s. l.). The plume top height was determined as 2. 7 - 3. 1 km a. s. l., which is in good agreement with data from Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite. Two distinct plume layers were detected, a non-condensed lower layer (300 m thickness) and a condensed upper layer (800 m thickness). The lower layer was characterized by a lognormal size distribution of fine particles (0. 2 μm diameter) and a secondary, coarser mode (2. 3 μm diameter), with a total particle number concentration of around 100 cm- 3 in the 0. 2 - 100 μm detection range. The upper layer was dominated by particle centered on 20 μm in diameter as well as containing a finer mode (2 μm diameter). The total particle number concentration in the upper plume layer was {{an order of magnitude}} higher than in the lower layer. We demonstrate that intercepting a volcanic plume with a <b>meteorological</b> <b>balloon</b> carrying LOAC is an efficient method to characterize volcanic aerosol properties. During future volcanic eruptions, balloon-borne measurements could be carried out easily and rapidly over a large spatial area in order to better characterize the evolution of the particle size distribution and particle number concentrations in a volcanic plume...|$|E
