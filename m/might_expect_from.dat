25|$|Malkin {{was born}} on 31 July 1986 in Magnitogorsk, a city in the Soviet Union to Vladimir and Natalia Malkin. Vladimir worked for Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the largest {{iron and steel works}} in Russia and the city's {{dominant}} industry, and played in the Metallurg Magnitogorsk youth and club hockey system. Malkin has one brother, Denis, who is older by one year. Malkin began skating at age 3. He joined his first organized hockey league two years later. He showed an aptitude for the sport at an early age, as one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the son of a pro. However, because both of his parents were short, no one suspected that Malkin would be a world-class athlete.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} {{the scene in}} which Tintin was imprisoned in the Marlinspike crypt, observing that it had parallels with Tintin's exploration of tombs and other secret chambers throughout the series. He identified the mystery left in Francis Haddock's parchments to be another appearance of Tintin's adventures being [...] "framed by enigmas". To this he adds that in solving the enigma, Tintin shows that he is [...] "the best reader" [...] in the series, {{and it is this}} which establishes him as [...] "the oeuvre's hero". McCarthy praised Hergé's Silk as one of the pivotal characters in the series who can [...] "exude a presence far beyond that which we <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a novelist, let alone a cartoonist".|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{praised the}} {{character}} of Tarragon, stating that he exudes a presence [...] "far beyond what we <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a novelist, let alone a cartoonist". He then compared the scenario in which Tarragon was trapped within his home to that in The Calculus Affair in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house. He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He argued that {{the way in which}} Alcazar was presented as Tintin's friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Hergé's use of jewels as a theme throughout the series, while the mummy's removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the New Statesman, George Eaton {{stated that}} he was {{surprised}} by the moderate stance that Chomsky took in Occupy, remarking that the [...] "self-described anarchist sounds very much like a social democrat", offering the [...] "cautious, provisional response one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a Labour shadow cabinet minister" [...] rather than the words of a radical revolutionary. Arguing that he was exhibiting [...] "passionate sanity" [...] at a time when much of the Left was gripped by conspiracy theories, he also criticized Chomsky for being [...] "maddeningly banal" [...] at points during the book, but ultimately thought that there was [...] "much to commend Chomsky's radical pessimism." [...] In a brief review in The Independent, Arifa Akbar highlighted that although Chomsky's claims regarding class war carried with them [...] "the ring of an old Marxist manifesto", the notion that we ourselves need to change in order to allow the state to change was [...] "very contemporary".|$|E

500|$|Rob Leane, for Den of Geek, {{stated that}} [...] "this week we {{continue}} to see the fallout of ’s revelations playing out in gleefully entertaining fashion ... we were treated to a twisty espionage-heavy thriller of an episode". Leane added that [...] "by pitting May against her other self in a well-shot, thumpingly-scored fight sequence, new-to-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Kevin Tancharoen used his experience from Mortal Kombat: Legacy to highlight how far the action elements of the show have come since the early days." [...] and also noted the development of multiple characters as positive. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said [...] "I had my trepidations about [...] "Face My Enemy"'s cutesy-looking callbacks to more camp episodes and spy tropes, the kind you <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> Chuck, back in the day. The hour certainly danced over that line here and there, what with May and Coulson’s only means to recover an important artifact lying in a lavish party, the stock laser grid security alarm, May's mirror image fight, and other such throwback fare, but I’d say [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] ended up more of a celebratory self-aware subversion, rather than {{a sign of the}} season running out on empty just yet." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the review}} {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup, issue #0 received an average score of 7.3/10 based on 23 reviews from critics. Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But {{the good news is that}} this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

Shakespeare's poetic line is based less upon rigid syllable counts than on a careful arrangement of stresses within an understood metrical norm, as one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a poet who had written both for the theater and for the page.

2500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, was {{favourable}} of 'Gotta Be You', {{referring to}} Austin as [...] " [...] clearly knows where Sugababes' strengths lie", further stating [...] " [...] adds a light, but nonetheless thrilling dusting of monotonal crunk-influenced synthesised honking to 'Gotta Be You'." [...] He was less favourable about their cover of 'Obsession', stating, [...] "sadly, Sugababes' version sands off the edges rather than amps up the lunacy: what's left is like 1980s night at karaoke". He also remarks that [...] "you {{get the impression}} that they would be happier making R". In conclusion, however, he states that [...] "the album's strike rate is far higher than you <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a manufactured pop act's fourth album; it avoids the obvious pitfalls and its highpoints are genuinely high", giving the album 3 out of 5 stars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{blast wind}} {{at sea level}} may exceed one {{thousand}} km/h, or ~300m/s, approaching {{the speed of sound}} in air. The range for blast effects increases with the explosive yield of the weapon and also depends on the burst altitude. Contrary to what one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> geometry, the blast range is not maximal for surface or low altitude blasts but increases with altitude up to an [...] "optimum burst altitude" [...] and then decreases rapidly for higher altitudes. This is due to the nonlinear behaviour of shock waves. When the blast wave from an air burst reaches the ground it is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the direct wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference.|$|E
2500|$|Senior {{figures in}} the trade union {{movement}} have accused the publication of having a classist anti-union bias, with Unite chief of staff Andrew Murray describing Private Eye as [...] "a publication of assiduous public school boys" [...] and adding that it has allegedly [...] "never once written anything about trade unions that isn't informed by cynicism and hostility". The Socialist Worker also wrote that [...] "For the past 50 years, the satirical magazine Private Eye has upset and enraged the powerful. Its mix of humour and investigation has tirelessly challenged the hypocrisy of the elite. ... But it also has serious weaknesses. Among the witty — if sometimes tired — spoof articles and cartoons, there is a nasty streak of snobbery and prejudice. Its jokes about the poor, women and young people rely on lazy stereotypes you <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the columns of the Daily Mail. It is the anti-establishment journal of the establishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the huge}} expense and time {{invested}} in Dunorlan, Henry Reed moved to Harrogate in 1870 and Dunorlan {{was put up}} for sale, with an original sales brochure remaining in the Tunbridge Wells museum today. The cause of this move is attributed by his widow (Mrs Margaret S.E Reed) to the fault some Christian people in England found with him because of the house. However, it proved {{difficult to find a}} buyer with two auctions being aborted in 1871 and 1872. Despite the favorable depictions of the property in the sales brochure (as quoted above), others viewed the mansion far less favourably, with a servant of the house describing it as [...] "an architectural monstrosity (which) represented everything one <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a man with too much money and too little taste". Eventually it was sold to Brenton Halliburton Collins, a banker from Halifax, Nova Scotia and on his death, it was inherited by his son, Carteret Fitzgeral Collins who subsequently died in 1941. At this point the house fell vacant before being requisitioned for the war effort on 15 May 1941.|$|E
