5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly</b> in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about Î»/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>assembly</b> of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a new, visualized approach for {{including all the}} geometric feature variations in the tolerance analysis of <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies.</b> It focuses on how to characterize geometric feature variations in vector-loop-based assembly tolerance models. The characterization {{will be used to}} help combine the effects of all variations within an assembly in order to perform tolerance analysis of <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies</b> by employing commercial 3 D kinematic software (e. g. ADAMS). Equivalent variational modeling, based on TAKS method, has been developed for modeling variations in 3 D <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Create a library of Equivalent Variational Joints (EVJs) to allow inclusion all kinds of variations in analysis, and allow the kinematic model to include both geometric and dimensional variation in a velocity analysis. EVJ, for use in tolerance analysis, was developed for commonly used 3 D kinematic joint types, and was implemented with examples to explain their use to form Equivalent Variational Mechanisms (EVMs) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper applies network {{connectivity}} analysis to <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Assemblies have extensive intentional structure while simultaneously displaying {{some of the}} properties of previously analyzed networks. Fundamental principles impose restrictions {{on the structure of}} assemblies, as do some practical principles. Fundamental restrictions stem from the desire to avoid over-constraining the assembly. Practical restrictions stem from the desire to limit the complexity of the assembly or any significant subassembly. These restrictions play a role analogous to the cost of connection. For these reasons, <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies</b> are unlikely to exhibit scale-free properties common in many natural systems and some man-made ones...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{numerous}} approaches to automatic reasoning about <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies</b> have been published. CAD techniques, graph-based approaches and semantic methods to model assembled objects were proposed. However, all these methods {{are difficult to}} employ for visually supervising assembly processes since they lack the flexibility, generality or ease required in practice. This paper presents {{the idea of using}} syntactic methods known from discourse theory in order to model classes of <b>mechanical</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Moreover, a criterion to derive recursive grammatical production rules is introduced so that the representation of a class of assemblies becomes especially compact. This general representation scheme allows to automatically derive hierarchical structural descriptions of individual assemblies by means of computer vision...|$|R
