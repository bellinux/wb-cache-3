50|$|The Japanese generals {{had made}} a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> their <b>assessment</b> of the tanks used against China, a country whose army had few tanks or antitank weapons. By 1937, Japan fielded 1,060 tanks in 8 regiments, but most were {{designed}} for and used in an infantry support role. However, tanks built for this role left the IJA without a tank capable of tank-vs-tank combat, a deficiency that was brought home hard at Khalkin-Gol, a terrible defeat inflicted by the Russians on the Mongolian border in 1939. This also proved fatal later when they faced Allied tanks during World War II, as {{the great majority of}} the Japanese models were too light, with not enough armament, and obsolete vehicles went on being mass-produced.|$|R
40|$|Predators use cues {{associated}} with their prey to assess prey quality and to avoid consuming poisonous prey. Considerable {{attention has been given}} to predators' use of aposematic cues to assess prey quality, but little is known about predators that eavesdrop on prey cues that are not intended for them. Here we investigate the prey-cue/prey-quality associations of a predator that eavesdrops on the sexual advertisement signals of its prey. Stability is expected in prey-cue/prey-quality associations when <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> prey <b>assessment</b> are lethal. Conversely, flexibility is possible when mistakes are less costly. Predators that must respond to temporal and spatial fluctuations in prey availability should be more flexible <b>in</b> their <b>assessment</b> of prey quality. Given these predictions, we examined flexibility in the ability of wild-caught bats to reverse prey-cue/prey-quality associations for a preferred prey and a poisonous one. We found that the predatory bat, Trachops cirrhosus, has a heretofore undescribed ability to reverse its evaluations of the cues that signal preferred prey...|$|R
40|$|Pelvic MR imaging allows {{to avoid}} {{most of the}} <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>assessment</b> of ovarian masses made using transvaginal {{ultrasonography}} or CT scan. However, even using pelvic MR imaging, there are some pathologies that may mimic primitive ovarian cancer including pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine myoma, digestive tumour or ovarian metastases. Preoperative diagnosis of these pathologies is crucial because the therapeutic strategy is completely different {{and the absence of}} a diagnosis may impact the prognosis. Thus, this lecture will present three clinical situations where the radiologist needs to accurately analyse MR images to not misdiagnose a wide variety of pelvic pathologies as ovarian cancer. Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with benign masses mimicking ovarian cancer. 2. To demonstrate benign and malignant diseases mimicking peritoneal carcinomatosis. 3. To learn about imaging strategies for avoiding these pitfalls. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Interviews were conducted with practitioners from a cross-section of agencies that worked with high-risk gang youth. The intent was to examine both the interpersonal and structural factors that either promoted or impeded the collaborative process. Of the factors contributing to successful collaboration, communication and cooperation were frequently cited as critical elements. Five interactional patterns were cited as contributing to negative collaboration, such as diffusion of responsibility, blaming other agencies for the failures of youth, withholding information between agencies, agencies "covering. up " <b>mistakes</b> made <b>in</b> <b>assessment</b> or treatment, and prematurely terminating collaborative arrangements. "Agency fear " was proposed as a primary construct responsible for collaborative behaviors that influence both the coordination of treatment programs and the clinical behaviors of practitioners.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Pulse Contour Methods (PCMs) provide {{stroke volume}} (SV) and cardiac output (CO) from the {{analysis}} of the arterial waveform. Artifacts affecting arterial wave morphology may reduce the reliability of PCMs in estimating such haemodynamic variables. The new operator who is facing a PCM for the first time should need a training period to gain ability in recognizing artifacts and avoiding <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> CO <b>assessment.</b> OBJECTIVES. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the potential bias rising when com- paring CO values obtained by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE-CO) and Most-Care (MC-CO) system recorded by trained (T) and not-trained operators (NT). METHODS. 23 consecutive patients (10 male, mean age 60 Â± 15) admitted to general ICU for heterogeneous pathologies were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: the presence of a radial artery catheter for invasive blood pressure monitoring, need for a transthoracic echocardi- ography evaluation, age [18 years old. Exclusion criteria were: cardiac arrhythmias, aortic valve pathologies, ascending aortic pathologies, pregnancy, arteriovenous fistulas, and significant artery obstruction. For each patient, during haemodynamic stability (i. e., mean arterial pressure changes 0...|$|R
50|$|Like the US Army (which {{utilized}} French and British {{tanks in}} World War I), the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) {{did not have}} tanks of its own in World War I, so it started out by purchasing foreign tanks for evaluation during World War I and right after the war ended. Like many other nations, the Japanese initially didn't embrace the tank, as it didn't have the cavalry tradition. Cavalry was used for reconnaissance in the mountainous countryside, and initially, as with most other armies, the first designs were constrained by the tank's infantry-support role. Building tanks of their own met several problems, as Japan's priority tended to be with naval procurements so production for tank steel was on a lower level. However, they finally began designing tanks by the mid-1920s. Inspired by European designs, the Japanese tank program designed and developed the tanks which facilitated their campaigns in China and the Soviet-Japanese border conflicts, prior to World War II. They introduced many innovations as they built their designs, including bell crank suspensions, were pioneers in amphibious tanks, {{and the use of}} diesel engines that were less likely to catch fire compared with gasoline tank engines that were being used at the time. The Japanese generals had made a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> their <b>assessment</b> of the tanks used against China, a country whose army had only three tank battalions, and few anti-tank weapons.|$|R
40|$|Rationality of {{decision}} maker is often reduced by heuristics and biases, {{and also by}} different types of external stimuli. In decision-making process individuals simplify phases of information selection and information processing by using heuristics, simple rules which are focused on one aspect of complex problem and ignore other aspects, {{and in that way}} 'speed up' decision-making process. This method of making decisions, although efficient in making simple decisions, can lead to <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> probability <b>assessment</b> and diminish rationality {{of decision}} maker. In that way it can influence drastically on transaction outcome for which decision is being made. The subject of this study is influence of representativeness heuristic on making financial decisions by individuals, and influence of consumption motives on stereotypical elements in information processing phase. Study was conducted by determining attitudes of respondents toward currencies, and then by conducting experiments with aim of analyzing method of making decisions on loan currency. Aim of study was determining whether and to what extent representativeness influence choice of currency in process of making loan decisions. Results of conducted behavioral experiments show that respondents, opposite to rational model, do not asses probability by processing available information and in accordance with their preferences, but by comparing decision objects with other objects which have same attributes, showing in that way moderate positive correlation between stereotypical attitudes and choice of loan currency. Experiments have shown that instrumental motive significantly influence representativeness heuristics, that is, individuals are prone to process information with diminished influence of stereotypical attitudes caused by external stimuli, in situations where there is no so called 'hedonistic decision-making'. Respondents have been making more efficient decisions if they had motive which does not lead to hedonistic consumption. Experiments did not show connections between consummatory motives and representativeness...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mistake</b> <b>in</b> {{performance}} {{is when we}} simply fail {{to do what we}} intend to do. According to Anscombe, in cases of error in action, the notion of <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> performance allows for the possibility of there being nothing wrong with the agentâs judgment(s), the mistake is solely to be found in his performance. One may choose to refuse this thought and argue that <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> performance presuppose some erroneous judgment, or, on the other hand, one can claim that <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> {{performance is}} a unique phenomenon. I support the latter strategy, which again opens up for two new options: given that there is some such phenomenon, are these cases to be regarded as actions, or not? I think that they are. How then shall cases of <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> performance be captured as actions? There are two strategies to choose between here, either to argue that they are actions on theory-independent grounds or to provide theory-dependent reasons for this claim. I consider both alternatives. I offer different reasons for why cases of <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> performance should be regarded as actions independent from any theory of action, and I discuss the latter option through Peabodyâs claim that Davidsonâs account cannot capture <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> performance as actions, while that of Jennifer Hornsby can. I support the former, but not the latter. It is my aim to show that Peabody has not successfully demonstrated that Hornsby can capture cases of <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> performance as actions. I conclude by arguing that Anscombeâs original account is best suited for that purpose...|$|R

5000|$|In {{traditional}} grammar, a solecism is {{a phrase}} that transgresses the rules of grammar. The word originally {{was used by the}} Greeks for what they perceived as grammatical <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> their language. Ancient Athenians considered the dialect of the inhabitants of their colony, Soli, in Cilicia, to be a corrupted form of their own pure Attic dialect, and labelled the errors in the form as [...] "solecisms" [...] (Greek: ÏÎ¿Î»Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î¿Î¯, soloikismoÃ­; sing.: ÏÎ¿Î»Î¿Î¹ÎºÎ¹ÏÎ¼ÏÏ, soloikismÃ³s). Therefore, when referring to similar grammatical <b>mistakes</b> heard <b>in</b> the speech of Athenians, they described them as [...] "solecisms" [...] and that term has been adopted as a label for grammatical <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> any language; in Greek there is often a distinction in the relevant terms <b>in</b> that a <b>mistake</b> <b>in</b> semantics (i.e., a use of words with other-than-appropriate meaning or a neologism constructed through application of generative rules by an outsider) is called a barbarism ( [...] barbarismos), whereas solecism refers to <b>mistakes</b> <b>in</b> syntax, in the construction of sentences.|$|R
