5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive effects can be {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and <b>micropsia</b> may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral <b>micropsia</b> {{is a rare}} form of <b>micropsia</b> {{that can}} arise in {{children}} with chronic migraines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> {{can result}} from the action of {{mescaline}} and other hallucinogenic drugs. Although drug-induced changes in perception usually subside as the chemical leaves the body, long-term cocaine use can result in the chronic residual effect of <b>micropsia.</b> <b>Micropsia</b> can be a symptom of Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, or HPPD, {{in which a person}} can experience hallucinogenic flashbacks long after ingesting a hallucinogen. A majority of these flashbacks are visual distortions which include <b>micropsia,</b> and 15-80% of hallucinogen users may experience these flashbacks. <b>Micropsia</b> can also be a rare side effect of zolpidem, a prescription medication used to temporarily treat insomnia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> is also {{commonly}} reported {{when the}} eyes are fixating at (convergence), or focussing at (accommodation), a distance closer {{than that of the}} object in accord with Emmert's law. Specific types of <b>micropsia</b> include hemimicropsia, a form of <b>micropsia</b> that is localized to one half of the visual field and can be caused by brain lesions in one of the cerebral hemispheres.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric {{patients}} may experience <b>micropsia</b> {{in an attempt}} to distance themselves from situations involving conflict. <b>Micropsia</b> may also be a symptom of psychological conditions in which patients visualize people as small objects as a way to control others in response to their insecurities and feelings of weakness. In some adults who experienced loneliness as children, <b>micropsia</b> may arise as a mirror of prior feelings of separation from people and objects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> is {{sometimes}} seen in individuals with brain infarctions. The damaged {{side of the}} brain conveys size information that contradicts the size information conveyed by {{the other side of}} the brain. This causes a contradiction to arise between the true perception of an object's size and the smaller perception of the object, and micropsic bias ultimately causes the individual to experience <b>micropsia.</b> Lesions affecting other parts of the extracerebral visual pathways can also cause <b>micropsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} neurological origin of <b>micropsia</b> {{is a result}} of temporal lobe seizures. These seizures affect the entire visual field of the patient. More rarely, <b>micropsia</b> can be part of purely visual seizures. This in turn only affects one half of the visual field and is accompanied by other cerebral visual disturbances. The most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as <b>micropsia</b> and macropsia is medial temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex. <b>Micropsia</b> often occurs as an aura signalling a seizure in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Most auras last for a very short period, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> {{can result}} from retinal edema causing a {{dislocation}} of the receptor cells. Photoreceptor misalignment seems to occur following the surgical re-attachment for macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. After surgery, patients may experience <b>micropsia</b> {{as a result of}} larger photoreceptor separation by edematous fluid.|$|E
25|$|Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, a {{neurological}} condition associated with both <b>micropsia</b> and macropsia, {{is named after}} Lewis Carroll's famous 19th century novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the story, the title character, Alice, experiences numerous situations {{similar to those of}} <b>micropsia</b> and macropsia. Speculation has arisen that Carroll may have written the story using his own direct experience with episodes of <b>micropsia</b> resulting from the numerous migraines he was known to suffer from. It has also been suggested that Carroll may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Episodes of <b>micropsia</b> or {{macropsia}} {{occur in}} 9% of adolescents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> {{can occur}} during the aura {{phase of a}} {{migraine}} attack, a phase that often precedes the onset of a headache and is commonly characterized by visual disturbances. <b>Micropsia,</b> along with hemianopsia, quadrantopsia, scotoma, phosphene, teicopsia, metamorphopsia, macropsia, teleopsia, diplopia, dischromatopsia, and hallucination disturbances, {{is a type of}} aura that occurs immediately before or during the onset of a migraine headache. The symptom usually occurs less than thirty minutes before the migraine headache begins and lasts for five to twenty minutes. Only 10-20% of children with migraine headaches experience auras. Visual auras such as <b>micropsia</b> are most common in children with migraines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> is a {{condition}} affecting human visual perception in which objects {{are perceived to be}} smaller than they actually are. <b>Micropsia</b> can be caused by optical factors (such as wearing glasses), by distortion of images in the eye (such as optically, via swelling of the cornea or from changes {{in the shape of the}} retina such as from retinal edema, macular degeneration, or central serous retinopathy), by changes in the brain (such as from traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, migraines, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs), and from psychological factors. Dissociative phenomena are linked with <b>micropsia,</b> which may be the result of brain-lateralization disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Psychogenic <b>micropsia</b> {{can present}} itself in {{individuals}} with certain psychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|Of all of {{the visual}} distortions, <b>micropsia</b> has the largest variety of causes.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} range of causes that lead to <b>micropsia,</b> {{diagnosis}} varies among cases. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may find lesions and hypodense areas in the temporal and occipital lobes. MRI and CT techniques are able to rule out lesions as the cause for <b>micropsia,</b> but are not sufficient to diagnose the most common causes.|$|E
25|$|Treatment varies for <b>micropsia</b> due to {{the large}} number of {{different}} causes for the condition.|$|E
25|$|Hemimicropsia {{is a type}} of {{cerebral}} <b>micropsia</b> {{that occurs}} within one half of the visual field.|$|E
25|$|Convergence-accommodative <b>micropsia</b> is a {{physiologic}} {{phenomenon in}} which an object appears smaller as it approaches the subject.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> causes {{affected}} {{individuals to}} perceive objects as being smaller or more distant {{than they actually}} are.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> {{seems to}} be {{slightly}} more common in boys than in girls among children who experience migraines.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of individuals with}} <b>micropsia</b> are aware that their perceptions do not mimic reality. Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from <b>micropsia</b> {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from <b>micropsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Retinal <b>micropsia</b> is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} the distance between retinal photoreceptors and is associated with decreased visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> is {{the most}} common visual distortion, or dysmetropsia. It is {{categorized}} as an illusion in the positive phenomena grouping of abnormal visual distortions.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{involving}} the occlusion of {{one eye and}} the use of a prism fitted over an eyeglass lens have both been shown to provide relief from <b>micropsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Related visual {{distortion}} conditions include macropsia, a {{less common}} condition with the reverse effect, and Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, {{a condition that}} has symptoms that can include both <b>micropsia</b> and macropsia.|$|E
25|$|Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR) {{which can}} produce <b>micropsia</b> {{predominantly}} affects persons {{between the ages}} of 20 and 50. Women appear to be affected more than men by a factor of almost 3 to 1.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 80% of {{temporal}} lobe seizures produce auras {{that may lead}} to <b>micropsia</b> or macropsia. They are a common feature of simple partial seizures and usually precede complex partial seizures {{of temporal}} lobe origin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> can {{be caused}} by {{swelling}} of the cornea due to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and can therefore present as an initial symptom of EBV mononucleosis, a disease caused by Epstein-Barr virus infection.|$|E
25|$|EEG testing can {{diagnose}} {{patients with}} medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Epileptiform abnormalities including spikes and sharp {{waves in the}} medial temporal lobe of the brain can diagnose this condition, which can in turn {{be the cause of}} an epileptic patient's <b>micropsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|CSCR is {{a disease}} in which a serous {{detachment}} of the neurosensory retina occurs over an area of leakage from the choriocapillaris through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The most common symptoms that result from the disease are a deterioration of visual acuity and <b>micropsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Amsler {{grid test}} {{can be used}} to {{diagnose}} macular degeneration. For this test, patients are asked to look at a grid, and distortions or blank spots in the patient's central field of vision can be detected. A positive diagnosis of macular degeneration may account for a patient's <b>micropsia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Macular {{degeneration}} typically produces <b>micropsia</b> due to {{the swelling}} or bulging of the macula, an oval-shaped yellow spot {{near the center of}} the retina in the human eye. The main factors leading to this disease are age, smoking, heredity, and obesity. Some studies show that consuming spinach or collard greens five times a week cuts the risk of macular degeneration by 43%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Micropsia</b> that is {{induced by}} macular {{degeneration}} {{can be treated}} in several ways. A study called AREDS (age-related eye disease study) determined that taking dietary supplements containing high-dose antioxidants and zinc produced significant benefits with regard to disease progression. This study was the first ever to prove that dietary supplements can alter the natural progression and complications of a disease state. Laser treatments also look promising but are still in clinical stages.|$|E
25|$|Distortions {{in visual}} {{perception}} during a temporal lobe seizure may include size distortion (<b>micropsia</b> or macropsia), distorted perception of movement (where moving objects {{may appear to}} be moving very slowly or to be perfectly still), a sense that surfaces such as ceilings and even entire horizons are moving farther away in a fashion similar to the dolly zoom effect, and other illusions. Even when consciousness is impaired, insight into the hallucination or illusion is typically preserved.|$|E
25|$|A {{controlled}} size comparison task can {{be employed}} to evaluate objectively whether a person is experiencing hemimicropsia. For each trial, a pair of horizontally aligned circles is presented on a computer screen, and the person being tested is asked to decide which circle is larger. After a set of trials, the overall pattern of responses should display a normal distance effect where the more similar the two circles, the higher the number of errors. This test is able to effectively diagnose <b>micropsia</b> and confirm which hemisphere is being distorted.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{is being done}} on macular degeneration which could help prevent cases of <b>micropsia.</b> A variety of drugs that block vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are being evaluated as a treatment option. These treatments {{for the first time}} have produced actual improvements in vision, rather than simply delaying or arresting the continued loss of vision characteristic of macular degeneration. A number of surgical treatments are also being investigated for macular degeneration lesions that may not qualify for laser treatment, including macular translocation to a healthier area of the eye, displacement of submacular blood using gas, and removing membranes by surgery.|$|E
