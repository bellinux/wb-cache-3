50|$|Restated, {{increases}} in {{central bank money}} <b>may</b> not <b>result</b> <b>in</b> commercial bank money because the money {{is not required to}} be lent out - it <b>may</b> instead <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a growth of unlent reserves (excess reserves).|$|R
50|$|Dihydroartemisinin {{has a low}} {{solubility}} in water of less than 0.1 g/L. Consequently, its use <b>may</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> side effects caused by minor, yet much more soluble, additives (excipients) such as Cremophor EL.|$|R
5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
5|$|In all {{tropical}} basins, {{except the}} Northern Indian Ocean, the extratropical transition of a tropical cyclone <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> reintensification into a warm seclusion. For example, Hurricane Maria of 2005 reintensified into a strong baroclinic system and achieved warm seclusion status at maturity (or lowest pressure).|$|E
5|$|Inflammation {{resulting}} from infection may impair {{the function of}} any of the cranial nerves. Inflammation of the facial nerve (VII) <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> Bell's palsy.|$|E
50|$|Flooding between March and <b>May</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> Baton Rouge {{reaching}} its second highest recorded crest at 45.18 ft on April 29. The Bonnet Carre Spillway was opened {{for the second}} time for 57 days.|$|R
25|$|Laker {{retired in}} 1959. The publication, in 1960, of his ghost-written autobiography, {{containing}} severe {{criticism of his}} Surrey and England captain Peter <b>May,</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> his losing honorary memberships of MCC and Surrey. These were both eventually restored.|$|R
50|$|Odontoid {{hypoplasia}} <b>may</b> occur <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> cervical instability.|$|R
5|$|Mercury and cadmium are toxic and {{may cause}} {{environmental}} damage if they enter rivers or rain water. This <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> contaminated crops {{as well as}} the bioaccumulation of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and cadmium poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) {{taken with}} {{amphetamine}} <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a hypertensive crisis if taken {{within two weeks}} after last use of an MAOI type drug.|$|E
5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the iliac and femoral veins. The leg is usually painful, tinged blue in color, and swollen, which <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> venous gangrene.|$|E
50|$|LPR <b>may</b> also <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{sinusitis}} {{and difficulty}} breathing.|$|R
50|$|A {{guilty plea}} <b>may</b> also <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a lower fine.|$|R
50|$|Retinoblastoma <b>may</b> also <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{abnormal}} light reflection {{from the}} eye.|$|R
5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, {{although there is}} the possibility that a self-inflicted injury <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} {{droplets}} {{can be highly}} electrically charged, and so they offer the potential for lightning. Venus' small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation. This radiation <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges.|$|E
50|$|Taxation {{of a good}} <b>may</b> {{actually}} <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{a decrease}} in price.|$|R

5|$|Unauthorised use of data {{contained}} in the National Register of Electors or the list of electors generated from it <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{the imposition of a}} maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine or one year in prison.|$|E
5|$|When {{used in the}} {{production}} or handling of chlorine, titanium should not be exposed to dry chlorine gas because it <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a titanium–chlorine fire. Even wet chlorine presents a fire hazard when extreme weather conditions cause unexpected drying.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel {{if he or she is}} not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{consumption}} of alcohol <b>may</b> also <b>result</b> <b>in</b> increased plasma levels of homocysteine.|$|R

50|$|Most major European leagues {{commence}} in {{the second}} half of the year (e.g. August or September) and stretch over two calendar years to the first half of the next year (e.g. <b>May),</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> a close season window in the Summer ending in August, and a mid-season window in January.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} new {{medications}} are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution <b>may</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
