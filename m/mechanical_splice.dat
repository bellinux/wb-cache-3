40|$|Synopsis: Concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes (CFFTs) are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in pile applications. An experimental program was undertaken to address the drivability and effect of driving forces on CFFT piles {{as well as the}} use of splices. In this program, four full-scale piles, 357 mm in diameter, and 13. 7 m long, including a spliced pile, were driven into the ground and then extracted. The piles were cut into 6 m portions that were used for beam tests on spliced and unspliced specimens and 0. 3 m portions used for material characterization of the FRP tube and push-off tests to evaluate the bond strength between the concrete core and FRP tube. Test results were compared to those of control specimens, which were not subjected to driving forces. In total, six beam tests, 28 push-off tests and 54 tension coupon tests were conducted. Test results indicate that driving forces have marginal effect, about 5 % reduction, on the flexural strength of both unspliced and spliced CFFT piles, on bond strength and on the tensile strength of the FRP tube. It is also shown that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>splice</b> used in this study performed well and was capable of developing a moment resistance, 7 % higher than that of the CFFT pile...|$|E

Reinforcing bar coupling has all of the features desirable in a rebar joining system combined with unequalled simplicity of installation. Couplers are designed to splice the same diameter bars where one bar is free to move and can be rotated.|$|R

40|$|With {{the total}} number of {{structurally}} deficient or functionally obsolete bridges at more than 20 % of the nation’s 607, 380 bridges in 2013, the nation need to work effectively to decrease {{the total number}} below to 15 % over the next decade. Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) techniques using the precast components are beneficial to effectively repair and replace the deficient bridges by reducing the period of onsite construction and improving the construction quality. However, the knowledge gap regarding the seismic performance of connections between the precast components limits the extensive implementation of ABC techniques in the moderate-to-high seismic regions of the country. Current Caltrans Seismic Design Criteria stipulates to degrade the connection between the precast girder and bent cap to a pinned connection under sever seismic event, which results in an inefficient bridge design. To overcome this issue, two innovative details for the precast bulb-tee girder to cast-in-place bent cap connection have been experimentally tested at Iowa State University. These two moment resisting connection details, named as the Extend Strand with a <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Splice</b> (ESMS) connection and the Extended Strand with a Lap Splice (ESLS) connection, consist of deck reinforcement, unstressed strands extended from the precast girder, and dowel bars grouted through the web of the girder as shown in following schematic. The deck reinforcement placed over the connection region provides the negative moment resistance. The strands spliced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>splice</b> chucks and lap splices within the ESMS and ESLS connection respectively develop the tension continuity to resist the positive moment, and the dowel bars are also designed to withstand the applied positive moments. Both connection details exhibited the adequate capacity to develop the moment resisting connection between the girders and the bent cap under target seismic demands. The testing results of this study reveal that the concrete crushing at the bottom of girder-to-cap interface induced the strength softening of the connection under the negative moments beyond the target value. For the connection behavior in the positive moment direction, the shear friction behavior was developed at the interface between the precast girder and the cast-in-place diaphragm poured around the girder, which provided the positive moment resistance. Meanwhile, the tension force generated by the strands extended from the girder contribute to the positive moment resistance as well. Based on the understanding of the behavior of the ESMS and ESLS connections exhibited within the experimental tests, an accurate but straightforward design methodology was then established to develop a guide to help with field implementation for these innovative connection details. The success in evaluating the seismic performance of the ESMS and ESLS connections confirms that both connections are adequate to develop the moment resisting connection for the precast bulb-tee girders subjected to the vertical and lateral loads and can be used within the routine bridge designs...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{fabricate}} all-in-fiber liquid microcells {{has been demonstrated}} which allows for the incorporation of complex hollow-core photonic crystal fibers (HCPCFs).

The efficiency of this integration method has been verified via strong cascaded Raman scattering in both toluene (high index) core capillaries and ethanol (low index) core HCPCFs, for power thresholds up to six orders of magnitude lower than previous results.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of two commercially available offset <b>mechanical</b> reinforcement bar <b>splice</b> systems is presented. The two splice systems, the BarSplice Double Barrel Zap Screwlok© and the Lenton QuickWedge©, were evaluated in four series of tests with reinforcement bar sizes ranging from # 4 to # 6. The tests were as follows: Direct Tension which tested the splice in open-air tension and allowed the splice to rotate freely; Restrained Tension which tested the reinforcement splice {{in a manner that}} inhibited the splice from rotating; Fatigue testing cycled the specimens through a 20 ksi (172 MPa) stress range for 10, 000 cycles; In situ beam tests embedded the splices in concrete beams. The beams were subjected to monotonic testing to failure with and without initial fatigue conditioning. Observations from the tension tests indicate current test methods do not effectively evaluate offset splices. Current practice assumes direct tension testing to be a conservative method for evaluating the ultimate load carrying capacity, and the slip through the splice. Due to rotation produced by the self aligning loads, there is an increase in load carrying capacity caused by large frictional forces at the face of the coupler. The restrained tension tests show promise as an effective test method for mitigating these large friction forces, and more accurately predicting in situ behavior of these types of splices, particular expected slip performance. Fatigue testing for offset <b>mechanical</b> <b>splices</b> proved to be an impractical test method for this type of splice. Results from this program correlate with the limiting stress restrictions contained in current design provisions. Flexural beam tests demonstrated that there was little degradation from fatigue conditioning on the performance of the splice.

40|$|In {{areas of}} high traffic, long term bridge {{construction}} can have significant {{impacts on the}} traveling public and surrounding communities. To minimize this impact, engineers and contractors prefabricate bridge elements and utilize technologies that facilitate rapid bridge assembly. This strategy is known as Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) and has gained {{the attention of the}} bridge community as information and the benefits of ABC projects has been shared. There is untapped potential in this movement as some advantages of certain bridge types, like the integral abutment bridge, have seen limited use. Integral abutment bridges were developed as a means of eliminating the expansion joint from the bridge superstructure which present long term maintenance concerns. To eliminate the joint, integral abutments rigidly connect the superstructure and foundation so that the entire structure experiences thermal expansion and contraction as one. For this reason, the integral abutment is often large and heavily reinforced which present challenges for use in ABC projects. The size of the abutment presents weight issues and <b>mechanical</b> <b>splicing</b> of the abutment to the deep foundation presents tight construction tolerances. This research investigated integral abutment details for use in ABC projects through <b>mechanical</b> <b>splicing</b> of the integral diaphragm and the pile cap. To complete this task, two ABC details were evaluated in the laboratory based on constructability, strength and durability. The construction process used to fabricate and erect the specimen was documented and is presented in this report, as this criteria often governs the design of ABC details. The specimen were tested for strength and durability by simulating thermal loads and live loads. Strain gages placed on the concrete and reinforcing steel captured the strain developed in the testing to evaluate strength. Displacement transducers placed across the precast joint measured the crack width that developed under loading in order to assess durability. The ABC details investigated are the grouted rebar coupler detail and the pile coupler detail. In order to establish baseline performances for an integral abutment, a typical cast-in-place detail was also constructed and tested. In the grouted rebar coupler detail, a plywood template was used to “match cast” the pile cap and the integral diaphragm. The template marked the locations of the spliced reinforcing steel and served as the base for the formwork in the integral diaphragm, holding the grouted couplers in position. The template proved to be simple to construct and resulted in the successful alignment of seventeen spliced steel bars and grouted couplers over the length of an eight foot specimen. A grout bed was pumped into the precast joint on the specimen, unfortunately grout leaked past two of the grouted coupler seals and obstructed the grouting of two couplers. Even with the two un-grouted rebar couplers, there was more than adequate strength created by the connection and the crack width that developed at the precast joint was comparable to that of the cast-in-place specimen. The pile coupler detail was developed to facilitate the use of a slide in bridge with integral abutments. The pile coupler reduced the number of spliced connections between the pile cap and integral diaphragm significantly in order to facilitate adequate construction tolerances. The splicing system worked well during construction; however the detail’s performance in terms of strength and durability was less than ideal. If there is a demand for the benefits of the pile coupler detail in terms of constructability, the detail should be further investigated as several lessons were learned from the testing which could improve the structural performance of the detail...|$|R

50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with <b>mechanical</b> <b>splices</b> to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|R
