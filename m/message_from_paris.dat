500|$|Instead {{of hunting}} big game abroad as he usually did {{over the winter}} months, Gordon-Cumming {{remained}} in Britain, and spent time in London and at his Scottish estate. He was also seen {{in the presence of}} an American heiress, Florence Garner, and the two became engaged. On 27 December he received an anonymous <b>message</b> <b>from</b> <b>Paris</b> that read: [...] "they are beginning to talk much here of... your sad adventure... They have talked too much in England. He sent the message to Williams and asked him to let the prince know the contents.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several <b>messages</b> <b>from</b> <b>Paris</b> were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1316 Bavel was {{separated}} from the parish of Gilze and gets its own church, devoted to St. Brigida. After the 80-years war in 1648, Catholicism became banned, and the church fell to the Protestants. The catholic population improvised a catholic church in the hamlet of IJpelaar (today {{part of the city}} of Breda) until 1743, in which year they build a new church, presumably at the [...] "Kerkeind". In 1809, the French king Lodewijk Napoleon returned the original church back to the catholic population. In this time, a French [...] "telegraphe" [...] was installed on the tower of the church, to convey <b>messages</b> fast <b>from</b> <b>Paris</b> to Amsterdam.|$|R

500|$|Goldman {{returned}} to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared {{to her like}} people [...] "in a burning house". Worse, anarchists and other radicals around the world refused to support their cause. The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she {{returned to}} London. Frustrated by England's repressive atmosphere—which she called [...] "more fascist than the fascists"—she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten, however. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT-FAI, Mariano Vázquez, sent a <b>message</b> to her <b>from</b> <b>Paris,</b> praising her for her contributions and naming her as [...] "our spiritual mother". She called it [...] "the most beautiful tribute I have ever received".|$|R

25|$|Because Portugal's ports {{were closed}} by the British blockade, her wines {{could no longer}} be sold to England nor could her goods be traded to Brazil. The French put 10,000 persons to work in the arsenal and shipyard, but Lisbon soon filled with large numbers of {{unemployed}} people who thronged the streets begging for alms. A <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Napoleon arrived in May ordering Junot to send 4,000 troops to Ciudad Rodrigo to support Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières in the north of Spain and 8,000 more to link up with General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Étang in Andalusia. These were the last instructions to reach Portugal <b>from</b> <b>Paris.</b>|$|R
50|$|There was no {{question}} of negotiation. The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands (for example, the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed), extended the schedule for the withdrawal and registered their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms. But they were {{in no position to}} refuse to sign. On Sunday 10 November, they were shown newspapers <b>from</b> <b>Paris</b> to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated. That same day, Erzberger was instructed to sign by Ebert. The cabinet had earlier received a <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Hindenburg, requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on.|$|R
