5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the <b>Middles</b> Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical instrument {{that may have been}} invented in Europe until this period. Stringed instruments were prominent in Middle Age Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern Europe as far north as Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E
5|$|The spore dust is olive to {{brownish}} olive. The spores are oval to somewhat -shaped, measuring 11–15μm long by 4.5–6.5μm wide. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen <b>middles</b> and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen <b>middles,</b> and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} <b>middles</b> ages, there were {{distinct}} material cultures {{evident in the}} different linguistic groups, federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art {{can be seen in}} the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hordes like the St Ninian's Isle Treasure. Irish-Scots art from the Kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items like the Hunterston brooch, which with other items like the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles, and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi-precious stones, in the heavily carved High crosses found most frequently in the Highlands and Islands, but distributed across the country and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.|$|E

By way of thanks to the Count, the town was named Neu-Isenburg after him. The town plan was laid out by Andreas Loeber in a right-angled grid pattern. From corners ran {{diagonal}} streets to the marketplace. Also, the <b>middles</b> of the outer sides were linked by streets to the square marketplace. This township survives today in the streets of Kronengasse, Pfarrgasse, Löwengasse and Hirtengasse.|$|E

500|$|The Ecstatic {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 28 reviews. After two poorly received records, The Ecstatic was viewed by critics as a return for Mos Def {{to the form}} of his 1999 debut album Black on Both Sides. In Spin magazine, Aaron wrote that the [...] "internationalist return to form" [...] was also [...] "perhaps his liveliest work yet". Mick <b>Middles</b> from The Quietus hailed it as [...] "the joyful sound of a rampant artist, unrestrained by expectation or commercialism", with free-flowing music that escaped the boundaries his previous albums had merely pushed. Thompson believed the diverse range of samples made The Ecstatic [...] "a crate-digger's wet dream" [...] and [...] "a thrillingly accessible demonstration of hip-hop's limitless creative possibilities" [...] to a layperson. Writing in MSN Music, Christgau felt the songs were [...] "devoid of hooks but full of sounds {{you want to hear}} again", along with [...] "thoughtfully slurred" [...] yet intelligible lyrics by Mos Def, whose creative vision warranted the introductory Malcolm X sample. Steve Jones of USA Today said his reflections on politics, love, religion, and societal conditions were full of insight and sincerity while calling the album his strongest effort so far. Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine was less impressed, writing that much of the music lacked song structure and [...] "careened wildly, free from the constraints of chorus and verse"; Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard found the quality of the songs inconsistent.|$|E
