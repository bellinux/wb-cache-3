5000|$|AIG is {{currently}} undergoing {{investigation by the}} New York State attorney general’s office for what State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo called [...] "unwarranted and outrageous" [...] executive expenditures {{in the wake of}} the U.S. government's initial $85 billion support package extended to the failing bank. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo</b> criticized in particular the multimillion-dollar payments to Martin Sullivan, A.I.G.’s former chief executive, and Joseph J. Cassano, who ran the unit blamed for the losses that pushed the company to the brink of collapse. A.I.G. agreed to help recover that money.|$|E
5000|$|The debates {{between the}} two gubernatorial {{candidates}} were sharp exchanges on issues involving the state's economic and crime problems. The New York Times reported after the New York Post debate {{at the beginning of}} October: [...] "Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Lewis E. Lehrman argued virtually uninterrupted for 50 minutes yesterday in their first debate of the New York gubernatorial campaign. What were to have been two-minute opening statements stretched to 25 minutes as the two—intense but seemingly not angry—alternated ripostes and kept their own informal time limits. At one point, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo</b> gestured to the four panelists and said, 'Maybe we should let them play.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Before {{joining the}} Metropolitan Museum in 1992, Holzer was special {{counselor}} to the New York State economic development {{director in the}} administration of the late Governor Mario M. Cuomo (with whom he co-edited the 1990 book, Lincoln on Democracy, which has now been translated into four languages). Before that, he was director of communications at WNET/Channel 13, the flagship PBS station in New York, and in the 1970s, served as a political press secretary—first to the late Rep. Bella S. Abzug (D-NY) in Congress and in her campaigns for the U. S. Senate and Mayor of New York; and in the 1977 general election mayoral campaign of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo.</b> Holzer started his career as a reporter, later editor, for the onetime news weekly the Manhattan Tribune.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{complaint}} accused Merkin of improperly commingling his personal funds with his hedge fund accounts and {{using some of}} the money to buy artwork worth more than $91 million. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo’s</b> office is seeking restitution and unspecified damages from Mr. Merkin.|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Rattner and Quadrangle {{were linked}} to a New York pension fund {{investigation}} [...] "within months of his '09 departure from Quadrangle, and then stepped down from his government role" [...] summer 2009. In September, 2009, {{a number of other}} firms involved in the pension fund investigation, including Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings, either paid fines or had [...] "already agreed to pay settlements and to stop using placement agents," [...] while Rattner and Quadrangle were [...] "among others in talks with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo’s</b> office." [...] In April, 2010, the firm agreed to pay fines of $7 million to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo’s</b> office and $5 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle its part. Rattner {{was not included in the}} agreement. According to a report, [...] "The allegations against Quadrangle involved a movie deal that a company owned by one of the firm’s funds agreed to distribute. That film called “Chooch” was a project involving a brother of David J. Loglisci, the chief investment officer of the state pension fund. Mr. Loglisci pleaded guilty March 2010 to securities fraud and admitted that he helped steer pension money to political contributors of the former state Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and to companies that paid kickbacks to Mr. Hevesi’s top political consultant, Hank Morris." ...|$|R
500|$|The Eliot Spitzer {{political}} surveillance controversy (popularly {{known as}} [...] "Troopergate") broke out on July 23, 2007, when New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office admonished Spitzer's administration for ordering the State Police to create special records of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno's whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City. A New York Times editorial suggested that Maloney {{might have been}} involved by withholding emails during the investigation, and the Times endorsed Maloney's 2012 election opponent because of its concerns about Maloney's handling of the investigation. The Wall Street Journal wrote in July 2012, [...] "generally, {{those involved in the}} investigation on both sides defend Mr. Maloney's conduct. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo's</b> chief of staff at the time, Steve Cohen, called the idea that Mr. Maloney {{got in the way of}} the Attorney General's inquiry 'misinformed to the point of being laughable.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Manhattan millionaire—by now styling {{himself as}} [...] "Pete" [...] Rinfret—agreed {{to become the}} Republican {{candidate}} in the 1990 gubernatorial election against Mario Cuomo {{at the request of}} former Tresury Secretary William Simon and state Senator Roy Goodman. Rinfret suffered when the Conservative Party of New York declined to cross endorse him and instead gave their support to Dr. Herbert London. Rinfret also contended that the Republican party gave him little or no support, and that there were several key members of the Republican party that was privately supporting London and the Conservatives. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo</b> {{went on to win the}} election with 53 percent, Mr. Rinfret 22 percent and the Conservative candidate, Herbert London, 21 percent. Had Mr. London won a larger percentage the Republican party would have lost the second line of New York State election ballots to the Conservatives.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the mayoral}} campaign, {{placards}} appeared saying: [...] "Vote for Cuomo, not the homo" [...] {{in reference to}} rumors about Koch's sexuality. Cuomo denied responsibility for this, but Koch never forgave him [...] "as he made clear with a pointedly disparaging reference to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo</b> in a recorded interview with The New York Times that {{was not to be}} made public until Mr. Koch's death." [...] Cuomo ran on his opposition to the death penalty, which backfired amongst New Yorkers as crime was very high. Cuomo then went negative with ads that likened Koch to unpopular former mayor John Lindsay. Meanwhile, Koch backers accused Cuomo of antisemitism and pelted Cuomo campaign cars with eggs. Cuomo was also defeated by Koch in the general election, taking 40.97% to Koch's 49.99%. The race is discussed in Jonathan Mahler's book Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning.|$|E
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} a {{campaign}} promise, Cuomo signed same-sex marriage legislation on June 24, 2011, following an [...] "intense {{public and private}} lobbying campaign", and later called for all states to do the same. Cuomo was lauded for his efforts to pass same-sex marriage legislation. One prominent advocate stated that [...] "for gay Americans, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Cuomo</b> was [...] "the only national politician with hero status." [...] Following {{the passage of the}} Marriage Equality Act, Cuomo was criticized for describing the viewpoints of same-sex marriage opponents as being [...] "anti-American." [...] On July 25, 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the New York Supreme Court seeking an injunction against the Marriage Equality Act, alleging corruption and violations of the law in the process of passing the bill. The trial court initially held that the plaintiffs' case could proceed, but the decision was reversed on appeal.|$|E
