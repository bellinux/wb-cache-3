40|$|Dealing with {{narratives}} {{relating to}} corporeal vulnerabilities, sinew II {{is in part}} initially a response to bone-like ceramic fragments and edges. My intention was to redefine and rearrange broken ceramic ware, using cast glass to extend and exaggerate anatomical references and to unite these forms in a new configuration. My process of making is a pursuit of a personal material language and purposeful ‘rough workmanship’. In order to realise the glass cast I employed digital technologies whilst maintaining a low-tech response to composition and an awkwardness of form. 3 D scans of ceramic edges and CAD software were utilised to generate the investment <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> <b>glass</b> casting. This was printed using a 3 D digital printer; this process is known as Rapid Tooling and removes {{the need for a}} physical pattern. Digital processes were employed alongside conventional exploratory means; for example, clay and plaster props were used to roughly mock up 3 dimensional sketches of potential compositions of the broken ceramics. The orientation of physical objects was then recorded using a microscribe, a gestural piece of kit that integrates the engagement between the physical and CAD software. By aligning cross- reference positions recorded using the microscribe with the scanned ceramic data I could sweep between these points to create 3 D pathways that would eventually form the surface of the glass cast. This is an intuitive way of employing digital tools, with unpredictable results. I have deliberately used basic construction methods and sheet glass to maintain immediacy with the materials, and hewn edges to suggest danger and vulnerability. Sinew II, supported by a critical commentary relevant to the conference theme of Materiality, was peer reviewed and included in the exhibition All Makers Now? at Trelissick House, Cornwall. Selected for the International Glass Prize 2015 at Glazenhuis, Lommel, Belgium. On Monday 19 January 2015, the jury of the international glass prize – consisting of Hans op de Beeck, Lut Maris, An Moons, Philip Wiesman, Ilse van Roy and Jeroen Maes – selected 61 works from 756 submissions. These artists will be invited to present their work at the international glass prize exhibition in the glass museum glazenhuis in Lommel, Belgium, from April until October 2015. Sinew II is now in the permanent collection of the Glazenhuis Museum...|$|E

U Augusteumu u Naroni (Vid kod Metkovića) te u Tiluriju (Gardun) nađeni su ulomci čaša koje su načinili, i to potpisali, Ennion i Aristeas. U naronskom Augusteumu nađen je skyphos, djelo jednog od šest Sidonaca. U istom je hramu nađena staklena kameja, možda rad jednog od trojice Dioskuridovih sinova. U Saloni su djelovala dva staklara, Paschazije, ili Pascazije, te vjerojatno Miscenije Ampliat. Uz Asseriju (Podgrađe kod Benkovca) vezuje se rad staklarâ Trellusa i Athenija. Dodajmo tome mogućnost da su osobna imena na dnu staklenih balzamarija i boca imena staklara, pa uz Argyruntum (Starigrad), Iader (Zadar), Asseriju, Volceru (Bakar) i Zaton vezujemo sljedeća imena: Rufinius, A(ntonius) Volumnius Ianuarius, Q. Dani Euhelpisti, L. Aemilius Blasius, C. Salvius Gratus, Cn. Pompeius Cassianus. Ako je riječ o staklarima, njihove su boce uvezene u Dalmaciju iz sjeverne Italije. Uz to valja napomenuti kako postoji hipoteza o Blasijevoj i Pompejevoj dalmatinskoj podružnici. In {{the last}} decade in Dalmatia the {{fragments}} of three cups attributed to the famous 1 st century glassblowers Ennion and Aristeas were found. Dalmatian Ennion’s cups come from the military camp in Tilurium (Gardun near Trilj) and from the Augusteum in Narona (Vid). The Naronitan vessel is the forth or fifth such vessel found on the route to Tremithus in Cyprus - Narona - Cavárzere near Adria - Romula - possibly Tarragona. Similar fragments are known from Mogador in Morocco as well as aforementioned fragment from Gardun in Croatia, which {{is too small to}} be attributed to some of Ennion’s cups with one or two handles. Aristeas, Ennion’s follower, as a Cypriote signed the Naronitan cup from Augusteum and the cup in the Constable-Maxwell collection, and without the toponymic mark the cup in olive-green glass in the Strada Collection, Pavia. The inscriptions on the flat horizontal tongues of two handles of scyphus from the Augusteum in Narona are worn and illegible so we don’t know who of Sidonians signed it in the 1 st century AD. The Naronitan glass cameo of Livia with the youthful appearance and hairstyle with nodus certainly originated in Rome during the period of Tiberius, and is possibly a work of one of Dioskourides’ sons: Eutyches, Hyllos or Herophilos. Only Salona in Dalmatia is proved to have been a glassworks centre not only by the remains of a glass furnace, but with certain epigraphic evidence - a sarcophagus fragment with the inscription of glassmaker Paschasius or Pascasius, and a marble <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> <b>glass</b> bottles with the inscription of glassmaker Miscenius Ampliatus. Depictions of closed glass furnaces, and glassblowing scenes are preserved on three clay lamps from the 3 rd quarter of 1 st century AD, consistent with the spread of glassblowing technique, one from Prati di Monestirolo (Ferrara region, Italy), the one from Školarice (Slovenia: Regio X) and another from Asseria (Dalmatia). On the lamp from Asseria the names of two depicted glassblowers, freedmen are inscribed: [Tre]llus and Athenio, his assistant whose name suggests Athenian origin, his or his ancestor’s. There is a possibility that the personal names on the bottoms of glass unguentaria and bottles are the names of glassmakers, so we relate the following names Rufinius, A(ntonius) Volumnius Ianuarius, Q. Dani Euhelpisti, L. Aemilius Blasius, C. Salvius Gratus, Cn. Pompeius Cassianus to Argyruntum (Starigrad), Iader (Zadar), Asseria (Podgrađe near Benkovac), Volcera (Bakar) and Zaton. If they were glassmakers, their bottles were imported in Dalmatia from north Italy; note that there is a hypothesis about Blasius’ and Pompeius’ Dalmatian branch glass shop...|$|E

40|$|The Centre for Fine Print Research in Bristol UK {{undertakes}} {{research into}} print technologies {{from the traditional}} 19 th Century to the latest digital capture and print. Outcomes of this research are often realised in collaborative projects with well-known artists. The breadth of technologies used {{in the creation of}} printed digital art is huge, and often mixes analogue and digital techniques. At the CFPR we print artwork using digital photographic technologies that range from, fired enamel on metal for largescale public art projects, continuous tone photo-ceramic relief panels, digital <b>moulds</b> <b>for</b> <b>glass</b> artists. On-glaze ceramic print, Digital photogravure, flexographic print both intaglio and relief, Helio-relief, collotype and Woodburytype, as well as large-scale digital inkjet for Blue chip artists such as Richard Hamilton. In order to understand and quantify colour and surface print quality differences between each process, colourmetric measurement is available alongside microphotography to support and back up the subjective analytical data that is collected during a project. Examples from this data will be used to illustrate the differences between digital print techniques and explain why the artist has chosen a particular print technique. In order to fully explain the breadth of technologies available this paper will also demonstrate the work other studios from Europe and the USA that develop projects using digital technologies to print artists work...|$|R
50|$|In 1901 Per Alfred Stenberg {{established}} a foundry {{in the small}} town of Emmaboda in southern Sweden. One of the main products was <b>moulds</b> <b>for</b> the <b>glass</b> industry. Per Alfred transfer ownership of the company to his sons. In 1922 Hilding Flygt set up a pump and fan sales company in Stockholm. Through a newspaper advertisement the two companies are brought into contact with one another in 1929, and led to the Stenberg brothers beginning to produce Flygt pumps in Emmaboda. Sixten Englesson, chief engineer, invented the first submersible drainage pump in 1947 and the first submersible sewage pump in 1956. In 1968 the Stenberg family sold the company to ITT Corporation. During the 1970s, the product range was expanded with mixers and other products.|$|R
50|$|Art student Geoffrey Baxter was {{employed}} as a designer in 1954 by Chief Designer, William Wilson. Baxter introduced a range of textured vases in 1967. These included Drunken Bricklayer vases, Television vases, and Banjo vases. Baxter used found objects including bark and nails to produce <b>moulds</b> <b>for</b> soda-lime <b>glass.</b> The bark effect vases {{and others in the}} textured range introduced colours including Tangerine orange, Meadow Green, Aubergine, Pewter, Indigo, Cinnamon, Ruby and Kingfisher blue in 1969. The coloured glass was encased in clear glass. Baxter stayed with Whitefriars Glass until its closure in 1980. The high labour costs of handmade glass and late 1970s economic problems in the UK had made Whitefriars uncompetitive. The factory site was bulldozed. Baxter died on 22 August 1995.|$|R
40|$|For the {{production}} of <b>mould</b> inserts <b>for</b> precision <b>glass</b> <b>moulding,</b> the ultra precision grinding technique with a subsequent manual polishing operation is typically applied. These processes are time consuming and have a relatively low reproducibility. An alternative manufacturing technology, with a high predictability and efficiency, which additionally allows a higher geometrical flexibility, is the diamond turning technique. In addition the ultrasonic assisted ultra precision cutting process has already proven its potential for machining difficult-to-cut materials, such as steel and glass. By applying the ultrasonic assistance, the classic constraints of the process can be widened significantly. In this publication the process is applied on binderless, nano crystalline tungsten carbide...|$|R

50|$|FreeFAB Wax™, {{invented by}} James B Gardiner and Steven Janssen at Laing O'Rourke (construction company). The {{patented}} {{technology has been}} in development since March 2013. The technique uses construction scale 3D printing to print high volumes of engineered wax (up to 400L/hr) to fabricate a 'fast and dirty' 3D printed <b>mould</b> <b>for</b> precast concrete, <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced concrete (GRC) and other sprayable/cast-able materials. The mould casting surface is then 5 axis milled removing approximately 5mm of wax to create a high quality mould (approximately 20 micron surface roughness). After the component has cured, the mould is then either crushed or melted-off and the wax filtered and re-used, significantly reducing waste compared to conventional mould technologies. The benefits of the technology are fast mould fabrication speeds, increased production efficiencies, reduced labour and virtual elimination of waste by re-use of materials <b>for</b> bespoke <b>moulds</b> compared to conventional mould technologies.|$|R
