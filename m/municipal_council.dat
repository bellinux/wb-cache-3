5|$|Bømlo <b>Municipal</b> <b>Council</b> voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord <b>Municipal</b> <b>Council.</b> Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio <b>Municipal</b> <b>Council</b> voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar <b>Municipal</b> <b>Council</b> voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E

40|$|Elections to <b>Municipal</b> <b>Councils</b> in the Czech Republic The {{topic of}} my Master'degree thesis are the {{elections}} to <b>municipal</b> <b>councils</b> in the Czech Republic.

It is so, although the decisions made by the <b>municipal</b> <b>councils</b> often have the biggest impact {{on the lives of}} ordinary people. Also this year, there were some interesting cases related to the elections to <b>municipal</b> <b>councils</b> that the Constitutional Court had to decide and that only made my interest greater. The aim of this thesis is to give a complex description of the legislation concerning the elections to <b>municipal</b> <b>councils,</b> to try to give some evaluation of this legislation and to suggest some possible changes to this legislation. This thesis consists of introduction, eight chapters and conclusion and its structure is essentially based on the structure of the Act No. 491 / 2001 Sb., on Elections to Representative Bodies of Municipalities and on Amendments to Certain Other Laws as amended. The introduction pursues the reasons why the elections to <b>municipal</b> <b>councils</b> receive such relatively small attention and the problems which the [...] ...|$|R
