5|$|The {{circulation}} {{version of}} the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever attempted by the Mint, was released through banks on November 1, 1971. Many were obtained by collectors; there was sufficient demand that <b>many</b> <b>banks</b> imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to search through rolls in search of better specimens. An oil film was found on {{a large number of}} specimens; this was removed by collectors.|$|E
5|$|As with <b>many</b> <b>banks</b> {{around the}} world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and <b>many</b> <b>banks</b> and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that firms maintain <b>many</b> <b>bank</b> relationships {{to reduce the risk}} of premature liquidation of their investment projects arising out of the information asymmetry between firms and banks. Using the data of large Japanese manufacturing firms of the early 1990 s, we find a negative relation between the number of bank relationships of a firm and the health of the primary banks, which is consistent with the hypothesis. Furthermore, a negative relationship is only observed for firms for whom access to bond markets was constrained. The result suggests that the availability of bond financing provides firms with an alternative to having <b>many</b> <b>bank</b> relationships. 論説(Article...|$|R
