5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used family symbols in advertising to varying extents of success. Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has <b>more</b> <b>success</b> with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

5|$|Over {{a hundred}} years later, missionaries had <b>more</b> <b>success,</b> setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on San Juan del Puerto (St. John of the Harbor), the mission {{established}} at the river's mouth following {{the demise of the}} French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.|$|E

5|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In {{much of the rest}} of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found <b>more</b> <b>success</b> on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

5|$|Ajax {{had little}} success in European {{competition}} {{prior to their}} meeting with Liverpool. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup twice during the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons, but did not progress past the first round either time. Liverpool had only participated in European competition during the previous two season, but they had <b>more</b> <b>success</b> than Ajax. Their first season of competition in 1964–65 they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, losing to eventual winners Internazionale. The following season they reached {{the final of the}} European Cup Winners' Cup, however, they lost 2–1 against German team Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had <b>more</b> <b>success.</b> The rebel campaign culminated in the fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
5|$|Both the Red Sox and Cardinals {{made the}} playoffs the {{following}} season. The Red Sox lost to the eventual champions the Chicago White Sox, in the American League Division Series. The Cardinals, in a repeat meeting of the previous season's National League Championship Series, lost to the Houston Astros. However, the city of Boston would see <b>more</b> <b>success</b> when the New England Patriots won Super Bowl XXXIX, {{three months after the}} Red Sox won the World Series, giving the greater Boston area its third championship in 12 months, making it the first time since 1980 that any city had two Super Bowl winners and a World Series winner in a period of the same length.|$|E

50|$|BattleDragons uses a dice pool of ten-sided dice and {{a target}} number for most actions.

5|$|During this period, Miller {{achieved}} <b>more</b> <b>success</b> as a footballer, {{following his}} brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937. A defender, Miller initially {{played on the}} half-back flank before moving to full back during his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he lacked the strength to hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on his running ability and accurate kicking.|$|E
5|$|Following the Georgia Tech punt, Wake Forest {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second quarter. Wake Forest, after a three and out, again punted the ball and Georgia Tech took over on offense. On their first full possession of the second quarter, Tech seemed to have <b>more</b> <b>success</b> moving the ball. Quarterback Reggie Ball picked up a first down running the ball, then completed a 22-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson, driving the Yellow Jackets inside Wake Forest territory. Once there, however, Wake Forest's defense stiffened. Ball was unable to complete two consecutive passes, and his third pass inside Wake Forest territory was intercepted.|$|E

Titled I Care, {{the album is}} the result of the tight collaboration of an international line-up of producers, songwriters, arrangers and engineers. Each contribution is meant to showcase the vocal artistry of the 19-year-old Search for a Star champion who has now come to her own as one of the country's finest performers.|$|R
5|$|JG 27 {{was moved}} out of Africa {{for about a month}} because of the impact Marseille's death had on morale. The deaths of two other German aces, Günter Steinhausen and Marseille's friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt, just three weeks earlier reduced spirits to an all-time low. One biographer {{suggests}} these consequences were instigated by a failure in the command style of Marseille, although it was not entirely within his control. The <b>more</b> <b>success</b> Marseille had, the more his staffel relied on him to carry the greater share of aerial victories claimed by the unit. So his death, when it came, was something which JG 27 had seemingly not prepared for.|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Dartford, Kent. He studied at the London School of Economics before abandoning his {{academic}} career to join the Rolling Stones. Jagger has written most of the Rolling Stones' songs together with Richards, and they continue to collaborate musically. In the late 1960s, Jagger began acting in films (starting with Performance and Ned Kelly), to a mixed reception. He began a solo career in 1985, releasing his first album, She's the Boss, and joined the electric supergroup SuperHeavy in 2009. Relationships with the Stones' members, particularly Richards, deteriorated during the 1980s, but Jagger has always found <b>more</b> <b>success</b> with the band than with his solo and side projects.|$|E
5|$|James {{achieved}} <b>more</b> <b>success</b> {{in foreign}} policy. Never having been {{at war with}} Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long Anglo–Spanish War to an end, and a peace treaty was signed {{between the two countries}} in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now Earl of Northampton, which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet. Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.|$|E
