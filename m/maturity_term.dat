Using dynamic term structure models and event study regressions I find that government bond purchases have important portfolio balance and signaling effects. The signaling channel operates mainly by lowering short-rate expectations in the intermediate segment of the yield curve, while the portfolio balance channel is effective in lowering longer <b>maturity</b> <b>term</b> premia. In addition, I find that target interest rate policy and government bond purchases operate in different segments of the yield curve.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of the term structure of interest rates, with a particular focus on empirical aspects of the modelling. In this thesis, we explore the &# 952;-parameterised (&# 952; being the length of time to <b>maturity)</b> <b>term</b> structure of interest rates, corresponding to the traditional T-parameterised (T being the time of <b>maturity)</b> <b>term</b> structure of interest rates. The constructions of Australian yield curves are illustrated using generic yield curves produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia based on bonds on issue and by constructed yield curves of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia derived from swap rates. The data used to build the models is Australian Treasury yields from January 1996 to December 2001 for maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years, and the second data used to validate the model is Australian Treasury yields from July 2000 to April 2004 for maturities of all years from 1 - 10. Both data were supplied by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Initially, univariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), with models of individual yield increment time series are developed for a set of fixed maturities. Then, a multivariate Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution of the term structure of yield increments is developed. This model captures many important properties of financial data such as volatility mean reversion, volatility persistency, stationarity and heavy tails. There are two innovations of GARCH modelling in this thesis: (i) the development of the Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution using meta-elliptical distribution in which the degrees of freedom of each series varies with maturity, and the estimation is given; (ii) the development of a GARCH model of term structure of interest rates (TS-GARCH). The TS-GARCH model describes the parameters specifying the GARCH model and the degrees of freedom using simple smooth functions of time to maturity of component series. TS-GARCH allows an empirical description of complete interest rate yield curve increments therefore allowing the model to be used for interpolation to additional maturity beyond those used to construct the model. Diagnostics of TS-GARCH model are provided using Australian Treasury bond yields...|$|E
40|$|A {{total return}} swap (TRS), {{sometimes}} known as a total rate of return swap or TR swap, is an agreement between two parties that exchanges the total return from a financial asset between them. This is designed to transfer the credit risk from one party to the other. It {{is one of the}} principal instruments used by banks and other financial instruments to manage their credit risk exposure, and as such is a credit derivative. They are used as credit risk management tools, and also as synthetic repo instruments for funding purposes. One definition of a TRS is given in Francis etal. (1999), which states that a TRS is a swap agreement in which the total return of a bank loan or credit-sensitive security is exchanged for some other cash flow, usually tied to Libor or some other loan or credit-sensitive security. The TRS trade itself can be to any <b>maturity</b> <b>term</b> – that is, it need not match the maturity of the underlying (or reference) security. In a TRS, the total return from the underlying asset is paid over to the counterparty in return for a fixed or floating cash flow. This makes it slightly different to other credit derivatives such as credit default swaps, as the payments between counterparties to a TRS are connected to changes in the market value of th...|$|E

Influencing of fertilization method of rape is taken into account at the same time. The obtained results specify that the delay of harvest of rape (term I &# 8211; full <b>maturity,</b> <b>term</b> II &# 8211; 10 days after) has a substantial influence on the yield of seeds. Losses from that delay can account {{for as much as}} 10. 9 q ha- 1. Application of Caramba (especially in the variant of B and C) had a substantial influence on the yield growth (about 5 - 6 q ha- 1) at collections in the term I, and even stronger in the term II (6 - 7 q ha- 1). The applied regulators of ripening (especially Reglone and Roundup) had a negative influence on the yield growth, causing its decrease of about 2 - 3 q ha- 1 (Reglone alone applied in the II term of harvest had a very slight impact on the yield growth). Applied chemicals modified MTS only in an insignificant way (statistically unimportant). Substantial differences were found only between control and combination where Roundup was applied &# 8211; but only in the term II of harvest. The meaningful decrease of MTS was also found on the combination where Reglone was applied. However, they were statistically insignificant...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on {{the information in the}} term structure for longer maturities about both future inflation and the term structure of real interest rates. The evidence indicates that there is substantial information in the longer <b>maturity</b> <b>term</b> structure about future inflation: the slope of the term structure does {{have a great deal of}} predictive power for future changes in inflation. On the other hand, at the longer maturities, the term structure of nominal interest rates contains very little information about the term structure of real interest rates. These results are strikingly different from those found for very short-term maturities, six months or less, in previous work. For maturities of six months or less, the term structure contains no information about the future path of inflation, but it does contain a great deal of information about the term structure of real interest rates. The evidence in this paper does indicate that, at longer maturities, the term structure of interest rates can be used to help assess future inflationary pressures: when the slope of the term structure steepens, it is an indication that the inflation rate will rise in the future and when the slope falls, it is an indication that the inflation rate will fall. However, we must still remain cautious about using the evidence presented here to advocate that the Federal Reserve should target on the term structure in conducting monetary policy. A change in Federal Reserve operating procedures which focuses on the term structure may well cause the relationship between the term structure and future inflation to shift, with the result that the term structure no longer remains an accurate guide to the path of future inflation. If this were to occur, Federal Reserve monetary policy could go far astray by focusing on the term structure of interest rates. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters that concern with the consumption cycle and corporate finance. The first chapter analyzes the role of durability in characterizing the consumption cycle. There is strong empirical evidence demonstrating that decreases in residential investments and durable expenditures are early indicators of economic downturns. Analogously, once the economy goes into recession, early increases in residential investments and durable expenditures signal economic recoveries. So far, little {{work has been done}} detailing the mechanisms explaining these important empirical stylized facts. In this article, I develop a general equilibrium asset pricing production model that includes durability and substitutability between perishable and durable service consumption. Results indicate that large shocks in the productivity of the capital accumulation process and a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution are both needed to create the correct timing of changes in durable expenditures and nondurable consumption characterized in the data. The study also uses this general equilibrium model as a framework to make predictions about the term structure of forward contracts settled on a national housing price index. Such work will create a foundation for further developing this important derivatives market. The second chapter analyzes the link between debt <b>maturity</b> and the <b>term</b> spread. This chapter is co-authored with Pratish Anilkumar Patel. Evidence shows that a firm's debt <b>maturity</b> and <b>term</b> spread are intricately linked. Firms issue short term debt when the term spread is significantly positive and they increase <b>maturity</b> as the <b>term</b> spread decreases. The current literature explains this link with market frictions such as agency problems, asymmetric information, and liquidity risk. We explain the link between debt <b>maturity</b> and <b>term</b> spread using the trade-off theory of capital structure. When the term spread is small or even negative, transaction costs of debt rollover outweigh bankruptcy costs. Therefore, the firm optimally chooses to increase debt maturity. On the other hand, when the term spread is significantly positive, bankruptcy costs outweigh transaction costs of debt rollover. Therefore shorter debt maturity is optimal as it minimizes the chance of bankruptcy. In addition, we contribute to the current discussion in the literature concerning the speed of adjustments of capital structure, finding that firms are active in adjusting their capital structure. The model is consistent with a variety of stylized facts concerning debt maturity...|$|R
