5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were going to sound in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the <b>mixing</b> <b>stage,</b> rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E

25|$|In February 2007, HIM began {{recording}} their sixth album at Finnvox Studios, reuniting with producers Hiili Hiilesmaa and Tim Palmer. The making-of {{the album}} was plagued with problems Valo was facing in his personal life. Among other things, Valo's alcohol abuse had worsened, with him reportedly vomiting and defecating blood at one point. All these issues came to a head, when Valo suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process. According to Valo, he did manage to recover, until the <b>mixing</b> <b>stage,</b> when he began drinking again. Eventually Valo {{was admitted to the}} Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen. In April 2007, HIM released Uneasy Listening Vol. 2, which peaked at number twelve in Finland. In May 2007, the band's upcoming album was pushed back from a previously announced 10 July release to September. From 25 July to 3 September 2007, HIM toured the US with Linkin Park on their Projekt Revolution Tour, which also included My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday and Placebo. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, HIM held a contest for fans to win a trip to meet the band at tour's opening date in Seattle. The winners of the contest would also be featured on a forthcoming live DVD. HIM also played a number of concerts in the summer of 2007 opening for Metallica, including a show at Wembley Stadium in London, England.|$|E

Shortly after, Jordison suggested the group would need a full-time sampler and Jones fit the position as [...] "he liked doing that anyway", so Mick Thomson was brought in to fill the open position on guitar. After the release of Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat., the band members were working on new material which required more vocal melody, with which Colsefni struggled. In 1997, Corey Taylor was recruited from local band Stone Sour. As a result, Colsefni was moved to backing vocals and percussion, although he left soon after.|$|E
500|$|During {{the making}} of HIM's 2007 album Venus Doom, Valo's alcohol abuse worsened {{to the point that}} he was {{vomiting}} and defecating blood.

Valo was able to recuperate, until he suffered a relapse during the album's <b>mixing</b> <b>stage.</b> He was eventually admitted to the Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen. Following Valo's time in rehab, HIM released , which was the band's first album that Valo recorded entirely sober. Since then, Valo has relapsed, but has said that he tries to balance his drinking, stating [...] "I'm an on-and-off guy. If I drink, I drink properly for long stretches of time.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{conceptual}} framework {{for the development of}} closed canopy oak (Quercus) stands that incorporates the influence of intermediate-severity canopy disturbance events, provides for the possibility of multiple developmental pathways, and does not narrowly define an endpoint given the stochastic nature of natural disturbances. The proposed model differs from the current oak stand development model in three primary ways. First, our proposed model acknowledges more than one <b>mixed</b> <b>stage</b> of development after an intermediate-severity disturbance based on the pre-disturbance condition and disturbance agent. Second, we suggest that these discrete <b>mixed</b> <b>stages</b> may progress in their development along different pathways and stands may be structurally dissimilar when they reach the complex stage. Third, we contend that the complex stage of development in oak stands is not usually achieved {{in the absence of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>stage</b> because the return interval of these events is shorter than the period required for oak stands to reach the complex developmental stage via gap-phase processes alone. Our proposed framework for oak stand development should aid decision making in oak-dominated systems...|$|R

2500|$|... 90125 is the {{eleventh}} studio album by the English rock band Yes, released on 7 November 1983 by Atco Records. Its title {{was chosen to}} match the label catalog number for the release. After the group disbanded in 1981 after touring their previous album, Drama (1980), bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White formed Cinema with guitarist and singer Trevor Rabin and original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye who had left in 1971. The group adopted a more commercial and pop-oriented direction {{as the result of}} their new material, much of it derived from Rabin's demos, with former Yes singer Trevor Horn as their producer.

5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the <b>mixed</b> <b>stage.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>stage</b> lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|R

2500|$|Tormato was {{released}} in September 1978 {{at the height of}} punk rock in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes. Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the Birotron, a tape replay keyboard, and Squire experimented with harmonisers and Mu-tron pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the RIAA. Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band's 1978–1979 tour was a commercial success. Concerts were performed in the round with a £50,000-central revolving stage and a 360-degree sound system fitted above it. Yes earned a [...] "Golden Ticket Award" [...] for grossing over $1 million in box office receipts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{recording}} the album, the band worked with music producers Ben Grosse and Rae DiLeo, {{both of which}} they had worked with on Title of Record.

The band entered the final phases of {{recording the}} album in December 2001, with plans to start mixing the album {{at the beginning of}} 2002. In March 2002, the band released a tentative track list that ultimately containing all of the tracks that would be make the final album, albeit with an alternate order, and [...] "The 4th" [...] going by the tentative title [...] "Reservation".
