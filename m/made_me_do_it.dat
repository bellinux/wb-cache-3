500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{also helped}} popularize {{political}} subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths {{at the turn}} of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan's cultural nationalism on their debut album To the East, Blackwards, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded The Devil <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers' debut Holy Intellect. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only [...] "the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world" [...] but also [...] "the most politically ambitious. Not even in the heyday of [...] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous '60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music." [...] Their music on the album inspired leftist and Afrocentric ideals among rap listeners who were previously exposed to more materialist themes in the music. Reeves said it introduced black consciousness to the [...] "hip-hop youth" [...] of the [...] "post-black power generation", [...] "as leather African medallions made popular by rappers like P.E. replaced thick gold chains as the ultimate fashion statement ... P.E.'s million seller sat at the front of a full-blown black pride resurgence within rap".|$|E

But, Miss Anderson, I--I didn't mean to be. I didn't think you saw me--at all. I don't know what <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> that. <b>It</b> never happened before. I beg your pardon." ...|$|R

6000|$|It was a truly {{striking}} cavalcade, {{the sight}} of which under any other circumstances would have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> laugh. Nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> fail in its effect, for even the silent Mazitu people through whom we wended our way, were moved to something like enthusiasm. [...] "Home, Sweet Home" [...] they evidently thought heavenly, though perhaps the two donkeys attracted them most, especially when these brayed.|$|R
2500|$|Their second album, <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It,</b> {{released}} in 2000, was more melodic and resembled the Gothenburg style (with bands such as At the Gates, etc.) more than old-school thrash metal {{that was used}} on The Haunted. It is originally called <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It,</b> but it is meant for the band name {{to be included in}} the title. [...] "The Haunted Made Me Do It" [...] topped CMJ Loud Rock Radio Chart in four weeks, and won a Swedish Grammy for Best Hard Rock Album. The album was followed by European tours with Entombed and Nile, The Crown in U.K., and In Flames in Japan. The Haunted played on festivals such as 2000 Decibel, Hultsfred (both in Sweden), Graspop (Belgium), and Wacken Open Air (Germany). The band subsequently released their first live album - Live Rounds in Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|Ice Cube {{collaborated with}} Tech N9ne on the song [...] "Blackboy" [...] that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album Killer. The eighth Ice Cube studio LP, titled Raw Footage, was {{released}} on August 19, 2008, and featured the singles Gangsta Rap <b>Made</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> and Do Ya Thang. Ice Cube appeared on a song by rapper The Game titled [...] "State of Emergency" [...] off The Game's album, L.A.X. In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and returned to perform at the 2011 festival.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that the punch was thrown {{by a member of}} Raekwon's entourage named Hanz. Hanz stated that he [...] "did not appreciate Budden speaking disrespectfully about Inspectah Deck and Method Man in interviews over the summer." [...] He further commented [...] "I punched him in the face because he was outta line. I look at him like, not the school yard bully, but the motherfucker that's always picking on a motherfucker that don't fuck with nobody. To say something about a nigga like Meth is crazy, Meth don't fuck with nobody. I'm not gonna sit here and say Rae <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> that was a spontaneous decision on my own. I'm glad I did it, 'cause he got a big mouth...It wasn't actually planned, he could have actually changed that whole situation as it unfolded, as it went on".|$|E
5000|$|Boyd marries Janae Timmins (Eliza Taylor-Cotter), but {{he later}} has {{an affair with}} fellow {{character}} Glenn Forrest (Cleopatra Coleman), which ruins his relationship with Janae. Behind the scenes Marsh was furious over the storyline and criticised the producers and branded it as [...] "stupid", also stating: [...] "I absolutely hated my character at the end. I couldn't believe what they <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do,</b> I thought <b>it</b> was a stupid storyline and I copped a lot of flack over it. I was really upset." [...] He also felt that after the storyline {{it was the right}} time for Boyd to leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolcino, {{come and}} see your daddy!" [...] There was {{something}} in the way he stood still and waited that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> think he <b>did</b> <b>it</b> for a purpose. Mrs. Ambient had her arm round the child's waist, and he was leaning against her knee; but though {{he looked up at the}} sound of his father's voice, she gave no sign of releasing him. A lady, apparently a neighbor, was seated near her, and before them was a garden-table, on which a tea-service had been placed.|$|R
5000|$|At age 13, Feild began {{practicing}} riding bareback broncs. [...] His {{goal was}} to become the best bareback rider in the world. [...] Feild was a scrawny child, however. His father was afraid he would be hurt, and refused {{to allow him to}} practice or compete regularly until he turned 17. The limited opportunities to practice whetted Feild's appetite. He said that [...] "starting at that age <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> more and crave it more. It <b>made</b> <b>me</b> put my mind to it instead of getting out there and just doing it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{surveillance}} videotape made on February 5, 2003, {{of a private}} meeting in Garson's , Siminovsky asked Garson if he would award the couple’s home to his client, Avraham Levi. Garson responded: [...] "I’ll award him exclusive use". He gave Siminovsky detailed instructions {{as to how to}} argue the Levi divorce case before him. He assured Siminovsky that if he followed Garson's instructions: [...] "The worst possible scenario is a win.... You're in good shape. You're a winner either way. And your schmuck [...] doesn't deserve it." [...] Garson dictated to Siminovsky the exact language the lawyer should use in a memo to Garson. He urged him to charge his client extra for the memo, saying: [...] "I am telling you, charge for it. This is extra; this was not contemplated; the judge <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it....</b> Squeeze the guy." [...] Referring to the estranged wife (Sigal Levi), the judge said: [...] "She's fucked." ...|$|E
2500|$|During August 2010, Blasko {{recorded}} an album, Seeker Lover Keeper, in New York for {{the group}} {{of the same name}} with fellow founding members and Australian singer-songwriters, Sally Seltmann and Holly Throsby. The group's debut album peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Albums Charts in June 2011, Blasko's highest chart entry. The trio embarked on a national tour to promote the album in June and July that year. Of the album's 12 tracks each of the artists had an equal share of four tracks, however Blasko takes lead vocal on five tracks including [...] "Rely on Me" [...] written by Throsby, Blasko described [...] "I was reluctant to do it but the girls kept asking me. I couldn't hear myself singing that one until Holly <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I enjoyed it because the song has real generosity to it". Greenberg felt Blasko's lead vocals were on the [...] "most memorable tracks, using her signature form of lilting power". By year's end all three artists had returned to their respective solo careers.|$|E

5000|$|During the Black Hills Expedition, several wagons became {{stuck at}} a bank. Custer asked whose fault the delay was and a scout named Charley Reynolds blamed Bloody Knife for the incident. Custer drew his {{revolver}} and fired {{shots in the}} two scouts' direction. Bloody Knife and Reynolds hid behind some trees. Bloody Knife then told Custer, [...] "It {{is not a good}} thing you have done to me; if I had been possessed of madness too, you would not see another day." [...] Custer replied, [...] "My brother, it was the madness of the moment that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> this, but <b>it</b> is now gone. Let us shake hands and be friends again." [...] Bloody Knife agreed and shook Custer's hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been away, dear heart, {{hard at work}} {{in another}} city, larger and wickeder than this. I tried to get work here, that I might be near you; but that cruel Cotton always found me out; and I was so afraid I should get desperate that I went away where I was not known. There it came into my mind to do for others more wretched than I what you had <b>done</b> for <b>me.</b> God put the thought into my heart, and He helped me in my work, for it has prospered wonderfully. All this year I have been busy with it, and almost happy; for I felt that your love <b>made</b> <b>me</b> strong to <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and that, in time, I might grow {{good enough to be}} your friend." ...|$|R
5000|$|Young Storytellers' annual fundraiser, [...] "The Biggest Show," [...] invites {{actors and}} comedians from film and {{television}} to perform their student's screenplays. In 2014, student screenplays were performed by Rob Corddry, Max Greenfield, John Cho, Alison Brie, Jillian Bell and Stephanie Beatriz. Corddry stated, [...] "program is kind of mythical {{in this world that}} I run in. You can't have a bad time. There's no pressure. You can't fail. It's pretty much everything you want as an actor. It's pretty much everything I've been looking for my whole life". In 2016, when asked about [...] "The Biggest Show," [...] Seth Rogen said: “One of the main things that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> was to encourage these kids to continue to do this stuff. I was not the type of person that would persevere through discouragement at that age.” ...|$|R

But it was only anxiety for Elspeth that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Dear one, be angry with me {{as often as you}} choose, and whether I deserve it or not; but don't go away from me; never send me from you again. Anything but that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Baldwin [4] {{is boring}} me {{to present their}} King's Bench petition. I {{presented}} Cartwright's last year; and Stanhope and I stood against the whole House, and mouthed it valiantly--and had some fun and a little abuse for our opposition. But [...] "I am not i' th' vein" [...] [5] for this business. Now, had----been here, she would have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There is a woman, who, amid all her fascination, always urged a man to usefulness or glory. Had she remained, she had been my tutelar genius.|$|E
5000|$|Elle {{decides to}} {{convince}} Glenn {{to remain in}} Erinsborough to steal Boyd from Janae. Marsh explained that Elle hates Janae and uses Glenn to enact her revenge against the Hoylands. But as the actor noted, Janae is characterised as a fiery female, a trait shared with all her family members. Writers used her [...] "Timmins spirit" [...] to spur Janae on into fighting mode to save her marriage. Marsh added [...] "Janae's {{not the kind of}} girl to take things lying down, so she goes into battle." [...] Janae slaps Glenn for sleeping with her husband. But the situation develops into a [...] "very nasty" [...] predicament when Glenn is run over and suspision is cast over Janae believing she caused the accident. Behind the scenes Marsh was furious with Boyd's infidelity and criticised the producers for their [...] "stupid" [...] storyline. He told a reporter [...] "I absolutely hated my character at the end. I couldn't believe what they <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do,</b> I thought <b>it</b> was a stupid storyline and I copped a lot of flack over it. I was really upset." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{story is}} simply this," [...] said the painter after some time. [...] "Two months ago I {{went to a}} crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor artists have to show {{ourselves}} in society from time to time, just to remind the public {{that we are not}} savages. With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stockbroker, can gain a reputation for being civilised. Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge over-dressed dowagers and tedious Academicians, I suddenly became conscious that someone was looking at me. I turned halfway round, and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had {{come face to face with}} someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed <b>it</b> to <b>do</b> so, <b>it</b> would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then---- but I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid, and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> so; <b>it</b> was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hanna {{was born}} November 12, 1968, in Portland, Oregon. At age four, she moved {{with her family}} to Calverton, Maryland; as Hanna's father changed occupations, the family moved several more times. Hanna's parents divorced, and she {{returned}} to Portland where she graduated from Lincoln High School. Hanna first became interested in feminism around the age of nine, after her mother {{took her to a}} rally in Washington D.C. where feminist icon Gloria Steinem spoke. Though several years would pass before she became an outspoken feminist, with Hanna eventually referring to herself as a radical feminist, the event left an impression on her. In a 2000 interview with BUST magazine, Hanna recalled: [...] "My mom was a housewife, and wasn't somebody that people would think of as a feminist, and when Ms. magazine came out we were incredibly inspired by it. I used to cut pictures out of it and make posters that said 'Girls can do anything', and stuff like that, and my mom was inspired to work at a basement of a church doing anti-domestic violence work. Then she took me to the Solidarity Day thing, {{and it was the first}} time I had ever been in a big crowd of women yelling, and it really <b>made</b> <b>me</b> want to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> forever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How strange! How {{perfectly}} impossible it all seems! Why, {{last night}} I was taking supper at Kinney's logging-camp, and hating you at every mouthful {{with all my}} might. Everything seemed against me, and I was feeling ugly, and flirting like mad with a fool from Montreal: she had come out there from Portland for a frolic with the owners' party. You <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> Marcia!" [...] he cried jestingly. [...] "And remember that, {{if you want me}} to be good, you must be kind. The other thing seems to make me worse and worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I'd known you, Missy, we'd {{never have}} held up this homestead. White people all through, and you're a prairie daisy. What <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Well, I guess that's a long story, {{and some of}} it might scare you. A big man froze me off my land, and some one rebranded my few head of stock. Law! we don't count much on that; it's often the biggest rascals corral the offices, and we just laid for them with the rifle. They were too many for us--and {{this is the end of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "And you <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Never thanking them, or anything, and {{standing}} there like I don't know what, {{and leaving the}} talk all to me. And now, making me lose my temper again, when I wanted to be so nice to you. Well, it is no use trying, and from this on I won't. Clarence!" [...] She has opened the parcel addressed to herself and now stands transfixed with joy and wonder. [...] "See what the girls have given me! The very necklace I've been longing for at Planets', and denying myself for the last fortnight! Well, never will I say your sisters are mean again." ...|$|E

I have told you that I acted {{throughout}} from the best and kindliest motives in roasting you to Angela. It cut me to the quick to have to speak like that, and only the recollection of our lifelong friendship would have <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> And now you say you don't believe me and call me names for which I am not sure I couldn't have you up before a beak and jury and mulct you in very substantial damages. I should have to consult my solicitor, of course, but it would surprise me very much if an action did not lie. Be reasonable, Tuppy. Suggest another motive I could have had. Just one." ...|$|E
60|$|Then one day {{our eyes}} met: {{not in a}} fashionable restaurant, I may tell you, but in a {{discreet}} one situated {{on the slopes of}} Montmartre. I was there alone, sipping a cup of coffee after a frugal dinner. I had drifted in there chiefly because I had quite accidentally caught sight of M. le Marquis de Firmin-Latour walking arm-in-arm up the Rue Lepic with a lady who was both youthful and charming--a well-known dancer at the opera. Presently I saw him turn into that discreet little restaurant, where, in very truth, it was not likely that Mme. la Marquise would follow him. But I did. What <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I cannot say; but for some time now it had been my wish to make the personal acquaintance of M. de Firmin-Latour, and I lost no opportunity which might help me to attain this desire.|$|E

They only saw the young wolf stretched dead on the snow, and the same moment in burst Ebbo, and flung himself {{on the floor in}} a passion of weeping. Stimulated by the applause of his grandmother and of Matz, he had furiously pelted the poor animal with all missiles that came to hand, till a blow, either from him or Matz, had produced such a howl and struggle of agony, and then such terrible stillness, as had gone to the young Baron's very heart, a heart as soft as that of his father had been by nature. Indeed, his sobs were so piteous that his mother was relieved to hear only, [...] "The wolf! the poor wolf!" [...] and to find that he himself was unhurt; and she was scarcely satisfied of this when Dame Kunigunde came up also alarmed, and thus turned his grief to wrath. [...] "As if I would cry in that way for a bite!" [...] he said. [...] "Go, grandame; you <b>made</b> <b>me</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> the poor beast!" [...] with a fresh sob.|$|E
