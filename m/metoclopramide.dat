5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication <b>metoclopramide</b> or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|These {{symptoms}} may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, <b>metoclopramide</b> {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. <b>Metoclopramide</b> might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as <b>metoclopramide</b> are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), <b>metoclopramide,</b> ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting {{is due to}} gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea {{relieved}} by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. domperidone or <b>metoclopramide).</b> If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for <b>metoclopramide,</b> rectally for domperidone).|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including ondansetron {{appear to be}} effective in controlling postoperative nausea and vomiting. It is more effective than <b>metoclopramide,</b> and less sedating than cyclizine or droperidol.|$|E
25|$|Prolactin is {{available}} commercially {{for use in}} animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of prolactin in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, <b>metoclopramide,</b> haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, <b>metoclopramide,</b> and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation in humans.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} including granisetron {{appear to be}} effective in controlling post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if it is more or less effective than other agents such as droperidol, <b>metoclopramide,</b> ondansetron or cyclizine.|$|E
25|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} caused by tramadol {{is thought to}} be due to activation of the 5-HT3 receptor via increased serotonin levels. In accordance, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist <b>metoclopramide</b> can be used to treat tramadol-associated nausea {{and vomiting}}. Tramadol and desmetramadol themselves do not bind to the 5-HT3 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Motility is {{encouraged}} {{by the use of}} prokinetic drugs such as erythromycin, <b>metoclopramide,</b> bethanechol and lidocaine, as well as through vigorous walking, which has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on GI motility. Lidocaine is especially useful, as it not only encourages motility, but also has anti-inflammatory properties and may ameliorate some post-operative pain. <b>Metoclopramide</b> has been shown to reduce reflux and hospital stay, but does has excitatory effects on the central nervous system. Anti-inflammatory drugs are used to decrease inflammation of the GI tract, which is thought to be the underlying cause of the disease, as well as to help control any absorption of LPS in cases of endotoxemia since the substance decreases motility However, care must be taken when giving these drugs, as NSAIDs have been shown to alter intestinal motility.|$|E
25|$|Two women, each {{claiming}} to have suffered severe medical complications from a generic version of <b>metoclopramide,</b> lost their Supreme Court appeal on June 23, 2011. In a 5-4 ruling in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, in which {{the court held that}} generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator's label.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while {{a combination of}} an antacid and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may improve symptoms 60% (NNT=4). <b>Metoclopramide</b> (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or {{in combination with other}} treatments due to concerns around adverse effects. The benefit of the prokinetic mosapride is modest.|$|E
25|$|Many {{pharmacological}} treatments {{which are}} effective for nausea and vomiting in some medical conditions {{may not be}} effective for motion sickness. For example, <b>metoclopramide</b> and prochlorperazine, although widely used for nausea, are ineffective for motion-sickness prevention and treatment. This {{is due to the}} physiology of the CNS vomiting centre and its inputs from the chemoreceptor trigger zone versus the inner ear. Sedating anti-histamine medications such as promethazine work quite well for motion sickness, although they can cause significant drowsiness.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron may be beneficial, however, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} regarding an association with cleft palate, {{and there is little}} high-quality data. <b>Metoclopramide</b> is also used and relatively well tolerated. Evidence for the use of corticosteroids is weak; {{there is some evidence that}} corticosteroid use in pregnant women may slightly increase the risk of oral facial clefts in the infant and may suppress fetal adrenal activity. However, hydrocortisone and prednisolone are inactivated in the placenta and may be used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum after 12 weeks.|$|E
25|$|Abortive therapies for {{migraine}}s may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or {{may require}} stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first {{be treated with}} acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemitic such as <b>metoclopramide</b> (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication which mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through a needle in the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.|$|E
25|$|For barium meal or barium follow-through examinations, a 6-hour {{period of}} fasting is {{observed}} {{prior to the}} studies. Barium is administered orally, sometimes mixed with diatrizoic acid to reduce transit time in the bowel. <b>Metoclopramide</b> is sometimes also added to the mixture to enhance gastric emptying. X-ray images are then taken in a supine position at intervals of 20–30 minutes. Real-time fluoroscopy is used to assess bowel motility. The radiologist may press or palpate the abdomen during images to separate intestinal loops. The total time necessary for the test depends on the speed of bowel motility or transit time and may vary between 1 and 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{gastrointestinal}} complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation, but also include elevated liver function tests, diarrhea, acute pancreatitis, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and, rarely, superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; {{the most common}} symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using <b>metoclopramide</b> to increase emptying of food from the stomach. Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{examples}} include levodopa (when {{used in the}} long term, as in Parkinson's disease), fluoxetine, <b>metoclopramide,</b> lithium, cocaine, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluvoxamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylphenidate (used in attention deficit hyperactive disorder), and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and similar gamma-aminobutyric acid-inducing analogues such as phenibut. Bruxism can also be exacerbated by excessive consumption of caffeine, as in coffee, tea or chocolate. Bruxism has also been reported to occur commonly comorbid with drug addiction. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) {{has been reported to}} be associated with bruxism, which occurs immediately after taking the drug and for several days afterwards. Tooth wear in people who take ecstasy is also frequently much more severe than in people with bruxism not associated with ecstasy.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and <b>metoclopramide.</b> Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg’s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, <b>metoclopramide,</b> prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg’s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|E
500|$|Both {{surgery and}} {{advanced}} inoperable tumors {{often lead to}} digestive system disorders {{from a lack of}} the exocrine products of the pancreas (exocrine insufficiency). [...] These can be treated by taking pancreatin which contains manufactured pancreatic enzymes, and is best taken with food. [...] Difficulty in emptying the stomach (delayed gastric emptying) is common and can be a serious problem, involving hospitalization. Treatment may involve a variety of approaches, including draining the stomach by nasogastric aspiration and drugs called proton-pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists, which both reduce production of gastric acid. Medications like <b>metoclopramide</b> {{can also be used to}} clear stomach contents.|$|E
500|$|This fungus {{has been}} cited as being {{responsible}} for 10% of all mushroom poisonings in Europe. For example, 70 people required hospital treatment in Geneva alone in 1983, and the fungus accounted for 33 of 145 cases of mushroom poisoning in a five-year period at a single hospital in Parma. Poisoning {{is said to be}} mainly gastrointestinal in nature; symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting and headache occur 30minutes to 2hours after consumption and last for up to 48hours. Acute liver toxicity and psychiatric symptoms like mood disturbance or delirium may occur. Rarely, symptoms of depression may last for months. At least one source reports there have been fatalities in adults and children. Hospital treatment of poisoning by this mushroom is usually supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen [...] abdominal cramps and activated charcoal may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. Intravenous fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. <b>Metoclopramide</b> may be used in cases of recurrent vomiting once gastric contents are emptied. The identity of the toxin(s) is unknown, but chemical analysis has established that there are alkaloids present in the mushroom.|$|E
2500|$|Pro-motility agents: <b>metoclopramide,</b> lidocaine, bethanechol, and {{erythromycin}} {{are used}} in cases of ileus.|$|E
2500|$|Though this {{medication}} possesses similar {{effects to}} other typical and atypical antipsychotics, {{it does not}} possess an affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In many respects, this medication can be useful as an [...] "acetylcholine release-promoter" [...] similar to gastrointestinal drugs such as <b>metoclopramide</b> and cisapride.|$|E
2500|$|Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. [...] Classical drug {{causes of}} methemoglobinaemia include {{antibiotics}} (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and dapsone), local anesthetics (especially articaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine), and aniline dyes, <b>metoclopramide,</b> rasburicase, [...] chlorates, and bromates. Ingestion of compounds containing nitrates (such as the patina chemical bismuth nitrate) {{can also cause}} methemoglobinemia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} the 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonists began in 1957, when J.H. Gaddum and Zuleika P. Picarelli at the University of Edinburgh proposed the existence of two serotonin receptor subtypes, the M and D receptors (thus named because their function could be blocked by morphine and dibenzyline respectively), in a landmark paper. The 5-HT3 receptor was later found to correspond to the M receptor. In the 1970s, John Fozard found that <b>metoclopramide</b> and cocaine were weak antagonists at the 5-HT3 (5-HT-M) receptor. Fozard and Maurice Gittos later synthesized MDL 72222, the first potent and truly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AND DOLASETRON MESILATE | journal = [...] EJHP journal| [...] issue = 6 | pages = 10–11 | date = October 1996 | url = http://www.eahp.eu/EJHP/EJHP-Practice/Issue-6-1996/Science/DISCOVERY-OF-5-HT3-RECEPTOR-ANTAGONISTS-AND-DOLASETRON-MESILATE }} The antiemetic effects of <b>metoclopramide</b> {{were found to be}} partially because of its serotonin antagonism.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 {{a program}} of [...] "Intermediate Care Upskilling" [...] was {{introduced}} by St John (initially in the Auckland District [...] ) to equip selected ICOs with adrenaline, morphine, naloxone and (at the time) <b>metoclopramide.</b> [...] This distinct training package {{was not part of}} any formal qualification. [...] St John also merged the two Post-Proficiency modules back into one education program at some point during this time so that an officer became qualified in both portions of Intermediate Aid concurrently. [...] Wellington Free Ambulance chose to adhere to the original Post-Proficiency module design thus retaining two distinct practice levels (cardiac and IV/cardiac). [...] They also developed their own upskilling program known as [...] "advanced life support" [...] consisting of two modules, A and B; module A contained cardiac arrest drugs (at the time adrenaline, atropine and lignocaine) while Module B provided intravenous pain relief along with naloxone and <b>metoclopramide.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Treatment ideally also {{consists}} of crystalloid IV fluids and/or colloids (e.g., Hetastarch), antinausea injections (antiemetics) such as maropitant, <b>metoclopramide,</b> dolasetron, ondansetron and prochlorperazine, and broad-spectrum antibiotic injections such as cefazolin/enrofloxacin, ampicillin/enrofloxacin, [...] metronidazole, timentin, or enrofloxacin. IV fluids are administered and antinausea and antibiotic injections are given subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The fluids are typically {{a mix of}} a sterile, balanced electrolyte solution, with an appropriate amount of B-complex vitamins, dextrose and potassium chloride. Analgesic medications {{can be used to}} counteract the intestinal discomfort caused by frequent bouts of diarrhea; however, the use of opioid analgesics can result in secondary ileus and decreased motility.|$|E
2500|$|Certain prokinetic {{drugs such}} as cisapride, {{renzapride}} and <b>metoclopramide,</b> although not 5-HT3 antagonists proper, possess some weak antagonist effect at the 5-HT3 receptor. Galanolactone, a diterpenoid found in ginger, is a 5-HT3 antagonist and is believed to at least partially mediate the anti-emetic activity of this plant. Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant with 5-HT3 antagonist effects and strong anti-emetic properties. [...] Studies show mirtazapine as equally effective in treating chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting as standard treatments; it is also cheaper and has fewer side effects than typical anti-emetics, and its antidepressant qualities may be an added benefit for cancer populations. [...] Mirtazapine has also {{been used in the}} treatment of the motility disorder gastroparesis due to its anti-emetic effects. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic with anti-emetic properties similar to those of mirtazapine, also shows promise in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{treatment}} is attempted first in many cases. In some cases, emergency surgery is necessary upon presentation. A six-week trial of medical {{treatment is}} recommended in pediatric cases. The goal of medical treatment for SMA Syndrome is resolution of underlying conditions and weight gain. Medical treatment may involve nasogastric tube placement for duodenal and gastric decompression, mobilization into the prone or left lateral decubitus position, the reversal or {{removal of the}} precipitating factor with proper nutrition and replacement of fluid and electrolytes, either by surgically inserted jejunal feeding tube, nasogastric intubation, or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pro-motility agents such as <b>metoclopramide</b> may also be beneficial. [...] Symptoms may improve after restoration of weight, except when reversed peristalsis persists, or if regained fat refuses to accumulate within the mesenteric angle. Most patients seem to benefit from nutritional support with hyperalimentation irrespective of disease history.|$|E
50|$|Bromopride is a {{substituted}} benzamide, {{closely related}} to <b>metoclopramide.</b> It is identical to <b>metoclopramide</b> except {{for the presence of}} a bromine atom where <b>metoclopramide</b> has a chlorine substituent.|$|E
50|$|Paracetamol (also {{known as}} acetaminophen), either {{alone or in}} {{combination}} with <b>metoclopramide,</b> is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects. <b>Metoclopramide</b> is also effective by itself. In pregnancy, paracetamol and <b>metoclopramide</b> are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metoclopramide</b> {{has long}} been used in all stages of {{pregnancy}} with no evidence of harm to the mother or unborn baby. In the USA, it has been assigned to pregnancy category B by the US FDA.A large cohort study of babies born to Israeli women exposed to <b>metoclopramide</b> during pregnancy {{found no evidence that}} the drug increases the risk of congenital malformations, low birth weight, preterm birth, or perinatal mortality. A large cohort study in Denmark found, in addition, no association between <b>metoclopramide</b> exposure and miscarriage. <b>Metoclopramide</b> is excreted into milk.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{treated with}} <b>metoclopramide</b> {{are at risk}} for serious side effects, some of which are permanent, such as tardive dyskinesia, hence {{limiting}} the use of <b>metoclopramide</b> to no more than 12 weeks.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the akathisia {{effects of}} <b>metoclopramide</b> are {{directly}} related to the infusion rate when the drug is administered intravenously. Side effects were usually seen in the first 15 min after the dose of <b>metoclopramide.</b>|$|E
