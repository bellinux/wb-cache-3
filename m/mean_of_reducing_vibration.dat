40|$|The {{design of}} a model {{helicopter}} rotor blade incorporating a swept tip is described. The swept tip is chosen to provide a coupling between the lift at the tip and the blade twist thus achieving a variation of blade tvist both with azimuth and with forward speed. The design is the first stop in an investigation of aeroelastic tailoring as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> helicopter <b>vibration</b> and increasing rotor performance. The first prototype blade encountered stability problems and further designs were evaluated using a new modes/stability computer program developed within RAE. Comparisons are made between the stresses measured on a second stable swept tip blade and a dynamically similar rectangular blade. The results show that a beneficial twisting of the swept tip blade is achieved which enhances rotor perforawtnee and reduces the flatvise bending and torsional moments. Comparisons are made between the experimental results and those predicted by the RAE/VOL coupled modes analysis. The predictions are. reasonably accurate for the flatwise moments but a more representative model of the hub is needed to produce acceptable predictions of the torsional moments. The {{design of a}} further set of blades is discussed, the aim being to investigate the effects of introducing a strong coupling between the flap and torsion notions of the blade by sweeping back the shear centre. An analysis of-the results shows that there are large gains in blade stability with no severe adverse effects on blade loads. A theoretical investigation has been undertaken to observe the effects of tip sweep {{on the performance of}} a full size rotor. The results show that aft tip sweep can reduce control loads and rotor power for a rotor with a cambered aerofoil, section...|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic layers {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as an effective <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> the structural <b>vibrations</b> that can generate undesirably high pressure levels in a coupled acoustic cavity. Constraining the viscoelastic layer increases {{the effectiveness of the}} viscoelastic layer by adding transverse shear as a dissipation mechanism in the system. It is proposed in this dissertation to replace the traditionally homogeneous core of a constrained damping layer treatment by a non-homogeneous viscoelastic material in order to further improve the effectiveness of the treatment. 	A finite element model is developed to simulate the vibrations of plates treated with a non-homogeneous constrained layer treatment using Reissner-Mindlin plate theory. The predictions of the model are validated against the predictions of a commercially available finite element package (NASTRAN). The model of the plate/constraining layer treatment is then coupled with a finite element model of a coupled acoustic cavity. The integrated model is exercised to consider different material combinations and geometric layouts of the non-homogeneous damping treatment in order to determine general guidelines for producing the largest reduction in sound pressure levels inside an acoustic cavity that is being driven by a flexible boundary. 	The predictions of the integrated finite element model are validated through experimental and numerical work. Close agreements are found between theoretical predictions and experimental results. Generally, it is found that damping treatments with stiffer outer perimeters and softer cores are more effective in attenuating the sound pressure levels in the acoustic cavity than other configurations of the non-homogeneous treatment...|$|R
40|$|Compressor design {{programs}} {{are becoming more}} reliant on computational tools to predict and optimize aerodynamic and aeromechanical behavior within a compressor. Recent trends in compressor development continue to push for more efficient, lighter weight, and higher performance machines. To meet these demands, designers must better understand the complex nature of the inherently unsteady flow physics inside of a compressor. As physical testing can be costly and time prohibitive, CFD and other computational tools have become the workhorse during design programs. ^ The objectives of this research were to investigate the aerodynamic and aeromechanical behavior of the Purdue multistage compressor, as well as analyze novel concepts for reducing rotor resonant responses in compressors. Advanced computational tools were utilized to allow an in-depth analysis of the flow physics and structural characteristics of the Purdue compressor, and complement to existing experimental datasets. ^ To analyze the aerodynamic behavior of the compressor a Rolls-Royce CFD code, developed specifically for multistage turbomachinery flows, was utilized. Steady-state computations were performed using the RANS solver on a single-passage mesh. Facility specific boundary conditions were applied to the model, increasing the model fidelity and overall accuracy of the predictions. Detailed investigations into the overall compressor performance, stage performance, and individual blade row performance were completed. Additionally, separation patterns on stator vanes at different loading conditions were investigated by plotting pathlines near the stator suction surfaces. Stator cavity leakage flows were determined to influence the size and extent of stator hub separations. ^ In addition to the aerodynamic analysis, a Rolls-Royce aeroelastic CFD solver was utilized to predict the forced response behavior of Rotor 2, operating at the 1 T mode crossing of the Campbell Diagram. This computational tool couples aerodynamic predictions with structural models to determine maximum Rotor 2 vibration amplitudes excited by both vortical and potential disturbances. A multi-bladerow, full-annulus unsteady simulation was performed to capture the aerodynamic forcing functions and understand the influence of bladerow interactions on these flow disturbances. The strength and frequency content of the S 1 vortical field and S 2 potential field were examined to quantify the aerodynamic forces exciting resonant vibrations. Detailed comparisons were made to experimental datasets acquired on the Purdue compressor which characterize the forced response behavior at the 1 T mode crossing. ^ Lastly, stator asymmetry was examined as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> forced response <b>vibration</b> amplitudes. For this study, a new Stator 1 ring was designed with a reduced vane count, creating the ability to isolate the relative contribution of the S 1 wakes on R 2 vibrational amplitudes. A second Stator 1 ring was then designed with asymmetric vane spacing such that two stator half-sectors of different vane counts were joined {{together to form a}} full stator ring. By joining two stator half-sectors with different vane counts, the energy of the wakes is spread into additional frequencies, thereby reducing the overall amplitudes. The aeroelastic CFD solver was again used to perform steady-state and unsteady simulations, capturing the effect of the stator asymmetry on resonant vibrational amplitudes. The resulting blade deflection amplitudes are presented and discussed in detail. ...|$|R

40|$|Polynomial {{profiles}} {{can be used}} as reference {{commands to}} limit induced vibration in flexible systems. Due to their ease of design and low-pass filtering effects, polynomial profiles are often found in cam-follower systems. Polynomial profiles have also been used as smooth reference commands for automated machines. How-ever, despite extensive work to develop and improve such profiles, inherent tradeoffs still exist between induced vibration, rise time, and ease of design. Input shaping is an alternative method for generating motion commands that <b>reduce</b> residual <b>vibration.</b> This paper compares polynomial profiles to input-shaped commands for the application <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>vibration</b> in flexible systems. Anal-yses using Laplace transforms reveal that input shapers suppress vibration at regularly spaced frequencies. However, polynomial profiles do not share this property. Simulations and experimental results show that input shaping improves rise time and <b>reduces</b> re-sidual <b>vibration</b> in comparison to polynomial profiles. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4007797]...|$|R
