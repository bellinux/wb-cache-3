30|$|Even {{though we}} {{captured}} the HDR stereo data, we only used them for our ground truth disparity calculation and used HDR tone-mapped data in our proposed framework. The first reason for using tone-mapped images (not the original HDR image pairs) {{is described in}} the previous paragraph regarding backward compatibility. The second reason is, although our HDR stereo matching approach outperforms the tone-mapped and LDR approaches, it is not fully automatic. We used a <b>manual</b> in-painting post <b>processing</b> to fill-in some of {{the holes in the}} disparity maps as shown in Fig. 2. <b>Manual</b> post <b>processing</b> and in-painting of disparity maps for the purpose of ground truth generation (evaluation) is a common approach [9, 10] but usually not a scalable or real-time method. We used the original HDR disparity maps just as a reference for our evaluation method for the same mentioned reasons. The <b>manual</b> post <b>processing</b> method will be discussed in more detail in Section 5.3.|$|R
40|$|Many {{recent studies}} have used long bone {{cross-sectional}} geometric properties in various comparative analyses. Methods have been described for reconstructing diaphyseal cross sections from external molds and biplanar radiographs that produce accurate results (within 5 % of true values on average). The <b>manual</b> image <b>processing</b> required, however, is both time and labor intensive. A new freely available program developed here for the computational freeware, R, automates much of the process. This study compares cross-sectional properties calculated using the new R program to those from peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) and the original manual method. We find that the R program works aswell as the original <b>manual</b> image <b>processing</b> for most cross sections eliminates the chance for entry errors at several steps and greatly speeds up data collection...|$|R

5000|$|The BNC corpus {{has been}} tagged for {{grammatical}} information (part of speech). The tagging system, named CLAWS, went through improvements to yield the latest CLAWS4 system, {{which is used}} for tagging the BNC. CLAWS1 {{was based on a}} hidden Markov model and, when employed in automatic tagging, managed to successfully tag 96% to 97% of each text analyzed. CLAWS1 was upgraded to CLAWS2 by removing the need for <b>manual</b> <b>processing</b> to prepare the texts for automatic tagging. The latest version, CLAWS4, includes improvements such as more powerful word-sense disambiguation (WSD) abilities, and the ability to deal with variation in orthography and markup language. Later work on the tagging system looked at increasing the success rates in automatic tagging and reducing the work needed for <b>manual</b> <b>processing,</b> while maintaining effectiveness and efficiency by introducing software to replace some of the manual work. Subsequently, a new program called the [...] "Template Tagger" [...] was introduced for a corrective function. Tags indicating ambiguity were later added. Manual tagging is still necessary, as CLAWS4 is still unable to deal with foreign words.|$|E
