This {{has been shown}} through structural studies (Classen et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2005) and biochemical studies performed by the Lindsley group.|$|E
40|$|The {{antitumor}} drug <b>mitindomide</b> (NSC 284356) {{was shown}} to inhibit the decatenation activity of human and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) topoisomerase II [DNA topoisomerase (ATP-hy-drolyzing), EC 5. 99. 1. 1]. <b>Mitindomide</b> did not induce the forma-tion of topoisomerase II-DNA covalent cleavable complexes in CHO cells. These results taken together indicate that mitindo-mide is a catalytic/noncleavable complex-forming-type inhibi-tor of topoisomerase II. The growth inhibitory effects of mitin-domide and dexrazoxane toward a sensitive parent CHO cell line and the dexrazoxane-resistant DZR cell line, which is highly (500 -fold) resistant to the bisdioxopiperazine dexrazoxane, were measured. The DZR cell line {{was shown to}} be 30 -fold cross-resistant to <b>mitindomide.</b> <b>Mitindomide,</b> like dexrazoxane, was shown to inhibit cleavable complex formation by the to-poisomerase II poison etoposide. The attenuated inhibition o...|$|E
