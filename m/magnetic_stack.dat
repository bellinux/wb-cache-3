The excitation of these magnetothermionic oscillations follow the scenario either of “soft” of “hard” instability: in the latter case oscillations arise if the initial perturbation is large enough.

In particular, exchange-coupled hard/soft magnetic bilayers are <b>magnetic</b> <b>stacks</b> combining a hard magnetic layer with high coercive field and a softer one with lower coercivity.

In 2005, a particular type of exchange-coupled hard/soft bilayers began to be developed, where the layers have perpendicular anisotropies [2, 3]. This appears to be a promising candidate system both for magnetic recording, because it reduces the required writing field and allows tuning the system anisotropy [4, 5], and for spin transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM) and spin-torque oscillators (STO) devices, through the possibility of tuning the magnetization tilt angle [6].|$|R

By keeping the same <b>magnetic</b> <b>stack,</b> but by tuning a device's shape and bias conditions, the spin torque can be engineered to build a variety of advanced magnetic nanodevices.

40|$|The {{combination}} of specular reflection and off-specular scattering with polarized neutrons gives a unique {{detailed information on}} the lateral and transverse spin-configuration of a <b>magnetic</b> multilayer <b>stack.</b> We present the first direct experimental observation of a phenomenon predicted theoretically for antiferromagnetically coupled multilayers: the twisted ground-state configuration in an external magnetic field. This twisted configuration arises due to the reduced symmetry of magnetic moments of the end layers having only one neighbor. This fact can be established directly via the qualitative analysis of the line shape of the superstructure peaks on the specular line and the related off-specular Bragg sheet. Additional quantitative evaluation of both specular reflection and off-specular scattering allows one to deduce the layer-by-layer spin configuration through the multilayer stack, as well as within {{the plane of the}} layer. The presence of spin-flip off-specular scattering means that the layer magnetization is laterally not homogeneous but is decomposed into a set of domains. The distribution of magnetic moments within each domain, the domains size and their distributions are obtained. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Keeping the same oxide volume fraction and decreasing the magnetic grain size does not further increase the amount of SFs much; however, the value further decreases. This is likely due to the larger volume content of the possible presence of a deadlayer in the outermost shell of the smaller magnetic grains.

Results: The method exploits Markov random fields in order to implement a 3 D maximum a posteriori estimator of the image. Due to the local nature of the considered model, the algorithm is able do adapt the smoothing intensity to the local characteristics of the images by analyzing the 3 D neighborhood of each voxel. The effect is a combination of details preservation and noise reduction. The algorithm has been compared to other widely adopted denoising methodologies in MRI. Both simulated and real datasets have been considered for validation. Real datasets have been acquired at 1. 5 and 3 T.
