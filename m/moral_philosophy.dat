5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a <b>moral</b> <b>philosophy</b> and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} law practice, Tucker wrote {{distinctive}} monologues for various publications. His topics ranged widely from the conceptual to the technical—from slavery, suffrage, and morality to intracoastal navigation, wages, and banking. He {{was elected in}} 1816 to the Virginia House of Delegates for one term, and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825. From his youth until early middle age, Tucker's lofty social lifestyle was often profligate, and occasionally scandalous. Nevertheless, upon completion of his congressional term, his eloquent publications led Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to extend to him an appointment to serve as Professor of <b>Moral</b> <b>Philosophy</b> at the newly founded University of Virginia; he accepted and held that post until 1845.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze and discuss the {{differences}} and similarities between different <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies.</b> The project focuses on virtue ethics by Plato and Aristotle, deontological ethics by Immanuel Kant and consequentialism by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The basic premise of this project is the application of these to a specific case concerning a plane crash in the Andes in 1972 where a team of rugby players survived 72 days in the mountains by eating the people who died in the plane crash. In order to analyze, we have chosen to focus on an extreme case, to get a clear distinction of the <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies.</b> Our project is therefore not to determine which one of the <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> is the best, but to try to understand the differences and similarities, which will allow us to apply these <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> to specific cases. We conclude that there are big differences (albeit also similarities) between the <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> on how people should behave in ethics dilemmas. Because of this, it is difficult to only apply one of these ethics in ethical dilemmas, since these situations often are complex. It is therefore not suitable to only deal with one aspect of ethics. Through this analysis we will incorporate the method of wide reflective equilibrium as a way of dealing with such dilemmas. The project can furthermore be used to debate the <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> in any other cases - for example euthanasia...|$|R

At the invitation of the Chinese ambassador to France, he lectured on his teachings and practice methods to the embassy staff and others. From that time on, Li gave lectures in other major cities in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America. He has resided permanently in the United States since 1998. Falun Gong is now practiced in some 70 countries worldwide, and the teachings have been translated to over 40 languages.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate possible relationships between religiosity levels, personal <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies,</b> ethical perceptions and intentions of associate’s and bachelor’s degree students. Therefore, a survey was conducted on 189 business administration students chosen through convenience sampling at Balıkesir University. In order to measure the respondents’ levels of religiosity and personal <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies,</b> some scales with established validity and reliability in literature were used. Religiosity variable was analyzed both uni- and multi-dimensionally to make a deeper analysis with multidimensional scales. To assess perceived ethical problem and ethical intentions variable, one question for each was developed with scenario method. Structural Equation Model was used in data analysis. The proposed model was composed of seven hypotheses. Religiosity level was independent variable in four of them. In the structure where religiosity variable was used uni-dimensionally, three of the hypotheses were accepted while one of them was rejected. On the other hand, in multidimensional construct three of the hypotheses were partly accepted whereas one of them was rejected. Regarding the three hypotheses without religiosity variable, perceived ethical problem was detected to have a relationship with ethical intentions; nevertheless, no relationship was found between personal <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> (idealism and relativism) and perceived ethical problem...|$|R

5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body more representative of society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of <b>moral</b> <b>philosophy</b> at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. He would be a major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of <b>moral</b> <b>philosophy,</b> Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> namely deontology and teleology on ethical judgments. Deontology is evaluations made by referring to a set of predetermined rules and guidelines. On the other hand, teleology is evaluations made based on the consequences. Three hypothesized relationships were tested using a sample of 424 business students from 4 public institutions of higher learning in Malaysia.   Based on the results of regression analysis SPSS 16. 0, it can be concluded that both deontology and teleology were found to have a significant positive effect on ethical judgments. In addition, deontology was more likely to be used as opposed to teleology in the formation of ethical judgments. Hence, the findings of this study emphasize the importance of usage of these <b>moral</b> <b>philosophies</b> among future businessmen in enhancing ethical judgments. </p...|$|R

5|$|Parsons {{testified to}} a closed federal court that the <b>moral</b> <b>philosophy</b> of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, {{emphasizing}} {{his belief in}} individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Societya Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons {{a job with the}} Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.|$|E
5|$|Rico's {{choice is}} taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves {{with a sense}} of estrangement. He is {{assigned}} to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and <b>Moral</b> <b>Philosophy</b> in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated enough not to resign. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Eventually, after further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2009 who had begun training in that regiment.|$|E
