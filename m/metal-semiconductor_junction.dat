50|$|The surface-barrier {{transistor}} {{is a type}} of transistor {{developed by}} Philco in 1953 as an improvement to the alloy-junction transistor and the earlier point-contact transistor. Like the modern Schottky transistor, it offered much higher speed than earlier transistors and used <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> (instead of semiconductor-semiconductor junctions), but unlike the schottky transistor, both <b>junctions</b> were <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the above}} diagrams, {{contact between the}} metal wires and the {{semiconductor}} material also creates <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> called Schottky diodes. In a simplified ideal situation a semiconductor diode would never function, since it would be composed of several diodes connected back-to-front in series. But, in practice, surface impurities within {{the part of the}} semiconductor that touches the metal terminals will greatly reduce the width of those depletion layers {{to such an extent that}} the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> do not act as diodes. These non-rectifying junctions behave as ohmic contacts regardless of applied voltage polarity.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrical}} junction may {{be either a}} thermoelectricity junction, a <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> or a p-n junction (p-type semiconductor-n-type semiconductor junction). Junctions are either rectifying or non-rectifying. Non-rectifying junctions are called ohmic contacts. Electronic components employing rectifying junctions include p-n diodes, Schottky diodes and bipolar junction transistors.|$|E
50|$|Metal-semiconductor FETs (MESFETs) are JFETs {{in which}} the reverse biased p-n {{junction}} {{is replaced by a}} <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction.</b> These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (microwave frequencies; several GHz).|$|E
50|$|A Schottky diode is {{a single}} <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction,</b> used for its {{rectifying}} properties.Schottky diodes are often the most suitable kind of diode when a {{low forward voltage drop}} is desired, such as in a high efficiency DC power supply.Also, because of their majority-carrier conduction mechanism, Schottky diodes can achieve greater switching speeds than p-n junction diodes, making them appropriate to rectify high-frequency signals.|$|E
50|$|In {{semiconductor}} physics, {{the primary}} {{use of the}} electron affinity is not actually {{in the analysis of}} semiconductor-vacuum surfaces, but rather in heuristic electron affinity rules for estimating the band bending that occurs at the interface of two materials, in particular <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> and semiconductor heterojunctions.|$|R
50|$|Schottky <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> are {{featured}} in the successors to the 7400 TTL family of logic devices, the 74S, 74LS and 74ALS series, where they are employed as Baker clamps in parallel with the collector-base junctions of the bipolar transistors to prevent their saturation, thereby greatly reducing their turn-off delays.|$|R

A fabrication process for ultrathin film <b>metal–semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> with micrometre-sized mesas has been established. The cur-rent–voltage characteristics of the junctions were found at variance with the conventional thermionic emission theory often applied to explain the transport properties of Schottky contacts. This discrepancy is tentatively ascribed to the very high electric field in the ultrathin SrTi$_{ 0. 8 }$Nb$_{ 0. 2 }$O$_ 3 $ layer and its effect on carrier depletion and dielectric constant...|$|R
50|$|Transmission line {{measurement}} or Transfer Length Measurement is {{a technique}} used in semiconductor physics and engineering to determine the contact resistance between a metal and a semiconductor. The technique involves making a series of metal-semiconductor contacts separated by various distances. Probes are applied to pairs of contacts, and the resistance between them is measured by applying a voltage across the contacts and measuring the resulting current. The current flows from the first probe, into the metal contact, across the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction,</b> through the sheet of semiconductor, across the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> again (except {{this time in the}} other direction), into the second contact, and from there into the second probe and into the external circuit to be measured by an ammeter. The resistance measured is a linear combination (sum) of the contact resistance of the first contact, the contact resistance of the second contact, and the sheet resistance of the semiconductor in-between the contacts.|$|E
50|$|Here, e is the {{elementary}} positive charge, ε0 is the electric constant and εr is the relative permittivity {{of the second}} medium (=1 for vacuum). In {{the case of a}} <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction,</b> this is called a Schottky barrier; {{in the case of the}} metal-vacuum interface, this is sometimes called a Schottky-Nordheim barrier. In many contexts, h has to be taken equal to the local work function φ.|$|E
50|$|Whether a given <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> is an ohmic contact, or Schottky barrier, {{depends on}} the Schottky barrier height, ΦB, of the junction.For a {{sufficiently}} large Schottky barrier height, where ΦB is {{significantly higher than the}} thermal energy kT, the semiconductor is depleted near the metal and behaves as a Schottky barrier. For lower Schottky barrier heights, the semiconductor is not depleted and instead forms an ohmic contact to the metal.|$|E

Anderson in 1960.|$|R
50|$|<b>Metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> {{are crucial}} to the {{operation}} of all semiconductor devices. Usually an ohmic contact is desired, so that electrical charge can be conducted easily between the active region of a transistor and the external circuitry.Occasionally however a Schottky barrier is useful, as in Schottky diodes, Schottky transistors, and metal-semiconductor field effect transistors.|$|R
50|$|A <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> {{is formed}} between a metal and a semiconductor, {{creating}} a Schottky barrier (instead of a semiconductor-semiconductor junction as in conventional diodes). Typical metals used are molybdenum, platinum, chromium or tungsten, and certain silicides (e.g., palladium silicide and platinum silicide), whereas the semiconductor would typically be n-type silicon. The metal side {{acts as the}} anode, and n-type semiconductor acts as the cathode of the diode. This Schottky barrier results in both very fast switching and low forward voltage drop.|$|E
5000|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, a metal-semiconductor (M-S) junction {{is a type}} of junction {{in which}} a metal comes in close contact with a semiconductor material. It is the oldest practical semiconductor device. M-S junctions can either be rectifying or non-rectifying. The rectifying <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> forms a Schottky barrier, making a device known as a Schottky diode, while the non-rectifying junction is called an ohmic contact.

5000|$|Tersoff {{proposed}} a gap state model based on more familiar <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> where the conduction band offset {{is given by}} the difference in Schottky barrier height. This model includes a dipole layer at the interface between the two semiconductors which arises from electron tunneling from the conduction band of one material into the gap of the other (analogous to metal-induced gap states). This model agrees well with systems where both materials are closely lattice matched such as GaAs/AlGaAs.|$|R
40|$|A unifying simple {{model for}} clean, etched and {{reactive}} <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> is proposed. For clean junctions {{the possibility of}} some relaxation or a physisorbed layer at the interface is also considered. As regards the other two, the crucial parameter of the model {{is the amount of}} charge located in the semiconductor surface states that reacts either with the etching agent or the metal. The selfconsistent redistribution of charge at the junction and its density of states are analysed {{as a function of the}} interface conditions. Virtual states or dangling bond derived resonances (characteristics of non reactive interfaces) and new interface states induced by the chemical reactions are embodied in the theory. The interface density of states is used to obtain the charge neutrality level, a central concept to explain the behaviour of <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions.</b> The available data for ionic and covalent semiconductor non reactive junctions, and etched and reactive Si(111) junctions, are discussed within this context. Although in most cases only a qualitative comparison between the theory and experiment can be done, the model is shown to be helpful for improving our understanding of the different factors governing the junction behaviour...|$|R
50|$|The tip of {{the wire}} {{contacting}} {{the surface of the}} crystal formed a crude unstable point-contact <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction,</b> forming a Schottky barrier diode. This junction conducts electric current in only one direction and resists current flowing in the other direction. In a crystal radio, its function was to rectify the radio signal, converting it from alternating current to a pulsing direct current, to extract the audio signal (modulation) from the radio frequency carrier wave. The metal whisker is the anode, and the crystal is the cathode; current flows from the whisker into the crystal but not in the other direction.|$|E
5000|$|MESFET {{stands for}} metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor. It is {{quite similar to}} a JFET in {{construction}} and terminology. The difference is that instead of using a p-n junction for a gate, a Schottky (<b>metal-semiconductor)</b> <b>junction</b> is used. MESFETs are usually constructed in compound semiconductor technologies lacking high quality surface passivation such as GaAs, InP, or SiC, and are faster but more expensive than silicon-based JFETs or MOSFETs. Production MESFETs are operated up to approximately 45 GHz, and are commonly used for microwave frequency communications and radar. The first MESFETs were developed in 1966, {{and a year later}} their extremely high frequency RF microwave performance was demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of a}} metal rectifier is related to modern semiconductor rectifiers (Schottky diodes and p-n diodes), but somewhat more complex. Both selenium and copper oxide are semiconductors, in practice doped by impurities during manufacture. When they are deposited on metals, it would be expected that {{the result is a}} simple <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> and that the rectification would be a result of a Schottky barrier.However, this is not always the case: the scientist S. Poganski discovered in the 1940s that the best selenium rectifiers were in fact semiconductor-semiconductor junctions between selenium and a thin cadmium selenide layer, generated out of the cadmium-tin metal coating during processing.In any case the result {{is that there is a}} depletion region in the semiconductor, with a built-in electric field, and this provides the rectifying action.|$|E

40|$|A {{new theory}} of the {{interface}} capacitance at <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junctions</b> is presented. The diode capacitance is attributed to the modulation of the effective Schottky barrier height by interface charge.

5000|$|Capacitance-voltage {{profiling}} (or C-V profiling, sometimes CV profiling) is {{a technique}} for characterizing semiconductor materials and devices. The applied voltage is varied, and the capacitance is measured and plotted {{as a function of}} voltage. The technique uses a <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> (Schottky barrier) or a p-n junction or a MOSFET to create a depletion region, a region which is empty of conducting electrons and holes, but may contain ionized donors and electrically active defects or traps. The depletion region with its ionized charges inside behaves like a capacitor. By varying the voltage applied to the junction it is possible to vary the depletion width. The dependence of the depletion width upon the applied voltage provides information on the semiconductor's internal characteristics, such as its doping profile and electrically active defect densities., Measurements may be done at DC, or using both DC and a small-signal AC signal (the conductance method, [...] ), or using a large-signal transient voltage.|$|E
50|$|The first {{theory that}} {{predicted}} the correct direction of rectification of the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction</b> {{was given by}} Nevill Mott in 1939. He found the solution for both the diffusion and drift currents of the majority carriers through the semiconductor surface space charge layer which has been known since about 1948 as the Mott barrier. Walter H. Schottky and Spenke extended Mott's theory by including a donor ion whose density is spatially constant through the semiconductor surface layer. This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor space-charge layer under the metal {{is known as the}} Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939. Although it gives the correct direction of rectification, it has also been proven that the Mott theory and its Schottky-Davydov extension gives the wrong current limiting mechanism and wrong current-voltage formulae in silicon metal/semiconductor diode rectifiers. The correct theory was developed by Hans Bethe and reported by him in a M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Report dated November 23, 1942. In Bethe's theory, the current is limited by thermionic emission of electrons over the metal-semiconductor potential barrier. Thus, the appropriate name for the metal-semiconductor diode should be the Bethe diode, instead of the Schottky diode, since the Schottky theory does not predict the modern metal-semiconductor diode characteristics correctly.|$|E
5000|$|A unified {{explanation}} of these phenomena required {{a theory of}} solid-state physics which developed greatly {{in the first half}} of the 20th Century. In 1878 Edwin Herbert Hall demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the Hall effect. The discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. Karl Baedeker, by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. Johan Koenigsberger classified solid materials as metals, insulators and [...] "variable conductors" [...] in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term Halbleiter (semiconductor in modern meaning) in PhD thesis in 1910. Felix Bloch published a theory of the movement of electrons through atomic lattices in 1928. In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by Alan Herries Wilson and the concept of band gaps had been developed. Walter H. Schottky and Nevill Francis Mott developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>junction.</b> By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the p-n junction and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{receiver}} side, the optical signal is typically converted {{back to the}} electrical domain using a semiconductor photodetector.
