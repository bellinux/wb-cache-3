40|$|The era {{of visual}} {{communication}} influences the cognitive {{strategies of the}} individual. Education, too, must adjust to these changes, which raises questions {{regarding the use of}} visualisation in teaching. In the present study, we examine the impact of visualisation on the ability of high school students to <b>memorise</b> <b>text.</b> In the theoretical part of the research, we first clarify the concept of visualisation. We define the concept of active visualisation and visualisation as a means of acquiring and conveying knowledge, and we describe the different kinds of visualisation (appearance-based analogies and form-based analogies), specifically defining appearance-based schemata visualisations (where imagery is articulated in a typical culturally trained manner). In the empirical part of the research, we perform an experiment in which we evaluate the effects of visualisation on students’ ability to memorise a difficult written definition. According to the theoretical findings, we establish two hypotheses. In the first, we assume {{that the majority of the}} visualisations that students form will be appearance-based schemata visualisations. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that, in visualisation, people spontaneously use analogies based on imagery and schemas that are typical of their society. In the second hypothesis, we assume that active visualisation will contribute to the students’ ability to <b>memorise</b> <b>text</b> in a statistically significant way. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that the combination of verbal and visual experiences enhances cognitive learning. Both hypotheses were confirmed in the research. As our study only dealt with the impact of the most spontaneous type of appearance based schemata visualisations, we see further possibilities in researching the influence of visualisations that are more complex formally...|$|R

50|$|After Wang Chongyang's death, Zhou Botong {{travelled}} to Peach Blossom Island, where Huang Yaoshi lives, to warn Huang not {{to think}} about stealing the manual. Huang tricked Zhou into allowing his wife Feng Heng to have a glance at the manual. Feng had eidetic memory and she <b>memorised</b> the <b>text</b> of the second volume after browsing through it once. She lied to Zhou that the manual was worthless, by reciting the text and claiming that it came from a book of childish rites she had read before. Zhou believed her and destroyed the book in anger.|$|R

He tells Guo Jing stories about the Nine Yin Manual and his conflict with Huang Yaoshi. He still has the first volume of the manual with him so he lets Guo Jing learn the skills as he had been forbidden by Wang Chongyang to practise the skills in the book. Guo Jing <b>memorises</b> the <b>text.</b> Zhou Botong also teaches him the 'Seventy-two Styles Vacant Fist' (七十二路空明拳) and the 'Technique of Ambidexterity' (雙手互搏).|$|R
50|$|Royal Court Theatre, London: Initially Billie Whitelaw {{wanted to}} stand on a dais but she found this didn’t work for her so she allowed herself to be {{strapped}} in a chair called an ‘artist’s rest’ on which a film actor wearing armour rests because he cannot sit down. Her entire body was draped in black; her face covered with black gauze with a black transparent slip for her eyes and her head was clamped between two pieces of sponge rubber so that her mouth would remain fixed in the spotlight. Finally a bar was fixed which she could cling to and on to which she could direct her tension. She was unable to use a visual aid and so <b>memorised</b> the <b>text.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} {{competition}} for his daughter's hand-in-marriage a fair one, Huang Yaoshi sets {{a series of three}} tests for the two contestants: Guo Jing and Ouyang Ke. The first obstacle is a test of martial arts. Ouyang Feng spars with Guo Jing while Hong Qigong fights Ouyang Ke. Guo Jing wins the first bout but ties with Ouyang Ke in the subsequent round, which involves appreciation of a piece of music played by Huang Yaoshi. The last assessment is a test of memory, in which Huang Yaoshi produces an incomplete copy of the Nine Yin Manual, without identifying the book, and asks the two contestants to <b>memorise</b> the <b>text</b> and recite to him later. Guo Jing read the manual before so he recites fluently and defeats Ouyang Ke.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, young mor lam {{were taught}} by {{established}} artists, paying {{them for their}} teaching with money or in kind. The education focussed on <b>memorising</b> the <b>texts</b> of the verses to be sung; these texts could be passed on orally or in writing, but they always came from a written source. Since only men had access to education, it was only men who wrote the texts. The musical education was solely by imitation. Khaen-players typically had no formal training, learning the basics of playing from friends or relatives and thereafter again relying on imitation. [...] With {{the decline of the}} traditional genres, this system has fallen into disuse; the emphasis on singing ability (or looks) is greater, while the lyrics of a brief modern song present no particular challenge of memorisation.|$|R
50|$|A {{few decades}} {{after the death of}} Brahmagupta, Sindh came under the Arab Caliphate in 712 CE. Expeditions were sent into Gurjaradesa. The kingdom of Bhillamala seems to have been annihilated but Ujjain repulsed the attacks. The court of Caliph Al-Mansur (754-775) {{received}} an embassy from Sindh, including an astrologer called Kanaka, who brought (possibly <b>memorised)</b> astronomical <b>texts,</b> including those of Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta's texts were translated into Arabic by Muhammad al-Fazari, an astronomer in Al-Mansur's court under the names Sindhind and Arakhand. An immediate outcome was the spread of the decimal number system used in the texts. The mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (800-850 CE) wrote a text called al-Jam wal-tafriq bi hisal-al-Hind (Addition and Subtraction in Indian Arithmetic), which was translated into Latin in the 13th century as Algorithmi de numero indorum. Through these texts, the decimal number system and Brahmagupta's algorithms for arithmetic have spread throughout the world. Al-Khwarizmi also wrote his own version of Sindhind, drawing on Al-Fazari's version and incorporating Ptolemaic elements. Indian astronomic material circulated widely for centuries, even passing into medieval Latin texts.|$|R

Of the Lodges of the GL BFG, 15 work in the English tradition with <b>memorised</b> English ritual <b>texts</b> using the ritual of the Emulation Lodge of Improvement as approved by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), one works a Scottish Ritual and there is one Lodge which uses the aforementioned Emulation Ritual, but translated into the German language and consequently this Lodge works in the German language. The GL BFG also supports separate Masonic orders (e.g. Mark, Royal Arch Chapter) of nearly all the rituals of English Freemasonry.|$|R
5000|$|Prodigious {{energy was}} {{expended}} by ancient Indian culture {{in ensuring that}} these texts were transmitted {{from generation to generation}} with inordinate fidelity.

25|$|In {{his younger}} years, he would recite by heart the sacred Hindu hymns like Bhavani Sahasranama, Indrakashi Strotam, Panchastavi, Vishnu Sahastranam, Shiv Mahimna Strotam, Shivastrotavali, Guru Gita and vaaks (poetic couplets) {{composed}} by some local saints. However, {{he had a}} marked interest for Bhagvad Gita and had kept {{a copy of the}} book close to where he would sit for his meditation right till his last day. He had <b>memorised</b> all these <b>texts</b> probably in his younger years. During his early years, young Gopinath would accompany his maternal uncle, Pandit Bhagwan Das Parimoo, who was a devotee of Sharika Bhagwati (the deity of the shrine of Hari Parbat), on annual or biannual trips to the holy spring at Pokhribal to desilt it from all the accumulated offerings of devotees. As a leader of a group of young men, he would often organise trips to local shrines like Kheer Bhawani, Mattan, Mahadev and Vicharnaag.|$|R
50|$|Uthman {{is perhaps}} best known for forming the {{committee}} which compiled the basic text of the Quran as it exists today, based on text that had been gathered separately on parchment, bones and rocks during the lifetime of Muhammad and also on a copy of the Quran that had been collated by Abu Bakr and left with Muhammad's widow after Abu Bakr's death. The committee members were also reciters of the Quran and had <b>memorised</b> the entire <b>text</b> during the lifetime of Muhammad. This work was undertaken due to the vast expansion of Islam under Uthman's rule, which encountered many different dialects and languages. This had led to variant readings of the Quran for those converts who were not familiar with the language. After clarifying any possible errors in pronunciation or dialects, Uthman sent copies of the sacred text to each of the Muslim cities and garrison towns, and destroyed variant texts.|$|R
5000|$|Jīvaka was {{a princess}} of Kucha (in Central Asia) {{in the early}} fourth century C.E. She was the sister of the King who {{introduced}} her to Kumārāyana, a noble Indian who renounced his fortune to become a Buddhist monk and thus stopped in Kucha on his journey. However, after meeting Jīvaka, Kumārāyana and her were married. Jīvaka {{is said to have}} possessed great talent and keen perception and understanding. According to the [...] "Collection of Records concerning the Tripitaka", she [...] "had only to glance over a written passage to master it, had only to hear something one time to be able to repeat it from memory." [...] Combining their great talents, Jīvaka and Kumārāyana produced a son, Kumārajīva. When he was just seven, he had already <b>memorised</b> many Buddhist <b>texts,</b> and Jīvaka herself joined the Tsio-li nunnery north of Kucha. Two years later, when her son was nine, Jīvaka took him to Kashmir to study further. After two or three years they returned to Kashgar, where they stayed for a year. Finally, they travelled to Turpan before returning home to Kucha. As Kumārajīva grew up Jīvaka the two are said to have become more distant, with Jīvaka supposedly relocating to Kashmir. Kumārajīva became a noted Buddhist scholar and translator.|$|R
40|$|Problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) is {{a teaching}} and learning approach that is widely used in healthcare education. It has similarly been suggested that poetry writing offers students a way to express their feelings and emotions related to clinical issues, medical education, and their relationship with patients. The rhythmic structure and temporal organisation of poetry allow students to remember poetry more easily than prose, suggesting that important and detailed information could be better <b>memorised</b> through poetic <b>text.</b> To report on how poetry writing and reciting was used in a PBL class in nursing to enhance the students' artistic ability, and on the students' perspectives on artistry in their learning. This paper presented a part of results of a main educational study where data were collected through lesson observations, reflective notes, and a follow-up interview. A total of 17 Hong Kong students were encouraged to collaborate in groups and write English poems based on a clinical case. A content analysis was conducted on their reflective notes and narratives were extracted from an interview. Although the students learned about cooperation, creativity, thinking, stress management, how to make lively presentations, deep learning, long-term memory, and professional knowledge, they expressed that the above were indirectly related to artistry. Scholars from the fields of both health related disciplines and literature should collaborate in researching and developing some learning and teaching activities which can further enhance the students' artistic ability so as to let them learn about empathy and understand patients' sufferings and illness experiences.
