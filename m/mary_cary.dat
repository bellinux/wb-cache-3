5000|$|Kelley {{was raised}} in Spokane, Washington, the eldest child of Adele and William Vincent Kelley, a lawyer who served as {{president}} of the city's bar association. Growing up Kelley helped take care of her five sisters, <b>Mary</b> <b>Cary,</b> Ellen, Margaret, Adele Monica and Madeleine Sophie, as well as her brother, John. [...] The family vacationed in Europe and spent summers at their two lakeside cottages in western Idaho. Kelley graduated from St. Augustine's Elementary School and then attended the private prep school Holy Names Academy. [...] In 1962 Kelley allegedly left the University of Arizona in lieu of criminal charges for suspected theft being filed against her, according to the biography Poison Pen by George Carpozi Jr. Her parents refused to let her live with them and sent her to live in Seattle with her maternal grandparents, the Martins. It was here that Kelley suffered a breakdown and used a wheelchair during some of that time. After this eight-month hiatus, Kelley surfaced at the University of Washington where she received a B.A. in English. She worked at the 1964 New York World's Fair and went on to become a receptionist/press secretary for Senator Eugene McCarthy.|$|E
40|$|Using Gérard Genette's {{concept of}} the "paratext," this article explores the many and various circumscriptions that {{characterize}} much seventeenth-century radical religious writing: multiple titles, epigraphs, prefaces, dedicatory epistles, and marginalia. Through {{an examination of the}} work of two radical sectarian writers from the 1640 s - Katherine Chidley, an Independent, and <b>Mary</b> <b>Cary,</b> a millenarian prophet - the essay analyses the ways in which their writings' paratextual apparatuses serve to negotiate their precarious position on the margins of mainstream religious culture. It is argued that, through paratextual processes of imitation, dispersal and proliferation, the authority of both text and author is simultaneously invoked, asserted and deferred. It is also argued that, precisely because of this complex relation to discursive authority, these processes are highly gendered, thereby suggesting that an analysis of paratextuality contributes to an understanding of sectarian writing as the site of the first major entry into public discursive space by English women writers...|$|E
