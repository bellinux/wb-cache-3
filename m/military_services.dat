While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, which seemed unclear and poorly defined.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} the causal effect of mandatory {{participation in the}} <b>military</b> <b>service</b> on the involvement in criminal activities. We exploit the random assignment of young men to <b>military</b> <b>service</b> in Argentina through a draft lottery to identify this causal effect. Using {{a unique set of}} administrative data that includes draft eligibility, participation in the <b>military</b> <b>service,</b> and criminal records, we find that participation in the <b>military</b> <b>service</b> increases the likelihood of developing a criminal record in adulthood. The effects are not only significant for the cohorts that performed <b>military</b> <b>service</b> during war times, but also for those that provided service at peace times. We also find that <b>military</b> <b>service</b> has detrimental effects on future performance in the labor market. JEL Classification: K 4...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{question}} of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan {{at the expense of}} East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and <b>military</b> <b>services,</b> and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League, which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1972, the Test Pilot School {{expanded}} its role to include astronaut training for military test pilots. Thirty-seven TPS graduates of this era {{were selected for}} the U.S. space program, and twenty-six went on to earn astronaut's wings by flying in the X-15, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs. Although the school no longer trains astronauts, many TPS graduates since 1972 have been selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for duties in space. The school encourages applications from civilians, personnel from other U.S. <b>military</b> <b>services,</b> and individuals from foreign countries. An exchange program allows selected students to attend other test pilot schools including the United States Naval Test Pilot School, the United Kingdom's Empire Test Pilots' School, and France's EPNER.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{separated}} and enlarged the empire's civil and <b>military</b> <b>services</b> and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing {{the largest and}} most bureaucratic government {{in the history of the}} empire. He established new administrative centres in Nicomedia, Mediolanum, Antioch, and Trier, closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome had been. Building on third-century trends towards absolutism, he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 France began a {{blockade}} of the Rio de la Plata against Rosas.

San Martín bequeathed his curved saber to Rosas, because of his successful defense of the country.

During this time he met Florencio Varela and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.|$|E
5|$|Recruitment for the women's {{services}} {{began in}} June 1941. Most volunteers were married women, {{many of them}} the wives of military men.

But fate had decided otherwise, as when he reached Medina, news of Khalid's death reached him. The news of Khalid's death broke like a storm over Medina. The women took to the streets, led by the women of the Banu Makhzum (Khalid's tribe), wailing and beating their chests. Though Umar, from the very first day had given orders {{that there would be no}} wailing for departed Muslims, as forbidden in Islam, in this one case he made an exception.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his <b>military</b> <b>services</b> in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E

The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion.
