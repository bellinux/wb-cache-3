40|$|It is well {{established}} that Indigenous Australians are heavily over-represented among Australia’s most disadvantaged citizens. An important component of this disadvantage is the limited and often unsuccessful engagement of Indigenous people with the labour market. To better understand this reality, the present paper explores the forces which influence the <b>labour</b> market <b>status</b> of Indigenous people. For this purpose, multinomial logit regression analysis is used to model <b>labour</b> force <b>status</b> {{as a function of}} factors relating to geography, demographic characteristics, education, health, culture, crime and housing issues. The analysis is conducted utilising the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS). Particular attention is given to geographic issues, revealing significant variations between the determinants of <b>labour</b> force <b>status</b> in non-remote and remote areas. The results also demonstrate the relevance {{of a wide range of}} factors in determining <b>labour</b> force <b>status</b> among Indigenous people, highlighting the complex array of issues which should be considered in attempts to increase employment. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the impact of}} {{education}} on happiness in Spain using individual-level data from the European Social Survey, by means of estimating Ordinal Logit Models. We find both direct and indirect effects of education on happiness. First, we find an indirect effect of education on happiness through income and <b>labour</b> <b>status.</b> That is, we find that people with a higher education level have higher income levels and a higher probability of being employed, and thus, {{report higher levels of}} happiness. Second, and after controlling by income, <b>labour</b> <b>status</b> and other socio-economic variables, we find that education has a positive (and direct) impact on happiness. We interpret this result as evidence of a “self-confidence ” or “self-estimation ” effect from acquiring knowledge. Finally, we find that the direct impact of education on happiness does not depend of the level of education (primary, secondary or tertiary).

40|$|This study uses ECHP data to give {{insights}} {{on the characteristics}} of people whose self-assessment of <b>labour</b> <b>status</b> differs from that of the LFS. We do some ‘labour accounting’, in order to clarify the connection between individual perception and LFS categorisation. We find that discrepancies are frequent, regional differences are extremely relevant in explaining them and thus traditional statistics may be strongly biased in capturing people’s well being in relationship with their <b>labour</b> <b>status.</b> We concentrate then on the most relevant perception errors, above all those connected with searching behaviour, in order to explain their determinants. What emerges is a map of social characteristics explaining discouragement and passive behaviour. Such an attitude is (paradoxically) reinforced by assistance from the state itself, such that it becomes – to a certain extent – ‘institutionalised’. Finally, we show that our understanding of the relationship between misclassification and individual characteristics leads to a reduction in the measurement error to be dealt with in transition flows analysis. ...|$|R

By using a rich longitudinal data set, I am able to control for individual immigrant differences whilst examining whether changes in mental health cause changes in <b>labour</b> force <b>status</b> rather than changes in <b>labour</b> force <b>status</b> causing changes in mental health. I find that causality runs from unemployment to mental health and that unemployment significantly adversely affects the mental health of immigrants.

40|$|By {{attracting}} the {{attention on the}} possibility of an inverse relationship between wages and unemployment, the model recently developed by Blanchflower and Oswald seems to provide an interesting explanation of the efficiency wage. Although this analysis is especially appropriated to the context of the industrialised countries, the opportunity of a such approach seems to prevail equally in developing countries. Indeed, {{with the help of the}} national household survey of Burkina Faso, realised in 1994 _ 95, the present research shows that, all other things being equal, a doubling of the rate of unemployment implies a 25, 8 per cent reduction in real wages. Furthermore, it appears that the rigidity of wages is far more strong for protected wage_earners that to these that have a non protected <b>labour</b> <b>status.</b> Since <b>labour</b> is an important asset whose shortage weakens the capacity of resistance of individuals or social groups to changes of the environment, the risk of insecurity in terms of well_being is considerably increased for individuals having a precarious <b>labour</b> <b>status</b> and for households whose chief is a non protected employee.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between work organisation and the <b>labour</b> market <b>status</b> of employees in Sweden, during the years 2008 to 2012. The main interest is to analyse the probability of staying employed or not, and staying employed after the general retirement age. To assess this relationship three different data sources are combined. Work organisation is approximated with the NU 2012 survey, which was conducted by the Swedish Work Environment Authority. We use an empirical combination of the questions, and the work organisation is assumed constant throughout the years. Separate regressions are estimated for each possible <b>labour</b> market <b>status.</b> The regressions are estimated with cross section models and random effects panel data models. We find that there is a relationship between work organisation and employees’ labour market positions. Numerical flexibility is found to affect the work environment and the individuals’ <b>labour</b> market <b>statuses</b> negatively. Decentralisation’s and learning’s impact on the individuals’ <b>labour</b> market <b>status</b> is, however, incoherent with theories and previous research. These results are probably due to the reverse time causality of the study. Finally we propose that it is important to investigate this relationship further to be able to make policy changes...|$|R

We assume that young people may fall in five labour market statuses: 1) Employee; 2) Self-employed; 3) Unemployed; 4) In Education; 5) Inactive, and perform a multinomial logit model to {{study the effects of}} years of education on relative probability of being in <b>labour</b> <b>statuses</b> 2, 3, 4, or 5, compared to the base category (Employee). Afterwards, we interact the individual-level years of education with a country-level indicator of education mismatch in order to identify the heterogeneous effects of the aggregate mismatch among people with different educational attainments. Results show that more years of education: i) reduce the relative probability of being unemployed; ii) have a cumulative effect by extending the period of education; iii) slightly raise the relative probability to be self-employed. As regards country-level education mismatch, we found that only after 2008 it produces an additional effect on better educated young people by further reducing their relative unemployment risk when it is compared to that of low educated youngsters. This outcome tells us that improving access to university degrees remains the main road to tackle youth unemployment caused by education mismatch, even after the outburst of the current financial and economic crisis...|$|R
40|$|The {{migration}} {{literature has}} {{focused primarily on}} earnings, with little attention {{on the issue of}} <b>labour</b> market <b>status.</b> Yet one of the main concerns of immigrant receiving countries is the size of public transfers to immigrants. The importance of repeat and circular migration is also largely overlooked. In this empirical paper we assess how labour market transitions and out- and repeat migration of immigrants are interrelated. We estimate a multi-state multiple spell competing risks model and identify four states: employed, unemployed receiving benefits, out-of-the-labour market (no benefits) and abroad. The first three states indicate the <b>labour</b> market <b>status</b> of the immigrant in the host country. For the analysis we use data on recent immigrants to The Netherlands. A unique feature of this data is that we can distinguish the immigrants by migration motive. We choose to focus on labour migrants which implies that all migrants are (self) -employed at the time of arrival. The data further contain information on the timing of migration moves, timing of <b>labour</b> <b>status,</b> income change and industry. We also have demographic information, such as the country of origin and marital status. We show that both low and high income migrants leave employment on the Dutch labour market faster. We also shed light on the percentage of immigrants that are trapped in unemployment and therefore present a financial burden to the country. JEL classification: F 22, J 61, C 41.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to recent research {{that seeks to}} understand the political consequences of ‘outsider’ <b>labour</b> market <b>status.</b> There is an emerging consensus that labour market outsiders have systematically different policy preferences and display systematically different political behavior to securely employed ‘insiders’ in Europe. Yet the political consequences of outsider status in the United States are less clear. They {{may be expected to}} differ from those that have been documented in the European context, because 1) the US is characterized by low employment protection of insiders, and 2) there is evidence that Americans are more reluctant than Europeans to hold governments responsible for personal economic hardship. We therefore use the General Social Survey to examine how outsider <b>labour</b> market <b>status</b> is related to voting behavior and to social policy preferences in the United States. We find that the concept of ‘labour market outsider’ - as conventionally operationalized - holds little explanatory power in the American context. Disaggregating the outsider category, our results suggest that the political consequences of outsider <b>labour</b> market <b>status</b> may be contingent on individual beliefs about government responsibility...|$|R
