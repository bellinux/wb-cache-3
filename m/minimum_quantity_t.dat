Otherwise, cost of cutting fluid also had been issues lately because it frequently higher than cost of cutting tools and influence amount total machining cost. Because of that, dry machining and <b>minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> lubricant become alternatives to solve this problem.

For the most general version of the problem, we show that it does not admit a polynomial time approximation algorithm (unless P=NP), even for the case of a single bin. This motivates to study dual approximation algorithms that compute solutions violating the bin capacities and <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> by a constant factor. When the number of bins is fixed and the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> of each bin is at least a factor δ> 1 larger than the largest size of an item in the bin, we show how to obtain a polynomial time dual approximation algorithm that computes a solution violating the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> and bin capacities by at most a factor 1 - 1 /δ and 1 + 1 /δ, respectively, and whose profit is at least as large as the profit of the best solution that satisfies the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantities</b> and bin capacities strictly.

This problem has recently been shown to be weakly NP-complete even on series-parallel graphs. In this paper, we provide further complexity and approximability results for MFPMQ and several special cases. We first show that it is strongly NP-hard to approximate MFPMQ on general graphs (and even bipartite graphs) within any positive factor. On series-parallel graphs, however, we present a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for the problem. We then study the case that the <b>minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> is the same for each arc in the network and show that, under this restriction, the problem is still weakly NP-complete on general graphs, but can be solved in strongly polynomial time on series-parallel graphs.

40|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> of {{lubrication}} (MQL) in machining is {{an established}} alternative to completely dry or flood lubricating {{system from the}} viewpoint of cost, ecology and human health issues. Hence, it is necessary to select MQL and cutting conditions in order to enhance machinability for a given work material. This thesis describes experimental investigations on influence of different lubrication conditions such as <b>minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> lubrication (MQL), dry machining and wet machining on surface roughness. The surface roughness was examined with Perthometer. In this research, the main objective is to determine the effect of the lubrication conditions on the surface roughness in turning operation. Three different materials had been chosen as work material. Those were ASTM B 176 Brass, AISI 1060 Aluminum Alloy and AISI 304 Stainless Steel. Two other parameters were also considered in this study; depth of cut and cutting speed. The ranges of depth of cut used were 0. 2 mm and 0. 4 mm whereby the cutting speed values were 810 rpm and 1400 rpm. Response Surface Method (RSM) was used to predict the surface roughness. Based on the generated results, the correlation for surface roughness with the cutting parameters satisfies a reasonable degree of approximation. It was found that, <b>minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> lubricants produced better surface finish as compared to dry and wet machining. The result can significantly reduce cost and environmental pollution by using <b>minimum</b> <b>quantity</b> lubrication...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In any {{machining}} operation, {{a lot of}} heat {{is generated}} due to plastic deformation of work material, friction at the tool-chip interface and friction between the clearance face of the tool and work piece. The friction in machining adversely affects the tool wear and quality of the products produced. Thus, effective control of friction in the cutting zone is essential to ensure less tool wear and good surface quality of the work piece in machining. Cutting fluids have been the conventional choice to deal with this problem. But it shows negative effect on product cost, environment and human health. Later semi-dry i. e., <b>Minimum</b> <b>Quantity</b> Lubrication machining has been tried as a possible alternative to the use of cutting fluid. The usage of coolant in <b>Minimum</b> <b>Quantity</b> Lubrication is typically 100 ml/hr or less.
