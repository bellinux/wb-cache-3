25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in <b>me?</b> <b>During</b> this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough.

500|$|In 1997, DiCaprio {{starred in}} James Cameron's Titanic (1997) as twenty-year-old Jack Dawson, a penniless Wisconsin man who wins two {{tickets for the}} third-class on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. DiCaprio {{initially}} refused to portray the character but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by Cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability. Against expectations, the film {{went on to become}} the highest-grossing film to date (it was surpassed in 2010 by Cameron's film Avatar), grossing more than $1.843 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed DiCaprio into a commercial movie superstar, resulting in fan worship among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as [...] "Leo-Mania". In May 1998, for example, his face appeared on the covers of at least four teen magazines, and three books about DiCaprio were among the top six paperbacks on The New York Times Best Seller list. More than 200 fans contacted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to protest his not being nominated for the 70th Academy Awards. He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a second Golden Globe nomination. Upon the success of Titanic, DiCaprio stated in 2000: [...] "I have no connection with <b>me</b> <b>during</b> that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] I'll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don't expect to.

But its messagethat relationships, like cooking, take a hands-on approachis a sweet and sustaining one." [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle opined that Chef was Favreau's best film to date, highlighting the [...] "natural and convincing" [...] chemistry between Favreau and Anthony and the [...] "vivid" [...] scenes featuring big-name actors in small roles. USA Today Scott Bowles gave Chef 3.5 out of 4 stars and called it [...] "a nuanced side dish, a slow-cooked film that's {{one of the most}} heartwarming of the young year". Ken Choy of Wide Lantern noted the structural problems but admitted, [...] "If you ever saw the Kristen Bell sloth video on Ellen, that was <b>me</b> <b>during</b> the entire 2nd half of the movie.
