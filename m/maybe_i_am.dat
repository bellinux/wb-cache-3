500|$|The {{journalist}} Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as [...] "friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d {{want to play}} {{video games}} with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t {{know what to say}} to the media if I’m not talking about a film that I am doing, so yeah, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> perceived as a snob." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is much more aggressive. He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
500|$|A big storyline {{occurred}} {{for the character}} in 2008, when Phoebe is killed after the car her boyfriend Rick Forrester (Kyle Lowder) was driving crashes. Her death left Steffy [...] "despondent and nearly suicidal". Wood recalled filming the storyline as being tough: [...] "Being a newbie, I was {{up most of the}} night trying to memorize all those monologues." [...] Speaking of emotional scenes where Steffy visited her sister's body in the morgue, the actress noted [...] "She was so tiny and innocent, and to see this beautiful young girl in the morgue, I had to keep my emotions in check. It was challenging. It was such a sad story." [...] Months later, Steffy becomes romantically involved with Rick, who was also previously in a relationship with her mother, Taylor. Reflecting on her initial reaction to the storyline, Wood revealed [...] "Sometimes when you read a script, you're like, 'How am I going [...] do this? How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers." [...] Wood was [...] "completely shocked" [...] with the speed at which the couple were moving, and said that the romance happened through Phoebe's death because of Steffy's raw feelings. However, she still felt that Steffy was in love with Rick and wanted to give herself to him. Lowder said the couple came together at the [...] "height of their emotions when Phoebe died". While describing the romance as [...] "complete honesty and no games", Wood said Steffy felt if she was close to Rick she could be close to Phoebe.|$|E

2500|$|Pipes was a firm {{supporter}} of the Vietnam War, and when his fellow students occupied the Harvard administration building to protest it in the 1960s, he sided with the administration. Pipes had previously considered {{himself to be a}} Democrat, but after anti-war George McGovern gained the 1972 Democratic nomination for President, he switched to the Republican Party. Pipes used to accept being described as a [...] "neoconservative", once saying that [...] "others see me that way, and, you know, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one of them." [...] However, he explicitly rejected the label in April 2009 due to differences with the neoconservative positions on democracy and Iraq, now considering himself a [...] "plain conservative".|$|E
2500|$|Between flops, it is true, I {{have come}} up with an {{occasional}} hit, but compared to a good boxer's record, for instance, my percentage has been lamentable. I fought a draw in my first fight, stupified everyone by winning the championship in my second, got a couple of wins with picture rights, then was knocked out three times in a row. Dragging my weary carcass to Hollywood, I was immediately knocked out again, won a big fight some six months later, then marked time for six years as an ordinary ham-and-beaner, picking up what I could. Suddenly I saw a chance and offered to fight for the world championship for a dollar. To everyone's astonishment, I won that championship and defended it successfully for a number of years, winning nine times by knockout, fighting three draws, losing twice and getting one no-decision in Europe. I have just come over to America for a fight, but it was called off at the last moment, one of the promoters having gone nuts and having to have been locked up.

The following year, on 18 May 2008, it was announced that [...] "Amebo" [...] would be the first single to be released from the album. According to Muma Gee, this song was what she had long desired to create: [...] "I have been doing my own thing. I've been experimenting even while at the University of Port Harcourt. Now, I want to see what I can achieve professionally." [...] Explaining what [...] "Amebo" [...] was specifically about, she says, [...] "I am a homegirl, I am an indigenous musician. I believe so much in Nigeria. So, [...] "Amebo" [...] simply talks about our people, our values, and our heritage." [...] On 25 May, Muma Gee premiered the song at an exclusive night party in Ikoyi. Other roles she played at the event included meeting fans, and signing autographs. [...] "Amebo" [...] was sent to radio afterwards; Muma Gee also spoke briefly about the new album's content and direction, saying, [...] "I figured out that there are lots of love songs in the album. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> learning the rules to falling in love.
