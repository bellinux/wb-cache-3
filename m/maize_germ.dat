40|$|Bun was {{prepared}} by blending wheat flour with de-oiled <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> flour (DMGF) in different combinations. The different proportions of DMGF at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 % levels were mixed with wheat flour. The composition, physical properties, color, texture, and sensory evaluation were analyzed for de-oiled <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> (DOMG) -fortified flour bun. It {{was found that}} the protein, fat, ash, and crude fiber content increased with increase in the percentage of DMGF in the wheat flour. Bun loaf volume decreased with increase in DMGF levels from 5 to 25 %. Bun yield increased with increase in blending proportions. Bun prepared with 5 % substitution was lighter than all other treatments as indicated by the higher L* values and the values decreased with DMGF augmentation. Total color difference (∆E) of DMGF buns differed from the wheat flour bun sample. With the increase in DMGF, an increase in the values of the hardness of DMGF bun was observed. Bun prepared from 10 % incorporation of DOMG scored highest for its overall appearance...|$|E

Based on the germ recovery and compositional analysis, one best hybrid germ, Pioneer 32 -F- 10 (P- 1), {{was selected for}} further analysis and product development. Refined <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> oil (MGO) from selected hybrid, was analyzed for various physical and chemical characteristics. The MGO was evaluated for cake preparation through blending with normal shortening at different levels. Moreover, defatted <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> (DMG) meal was subjected to biological and safety evaluation using Sprague Dawley rats. Later, DMG flour was blended with wheat flour in different combinations; evaluated for functional properties, textural analysis (SMS Texture Analyzer) and Farinographic behavior. Flour blends were further used to develop value-added products like bread and cookies. Germ recovery from the experimental hybrids ranged from 6. 31 - 7. 68 %, while the highest germ yield was observed in P- 1 hybrid. Germ samples {{were found to be}} nutrient dense; crude protein 16. 34 - 20. 96 %, crude fat 32. 10 - 38. 80 %, crude fiber 2. 63 - 4. 79 %, ash 3. 08 - 4. 94 %, α-tocopherol 4. 63 - 9. 68 mg/ 100 g and γ-tocopherol 29. 52 - 35. 51 mg/ 100 g. The germ samples were rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (46. 74 - 58. 00 g/ 100 g) and essential amino acids (33. 30 - 39. 04 g/ 100 g). Additionally, in germ samples, minerals like P (1. 06 - 1. 79 g/ 100 g), K (1. 19 - 1. 64 g/ 100 g), Mg (0. 43 - 0. 78 g/ 100 g) and Fe (9. 08 - 14. 46 mg/ 100 g) were in substantial amount. MGO from selected germ (P- 1) was successfully incorporated in cake recipe with high sensory quality. Defatted <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> (DMG) meal was found to be considerable source of protein (32. 1 %), dietary fiber (31. 87 %) and allied minerals. In the experimental rats, in-vivo protein quality of DMG flour was: 87. 10 ± 0. 78 % true digestibility, 76. 70 ± 1. 25 % net protein utilization, 88. 06 ±o. 67 % biological value, 5. 12 ± 0. 21 net protein ratio and 2. 15 ± 0. 03 protein efficiency ratio were significantly higher than that of wheat-based diet and comparable with casein. Favorable impact of DMG flour on serum biochemical profile was observed; cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and glucose levels decreased up to 6. 80, 12. 45, 16. 19 and 6. 50 %, respectively. DMG flour resulted in improvement of functional properties of DMG flour-wheat flour blends with special reference to improved water & oil absorption capacity, gelling and emulsion properties; revealed its worth in food preparations. Protein and fiber enriched cookies and breads were prepared up to 15 % wheat flour substitution with DMG flour. Consumer response to purchase defatted <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> flour fortified cookies was very positive e. g. 64 % of the respondents said that they would prefer to purchase cookies containing DMG flour if available in market. It is concluded from the present exploration, that <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> components especially oil and defatted meal can successfully be used for value-addition of baked products. Moreover, DMG flour bears a potential to cope with protein deficiency in the vulnerable segment of populatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{artificial}} UV-B radiation combined with carbon dioxide doubling and temperature increase on plant growth, pigments and photosynthesis {{has been studied}} with sunflowers, maize, rye, oat and beans. Results were compared with those obtained under enhanced solar UV-B radiation using the ozone filter technique or plant cultivation in Plexiglas greenhouses. In the case of UV-sensitive plants (sunflower, maize), a 20 % enhanced radiation (corresponding to 10 % ozone depletion) effects a 20 % reduction of plant growth and photosynthesis. The growth retardation is caused by an UV-dependent depletion of phytohormones. At beans a 7 % UV enhancement caused a yield reduction up to 54 %. Under the studied conditions the effect of UV radiation on sunflower and <b>maize</b> <b>germs</b> is compensated by the greenhouse effect (elevated temperature and CO_ 2 level).

40|$|A {{modified}} {{process for}} the infrared heat processing of oilseeds and cereal grains at relatively low temperatures is put forward. The process which involves an additional holding step and potentials for saving energy was investigated on a pilot plant {{on the basis of}} which a design is proposed for industrial applications. The process was used in order to produce full-fat soy flour and <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> with long shelf life and improved nutritive and organoleptic qualities. Antitrypsin factors, lipoxygenase and lipase could be inactivated with no damage to available lysine. Overheating not only caused damage to available lysine but also made the products more prone to rancidity possibly by causing destruction of natural antioxidants. The process caused protein solubility and dispersibility to fall and starch (in <b>maize</b> <b>germ)</b> to gelatinize. Water absorption of <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> also increased. In soybeans, urease was found to be a good indicator of the extent of inactivation of antitrypsin factors, while lipoxygenase was found more heat sensitive than urease and antitrypsin factors. For evaluating storage stability, in addition to measuring peroxide value and % free fatty acids, sensory analysis was also carried out. The process was further applied for treating soybeans prior to oil extraction. It was concluded that the quality of the crude oil obtained from the pretreated beans in terms of oxidation products, free fatty acids and nonhydratable phospholipids was such that the alkali treatment step in the refining process could be circumvented. The improved quality of the crude oil was attributed to the inactivation of phospholipase D, lipoxygenase and lipase. The residual defatted flakes showed low levels of trypsin inhibitor activity and could be used directly as food or feed. Finally, the involvement of phospholipase D in the hydrolysis of phospholipids and formation of nonhydratable phospholipids in soybeans was elucidated by radio(chemical) methods, as well as thin layer chromatography and densitometry. The presence of an active, soluble form of the enzyme with isoelectric point 4. 8 was shown by isoelectric focusing...|$|E
40|$|Storage triacylglycerols in {{oleaginous}} {{seeds are}} surrounded by a layer that consists of phospholipids and proteins, mainly oleosins. These entities are intracellular organelles, known as oil bodies. It is often reported {{that they have a}} spherical shape, but imaging using cryo-SEM analysis showed that they are rather elastic and their shape depends on their surrounding environment. In this research we have shown that oil bodies in <b>maize</b> <b>germ,</b> which has a relatively low moisture content, are taking the shape of the available space they have. On the other hand, oil bodies in sunflower seeds, which contain double amounts of water, appear with an almost spherical shape. Oil bodies can be extracted from oleaginous seeds using an aqueous alkaline extraction, which leads to a stable natural oil-in-water emulsion. As no additional energy is required, this method can be considered as sustainable and may find a lot of potential uses in the industry. Extraneous co-extracted proteins most likely form a second layer around the oil body surface, which protects the oil bodies from coalescence, even at high oil concentration. The extraneous proteins of <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> oil body emulsions could be removed by applying aqueous washing steps, but not in the case of sunflower seed oil bodies...|$|E

After diluting the oils with n‐hexane, E vitamers {{are separated by}} HPLC and detected fluorometrically. Standardization is achieved, using electron‐impact mass spectrometry and HPLC. Vitamin E composition of several hot and cold pressed seed oils, originating from maize germs, olives, soy beans and from sesame, safflower and sunflower seeds, was investigated. No clear differences were observed between E vitamer concentrations of hot and cold pressed oils of the same origin. On the other hand, vitamin E composition of oils different origin varied widely.

40|$|Oleosins are low {{molecular}} mass proteins that are distinguished from other proteins for their extended central hydrophobic domain which covers {{almost half of}} its entity. For this work, they were extracted from isolated <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> oil bodies. The purification steps included washing with diethylether and a chloroform-methanol-water mixture. Their amphipathic terminal domains positioned at the organelle surface, where they strongly interact with the surface polar phospholipids, made {{the application of a}} third washing step with acetone essential. Although oleosins are well known for their insolubility in water, we were able to prepare aqueous buffer solutions of 0. 008 wt% at pH 8. 0. The interfacial behaviour of oleosins was studied, in order to predict their ability to stabilize foams. Even at low concentrations they were capable of decreasing the interfacial tension of air-water interfaces to values similar to those obtained from milk protein or egg yolk apolipoproteins adsorption. Pendant drop profile analysis showed that the dilatational elastic modulus was frequency-dependent, {{but at the same time}} the elastic to viscous modulus ratio was frequency-independent and below 0. 1. The results indicate that oleosins might have a high potential as foam stabilizers, a fast developing and challenging field...|$|E
40|$|A set of {{prediction}} equations {{to estimate}} the nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) of individual ingredients and diets used in the poultry feed industry was evaluated. The AMEn values of three energy ingredients (maize, sorghum and defatted <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> meal), four protein ingredients (soybean meal, maize gluten meal 60 % crude protein, integral micronized soy and roasted whole soybean) and four diets (three containing four feedstuffs, complex diets, and one containing only corn-soybean meal, basal diet) were determined using a metabolism assay with male broilers from 1 to 7, 8 to 21, 22 to 35, and 36 to 42 days old. These values were compared to the AMEn values presented in the tables of energy composition or estimated by equation predictions based on chemical composition data of feedstuffs. In general, the equation predictions more precisely estimated the AMEn of feedstuffs {{when compared to the}} tables of energy composition. The equation AMEn (dry matter [DM] basis) = 4, 164. 187 + 51. 006 ether extract (% in DM basis) – 197. 663 ash– 35. 689 crude fiber (% in DM basis) – 20. 593 neutral detergent fiber (% in DM basis) (R 2 = 0. 75) was the most applicable for the prediction of the energy values of feedstuffs and diets used in the poultry feed industry...|$|E
40|$|Three natural {{oil body}} {{emulsions}} {{of a similar}} fat content (similar to 5 %), but differing in their protein composition were obtained from an aqueous <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> extract. The first was prepared by concentrating the aqueous oil body extract with ultrafiltration to a fat content of similar to 5 %. The other two were prepared by initially recovering the oil bodies from the extract by centrifugation, either {{in the presence of}} sucrose or by applying isoelectric precipitation at pH 5. 0 and then diluting the resulting oil body creams with deionized water. The oxidative and physical stability of the three emulsions, either as they were or after submission to thermal treatment (100 degrees C for 15 min), were studied following storage at 45 degrees C. The emulsions differed both in their oxidative and physical stability, depending on the recovery method that in turn influenced their continuous phase and/or interfacial membrane protein and/or polar antioxidant composition. Ultrafiltration resulted in the most stable emulsion. Mixtures of the natural oil body emulsions with green tea extracts, aiming to serve as a base for functional beverages, were then prepared and studied for their creaming behaviour. The green tea polyphenols seem to interact with the oil bodies leading to intensive dispersion destabilisation which, however, was halted following carrageenan addition at a relatively very low level.

40|$|The maize genome {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} analyzed among the plant genomes. Consequently, maize has been at the forefront in development and evaluation of an array of molecular markers for varied purposes in genetics and breeding. Besides the well-demonstrated utility of molecular markers in genotype differentiation and analysis of genetic diversity in maize germplasm, application of DNA-based markers is also of considerable significance to tropical/sub-tropical maize production systems, such as in India, for mapping and marker-assisted selection for resistance to major biotic/abiotic stresses affecting production and productivity. Significant impetus in this direction has been provided in recent years through the Asian Maize Biotechnology Network (AMBIONET). This article provides an overview of the recent efforts under AMBIONET in relation to: (i) the molecular characterization of inbred lines developed by various public sector institutions in India; (ii) the analysis of genetic diversity in the Indian <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> plasm using microsatellite markers; and (Hi) the mapping of quantitative trait loci conferring resistance to different downy mildews affecting maize in tropical Asia. Judicious integration of conventional and molecular approaches in maize breeding programmes is vital for efficient utilization of genetic resources, and improving the production and post-harvest characteristics of the elite germplasm.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the quality of selected feed ingredients as protein sources in grouper diets, based on their nutrient composition and apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter (ADMD) and crude protein (APD). A total of 56 juveniles were used for the 1 st batch of test ingredients (Chilean fish meal, white fish meal, shrimp meal, defatted soyabean oilmeal, white cowpea meal and ipil-ipil leaf meal). 54, 72 and 48 juveniles were used for the 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th batches of test ingredients (squid meal, local meat and bone meal, meat solubles, soya protein concentrates and rice bran; tuna fish meal, imported meat and bone meal, blood meal, maize gluten meal and wheat flour; and poultry feather meal, lupin seed meal and <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> meal, respectively). Apparent digestibility coefficients were measured in vivo. The apparent digestibility coefficients for ADMD ranged from 37 - 99 %. Squid meal and meat solubles had the highest coefficients, whereas blood meal had the lowest. The APD of all feed ingredients tested were relatively high (79 - 99 %), except for rice bran (43 %) and blood meal (15 %). ADMD values varied with the levels of fibre and other carbohydrate substances in the feed ingredients. Groupers could utilize dietary protein efficiently regardless of whether it was of animal or plant origin. High APD values were generally obtained in feed ingredients with high protein content. Low digestibility coefficients for feed ingredients could also be attributed to the processing methods used in their preparation...|$|E

Four concentrate diets were formulated. The diets composed of <b>maize</b> <b>germ,</b> wheat bran, molasses, and poultry waste constituting 0, 15, 30 and 45 % of the total mixture replacing cotton seed cake as a convetional protein source. Milk yield, liveweight changes and diet acceptability were monitored. All rations were consumed equally well regardless of poultry waste content. Total milk yield including or excluding the quantity suckled by the kids as well as liveweight changes showed no significant differences (P> 0. 05) among the treatments. However, {{there was a strong}} tendency toward higher milk yields from goats fed a diet containing 15 % poultry waste. High weighing errors {{to determine the}} kids' residual milk intakes might have influenced these results, hence suggesting a possible limitation {{in the use of the}} Weigh -Suckle - Weigh method. Animals in Treatment IV produced higher milk yield, though for reasons not established yet, than those in Treatment III and slightly less than those in the control. It suffices to conclude that in the advent of either partial or total scarcity of a conventional protein source, poultry waste would be an effective replacement.

40|$|Proteins from {{vegetable}} and cereal sources {{are an excellent}} alternative to substitute animal-based counterparts because of their reduced cost, abundant supply and good nutritional value. The objective of this investigation is to study a set of {{vegetable and}} cereal proteins in terms of physicochemical and functional properties. Twenty protein sources were studied: five soya bean flour samples, one pea flour and fourteen newly developed blends of soya bean and <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> (fi ve concentrates and nine hydrolysates). The physicochemical characterization included pH (5. 63 to 7. 57), electrical conductivity (1. 32 to 4. 32 mS/cm), protein content (20. 78 to 94. 24 % on dry mass basis), free amino nitrogen (0. 54 to 2. 87 mg/g) and urease activity (0. 08 to 2. 20). The functional properties showed interesting differences among proteins: water absorption index ranged from 0. 41 to 18. 52, the highest being of soya and maize concentrates. Nitrogen and water solubility ranged from 10. 14 to 74. 89 % and from 20. 42 to 95. 65 %, respectively. Fat absorption and emulsification activity indices ranged from 2. 59 to 4. 72 and from 3936. 6 to 52 399. 2 m 2 /g respectively, the highest being of pea flour. Foam activity (66. 7 to 475. 0 %) of the soya and maize hydrolysates was the best. Correlation analyses showed that hydrolysis affected solubility-related parameters whereas fat-associated indices were inversely correlated with water-linked parameters. Foam properties were better of proteins treated with low heat, which also had high urease activity.

40|$|Poultry {{can be an}} {{important}} source of food following drought and crop failure. Unfortunately, reduced staple crop production also affects the chickens so that they become scrawnier and less able to produce eggs thereby detracting from their potential contribution to human diet. The article below suggests one rather innovative means by which the nutrition of poultry may be safeguarded in times of drought and food scarcity. Eds Chickens are unable to manufacture 10 necessary amino acids or the B vitamins. 1 They therefore require a diet high in protein. In addition, they require fats and carbohydrates, and cannot exist on high fibre diets. When NGOs or the FAO have taken a role in the improvement of family poultry farming in the developing world, the diet endorsed is varied, comprised of grains and tubers "for energy " (millet, sorghum, maize, sweet potatoes, and even cassava); meals for protein (sunflower cake, fish meal, cotton seed cake, <b>maize</b> <b>germ,</b> soya cake, meat and bone meal) and vegetables "for vitamins " (green grass, green kale, and cabbage) 2 and green seaweed. 3 The grains are given as a supplement to foraging 4 with millet recommended as the best grain for protein supplementation in chickens. Where these are unavailable, leaf meals have been used, 5 and recent research suggests that the seeds of the Croton tree are valuable in supplying necessary oils and proteins. 1 In the search for less expensive, natively available food for chickens, recent studies suggest that tobacco seed cakes, 6 or even molasses from sugar cane residue, 7 can be reasonably and productively utilised, and that meal from azolla, snails or rice polishings are comparable to maize-soybean meal diets. 8 In Haiti, however, farmers often are unable to purchase any form o...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing {{research}} in industrialized countries has identified {{links between the}} occurrence of malignant diseases and nutrition. An investigation of this association may be facilitated from a relatively monotonous diet {{of the majority of}} people in East Africa. As breast cancer is among the more common malignant diseases in Northern Tanzania, patients with this tumour have been selected for a case-control-study. The Kilimanjaro region in North-eastern Tanzania is chosen because of the availability of a capable partner, the Department of Histopathology of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC). All patients suffering from primary mammary carcinoma, diagnosed at the KCMC and hospitals in the region, are included except those with HIV-infection. For each case (n= 40), two individual matched controls are studied (n= 80). The most important method is structured interviews about nutritional habits and lifestyle, like use of hormonal contraceptives and the reproductive habits. Expected results are information on the association between dietary intake and the occurrence of the malignancy of the mammary carcinoma. Nutritional habits are recorded by the food-frequency method witch estimates how frequently certain foods are eaten during a specific period of time (per day, week, month). In this survey, the quantitative assessment of common portion sizes are included as well. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis of nutrients show a positive correlation between alcohol intake and breast cancer risk (OR= 2. 997; p value= 0. 0205). A total fat intake of over 30 % of the daily energy intake had a weak inverse effect (adjusted OR= 0. 618;n. s.), saturated fatty acids showed no effect (adjusted OR= 0. 913;n. s.). A high intake of soluble dietary fibre showed a weak protective effect (adjusted OR= 0. 553;n. s.). Carotene intake showed no effect on the cancer risk (OR= 1. 101;n. s.). In the multivariate model, we found - although non-significant - a higher risk associated with an early menarche (OR= 1. 512) and a lower risk associated with a first pregnancy at younger age (OR= 0. 460). The results of this case control study in Tanzania further supports the finding that alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer. We found an high total fat intake associated with a lower risk. The higher fat intake of the controls may be less detrimental because of the fat quality: the study population consumes self made sunflower and <b>maize</b> <b>germ</b> oil. Plant derived fat and oils seem to decrease the risk compared to animal fats. According to our findings - no single dietary factor exerts a direct effect on the breast cancer risk except for the food quality. The higher fruit, vegetable, and legume intake of the control group led to an higher intake of fibres, vitamins and minerals. Further research is needed to identify possible associations between breast cancer incidence and nutritional factors based on a much bigger number of cases and population-based enrolment of controls...|$|E

Data collected once fortnightly for 11 months was analysed to study the impact of water on offer on productivity. Data was collected on source of water (on- or off-farm), water storage, distance to water source (categorised as 1) 0 - 200 m, 2) 200 - 1000 m or 3) >lkm), watering frequency (continuous or non-continuous watering), mode of presentation (categorised as water troughs of 1 « 100), or 2 (> 100 litres)), means of water transport categorised as none needed. manual, or carts/wheelbarrows/donkeys/bicycles. Total amount of feed offered, water offered. milk yield, live weight and condition score were also monitored. Mean amount of water offered per farm per day was 134 I. or 35. 6 11300 kg LWI day. However, the variability was high (range of 7 - 108 11300 kg LW/day). Of the farms surveyed, 60 % had on-farm water source, which was within a radius of 200 m. 40 % trekked between 0. 2 - 2. 5 km to fetch water for livestock. Only 25 % had water piped directly to the water trough. 55 % carried water manually by bucket while 20 % used draught power or bicycle or wheelbarrows to transport water. Small water troughs (20 - 1 - buckets) were used in 25 % of the farms surveyed to water dairy cattle. 50 % of the farms practised non-continuous watering and 55 % had no water storage facilities. Analysis of the data showed that source, distance to source, water transport means, water storage facilities, watering frequency, volume of water trough significantly affected {{the amount of water}} offered/day to dairy cattle (P< 0. 05). Distance to water source was related to quantity of water offered. with mean quantities of 43. 23 and 21 1 / 300 kg LW being offered to animals in the distance categories 1 - 3 cited above. Cows with on-farm water source received 43 1 compared to 22 1 offered in farms with off-farm water source. Mean quantities of 52. 30 and 25 1 / 300 kg lwt were offered to dairy cattle in farms with water piped directly to water trough, manual-hand bucket and those using draught/bicycle/wheelbarrow respectively. Watering frequency influenced water on offer with mean quantities of 491 / 300 kg lwt/day (continuous watering) and 21 - 1 / 300 kg lwt/day (non-continuous watering). Small water troughs restricted the amount of water on offer/day (21 1 I 300 kg lwt) compared to 39 1 I 300 kg 1 wt /day offered in farms with large water troughs. Dairy cows were offered a variety of feeds. Napier and other types of grasses were the main feeds constituting more than half (1. 581100 kg lwt) of the total feed offered. Dry maize stover was second to napier/grasses in importance with an average of 0. 567 kg / 100 kg lwt per day. Concentrates were offered in all farms to lactating cows at an average of 0. 4855 kg / 100 kg lwt per day. These included commercial dairy meal, cotton seed cake, bone meal, maize bran. <b>maize</b> <b>germ.</b> wheat bran and poultry litter. It was observed that dairy cattle in farms with on-farm water source, large water troughs, practicing continuous watering and those with water storage facilities were offered high amounts of water and produced significantly (P< 0. 05) more mille In addition, these farms were offered high amounts of concentrates and napier grass. In farms where high amount of dry maize stover was offered to dairy cattle, coupled with low water on offer, low milk yields were realised. This was observed in farms with small water troughs, offfarm water source and farms without piped water. General linear model analysis of the data indicated that the amount of water offered (l/ 300 kg LW/day), age, parity, body weight stage of lactation, body condition score and dry matter on offer had a significant effect on milk yield. Increasing amount of water offered increased milk yield. In conclusion. high amount of water. concentrates and napier/grass on offer resulted in high milk yields. These results highlight the increasing importance of ensuring adequate provision of drinking water as milk yields in dairy cows increase. In this context smallholder dairy farmers in Kiambu District should be advised {{to increase the amount of}} water offered to dairy cattle from the average 35 litres/ 300 kg LW/day currently offered to at least the recommended 60 litres per day. ...|$|E
