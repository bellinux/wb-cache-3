5000|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "scoop", [...] "scallop", or [...] "shave" [...] excisional biopsy, or [...] "shave excision". A trend has {{occurred}} in dermatology over the last 10 years with the advocacy of a deep shave excision of a pigmented lesion An author published {{the result of this}} method and advocated it as better than standard excision and less time consuming. The added economic benefit is that many surgeons bill the procedure as an excision, rather than a shave biopsy. This save the added time for hemostasis, instruments, and suture cost. The great disadvantage, seen years later is the numerous scallop scars, and a very difficult to deal with lesions called a [...] "recurrent melanocytic nevus". What has happened is that many [...] "shave" [...] excisions does not adequately penetrate the dermis or subcutanous fat enough to include the entire <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion.</b> Residual melanocytes regrow into the scar. The combination of scarring, inflammation, blood vessels, and atypical pigmented streaks seen in these recurrent nevus gives the perfect dermatoscopic picture of a melanoma. When a second physicians re-examine the patient, he or she {{has no choice but to}} recommend the reexcision of the scar. If one does not have access to the original pathology report, it is impossible to tell a recurring nevus from a severely dysplastic nevus or a melanoma. As the procedure is widely practiced, it is not unusual to see a patient with dozens of scallop scars, with as many as 20% of the scars showing residual pigmentation. The second issue with the shave excision is fat herniation, iatrogenic anetoderma, and hypertrophic scarring. As the deep shave excision either completely remove the full thickness of the dermis or greatly diminishing the dermal thickness, subcutanous fat can herniate outward or pucker the skin out in an unattractive way. In areas prone to friction, this can result in pain, itching, or hypertrophic scarring.|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{overcome}} subjectivity and {{variability in}} the interpretation of dermoscopic images, image analysis programs, enabling the numerical description of <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images, have been developed. Objectives: Our aim was to assess a method for the description of colours in <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images, based on the subdivision of image colours into red, green and blue clusters. Methods: Melanomas and naevi of the test set were described by means of 23 colour clusters previously selected by a training set comprising 369 <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images. The diagnostic performance obtained by this automated method was compared to sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of 4 dermatologists. Results: Colour cluster values significantly differed between melanomas and naevi. Moreover, sensitivity and specificity values of computer diagnosis were similar to those achieved by the dermatologists. Conclusion: Our image analysis program based on the assessment of one single parameter has the diagnostic accuracy of dermatologists employing dermoscopy on a regular basis...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} type of {{problems}} encountered in diagnosing <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> and to evaluate the contribution of expert review. Methods and results: Data from 1887 lesions submitted for consultation {{to one of the}} expert pathologists of the Dutch Melanoma Working Group Pathology Panel between 1991 and 2004 were analysed. Referring pathologists can voluntarily submit lesions which are difficult to classify to the panel. Most cutaneous <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> (n = 1217) were submitted with a presumed diagnosis by the referring pathologists. Relevant underdiagnoses of melanoma (in situ) and overdiagnoses of naevi were prevented in 12 % (144 / 1217) and 15 % (178 / 1217) of cases, respectively. Problematic <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were (i) spitzoid and dysplastic lesions, (ii) lesions with histological features that hampered the diagnosis such as regression, lymphocytic infiltrate, or a combination with other <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions,</b> and (iii) lesions with unusual clinical features, e. g. childhood melanoma. Remarkably, the features of the lesions that were submitted and the types of over- and under-diagnosis remained consistent from 1991 to 2004.

40|$|The {{histological}} {{differential diagnosis}} between melanotic schwannoma, primary leptomeningeal <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> and cellular blue nevus can be challenging. Correct diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma {{is important to}} select patients who need clinical evaluation for possible association with Carney complex. Recently, we described the presence of activating codon 209 mutations in the GNAQ gene in primary leptomeningeal <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Identical codon 209 mutations have been described in blue nevi. The aims {{of the present study}} were to (1) perform a histological review of a series of lesions (initially) diagnosed as melanotic schwannoma and analyze them for GNAQ mutations, and (2) test the diagnostic value of GNAQ mutational analysis in the differential diagnosis with leptomeningeal <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> We retrieved 25 cases that were initially diagnosed as melanotic schwannoma. All cases were reviewed using established criteria and analyzed for GNAQ codon 209 mutations. After review, nine cases were classified as melanotic schwannoma. GNAQ mutations were absent in these nine cases. The remaining cases were reclassified as conventional schwannoma (n = 9), melanocytoma (n = 4), blue nevus (n = 1) and lesions that could not be classified with certainty as melanotic schwannoma or melanocytoma (n = 2). GNAQ codon 209 mutations were present in 3 / 4 melanocytomas and the blue nevus. Including results from our previous study in leptomeningeal <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions,</b> GNAQ mutations were highly specific (100 %) for leptomeningeal <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> compared to melanotic schwannoma (sensitivity 43 %). We conclude that a detailed analysis of morphology combined with GNAQ mutational analysis can aid in the differential diagnosis of melanotic schwannoma with leptomeningeal <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background The {{assessment}} of colours {{is essential for}} the diagnosis of malignant melanoma (MM), both for pattern analysis on dermoscopic images, and when employing semiquantitative methods. Objectives To develop a computer program for colour assessment in MM images mimicking the human perception of lesion colours, and to compare the automatic colour evaluation with one performed by human observers. Methods A colour palette comprising six colour groups (black, dark brown, light brown, blue grey, red and white) was created by selecting single colour components inside <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images acquired by means of a digital videomicroscope, and was implemented in the image analysis program. Subsequently, colours were assessed by the computer program on 331 <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images composing our image database, and the results were compared with the evaluation of lesion colours performed by the clinician. Results The black, white and blue - grey colours were more frequently found in MMs than in naevi, both by the clinicians and by the computer. In MM images we observed 4. 27 +/- 1. 14 colours (mean +/- SD) per lesion, as opposed to 3. 22 +/- 0. 68 in naevi. The correlation between clinical and computer evaluation of the colours was very good, with a value of 0. 781 for overall assessment. Conclusions This innovative method for automatic colour evaluation, reproducing clinical {{assessment of}} <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> colours, may provide numerical parameters to be employed for computer-aided diagnosis of MM...|$|E

Objectives To investigate if the dermoscopic classification of atypical naevi is of any value to discriminate benign from malignant <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Methods Consecutive patients (n ¼ 205) were included with 254 suspicious <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions,</b> confirmed by histopathology at the Pigmented Lesions Clinic of the Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center, University of Tuebingen, Germany. In this retrospective study, dermoscopic images of benign and malignant <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were classified according to the dermoscopic classification of atypical naevi (reticular, globular, homogeneous or combinations of two of these) and pigmentation (uniform, central hyper- or hypopigmentation, eccentric peripheral hyper- or hypopigmentation, or multifocal hyper- or hypopigmentation). The threestructure type (reticular, globular and homogeneous) was additionally defined. Results Reticular, homogeneous and reticular–homogeneous types were significantly more frequent in naevi than in melanomas, whereas the three-structure type was significantly more frequent in melanomas (P < 0 Æ 001). A sensitivity of 86 Æ 7 %, specificity of 87 Æ 7 % and diagnostic accuracy of 87 Æ 4 % was obtained. Uniformly pigmented and centrally hyperpigmented types were significantly more frequent in naevi than in melanomas, whereas eccentric peripheral hyperpigmented and multifocal hyper- or hypopigmented types were significantly more frequent in melanomas (P < 0 Æ 001). Conclusions The dermoscopic classification of atypical naevi (Clark naevi) is useful to discriminate benign from malignant <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> The three-structure type and eccentric peripheral hyperpigmentation were significantly more frequently found in malignant than in benign <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> The knowledge of these two dermoscopic types should be helpful for the management of patients presenting with multiple <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} a multicentre study {{to test the}} validity of teledermoscopy for diagnosing acral melanoma and to evaluate inter-observer agreement on the classification of acral <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Dermoscopic images of 77 acral <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> (71 common <b>melanocytic</b> naevi and 6 melanomas) were sent by email to 11 dermatologists with different degrees of experience in dermoscopy. The observers analysed the images on a computer monitor to diagnose acral melanoma or atypical lesions and to categorize all lesions. All 11 observers, regardless of their degree of experience, obtained high values for sensitivity (mean 0. 91, SD 0. 09) and specificity (mean 0. 95, SD 0. 04) {{with regard to the}} diagnosis of melanoma. The inter-observer agreement was good to excellent (kappa 0. 49 - 0. 88) for the categorization of acral <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> All six melanomas were correctly classified as 2 ̆ 7 atypical pattern 2 ̆ 7 and all observers recommended surgical excision.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{computerized}} method for the identification and description of colour areas in <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images based on an approach mimicking the human perception of colours. A colour palette comprising six colour groups (black, dark brown, light brown, blue-grey, red and white) was created by selecting single colour components within <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images acquired using a digital videomicroscope, and was implemented in the image analysis program. For each colour region, the area, the distance from the lesion centroid, the spread, the colour area distribution in the internal and the external part of the lesion, and asymmetries were assessed on 604 <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> images in our image database. Black, white and blue-grey colour areas were detected more frequently in melanomas compared with naevi. Moreover, significant differences in colour descriptors were observed for each colour group, showing that colour areas are more unevenly distributed in melanomas compared with naevi. Using a discriminant analysis approach, the extension of dark, white and blue-grey areas and some descriptors of the distribution of the colour areas were identified as the most relevant colour parameters for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions. In conclusion, our automatic procedure breaks down the image into the colour areas used in the clinical examination process, and also supplies a description of their extension and distribution, with parameters that correlate with the clinical concepts of regularity and homogeneity...|$|E

40|$|Human {{melanoma}} {{cell lines}} {{were shown to}} express ligands for the natural cytotoxicity receptor, NKp 46, expressed by natural killer (NK) cells. We aimed to examine the expression of ligands for NKp 46 by various primary human melanocytic cells and <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> Sections from primary nevi and melanomas were tested for expression of NKp 46 ligands employing chimeric NKp 46 -Fc for staining. The melanocytes present in the reticular dermis were negative for NKp 46 ligands in common nevi; in malignant <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions,</b> the deeper melanocytes were focally positive. In dermoepidermal junction of all <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions,</b> the melanocytes showed enhanced expression of NKp 46 ligands. Melanophages in all lesions were consistently positive for NKp 46 ligands. These observations establish the expression of NKp 46 ligands by primary-transformed melanocytes. Normal melanocytes did not express ligands to NKp 46. Therefore, the results show (i) a correlation between the malignant potential of the lesion and the expression of NKp 46 ligands in the reticular dermis, and (ii) enhanced expression of NKp 46 ligands in the active proliferation zone (dermoepidermal junction) of nevi and melanomas. Ligands to NKp 46 were expressed on the membrane and within the cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The 'gold standard' for the {{diagnosis}} of <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> is dermatopathology. Although most of the diagnostic criteria are clearly defined, the interpretation of histopathology slides {{may be subject to}} interobserver variability. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the variability among dermatopathologists in the interpretation of clinically difficult <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> METHODS: This study used the database of MelaFind®, a computer-vision system for {{the diagnosis}} of melanoma. All lesions were surgically removed and sent for independent evaluation by four dermatopathologists. Agreement was calculated using kappa statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1, 249 pigmented <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were included. There was a substantial agreement among expert dermatopathologists: two-category kappa was 0. 80 (melanoma vs. non-melanoma) and three-category kappa was 0. 62 (malignant vs. borderline vs. benign <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions).</b> The agreement was significantly greater for patients ≥ 40 years (three-category kappa = 0. 67) than for younger patients (kappa = 0. 49). In addition, the agreement was significantly lower for patients with atypical mole syndrome (AMS) (kappa = 0. 31) than for patients without AMS (kappa = 0. 76). LIMITATIONS: The data were limited by the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the MelaFind® study. This might represent a selection bias. The agreement was evaluated using kappa statistics. This is a standard method for evaluating agreement among pathologists, but might be considered controversial by some statisticians. CONCLUSIONS: Expert dermatopathologists have a high level of agreement when diagnosing clinically difficult <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions.</b> However, even among expert dermatopathologists, the current 'gold standard' is not perfect. Our results indicate that lesions from younger patients and patients with AMS may be more problematic for the dermatopathologists, suggesting that improved diagnostic criteria are needed for such patients...|$|R

In order to study me inheritance of cutaneous <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> in the Munich Miniature Swine Troll, we established the F 1 -, F 2 -, B IDL-, and B ITroll -generations, starting with one melanoma-bearing MMS Troll boar and four non-affected sows of the German Landrace (DL) as founder animals. A total of 176 animals were available, 27 in the F 1 -, 111 in the F 2 -, 19 in the B |DL-, and 14 in the B ITroll -generation. Benign <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> with two distinct forms of basal melanocytic hyperplasia or nests of hyperplastic melanocytes like in human junctional nevus were observed in 10 (41, 7 %) F 1 -, 20 (18 %) F 2 -, 2 (10, 5 %) B IDL-, and 7 (50 %) B ITroll -animals. Malignant melanomas were found in four (3, 6 %) F 2 - and one (7, 1 %) B ITroll -animals, but did not occur in the F 1 - and B IDL -generations. The observed segregation pattern suggests a different mode of inheritance for benign <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> and melanomas, respectively. An influence of SLA haplotypes could not be observed. However, a significant influence of coat colour on the occurence of melanoma could be found in the F 2 -generation. While around 65 % of F 2 -animals had the German Landrace dominant white colour, melanomas were only found in black and red animals. Benign lesions of the junctional nevus type, too, were only found in black animals. A possible explanation is the lack of melanocytes in the skin of dominant white pigs caused by a mutation of the KIT-gene, which leads to a failure of melanoblast migration and developmen...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To report {{impression}} cytology (IC) {{results of}} clinically diagnosed ocular surface melanocytic lesions. Methods: Ten {{patients with a}} clinical diagnosis of an ocular surface <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> underwent IC using cellulose acetate strips and Periodic acid Schiff-Papanicolaou staining. Excisional biopsy of lesions was performed in case of observing atypical cells on IC or at the patient's request, and excised specimens were subjected to histopathological analysis. Agreement between clinical diagnoses and IC results and between IC results and histopathology were evaluated. Results: Clinical diagnoses were nevi in 6, primary acquired melanosis (PAM) with atypia/melanoma in 2, and atypical nevus versus pigmented conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in 2 cases. IC results were suggestive of a benign nevus in 7, PAM with atypia/melanoma in 2 and CIN versus an atypical epithelioid type <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesion</b> in 1 case. IC results {{were consistent with the}} clinical diagnoses in 9 cases (Cohen's kappa index of 0. 83) and excluded CIN in 1. Histopathology in 6 cases disclosed benign melanonevus in 3, malignant melanoma in the context of PAM with atypia in 2, and CIN in 1 case.

Results Twelve newly detected primary melanomas were confirmed in 11 patients within 27 weeks of selective BRAF blockade. In addition, 10 nevi developed of which nine were dysplastic. All <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> were BRAF wild type. Explorations revealed that expression of cyclin D 1 and pAKT was increased in newly developed primary melanomas compared with nevi (P =. 01 and P =. 03, respectively). There was no NRAS mutation in common nevi, but BRAF mutations were frequent. Conclusion Malignant melanocytic tumors might develop with increased frequency in patients treated with selective BRAF inhibitors supporting a mechanism of BRAF therapy–induced growth and tumorigenesis. Careful surveillance of <b>melanocytic</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients receiving class I RAF inhibitors seems warranted...|$|R
