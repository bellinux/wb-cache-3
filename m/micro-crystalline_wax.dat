30|$|According to Table  8, AARE for systems # 1 and # 2 {{is lower}} than all the {{previous}} developed thermodynamic models except the MS models of Ghanaei et al. (2007) {{which is based on}} the predictive Wilson model for these systems. Considering the fact that wax deposits are mainly composed of components with a carbon number of 18 – 36 (for macro-crystalline waxes) or 30 – 60 (for <b>micro-crystalline</b> <b>waxes),</b> concentration of wax forming compounds decreased with corresponding increase in composition of non-waxing components in mixture no. 7 and beyond. Therefore, the ability of model to predict WDT decreased and the difference between experimental and predicted results increased. Unlike systems # 1 and # 2, average absolute deviation of the new developed MS model for systems # 3 and # 4 {{is lower than}} all other thermodynamic models. Results show that as carbon number of the systems increases, the AARE of developed model decreases. For 56 experimental data point of four ternary systems, this model has AARE of 0.52 % which is the lowest among other models. Table  8 indicates that the error of thermodynamic models of Ghanaei et al. (2007) (five models), Nichita et al. (2001), and Lira-Galeana et al. (1996) have, respectively, 1.24, 1.24, 1.24, 0.99, 0.75, 1.24, and 12.3 % AARE which is higher than the new developed MS model. In addition, results reveal that consideration of PNA analysis is essential for accurate estimation of equilibrium conditions.|$|R
30|$|Understanding of wax {{formation}} {{potential in}} waxy oil samples {{is necessary for}} avoiding wax deposition during oil and condensate production. Wax deposition increases pressure drop and power requirements (Misra et al. 1995), pig stuck (Bai and Bai 2005) and decreases effective flow area of the pipeline which causes oil production reduction (Jalalnezhad and Kamali 2016). To prevent these problems, it is required to predict wax precipitation {{as a function of}} composition and thermodynamic conditions correctly. Various experimental studies were carried out for determining WDT and wax appearance temperature (WAT) of crude oils and condensate samples. Wang et al. (2003) used a light transmittance technique to measure the WAT and WDT of paraffinic mixtures of C 24 and C 36 in C 10. Binary mixtures were prepared by dissolving 5  wt% of C 24 or C 36 in C 10. Poly n-butyl methacrylate (nBuMA), poly n-nonyl methacrylate (NMA), poly n-octadecyl methacrylate (ODMA), polyalkyleneimine (D), and unknown (E) solvent were used as inhibitor. Their results show that solvents that decrease WAT also increase WDT of C 24 and C 36 mixtures. In addition, the ability of inhibitors for reducing the WAT of mixtures containing C 24 was higher than those which comprised from C 36. In addition, the order of inhibitor efficiency for WAT reduction was E[*]>[*]D[*]>[*]ODMA[*]>[*]NMA[*]=[*]nBuMA. Several experimental studies were performed to measure wax formation condition in multi-component systems. In another study, Nitin and Anil (2004) studied the liquid–solid-phase equilibrium of waxy mixtures containing 6 – 22  wt% wax. These samples consisted n-alkanes with carbon number in range of C 20 –C 40. In addition, C 16 and Norpar 13 which comprised from mixture of C 9 –C 16 were employed as solvents. They reported that measured WDT data were higher than the WAT values by <[*] 3  °C. Results of these studies show that the highest and lowest WDT values which, respectively, obtained for 22  wt% wax in C 16 and 6  wt% wax in Norpar 13 are 41 and 26  °C. In addition, it was observed that wax-Norpar 13 mixture had lower WDT compared to mixture that used C 16 as solvent. Martos et al. (2008) characterized wax samples precipitated from two crude oils at different temperatures by optical microscopy, elemental analysis, HNMR spectroscopy, DSC, and mass spectroscopy. Two naphthenic and paraffinic oil samples and their precipitated fractions were utilized for investigation. An HNMR spectrometer was used to quantify different types of hydrogen atoms. The temperature profile for DSC tests varied in range of 353 to 153 at 3  K min− 1 and vice versa. Two different techniques including gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectroscopy were employed for n-paraffin distribution of each fraction. They reported that crude oils had lower WDT values compared to corresponding precipitated samples because precipitated fractions had higher wax concentration. In addition, they observed that fractions which precipitated at lower temperatures had lower WDT, because lighter components crystallize at lower temperatures. The effect of wax properties of different oil mixtures from Iran reservoirs on shape, WAT, and crystals morphology was investigated by Taheri-Shakib et al. (2018). The crude oil samples had asphaltene content in range of 0.67 – 16.19  wt% and wax content between 2.52 and 8.5  wt%. They used cross-polarized microscopy (CPM) and viscometer for WAT measurement. Their studies showed that naphthenic waxes comprised from polar compounds, while paraffinic waxes not contained from polar/naphthenic compounds. They reported that crystalline form affected and WAT increased by increasing asphaltene content. In addition, their results showed that WAT of semi-micro-crystalline samples increased by increasing sample polarity. In addition, the authors found that WAT values can be reduced by eliminating the oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) elements in the waxy mixtures. In addition, they observed that in waxy mixtures with high and low WAT values, wax carbon content was about 80 and 90 %, respectively. Therefore, higher carbon content and lower SNO elements increase the non-polarity of wax and reduce the WAT. Using a micro-DSC, couple of CPM and image processing method and rheometer, Japper-Jaafar (2016) measured WAT of three crude oils from South East Asia. These oils were classified into mild, medium, and severe waxy crude oils. The effects of cooling rate on WAT and wax aggregation from various equipment under cooling rate of 1  °C min− 1 are explored and discussed in detail. Their finding shows that the wax type, cooling rate, and shear rate affected the WAT values significantly. In addition, due to the presence of <b>micro-crystalline</b> <b>waxes,</b> they observed that micro-DSC technique detects wax crystals at higher temperatures compared to CPM and rheometry. In addition, their studies showed that wax crystal aggregation reduced by increasing cooling rate and this effect increased by increasing wax content of crude oil. Finally, rheological investigations indicated that WAT of oil samples is shear-dependent when paraffin content is higher than 23.89  wt%.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} combined {{analysis performed}} in pure waxes and paraffin based mixtures {{that can be}} used as fuels in hybrid engines. The feasibility of the use of such materials as fuels in hybrid rockets is under study at SPLab in Politecnico di Milano and at the DLR Institute of Space Propulsion in Germany. Density measurements of pure waxes were performed using a dilatometer. An experimental facility was set up and, after preliminary measurements and calibration, a repeatable procedure was implemented. The implemented instrumentation set up allowed the measure of density in softening and melting intervals. Mechanical uniaxial tensile tests were performed according to Standard ISO 527 - 1, on pure macro paraffin and microcrystalline wax and on these waxes doped with stearic acid and graphite; elastic modulus, elongation and maximum stress were calculated. Data indicates that ductile rupture is achievable even on pure tested macro paraffin. Moreover <b>micro-crystalline</b> <b>wax</b> was mixed with a synthetic wax characterized by higher nominal melting temperature in order to improve the softening point up to higher temperatures without compromising regression rate values. Thermal, rheological, viscosimetric and ballistic experiments were performed on this new formulation, promising for applications characterized by wide temperature ranges...|$|E
