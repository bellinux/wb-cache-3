50|$|A {{mortgage}} lender is {{an investor}} that lends money secured by a <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> In today's world, most lenders sell the loans they {{write on the}} secondary mortgage market. When they sell the mortgage, they earn revenue called Service Release Premium. Typically, {{the purpose of the}} loan is for the borrower to purchase that same real estate. As the mortgagee, the lender has the right to sell the property to pay off the loan if the borrower fails to pay.|$|E

50|$|Another {{strategy}} used {{by corporations}} issuing clap notes to exclude small-time speculators is a waiting period {{before the first}} payment is made. Strictly speaking, clap notes are private <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> As such, the payments made to the investors from the “first hand” are remitted monthly. However, since the interest rates on clap notes are so attractive, individuals {{might be tempted to}} get low-interest loans from banks and other sources under false pretenses and invest the money in a clap note. A four- to six-month waiting period {{at the beginning of the}} note term is intended to discourage such behavior.|$|R
50|$|The alliances {{created through}} his growing <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> {{business}} led to investments in motion picture theaters, building and loan associations, and mortgage financing. By the early 1920s he controlled 27 building and loan associations. In 1924, Greenfield and his father-in-law Sol C. Kraus formed Bankers Bond & Mortgage Company to handle first <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> in Philadelphia. After expanding to the New York City market, {{the firm was}} renamed Bankers Bond & Mortgage Company of America. By 1930 his <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> concern, known as Albert M.

50|$|A {{mortgage}} bond is a bond {{backed by a}} pool of <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> a <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> asset such as a house. More generally, bonds which are secured by the pledge of specific assets are called {{mortgage bond}}s. Mortgage bonds can pay interest in either monthly, quarterly or semiannual periods.

500|$|The {{university}} {{began in}} earnest in 1925 when George E. Merrick, the founder of Coral Gables, gave [...] and nearly $5million, ($ million, adjusted for current inflation) to the effort. These contributions were land contracts and <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> that had been sold in the city. The university was chartered on April 18, 1925 by the Circuit Court for Dade County. By the fall of 1926, when the first class of 372 students enrolled at UM, the land boom had collapsed, and hopes for a speedy recovery were dashed by a major hurricane. For the next 15years the university barely remained solvent. The construction of the first building on campus, {{now known as the}} Merrick Building, was left half built for over two decades due to economic difficulties. In the meantime, classes were held at the nearby Anastasia Hotel, with partitions separating classrooms, giving the university the early nickname of [...] "Cardboard College." ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this study to examine the nature of the capital {{acquisition}} problems facing the farm operator who wants to make erosion-control oriented adjustments in his farming system as well as to examine the nature of the adjustments to be made. The study is designed to explore: (1) the amount of capital required for the adjustments; (2) the timing of capital investments associated with the adjustments; (3) the extent to which an individual can be expected to meet these problems with his own resources; (4) the extent to which credit agencies serving agriculture are assisting him; and (5) the extent to which these agencies could further adapt or expand their lending policies to help meet this problem. Four distinct groups of farmers are considered in this study: (1) full owner-operators who are free of debt; (2) moderately encumbered owner-operators who have a <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> their <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> but have no <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> their chattels; (3) heavily encumbered owner-operators who have a <b>mortgage</b> <b>on</b> both <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and chattels and (4) tenant operators.

25|$|The bank {{offered the}} first {{debentures}} in Canadian banking history on May 29, 1967. The Bank Act of 1967 {{ushered in a}} period of enormous change on the Canadian financial scene. For the first time, banks were permitted to charge more than six-percent interest on loans, encouraging a new emphasis on personal and specialized consumer loans. More significantly, banks could now make <b>mortgage</b> loans <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and the <b>mortgage</b> loan portfolio quickly gained enormous significance.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{argues for}} federal {{preemption}} of state procedures governing the foreclosure of mortgages and security interests in rents. While {{it also suggests}} that federal action limiting or prohibiting state anti-deficiency legislation may be appropriate, it leaves this issue to future consideration. Thus, its major focus is to advocate the congressional adoption of both Uniform Nonjudicial Foreclosure Act (UNFA) and Uniform Assignment of Rents Act (UARA) to make them available to all lenders nationwide. However, {{the federal government has}} a special stake in greater uniformity for its own account. This is especially the case as to <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> The fallout of the economic crisis of {{the past year and a}} half has made it the owner or guarantor of millions of mortgages. It will be confronted with an overwhelming number of foreclosures that will survive all attempts at modification. Given the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now wards of the federal government, the federal stake in efficient and fair foreclosure procedures has become compelling. Forcing the federal government to foreclose possibly hundreds of thousands of mortgages judicially in many states seems almost surreal. Given the enormous cost of this crisis to the federal taxpayers, the government should not be held hostage to arcane and outmoded foreclosure procedures. Even in nonjudicial foreclosure states, the federalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac probably necessitates changes in some statutes to comply with constitutional due process mandates. At the very minimum, the federal Single Family and Multifamily Acts with minor modifications should be made available to all federal agencies...|$|R
50|$|Interest {{rates for}} {{commercial}} mortgages may be fixed-rate or floating rate. Fixed-rate <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> stabilized commercial <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> are generally priced {{based on a}} spread to swaps, with the swap spread matched to the term of the loan. Market interest rates as well as underwriting factors greatly affect the interest rate quoted on a particular piece of commercial <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> Interest rates for commercial mortgages are usually higher than those for residential mortgages.|$|R
40|$|Most <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> income-producing <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> (as {{distinct}} from owner-occupied housing) contain clauses restricting early payment of the loan. These clauses are highly controversial, and borrowers often resist their enforcement. While other writers have discussed prepayment clauses {{in the recent}} legal literature, my objectives {{in this article are}} to advance this discussion in three respects: first, to provide an economic perspective <b>on</b> <b>mortgage</b> prepayment as support for a set of legal recommendations; second, to consider whether the bankruptcy of the mortgagor should affect enforceability of a prepayment fee clause; and third, to analyze the cumulative effect of the presence in the same mortgage documents of both a clause imposing a fee upon prepayment of the loan and a clause accelerating the loan in the event of default, sale, eminent domain taking, or hazard insurance payoff...|$|R

5000|$|The fury of this {{uprising}} {{destroyed the}} organization of the Jewish communities in Belarus. The survivors who returned to their old homes {{in the latter half of}} the 17th century were practically destitute. The wars which raged constantly in the Lithuanian territory brought ruin to the entire country and deprived the Jews of the opportunity to earn more than a bare livelihood. The intensity of their struggle for existence left them no time to reestablish the conditions which had existed up to 1648. John Casimir (1648-1668) sought to ameliorate their condition by granting various concessions to the Jewish communities of Lithuania. Attempts to return to the old order in the communal organization were not wanting, as is evident from contemporary documents. Thus in 1672, Jewish elders from various towns and villages in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania secured a charter from King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki (1669-1673), decreeing [...] "that on account of the increasing number of Jews guilty of offenses against the Szlachta and other Christians, which result in the enmity of the Christians toward the Jews, and because of the inability of the Jewish elders to punish such offenders, who are protected by the lords, the king permits the kahals to summon the criminals before the Jewish courts for punishment and exclusion from the community when necessary." [...] The efforts to resurrect the old power of the kahals were not successful. The impoverished Jewish merchants, having no capital of their own, were compelled to borrow money from the nobility, from churches, congregations, monasteries, and various religious orders. Loans from the latter were usually for an unlimited period and were secured by <b>mortgages</b> <b>on</b> the <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> of the kahal. The kahals thus became hopelessly indebted to the clergy and the nobility.|$|R
40|$|CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) are {{securities}} {{backed by}} pools of <b>mortgage</b> loans <b>on</b> commercial <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> properties. The primary attractiveness of the CMBS market {{is that it}} provides liquidity and diversification to commercial <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investors and ready access to capital for commercial lenders. CMBS are structured such that a master servicer oversees {{the administration of the}} underlying loans and the distribution of the cash flows to the tranche investors. One of these functions involves the administration and disposition of troubled loans. When a loan in a CMBS deal fails to perform as expected, the master servicer sends the loan to a “special servicer. ” The special servicer has wide latitude to foreclose on the loan or modify the loan terms in an effort to maximize the cash flows to the CMBS investors. Since the first-loss investors have the most at stake when a loan fails to perform, these investors often control the appointment of the special servicer. In fact, the special servicer often holds a portion of the first-loss piece in order to properly align the incentives of the investors and the special servicer. As such, the special servicer may not be concerned with the borrower's position, but rather may undertake action...|$|R
