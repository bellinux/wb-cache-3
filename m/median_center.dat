40|$|For regular {{parametric}} problems, we {{show how}} <b>median</b> <b>centering</b> {{of the maximum}} likelihood estimate {{can be achieved by}} a simple modification of the score equation. For a scalar parameter of interest, the estimator is equivariant under interest respecting parameterizations and third-order median unbiased. With a vector parameter of interest, componentwise equivariance and third-order <b>median</b> <b>centering</b> are obtained. Like Firth's (1993, Biometrika) implicit method for bias reduction, the new method does not require finiteness of the maximum likelihood estimate and is effective in preventing infinite estimates. Simulation results for continuous and discrete models, including binary and beta regression, confirm that the method succeeds in achieving componentwise <b>median</b> <b>centering</b> and in solving the infinite estimate problem, while keeping comparable dispersion and the same approximate distribution as its main competitors.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of {{the tens of thousands}} of kinds of plants on Earth is an important and difficult task. If we use a nearest neighbour classifier to solve it, millions of training data are needed to obtain a high correct recognition rate. However, the corresponding classification process is quite time-consuming. We propose a new approach using a moving <b>median</b> <b>centers</b> hypersphere technique to recognize different plant leaves. With this new method, we can successfully decrease the classification time, and reduce the storage size without sacrificing the classification accuracy. Experimental results using real data show that this method is really efficient and effective in classifying different plant leaves.

At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pounds. This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd's individual judgments can be modeled as a probability distribution of responses with the <b>median</b> <b>centered</b> near the true value of the quantity to be estimated.|$|R

First, gene expression values are <b>median</b> <b>centered,</b> setting each gene’s median expression value to zero. Second, the median absolute deviation (MAD) is calculated and scaled to 1 by dividing each gene expression value by its MAD. Of note, median and MAD were used for transformation as opposed to {{mean and standard deviation}} so that outlier expression values do not unduly influence the distribution estimates, and are thus preserved post-normalization. Third, the 75 th, 90 th, and 95 th percentiles of the transformed expression values are tabulated for each gene and then genes are rank-ordered by their percentile scores, providing a prioritized list of outlier profiles...|$|R

Comparative studies of bark texture feature extraction are performed for the four texture analysis methods such as the gray level run-length method (RLM), co-occurrence matrices method (COMM) and histogram method (HM) as well as auto-correlation method (ACM). Specifically, we use three classifiers of nearest neighbor (l-NN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and moving <b>median</b> <b>centers</b> (MMC) hypersphere classifiers to verify {{the validity of the}} extracted bark texture features. To gain good results we added to color information that proved very efficient. Moreover, the experimental results also demonstrate that from the viewpoint of the recognition accuracy and computational complexity, the COMM method is superior to the other three methods.

In the classical approaches weights are assigned to existing facilities expressing the importance of the new facilities for the existing ones.

This approach is shown to be a generalization of the <b>median,</b> <b>center</b> and centdian objective functions. In addition, this approach allows to formulate completely new location models. Efficient algorithms as well as structure results for this algebraic approach for location problems are presented. Extensions to the multifacility and restricted case are also considered...|$|E

Since the maintenance of exact <b>medians</b> and <b>center</b> points can be quite expensive, we also show how to maintain "-approximate <b>medians</b> and <b>center</b> points and argue that the latter can be made to be much more stable under motion.

Select methods were further analyzed on existing immune response data of Boldrick et al. (2002, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 972 – 977). Based on the simulations, we recommend the ANOVA variants of Cui and Churchill.

Our proposed GSVD-based differential expression method {{was shown to}} detect subtle changes. ANOVA combined with GSVD was consistent on background-normalized simulation data. GSVD with empirical Bayes was consistent without background correction. Based on the Boldrick et al. data, ANOVA is best suited to detect changes in temporal data, while GSVD and empirical Bayes effectively detect individual spikes or overall shifts, respectively. For methods tested on simulation data, lowess after background correction improved results.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{locating}} a median path of limited length on a tree {{under the condition that}} some existing facilities are already located. The existing facilities may be located at any subset of vertices. Upper and lower bounds are proposed for both the discrete and continuous models. In the discrete model, a median path is not allowed to contain partial edges. In the continuous model, a median path may contain partial edges. The proposed upper bounds for these two models are O(nlog n) and O(nlog n�(n)), respectively. They improve the previous ones from O(nlog 2 n) and O(n 2), respectively. The proposed lower bounds are both �(nlog n). The lower bounds show that our upper bound for the discrete model is optimal and the margin for possible improvement on our upper bound for the continuous model is slim.
