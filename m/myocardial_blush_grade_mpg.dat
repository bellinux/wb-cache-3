Results were related to global wall motion index (GWMI) at 4 weeks. MCE I hour after PTCA showed good correlation with GWMI at 4 weeks (r = 0. 684, p < 0. 001) and was in an analysis of variance the best parameter to predict GWMI 4 weeks after AMI. The ST-segment elevation index was close in its predictive value. Considering only invasive parameters of reperfusion <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> was the best predictor of GWMI at 4 weeks (R- 2 = 0. 3107, p < 0. 001). A MCE perfusion defect size at 24 hours of {{greater than or equal to}} 50 % of the MCE perfusion defect size before PTCA was used to define myocardial nonreperfusion.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between time-to-treatment and myocardial perfusion in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by primary angioplasty. Methods and results Our study population consisted of 1072 patients with STEMI treated by primary angioplasty from 1997 to 2001. Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by using ST-segment resolution and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade.</b> Time-to-treatment {{was defined as the}} time from symptom-onset to the first balloon inflation. Time-to-treatment was significantly associated with the extent of ST-segment resolution, <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade,</b> enzymatic infarct size, and 1 -year mortality. After adjustment for baseline confounding factors, time-to-treatment was still associated with impaired ST-segment resolution (adjusted OR [95 % CI]= 1. 01 [1. 01 – 1. 02], p< 0. 001 p< 0. 001) and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> (adjusted OR [95 % CI]= 1. 01 [1. 01 – 1. 02], p< 0. 0001 p< 0. 0001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included 310 patients with SMVA that we split into two populations: diabetic-non hypertensive (164 patients) and non-diabetichypertensive (146 patients). We calculated, on angiographic images of each patient, TIMI Frame Count (TFC), <b>Myocardial</b> <b>Blush</b> <b>Grade</b> (MBG) and Total <b>Myocardial</b> <b>Blush</b> Score (TMBS) using the protocol described by Gibson and Yusuf.

METHODS: A total of 95 subjects with chest pain and uninjured coronary arteries were recruited into the study: 80 subjects were hypertensive while 15 subjects were normotensive. The hypertensive subjects were divided into two subgroups: hypertensive subjects with positive scintigraphy and hypertensive subjects with negative scintigraphy. The TFC, a quantitative method of assessing coronary artery flow, the MBG, an assessment of the level of tissue perfusion, and the Total <b>Myocardial</b> <b>Blush</b> Score (TMBS), the sum of the <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grades</b> of each coronary territory, were evaluated on the coronary angiogram of every patient. RESULTS: The TFC was higher (p< 0. 05) in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. The MBG and the TMBS were lower (p< 0. 05) in hypertensive subjects than in normotensive subjects. The TFC was higher (p< 0. 05) in positive scintigraphy than in negative scintigraphy. The MBG was lower (p< 0. 05) in positive scintigraphy than in negative scintigraphy. The Spearman rank correlation test showed that the TFC and the MBG was inversely associated. CONCLUSION: The hypertensive subjects had impaired coronary artery flow and myocardial perfusion, documented by the TFC, MBG and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy.

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the impact on myocardial perfusion and infarct size as assessed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) of a manual thrombectomy device, Export Medtronic (EM) (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), as adjunctive therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in a subset of patients with anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Background PPCI may cause thrombus dislodgment, leading to microvascular damage. Methods One hundred seventy-five STEMI patients were randomly assigned to standard percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 87) or EM-PCI (n = 88). The primary end points were the occurrence of <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> ? 2 and the rate of 90 -min ST-segment resolution > 70 %. The CE-MRI substudy was performed in 75 patients with anterior STEMI to assess microvascular obstruction and infarct size. Results <b>Myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> ? 2 and ST-segment resolution occurred more frequently in the EM-PCI group (88 % vs. 60 %, p = 0. 001; and 64 % vs. 39 %, p = 0. 001). In the acute phase, microvascular obstruction extent was significantly lower in the EM-PCI group and at 3 months, infarct size was significantly reduced only in the EM-PCI group. A lower incidence of cardiac death in the EM-PCI group (4. 6 % vs. 0 %, log-rank test p = 0. 02) was observed at 9 months. Conclusions Thrombectomy prevents thrombus embolization and preserves microvascular integrity reducing infarct size, and it therefore represents an useful adjunctive therapy in PPCI...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the "Quantitative Blush Evaluator" (QuBE) score is associated with measures of myocardial reperfusion in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated in two hospitals with 24 / 7 coronary intervention facilities. Background: QuBE is an open source computer program to quantify myocardial perfusion. Although QuBE has shown to be practical and feasible in the patients enrolled in the Thrombus Aspiration during Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study (TAPAS), QuBE has not yet been verified on reperfusion outcomes of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients treated in other catheterization laboratories. Methods: Core lab adjudicated angiographic outcomes and QuBE values were assessed on angiograms of patients who were enrolled in the PRoximal Embolic Protection in Acute myocardial infarction and Resolution of ST-Elevation (PREPARE) trial. ST-segment resolution immediately after PCI measured by continuous ST Holter monitoring was calculated by a blinded core lab. Results: The QuBE score could be assessed on 229 of the 284 angiograms (81 %) and was significantly associated with visually assessed <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> (P < 0. 0001). Patients with improved postprocedural Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-graded flow, <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade,</b> ST-segment resolution immediately after PCI, or a small infarct size measured by peak CK-MB had a significant better QuBE score.

Methods: A total of 40 consecutive patients with ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) were selected. They underwent treatment according to the surgeon’s discretion to either standard PCI or PCI with thrombus aspiration Catheter. Primary end points {{of the study were}} ST Segment resolution (STR) > 70 % and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> (MBG) > 2. Results: The base line clinical and procedural characteristics were same for both the groups. In the post intervention comparison the thrombus aspiration group was found to have significantly better outcomes as compared to the standard PCI group with regards to TIMI flow grade (p = 0. 009) and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> (p = 0. 001). Considering the criteria for MBG and STR together, the thrombus aspiration was found to have significantly better outcome than the standard PCI group (p = 0. 017).

40|$|The role of glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) {{infusion}} in {{the management}} of acute coronary syndrome is controversial. Limited data are available on the effects of adjunctive high-dose GIK (30 % glucose, 50 IU of insulin, 80 mEq of potassium chloride infused at 1. 5 ml/kg/hour over 24 hours) on myocardial perfusion and left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In this prospective study, 73 patients were randomized to receive GIK infusion (n = 40) or saline (placebo, n = 33) in addition to standard therapy. The primary end points were myocardial perfusion after PCI and LV remodeling at 6 months. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> were evaluated before and after reperfusion treatment.

40|$|Microvascular {{obstruction}} {{seems to}} predict poor outcome in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We analyzed whether serum thromboxane B 2, a stable metabolite of thromboxane A 2, may be implicated in post-PCI microvascular obstruction. We enrolled 91 patients (74 males, 66 ± 10 years) on chronic low-dose aspirin therapy (aspirin, 100 mg daily) scheduled for elective PCI and {{randomly assigned to}} receive aspirin reload (325 mg orally, n= 46) or no reload (control group, n= 45) ≥ 1 hour before elective PCI. Serum levels of thromboxane B 2, reperfusion indexes (corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade),</b> and serum cardiac troponin I were assessed before and after PCI. Serum thromboxane B 2 significantly increased after 120 minutes (P= 0. 0447) from PCI in control but not in aspirin reload group. After PCI, both groups showed a statistically significant reduction in corrected Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count more evident in aspirin reload group (P= 0. 0023). Moreover, after PCI, 61 % of patients allocated to aspirin reload and only 32 % of patients allocated to control group reached normal microcirculatory reperfusion (<b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> grade= 3); patients with <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> grade= 3 exhibited lower values of serum thromboxane B 2 compared with those with <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> < 3 (P= 0. 05). Periprocedural cardiac troponin I significantly increased (F= 3. 64; P= 0. 01334) and correlated with serum thromboxane B 2 (ρ= 0. 31; P= 0. 0413) in control but not in aspirin reload group. In addition, left ventricular ejection fraction significantly increased after PCI only in the aspirin reload group (P= 0. 0005). Aspirin loading dose before elective PCI improves myocardial reperfusion and injury indexes, suggesting a possible role of platelet thromboxane A 2 in microvascular occlusion.

METHODS: This was an observational, prospective study that included 398 patients admitted to a tertiary center for percutaneous coronary intervention within 3 to 24 hours after thrombolysis with tenecteplase. ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 01791764 RESULTS: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5. 8 %. Compared with patients who survived, patients who died {{were more likely to}} be older, have higher rates of diabetes and chronic renal failure, have a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and demonstrate more evidence of heart failure (Killip class III or IV).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} and compare recently suggested parameters of reperfusion after angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for risk stratification during long-term follow-up. BackgroundAbnormal myocardial perfusion has a detrimental impact on survival. Several parameters of reperfusion have been evaluated in controlled study populations for risk stratification. MethodsIn 253 consecutive patients undergoing intervention in AMI on a native coronary vessel, angiographic <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> (MBG), corrected TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) frame count (CTFC) and persistent ST-segment elevation (STE) were determined to evaluate reperfusion. This was a high-risk population, including referral for treatment failure at a primary center in 29. 2 %, failed thrombolysis in 22. 1 % and cardiogenic shock in 13. 4 % of cases. ResultsIn addition to age, patient referral, LBBB and heart rate on admission, MBG 0 to 1 (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 23, p 2 leads (OR = 3. 46, p = 0. 010) were univariate predictors of mortality during a 22. 1 ± 15. 6 months follow-up. <b>Myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> 0 to 1 (OR = 2. 17, p = 0. 033) and persistent STE (OR = 3. 61, p = 0. 017) persisted as independent predictors of mortality, whereas CTFC failed. Differences in mortality between reperfusion groups at 30 days remained throughout the complete follow-up. In sequential Cox models, the predictive power of clinical data alone for mortality (model chi-squared 55. 8) was strengthened by adding MBG (model chi-squared 64. 2) and ECG postintervention (model chi-squared 69. 2). ConclusionsMyocardial <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> 0 to 1 and persistent STE are independent predictors for long-term mortality after angioplasty in AMI.

MethodsThe FINESSE-ANGIO substudy compared {{the effects of the}} 3 treatment strategies on patency (TIMI [Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction] flow grade 2 / 3) of the IRA at basal coronary angiography. The secondary efficacy end points were corrected TIMI frame count, percentage of patients achieving TIMI flow grade 3, and the percentage achieving <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> 2 / 3 of the IRA at post-PCI angiography. All angiographies were evaluated at a central core laboratory. ResultsOf the 2, 452 FINESSE patients, 637 were included in the FINESSE-ANGIO substudy. Patients in the combination-facilitated group exhibited significantly higher rates of baseline IRA patency compared with the abciximab-facilitated and the primary PCI groups (76. 1 % vs. 43. 7 % and 32. 7 %, respectively; p < 0. 0001 for both; p = 0. 025 abciximab-facilitated vs. primary PCI).

Plasma MPO levels were measured in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (n = 160) who had undergone percutaneous coronary stenting within 12 hours of symptom onset. We investigated whether the plasma MPO level at admission was associated with impaired myocardial microcirculation, as indicated by ST-segment resolution and <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> after reperfusion, and left ventricular ejection fraction and remodeling at 6 months. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median MPO value for the entire cohort (low-MPO group 50 ng/ml, n = 80). ST-segment resolution and the <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> were significantly lower in the high-MPO than in the low-MPO group (48 +/- 27 % vs 61 +/- 24 %, p < 0. 005; and 2. 1 +/- 0. 8 vs 2. 4 +/- 0. 7, p < 0. 01; respectively). Moreover, the percentage of increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was significantly greater and the left ventricular ejection fraction at 6 months was significantly lower in the high-MPO group than in the low-MPO group (8. 2 +/- 24. 7 % vs - 1. 9 +/- 23. 5 %, p < 0. 05; and 46 +/- 9 % vs 54 +/- 9 %, p < 0. 0001, respectively).

40|$|Background Several {{studies have}} shown that patency of the {{epicardial}} vessel does not guarantee optimal myocardial perfusion in patients undergoing primary angioplasty for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of the current study was to identify clinical and angiographic correlates of unsuccessful reperfusion by the use of <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> in a large consecutive cohort of STEMI patients. Methods Our population is represented by a total of 1548 consecutive patients with STEMI treated by primary angioplasty at our institution. All clinical and angiographic data were prospectively collected. Successful reperfusion was defined as postprocedural thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) 3 flow with <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grades</b> 2 to 3. Results Poor myocardial reperfusion was observed in 358 patients (23. 1 %) and was associated with a significantly larger infarct size (1838 [350 - 3387] vs 1187 [607 - 2257], P <. 0001) and lower ejection fraction (41 [31 - 48. 2] vs 65 [36. 5 - 52. 5], P <. 0001). At multivariate analysis, preprocedural TIMI flow 0 to 1, anterior infarction, ischemic time, postprocedural residual stenosis, advanced Killip class at presentation, and age were identified as independent predictors of poor myocardial reperfusion. At 1 -year follow-up, a total of 92 patients (5. 9 %) had died. At multivariate analysis, including clinical and angiographic variables, unsuccessful reperfusion was an independent predictor of 1 -year mortality (relative risk 3. 11, 95 % CI 1. 99 - 4. 87, P <. 0001). Conclusions The prevalence of poor myocardial reperfusion is relatively high in patients undergoing primary angioplasty for STEMI, with a significant impact on 1 -year mortality. Preprocedural TIMI flow, anterior infarction, ischemic time, Killip class at presentation, and age were independently associated with unsuccessful reperfusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk {{of death}} in {{patients}} affected by ST-elevation segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) is well known, but more data are required to define the in-hospital mortality in special subsets. We sought to assess the prognostic value of indicators in patients with large anterior STEMI as a first acute coronary event, undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 48 consecutive large anterior STEMI patients admitted as first acute coronary event, undergoing in acute phase both PCI and IABP. Patient demographics, clinical, noninvasive and invasive findings, together with in-hospital complications, were collected. Moreover, findings obtained after a 24 -month follow-up were reported. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, whereas the secondary endpoints were out of hospital mortality, rehospitalization for heart failure or reinfarction, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at least 2 at follow-up visit. The univariate analysis {{showed a significant association}} with symptom to balloon, left anterior descending coronary artery, <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade,</b> and wall motion score index. Results of the multivariable analysis revealed the strongest predictive power for in-hospital mortality of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (odds ratio: 6. 9; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 – 67. 7) and of <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> 0 – 1 (odds ratio: 5. 5; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 0 – 38. 8). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (27 % of total cases), whereas, at follow-up, the mean of survival was 66. 7 ?±? 7. 0 %. CONCLUSION: The patients with large anterior STEMI as a first acute coronary event, undergoing PCI and IABP, had a very high in-hospital mortality, whereas the mortality rate over the follow-up period was lower. The involvement of a large territory at risk and the ineffective treatment in terms of myocardial reperfusion were the main predictors of in-hospital mortality...|$|R

We sought to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a burr size/reference artery diameter (RAD) ratio < 0. 7 in rotational atherectomy {{in order to reduce the}} distal embolization and then to analyze the procedural and peri-procedural no-reflow phenomenon. METHODS: Between March 1999 and May 2003, 50 consecutive patients with a chronic stable angina lasting more than 3 months underwent rotablator atherectomy, adjunctive stent im-plantation (primary coronary stenting, PCS) or plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) in case of de novo lesions or in stent restenosis, respectively. We analyzed the target vessel <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> and the troponin I, creatine kinase and CK-MB values at 1. 6 and every 8 h during the first day and then daily until discharge. RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in all 50 patients (mean age 55 +/- 11 years; 45 males, 5 females). Quantitative angiography revealed, in the group treated with PCS, an increase in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) from 0. 88 +/- 0. 39 mm at baseline to 1. 4 +/- 0. 63 mm after rotablator (p< 0. 01) to 2. 85 +/- 0. 9 mm after stent implantation (p< 0. 01). On the other hand, for the group treated with POBA, the MLD changed from 1. 8 +/- 0. 32 mm at baseline to 2. 2 +/- 0. 54 mm after rotablator (p= 0. 6) to 3. 28 +/- 0. 91 mm after adjunctive balloon angioplasty (p< 0. 01). No statistically significant changes have been observed between <b>myocardial</b> <b>blush</b> <b>grade</b> and enzymes between baseline and after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Rotablator atherectomy with a reduced burr size/RAD ratio is a safe and effective interventional procedure without any peri-procedural no-reflow phenomenon...|$|R
