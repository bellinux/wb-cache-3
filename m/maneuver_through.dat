5|$|Gimmick!, known outside Japan as Mr. Gimmick, is a {{platform}} video game developed {{and published by}} Sunsoft, and originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on 31 January 1992. The story follows a small green character named Yumetaro who was given to a young girl as a birthday present. One night, the girl's other toys become jealous of the attention he is receiving, and whisk the girl away to another dimension. Playing as Yumetaro, the player must <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> a variety of levels, using the protagonist's star-shooting power to defeat enemies and progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha {{delivered}} a diplomatic {{note to the}} League of Nations asking it {{to intervene in the}} Polish–Lithuanian War. He claimed that Lithuania allowed free passage through its territory for Soviet troops and therefore violated its declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. The next day Lithuania responded with a direct note to Poland in which Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis proposed to negotiate a demarcation line and other issues in Marijampolė. On September 8, during a planning meeting for what later was the Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the Lithuanian territory {{to the rear of the}} Soviet Army. In an attempt to conceal the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate. The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.|$|E
5|$|The 162nd Division, {{concentrated}} {{south of}} Tasa, {{had been standing}} by to cross the canal since dawn on October 16. The division advanced towards the canal, but movement was hampered by the massive traffic jams on the roads leading to the canal. When Adan realized that Akavish was closed, he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the desert to reach Deversoir. When it arrived, Sharon contacted Adan, explaining Reshef's difficult situation, and requested that the battalion be placed under his command. Adan accepted, and Sharon in turn authorized Reshef's request to pull back and regroup, replacing his brigade with the tank battalion.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E
5|$|Knuckles' Chaotix is a side-scrolling, action-platform {{game that}} shares {{the same basic}} {{gameplay}} elements that defined earlier entries in the Sonic series. New to this game, however, is a partner mechanic which tethers the player to a computer or human-controlled partner. This tether behaves like a rubber band, and requires the player(s) to use its physics to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the zones. Players can choose between playing as five different characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Knuckles the Echidna can glide and climb walls, Mighty the Armadillo can jump up and kick off walls, Espio the Chameleon can run along walls and ceilings, Vector the Crocodile can boost {{through the air and}} climb walls, and Charmy Bee can fly and hover in the air. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story follows the group's efforts to save a mysterious island from Doctor Robotnik and Metal Sonic, who are using its magical Chaos Rings for their evil plans.|$|E
5|$|The Louisiana Maneuvers pitted Krueger's Third Army against Lieutenant General Ben Lear's Second Army. The {{maneuvers}} were a test {{ground for}} doctrine and equipment, and gave senior commanders experience in maneuvering their formations. In the first phase, Krueger quickly proved {{himself to be}} the more modern general. He responded adroitly to a changed battle situation by re-orienting his front from northeast to northwest, {{and was able to}} inflict a series of reverses on Lear's forces. In the second phase, Krueger had a superior force, and had to advance on Shreveport, Louisiana. Lear's forces conducted a stubborn withdrawal, demolishing bridges in order to slow Krueger down. Krueger responded by sending Major General George S. Patton, Jr.'s 2nd Armored Division on a wide flanking <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> Texas. Afterwards, Eisenhower became the head of the War Plans Division, and was replaced by Colonel Alfred M. Gruenther. After he too was transferred, Krueger replaced him with Colonel George B. Honnen.|$|E

25|$|On September 6, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis {{proposed}} direct {{negotiations in}} Marijampolė. On September 8, during a planning {{meeting of the}} Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the Lithuanian-held territory {{to the rear of}} the Soviet Army, stationed in Hrodna. In an attempt to conceal the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate. The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff possessed {{extremely}} large hands, {{with which}} he could easily <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the most complex chordal configurations. His left hand technique was unusually powerful. His playing was marked by definition—where other pianists' playing became blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique, Rachmaninoff's textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne shared this kind of clarity with him. All three men had Anton Rubinstein {{as a model for}} this kind of playing—Hofmann as a student of Rubinstein's, Rachmaninoff from hearing his famous series of historical recitals in Moscow while studying with Zverev, and Lhevinne from hearing and playing with him.|$|E
25|$|Wilson began {{a public}} {{campaign}} for the nomination in the South, with {{a speech to the}} Pewter Platter Club in Norfolk, Virginia. While he was received enthusiastically, the speech, reformist in nature, was considered provocative and radical by the conservative audience, making the visit on the whole less than positive. However, as Wilson was the first Southerner to have a serious chance at the White House since 1848, Southern Democrats in general strongly supported Wilson's {{campaign for the}} nomination in 1912. More of Wilson's support came from young progressives in that region, including intellectuals, editors and lawyers. Wilson managed to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the complexities of local politics. For example, in Tennessee the Democratic Party was divided over Prohibition; Wilson was progressive and sober, but not dry, and appealed to both sides. They united behind him to win the presidential election in the state, but divided over state politics and lost the gubernatorial election.|$|E

500|$|Sherman {{proceeded}} {{to invade the}} state of Georgia with three armies: the 60,000-strong Army of the Cumberland under George Henry Thomas, the 25,000-strong Army of the Tennessee under James B. McPherson, and the 13,000-strong Army of the Ohio under John M. Schofield. He fought a lengthy campaign of <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> mountainous terrain against Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee, attempting a direct assault only at the disastrous Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. In July, the cautious Johnston {{was replaced by the}} more aggressive John Bell Hood, who played to Sherman's strength by challenging him to direct battles on open ground. [...] Meanwhile, in August, Sherman [...] "learned that I had been commissioned a major-general in the regular army, which was unexpected, and not desired until successful in the capture of Atlanta." ...|$|E
500|$|Portal {{consists}} {{primarily of}} a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using [...] "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows momentum to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game Narbacular Drop; many of the team members from the DigiPen Institute of Technology who worked on Narbacular Drop were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal, making it a spiritual successor to the game.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of 1871, the Northern Pacific pushed westward from Minnesota into present-day North Dakota. Surveyors and {{construction}} crews had to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> swamps, bogs, and tamarack forests. The difficult terrain and insufficient funding delayed by six months the construction phase in Minnesota. [...] The NP also began building its line north from Kalama, Washington Territory, on the Columbia River outside of Portland, Oregon, towards Puget Sound. Four small construction engines were purchased, the Minnetonka, Itaska, Ottertail and St. Cloud, {{the first of which}} was shipped to Kalama by ship around Cape Horn. In Minnesota, the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad completed construction of its [...] line stretching from Saint Paul to Lake Superior at Duluth in 1875. It was leased to the Northern Pacific the following year, and was eventually absorbed by the Northern Pacific.|$|E
2500|$|The striped stingaree (Trygonoptera ovalis) is {{a common}} but little-known species of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, endemic to shallow, inshore waters off southwestern Australia. Reaching [...] long, this species is characterized by an oval, grayish to brownish disc with darker mask-like markings around the eyes and paired blotches {{at the center of}} the disc that are extended posteriorly into horizontal lines. Its nostrils have enlarged lobes on the outer margins and a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed trailing margin in between. Its tail terminates in a relatively large leaf-shaped caudal fin, and bears a small dorsal fin just before the stinging spine. The rounded, flexible disc of the striped stingaree enable it to <b>maneuver</b> <b>through</b> the rocks, reefs, and seagrass that comprise its favored habitats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern; it is seldom caught by fisheries due to its habitat preferences.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that after {{destroying}} about 90% of their dentate gyrus (dg) cells, rats had extreme difficulty in <b>maneuvering</b> <b>through</b> a maze they had been through, prior to the lesion being made. When being tested {{a number of times}} to see whether they could learn a maze, the results showed that the rats did not improve at all, indicating that their working memories were severely impaired. Rats had trouble with place strategies because they could not consolidate learned information about a maze into their working memory, and, thus, could not remember it when <b>maneuvering</b> <b>through</b> the same maze in a later trial. Every time a rat entered the maze, the rat behaved as if it was seeing the maze for the first time.|$|R
