The subtle sphere refers to energy, or prana, a gross aspect of which is nuclear energy. In the book it is also referred to as the life-giving energy, or the breath of God. The <b>mental</b> <b>sphere</b> refers to the domain of instincts, feelings, and eventually also of thoughts and desires. When the human form is reached, along with the gross body, the subtle and mental bodies also reach full development and although they remain unconscious, the soul indirectly works through them in the corresponding spheres.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} planes {{belong to the}} subtle sphere, the fourth is on the {{threshold}} between the subtle and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the <b>mental</b> <b>sphere.</b> The first plane starts from {{the threshold of the}} gross and the subtle sphere. The soul here starts experiencing subtle phenomena simultaneously through its gross and subtle senses. It starts hearing subtle sounds and smelling subtle scents, although their nature is far different from their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving the subtle world through its subtle body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to subtle impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of the subtle world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|E

I’m interested in the psychological and emotional effects of visual phenomena and am exploring this area through glass’s ability to reflect and obscure. I’m also experimenting with photography because it’s simply documentation of reflection. The solidity of reflection whether on glass, photography, or water is something that I’m questioning. The viewer assumes its physicality, but what we accept as conclusive is at times a construct. The palpability of reflection then disintegrates into the residue of sight. I’ve been contemplating our eyes perceptual limits and what our mind sees in relation to what’s shown.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a principled and generalized model of a mythologem (ML) as psychogenic structure having psychological, electric, magnetic, hemodynamic, and time equivalents {{is the result of}} this study.

Within the framework of the ML model construction, the partial identity of ML and a motive, the image of the goal (IG) is accepted. The location of the IG was attributed to the expected result, which is located outside the attainable. The ML equivalents were defined as properties of a unified psychogenic structure initiating the forms of goal-directed behavior (GDB), which are unable to achieve the final goal, and a homeostatic balance, as a final result. We believe that anticipatory, prospective formation of IG, initiating adaptive forms of behavior, is a manifestation of a general principle of "anticipatory response" (the formation of the future in the present moment) inherent for somatic and <b>mental</b> <b>spheres</b> of human ontogenesis...|$|R

Psychology cannot boast of any triumph comparable to gravitational astronomy. Nevertheless, the evidence is not very greatly less than in the physical world.

Exceptions exist, but are capable of being explained as easily as the exceptions to the rule that unsupported bodies in air fall. There is, in fact, just such a degree of evidence for causal laws in psychology as will warrant the psychologist in assuming them as a matter of course, though not such a degree as will suffice to remove all doubt from the mind of a sceptical inquirer. It should be observed that causal laws in which the given term is mental and the inferred term physical, or vice versa, are at least as easy to discover as causal laws in which both terms are mental.|$|E

Such mental space usually systemically artistically reveals both differences between the world of language and the world of soul, the world of consciousness and their unity. It is noted that a bilingual consciousness operates a special set of syntactical structures (elliptical sentences) enabling the recipient to conjecture some information; thus, this cognitive process is a creative and positive one, moulding a personality. Relevant stereotypes are also characterized by a special interrelation between verbalization and semantization, which acquire a language form through etiquette formulas, various stable cognitive combinations and proverbs. The bilingual consciousness creates a fragment of reality in a special way in the mental space, reflecting the specific national verbal and non-verbal behaviour of a certain ethnos and specific standards of the creation and perception of speech forms adopted in a certain culture.

40|$|One of {{substantial}} peculiarities of modern globalization {{process is the}} distribution of multilingualism or bilingualism. Multilingualism is a linguistic and philosophical concept of a public production which was formed artificially, or under the action of some historical factors, determined by the correlation of two and more languages in speech and <b>mental</b> <b>spheres</b> of individual who uses these languages {{at different stages of}} communication. “Multilingualism” in his development and establishment is closely connected with the process of globalization. This concept became the focus of analysis of many scientists; it belongs to those phenomena of spiritual culture segments, attention to which was traditionally high from the side of philosophy of education, and it can be seen the same tendency to subsequent growth. Comparing nowadays situation with the middle of XX age, it is possible to state that presently to a large extent the reasons of increased interest to nature, functional possibilities, multilingualism’s public role, and also to those accompanied conceptual nature phenomena, have changed. Actually to scientifically linguistic, social linguistic, philosophical and political circumstances were added some other extralinguistic peculiarities, predetermined by the modern historical situation. Concept “multilingualism” is interpreted as a capacity for few languages operation in verbal or writing form. There are two types: national and individual multilingualism. This term is originated from the words “language”, “bilingualism”, “multi”. These qualities considerably influence on present education, in fact, as a result, it acquires multilingual character. The result of such education is the achievement of multilingual elementary competence that makes it possible to consider it not only as the alternative way of language study but also as a way of mastering some special knowledge, developing social and communicative capabilities of personality...|$|R

40|$|The thesis "Effects {{of surgery}} {{treatment}} of epilepsy on psychosocial {{condition of the}} patients" deals with the disease which causes many social effects on the patients. The most frequent ones are limitations in the working life and mental problems. I am interested in the epilepsy issue and therefore I have selected this topic which continues the bachelor thesis written in 2008. The objective of my work was to determine effects of epileptosurgery on the work life and on the mental area. Two hypotheses were established which assumed that the surgical treatment improved the patient´s life both in the working and in the <b>mental</b> <b>spheres.</b> The hypotheses were tested by means of quantitative research; questionnaires {{were used for the}} collection of data and the respondents were adult patients, who underwent surgical treatment of epilepsy and have been in the care of the Center of Epilepsy Na Homolce in Prague, and patients in the care of neurology departments in České Budějovice and in Strakonice. The results have shown that the epileptosurgery failed {{to improve the lives of}} the patients in the working sphere and thus the first hypothesis was not confirmed. Many of the patients are still unemployed and they still find it difficult to find jobs. The offer of vacancies has not increased much after the surgery. Those who work often feel stress and anxiety as a result. Some patients even lost jobs after the surgery or their working positions do not correspond to the achieved qualification level, experience and potential. The improvement in the mental area has been confirmed and many of the patients no more suffer from mental problems they had before the surgery. In some of the respondents mental disorders diminished or disappeared entirely. They are more self-confident, more even-tempered and they need less professional help. In this area I see the effects of surgical treatment as very beneficial. The results of my thesis might be used in publications for the general public, as well as for professionals specializing in the field...|$|R

With respect to <b>Sphere</b> <b>mental</b> health intervention indicators, the research largely ignores the existence and well-being of persons with pre-existing, severe mental disorders in disasters, whose well-being is addressed by the relevant Sphere standard.

The importance of interdisciplinary teamwork is based on complexity of <b>mental</b> health <b>sphere.</b> That’s why social workers in mental health care always work. in the interdisciplinary team. However, some contradictions between theoretical realization of teamwork and practical expression exists, possibly because the psychosocial model of health care is not seen as equal in comparison with medical one.

My view of mental subjective function is that it is an emergent property of appropriate brain functions. The conscious mental cannot exist without the brain processes that give rise to it.

The metaphorical shift of spatial characteristics onto the events and phenomena of social sphere is the most frequent (68, 58 %), as it is realized in most regular metaphorical models. The metaphorical shift of spatial characteristics onto the mental phenomena is marked by lower frequency (24, 28 %), and as a result it is realized in smaller number of metaphorical models. The metaphorical shift of spatial characteristics onto intellectual sphere is marked by the lowest frequency (7, 14 %). It is represented by the minimal number of regular metaphorical models. The authors determine the connection between spatial features and evaluation sphere and reveal the spatial features which prove to be essential in evaluation process.

40|$|Chapter One {{explores the}} {{classification}} of the grotesque and its disruptive role in natural and philosophical taxonomic systems. I argue that the grotesque served as a useful repository for the marvellous, the hybrid and the preternatural. Further, {{as a product of}} mind., the grotesque had nominalist status which was used to undermine essentialist classification, as well as to disrupt the referential relation between words and things. Moreover, grotesque hybrids, and fantastic beings were characteristic of the plenitude of nature and of the imagination. Chapter Two therefore moves on from spatial considerations of where the grotesque should be placed, to explore how it is generated and where it comes from. The becomingness of the grotesque is explored in relation to notions of chaos and metamorphosis; in a less tangible sense, I argue that the grotesque process can be understood in relation to metempsychosis and incomplete structuring. In this regard I demonstrate the sportive and playful operation of the grotesque within natures as examples of the lusus naturae. Chapter Three builds on the preoccupations of the first chapter, exploring how the grotesque manipulated different kinds of inner space; I show that an emphasis on the pictorial is insufficient for a proper understanding of the category; rather, the grotesque plays or sports with the underlying concept of representation. Chapter Four moves out from the <b>mental</b> and private <b>spheres</b> of representation to discuss how notions of category and process were brought together in a variety of constructions of the grotesque body. I argue that the body was subject to a novelization, a grotesque welding of forces. The fifth chapter explores the public manifestations of the grotesque in pantomime, fairs and masquerade; I argue that these served as sites of exchange and negotiation and that the grotesque therefore reflects the evolving commercial system. Chapter Six considers the judgment of the grotesque in relation to a range of legalities. The grotesque disrupted notions of legality just as it played within systems. These arguments are tested in the light of Scriblerian satire, with special attention devoted to Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope throughout...|$|R

Conducted in a number of locations in Europe and Asia, these experiments examine the usefulness of improvisation performance practices to notions of “ecology” and common understandings of humans’ relationships to our environment. Using “ecology” to describe an investigation of interrelationship as well as a commitment to act with an awareness of one’s actions in the social, <b>mental</b> and natural <b>spheres</b> discussed by Felix Guattari (2000), I outline ways contemporary improvisation practices can facilitate this investigation. To do this I draw on my own experience as a dancer at the Performing Arts Research and Training Studios (PARTS) in Brussels from 2004 - 2006, and as codirector of the TWIG Project in China in 2006. Using the experiences of improvising, learning dance, seeing dance, performing dance, creating scores for dance, and teaching movement improvisation, I argue that ecological practice is defined by its ability to instill a sense of “response ability” and personal agency in its practitioners. As a way of observing and incorporating new knowledge, improvisation functions herein both as a research practice and as the object of study. By improvising and documenting my experiences using a phenomenological lens derived from Merleau-Ponty’s work, I reflect on how practices of awareness in dancing can constitute new ways of knowing. I discuss how improvising can assist awareness of the body’s relationship with the environment at a number of levels including sensory, spatial, temporal, conceptual, social and political. I also investigate the notion of paradox as a theme throughout the thesis and present its usefulness as a way of producing and reflecting upon a practice of bodily research. The term “twig dances” represents an expanded understanding of what I mean by “improvising”, and points to my use of improvisation as a research process.

The situation could go on unchecked for a long time, before things got so bad that a spontaneous revolution and overthrow of the system took place. In fact, as this was the reason for social change, it was clear that no single class of people could remain dominant indefinitely. Social power was destined to pass from one class to next in the prescribed order, or cycle. The 'age of warriors', which brings strict order to society and a return to fundamental values, essentially leads to excessive focus on strong man rule and warfare. It is followed by an 'age of intellectuals', which bring a sense of liberation in the <b>mental</b> <b>sphere</b> but soon replace that freedom with the yoke of newer ideas. Over time this age merges into an 'age of acquisitors', which brings progress in the material sphere, but this is soon replaced by increased physical and mental exploitation. The Servile Wars spelled the doom of the Roman Republic. Labour conflict could be the undoing of Capitalism, according to this theory. And so the cycle moves on its endless round, until the civilisation ceases to exist or is taken over by a superior or more powerful civilisation.|$|E
