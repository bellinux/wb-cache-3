40|$|The main {{problems}} facing annuity providers relate to adverse selection and mortality risk, the {{risk associated with}} mortality improvements, and to interest rate, reinvestment and in¯ation risk. Annuity providers hedge these risks, wherever possible, by holding suitable <b>matching</b> <b>assets</b> against their annuity liabilities: for example, riskless (government) ®xedincome bonds are used to provide the payments on level annuities, and index-linked bonds are needed if index-linked annuities are to be serviced effectively. However, {{in the absence of}} suitable <b>matching</b> <b>assets,</b> providers are unable to hedge the risks associated with mortality effectively and compensate for this by imposing substantial cost loadings. They also face reinvestment risk if available assets are of insuf®cient duration. Annuitants face interest rate risk prior to purchase and, since most of them prefer the higher initial income from a level annuity compared with an indexed annuity, in¯ation risk after purchase. Some solutions to these problems are considered, including a planned programme of phased annuity purchases to hedge interest rate risk, limited price index bonds to partially hedge in¯ation risk, and survivor (or indexed life) bonds, with coupons declining in direct proportion to the realized mortality of a selected group of annuitants, to hedge mortality risk.

30|$|Finally, an {{important}} feature of our model economy is wealth accumulation. One of our main points is that access to credit markets affects the value of maternity leave: households can smooth consumption through saving and borrowing. Hence, {{it is important that}} our model <b>matches</b> <b>asset</b> profiles. In our benchmark economy, the median ratio of wealth to husband income of households has risen by age 55 to about 5.4. This is comparable to the numbers in the data reported in Low et al. (2010) if we include private pension wealth and housing wealth. In the simulations, the fraction of households borrowing against future income at the time the first child arrives is 14 %. This fraction increases until age 35, driven by the needs of children, and then decreases from then on as accumulation for retirement begins.|$|R

Our world uncertainty process captures the large but uneven rise and fall of volatility that occurred over the course of the 20 th century.

50|$|In {{the less}} common {{unassigned}} case, the defendant or property/casualty insurer retains the periodic payment obligation and funds it by purchasing an annuity {{from a life}} insurance company, thereby offsetting its obligation with a <b>matching</b> <b>asset.</b> The payment stream purchased under the annuity matches exactly, in timing and amounts, the periodic payments agreed to in the settlement agreement. The defendant or property/casualty company owns the annuity and names the claimant as the payee under the annuity, thereby directing the annuity issuer to send payments directly to the claimant. One of the reasons an unassigned case is less popular is that the obligation is not truly off the books, and the defendant or casualty insurer retains a contingent liability. While a default is a rare occurrence, contingent liability did come into play with the liquidation of Executive Life Insurance Company of New York.
