3000|$|As {{revealed}} in the previous section, minimum path pitches are desired for restraint of residual ripple errors. Eq. 7 indicates that the <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> is inversely proportional to the pitch; thus, we can adopt a maximum <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> allowed by the machine so as to decrease the pitch. However, increasing <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> has {{a significant impact on}} the stability of TIF. A too large <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> will result in alteration of TIF, and hence deteriorate efficiency of figure correction as well as MSF errors. Further, the machine imposes restrictions on the moving velocity and acceleration of every movable component. Hence, there is a favorable maximum velocity allowed for each polishing machine.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to study the {{influence}} of cutting conditions - cutting speed, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> and <b>feed</b> per tooth - on tool life and surface finish of the workpiece in the face milling of flat surfaces. Aiming to achieve this goal, several milling experiments were carried out with different cutting speeds, <b>feed</b> <b>velocities</b> and <b>feeds</b> per tooth. In {{the first phase of}} the experiments, cutting speed was varied without varying <b>feed</b> <b>velocity,</b> which caused a variation in feed per tooth. In the second phase of the experiments, cutting speed and <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> were varied in such a way that feed per tooth was kept constant. Tool flank wear and surface roughness of the workpiece were measured as cutting time elapsed. The main conclusions of this work are that a) cutting speed has a strong influence on tool life, regardless of whether <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> or <b>feed</b> per tooth varies and b) an increase in surface roughness of the workpiece is not closely related to an increase in wear of the primary cutting edge...|$|R

30|$|Raster path {{is usually}} adopted for the {{fabrication}} of square-shaped optics. During polishing with raster path, the tool feeds along {{a straight line}} and then translates to another parallel line. This process is repeated to cover the whole surface. The pitch between adjacent path lines is commonly set identical (i.e. uniform pitch) on the whole surface, and the <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> along each path is instantaneously controlled based on the local removal [14]. It is obvious that for a uniform removal map of a certain removal amount, the smaller the path pitch, the larger the <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity.</b> However, if the desired <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> {{is larger than the}} largest one allowed by the machine, the actual <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> has to be changed to the largest one, which will introduce extra dwell time leading to material over-removal. As the tool feeds fast at lower region while slowly at higher region with the uniform pitch path, the smallest removal region (lowest region) will commonly bring with such over-removal. Since, the decreased pitch is propitious to restraint of MSF errors [15]. On the other hand, the decreased pitch will greatly increase over-removal especially in the lowest region deteriorating the form correction precision. Hence, it is needed to develop an optimized tool path planning method which can solve this problem.|$|R

The simulation {{results showed that the}} changes of feeding wastewater had great influence on sludge settle ability in decant process, and the position of decanter needed optimized; it had no influence on sludge settle ability in settling process. For considering the lowest hydraulic retention time, the research controlled maximum feeding wastewater for 1610 m 3 /h. Internal recycle had no influence on sludge settle ability. Two methods were proposed: the first one, the water level of decanter was set 3. 9 m (sludge volume fraction of this suspended area was less than 0. 05), <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> was 0. 07 m/s; the second, keep the water level of decanter 3. 75 m, reduce <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> (preliminary setting <b>feeding</b> <b>velocity</b> 0. 06 m/s).

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for choosing the optimal load resistance, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> and residence time for a reverse electrodialysis stack based on minimizing the levelized cost of electricity. The optimal load resistance maximizes the gross stack power density and results from a trade-off between stack voltage and stack current. The primary trade-off governing the optimal <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> is between stack pumping power losses, which reduce the net power density and concentration polarization losses, which reduce the gross stack power density. Lastly, the primary trade-off governing the optimal residence time is between the capital costs of the stack and pretreatment system. Implementing our strategy, we show that a smaller load resistance, a smaller <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> and a larger residence time than are currently proposed in the literature reduces costs by over 40 %. Despite these reductions, reverse electrodialysis remains more expensive than other renewable technologies.

40|$|A novel {{ultrasonic}} assisted {{direct contact}} membrane distillation (USDCMD) hybrid process {{was designed and}} the effects of feed temperature, <b>feed</b> concentration, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity,</b> ultrasonic power and frequency on mass transfer were investigated. Under ultrasonic irradiation, changes and damages in membrane structure were found on PVDF membrane, while the pore size and the stretching strain of PP fibers were also enlarged and declined, respectively. The PTFE hollow fiber was selected to carry out USDCMD. The results showed that ultrasonic irradiation could effectively enhance mass transfer. Under the ultrasonic irradiation of 20 kHz and 260 W, the maximum permeate flux enhancement of 60 % was obtained under conditions of feed temperature of 53 degrees C, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> of 025 m/s and feed salt concentration of 140 g/L. The increment was enlarged with the decrease of <b>feed</b> temperature, <b>feed</b> <b>velocity</b> and ultrasonic frequency as well as the increase of feed concentration and ultrasonic power. Ultrasonic irradiation had no significant influence on the mechanical strength, pore size and hydrophobicity of the FIFE membrane in a 240 h continuous USDCMD experiment, and the novel membrane distillation process exhibited satisfying performance stability, which indicated that ultrasonic irradiation can be applied to membrane distillation for mass transfer enhancement.

A series of particles with their densities ranging from 760 kg/m 3 to 1380 kg/m 3 were fed into the Vorsyl separator with water by means of tangential inlet. The simulation showed that the feed materials acquired centrifugal force which allows most portion of the particles with a density less than water {{to move to the}} center of the separator, enter the vortex finder and leave the separator through the bottom outlet. While the particles heavier than water move to the wall, reach the throat area and leave the separator through the side outlet. The particles were thus separated and particles collected at the bottom outlet are pure and clean. The influence of particle density on separation efficiency was investigated which demonstrated a positive correlation of the separation efficiency with increasing density difference between medium liquid and the particle. In addition, the influence of the split ratio on the performance was studied which showed that the separation efficiency of the Vorsyl separator can be improved by the increase of split ratio.
