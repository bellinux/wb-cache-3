5|$|After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around 300) {{spoke of}} a <b>mineral</b> that when mixed with natron {{produced}} a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was arsenic trioxide, the unidentified <b>mineral</b> having to have been either realgar or orpiment, due to {{the relation between the}} unidentified <b>mineral</b> and his other writings.|$|E
5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy <b>mineral</b> sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the <b>mineral</b> grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the <b>mineral</b> zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minerals</b> {{produced}} through {{hydrothermal alteration}} and weathering of primary basaltic <b>minerals</b> are also present on Mars.

50|$|Most <b>minerals</b> with no {{iron content}} are diamagnetic.

40|$|The two <b>minerals</b> borickyite and delvauxite CaFe 3 + 4 (PO 4,SO 4) 2 (OH) 8 • 4 - 6 H 2 O {{have the}} same formula. Are the <b>minerals</b> {{identical}} or different? The <b>minerals</b> borickyite and delvauxite have been characterised by Raman spectroscopy. The <b>minerals</b> {{are related to the}} <b>minerals</b> diadochite and destinezite. Both <b>minerals</b> are amorphous. Delvauxite appears to vary in crystallinity from amorphous to semi-crystalline. The <b>minerals</b> are often X-ray non-diffracting. The <b>minerals</b> are found in soils and may be described as ‘colloidal’ <b>minerals.</b> Vibrational spectroscopy enables an assessment of the molecular structure of borickyite and delvauxite. Bands are assigned to phosphate and sulphate stretching and bending modes. Multiple water bending and stretching modes imply that non-equivalent water molecules in the structure exist with different hydrogen bond strengths. The two <b>minerals</b> show differing spectra and must be considered as different <b>minerals...</b>|$|R

50|$|As the {{sediment}} is transported, the unstable <b>minerals</b> are abraded or dissolve to leave more stable <b>minerals,</b> such as quartz.

40|$|Although bone <b>minerals</b> {{have been}} widely studied by various {{techniques}} in previous studies, crystal structures and morphology of bone <b>minerals</b> remained as controversy. In this study, bone <b>minerals</b> were extracted from human cortical bone with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid solution (pH 7. 4, ambient temperature) and examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The {{results showed that the}} majority of bone <b>minerals</b> were flake-like and a few were needle-like. Most of flake-like <b>minerals</b> were less than 100 nm in their largest dimension and the needle-like <b>minerals</b> have a width of similar to 10 nm. Hydroxyapatite structure was identified in relatively thick bone <b>minerals.</b> However, octacalcium phosphate structure was identified in relatively thin flake-like bone <b>minerals.</b> Moreover, central dark line defect similar to that reported in dentin and enamel crystals was observed in some of needle-like bone <b>minerals...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black <b>mineral</b> on Løvøya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark determined {{that it was not}} a known <b>mineral</b> and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source <b>mineral</b> thorite.|$|E
5|$|In 1908 the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the {{creation}} of community space along Ashland Creek, which became Ashland Canyon Park. The discovery of lithia water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a <b>mineral</b> spa at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included piping the <b>mineral</b> water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the <b>mineral</b> spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling <b>mineral</b> waters from the area's springs.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{naturally}} occurring boron nitride <b>mineral</b> in the cubic form (c-BN) {{was reported in}} Tibet, with a proposed name of qingsongite.
