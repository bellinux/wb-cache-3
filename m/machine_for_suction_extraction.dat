3000|$|... is the {{indicator}} of the variation of fluid viscosity with temperature which has a substantial effect on f′(η) and hence on f″(1) (see Table  7 for details). The effect of Mn on f′(η) is demonstrated in Fig.  2 b. It is observed that, for the higher values of Mn, the fluid velocity increase and thereby decrease {{the thickness of the}} momentum boundary layer near the wall region, for absence of suction/injection parameter and 0.23 [*]≥[*]η[*]≥[*] 0.67  <b>for</b> <b>suction)</b> However, the reverse trend is observed in the central region. This dual behavior of the flow is due to the mass conservation constraint (see Lawal and Kalyon (1998)). Figure  2 c depicts the behavior of S on f′(η) It is seen that f′(η) decreases with an increase in S at the central region <b>for</b> <b>suction</b> (0.32 [*]≤[*]η[*]≤[*] 0.74) and the reverse trend is recorded in the case of injection. Physically, in the case of suction, there will be an increase in h(t) which will cause it to decrease in velocity and the increase in squeezing parameter. Further, when η[*]≤[*] 0.32  or η[*]≤[*] 0.74, that is the neighborhood of 0.32 and 0.74, there will be a corresponding decrease in h(t) which in turn will increase in both fluid velocity and squeezing parameter. The effect of β on f′(η) is shown in Fig.  2 d. The behavior of f′(η) at the surface of the disks is zero when β[*]=[*] 0 (no slip at the wall). <b>For</b> the <b>suction</b> flow, an increase in β strengthens the f′(η) near the wall, that is for η[*]≥[*] 0.16  and η[*]≥[*] 0.82, while at the central region, rising β results in weakening of f′(η). However, for the case of injection, the effect of f′(η) is opposite to that accounted <b>for</b> <b>suction</b> flow. Physically, in the case of injection, an increase in f′(η) near the wall region with increasing β gives rise to a decrease in velocity gradient at there. However, when the mass flow rate is kept constant, an increase in the fluid velocity near the wall region will be remunerated by an analogous fall in the fluid velocity near the mid region so that mass conservation limitation will not be dishonored (see ref. (Lawal and Kalyon 1998)).|$|R
