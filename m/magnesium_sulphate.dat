50|$|Coco peat {{is used as}} a soil conditioner. Due to {{low levels}} of {{nutrients}} in its composition, coco peat is usually not the sole component in the medium used to grow plants. When plants are grown exclusively in coco peat, it is important to add nutrients according to the specific plants' needs.

30|$|Sulphates occur {{naturally}} in various minerals, including Barite (BaSO 4), Epsomite (MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O) and Gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) (Greenwood and Earnshaw 1984). The primary mineral sources of sulphate ions include evaporate minerals such as Anhydrite, Gypsum and <b>sulphates</b> of <b>Magnesium</b> and Sodium and the leaching of fertilizers (Thivya et al. 2013 a) may {{also increase the}} sulphate concentration in groundwater. These dissolved minerals contribute to the mineral content of drinking water (WHO 2004). There {{have been a number}} of studies conducted to determine the toxicity of sulphate in humans. Case reports of diarrhoea in three infants exposed to water containing sulphate at concentrations ranging from 630 to 1150  mg/l have been presented (Chien et al. 1968). However, diarrhoea could not be explained as being solely due to exposure to high sulphate levels and other factors may have played a role (e.g. consumption of infant formula with high osmolarity or the presence of microbial pathogens). Sodium, potassium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphates</b> are all highly soluble in water, whereas calcium and barium sulphates are less soluble.

A {{number of potential}} scalants including silica, calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> <b>sulphates</b> and carbonates, {{all of which were}} present in dissolved and non-dissolved forms, were characterized. The presence of spherical particles with a size range of 10 – 1000  nm and aggregates of 1 – 10 microns was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Those particulates contained the following metals in decreasing order: K, Si, Sr, Ca, B, Ba, Mg, P, and S. Characterization showed that nearly one-third of the total silicon in the brine was present in the particulates. Further, analysis of the RO brine suggested supersaturation and precipitation of metal carbonates and sulphates during the RO process should take place and could be responsible for subsequently capturing silica in the solid phase. However, the precipitation of crystalline carbonates and sulphates are complex. X-ray diffraction analysis did not confirm the presence of common calcium carbonates or sulphates but instead showed the presence of a suite of complex minerals, to which amorphous silica and/or silica rich compounds could have adhered.

40|$|A {{computerized}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed to simulate the system hydrology and water-salinity (as indicated by seven major ions constituting the salt) of a river basin, in which irrigation is the major beneficial water user. The overall system simulation model consists of three submodels: (1) a general hydrologic submodel programmed on a hybrid computer; (2) a chemical submodel to predict the quality of percolated water through the soil profile; and (3) a biological transformation submodel in respect of microbial nitrogen transformations, which is utilized by the chemical submodel. Both the chemical and biological submodels are programmed on a digital computer and are combined with the general hydrologic submodel to form the system simulation model. The overall model operates on monthly time intervals with variable spatial resolution. The hydrologic portion of the model simulates the various hydrologic processes which are linked together by the continuity-of-mass principle and predicts the monthly runoff from the area. The chemical quality component of the model considers the complex chemistry of soilwater-plant system, including cation exchange on the soil complex, the dissolution or precipitation of lime (CaCO 3), and calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulphates</b> ion pairs in solution. The biological transformations submodel uses the kinetic approach in simulating the microbial nitrogen transformations within the root zone of a soil profile. The transformation reactions included are: (1) hydrolysis of Urea-nitrogen; (2) immobilization of ammonium-nitrogen; (3) mineralization of organic-nitrogen; and (4) immobilization of nitrate-nitrogen. The chemical composition of return flow {{is a function of}} these chemical and biological processes within the soil profile, in addition to blending of undiverted flows, evapotranspiration, and mixing of subsurface return flow with groundwater. Uptake of nitrate by aquatic biomass in the surface runoff of return flow has also been considered. The seven ions considered in the study are calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> sodium, <b>sulphate,</b> chloride, bicarbonate, and nitrate. The total dissolved solids outflow is a summation of these individual ions. In order to demonstrate its capabilities, the hydro-quality model is applied to a large irrigated area of the Snake River Plains, near Twin Falls, Idaho. The model successfully simulated measured outflows of water and the concentration of seven ions for a 24 month period. The correlation coefficients range from 0. 79 to 0. 96 for the quantity and quality components of outflow, except for the sulphate ion, the correlation coefficient of which is 0. 66. The model is general in nature and with suitable adjustments it can be applied to other areas and also to various kinds of management situations, including land application of waste water and studies involving nitrate pollution of groundwaters...|$|R
