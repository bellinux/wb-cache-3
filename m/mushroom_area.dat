Additional measurements were made on samples from the Moscow, southern Belarus, and Yugoslavia/Bulgaria regions. Activity values were found to vary by several orders of magnitude within all geographic areas, even for the same mushroom species. Significantly higher specific activities were observed in mycorrhizal species than in saprophytic and parasitic fungi. Unfortunately, many of the European mycorrhizal species considered as prized edibles contained unacceptably high levels of 137 Cs (> 1, 000 Bq/kg [dry weight]) and should be used sparingly as food.

It might seem like play is free in all places of the world but the state at which children can access play {{while growing up in}} developing world with political, ecological and economic factors is alarming. This is due to the shortage of playgrounds to learn and play in and even harder to find playgrounds that are all-inclusive.

Alongside Igodomigodo polity (later known as Benin) were Udo to the west and Iguobode in Iyekorhionmwon area to the east, and possibly other Edo-speaking polities. What immediately followed the collapse of Ogiso rulership was decentralized political authority. Many autonomous principalities emerged with leaders struggling to establish their own dynastic hegemony over surrounding areas. How long this situation lasted is not clear but oral historical sources and archaeological data soundly indicate that centralized political authority and a new kingship dynasty were re-installed in sections of Benin area during {{the thirteenth century}}.

A key computational difficulty of {{object recognition}} is that it requires both selectivity to particular objects (e. g., exact odor mixture identification) and generalization across objects (identifying particular features or components common to different odors). Although previous results (1) suggest that odor identity and intensity are represented in the activity of both PNs and KCs, {{it is not clear}} how these representations generalize across complex odor mixtures. In particular, it is not clear what types of information are available in KC population (or if its even possible to decode across KC populations?) and how is this information represented? Using the locust olfactory system as a model system, we found that Kenyon cells (KCs), the principal neurons of the <b>mushroom</b> body, an <b>area</b> required for associative learning can identify the presence of components in mixtures and thus enable odor segmentation. As a population, small groups of KCs can both identify and categorize odors with high accuracy.

These rules may be relevant for pattern classifying circuits in general...|$|R

Here we explore whether there are temperature-mediated effects on the brain. We raised pupae at different constant temperatures between 29 and 37 °C and performed neuroanatomical analyses of the adult brains. Analyses focused on sensory-input regions in the <b>mushroom</b> bodies, brain <b>areas</b> associated with higher-order processing such as learning and memory. Distinct synaptic complexes [microglomeruli (MG) ] within the mushroom body calyces were visualized by using fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin and an antibody to synapsin. The numbers of MG were different in bees that had been raised at different temperatures, and these differences persisted after the first week of adult life. In the olfactory-input region (lip), MG numbers were highest in bees raised at the temperature normally maintained in brood cells (34. 5 °C) and significantly decreased in bees raised at 1 °C below and above this norm. Interestingly, in the neighboring visual-input region (collar), MG numbers were less affected by temperature. We conclude that thermoregulatory control of brood rearing can generate area- and modality-specific effects on synaptic neuropils in the adult brain. We propose that resulting differences in the synaptic circuitry may affect neuronal plasticity and may underlie temperature-mediated effects on multimodal communication and learning...|$|R

Security Unbound argues that when insecurities pervade how we relate to our neighbours, how we perceive international politics, how governments formulate policies, at stake is not our security but our democracy. Security {{is not in the}} first instance a right or value but a practice that challenges democratic institutions and actions. We are familiar with emergency policies in the name of national security challenging parliamentary processes, the space for political dissent, and fundamental rights. Yet, security practice and technology pervade society heavily in very mundane ways without raising national security crises, in particular through surveillance technology and the management of risks and uncertainties in many areas of life. These more diffuse security practices create societies in which suspicion becomes a default way of relating and governing relations, ranging from neighbourhood relations over financial transactions to cross border mobility. Security Unbound demonstrates that governing through suspicion poses serious challenges to democratic practice. Some of these challenges are familiar, such as the erosion of the right to privacy; others are less so, such as the post-human challenge to citizenship. Security unbound provokes us to see that the democratic political stake today is not our security but preventing insecurity from becoming the organising principle of political and social life...|$|R
