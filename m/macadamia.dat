5|$|In 2002, Barr met Johnny Argent online {{after running}} a writing {{competition}} on her blog and began dating him in 2003, {{after a year}} of phone conversations. They live on a 46-acre <b>macadamia</b> nut farm located on the Big Island of Hawaii. Barr purchased the property in 2007 for $1.78million. Barr has studied Kabbalah at the Kabbalah Centre and frequently comments on the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{throughout}} the season was minimal and no deaths were recorded. In early August, the remnants of Hurricane Darby aided in localized heavy rainfall in Hawaii, causing minor street and stream flooding; coffee and <b>macadamia</b> trees were damaged as well. In early September, Hurricane Howard resulted in significant flooding across Baja California Peninsula that damaged agricultural land and 393 homes. Large swells also resulted in about 1,000 lifeguard rescues in California. In mid-September, Javier caused three fishermen to go missing and helped alleviate a multi-year drought across the Southwest United States. It produced record rainfall {{in the state of}} Wyoming. In mid- to late October, Tropical Storm Lester and Tropical Depression Sixteen-E caused localized flooding; the latter may have produced a tornado near Culiacán, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Wirrimbirra White' {{is a white}} {{form from}} Kangaloon near Robertson. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered, but none had been {{previously}} preserved in horticulture. Joseph Maiden had previously found a white waratah near Kurrajong, and others had been sighted near Narara on the Central Coast in 1919, and Colo Vale in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported one in his garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant. 'Wirrimbirra White' was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant, which grew on water catchment property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence. It is less vigorous than the parent species and vulnerable to borers. It is also highly vulnerable to the <b>Macadamia</b> twig girdler.|$|E

5|$|Purvis {{was born}} on July 4, 1857, into a family of Scottish descent. His parents were Robert Raaf Purvis and Annie Silburn Marshall. His {{paternal}} grandfather, William Purvis, {{who worked as a}} trader and ship captain, had settled in the Dutch East Indies in the 1810s while it was still part of the British Empire. The family lived in many places including Dutch East Indies, Brussels, and London. Educated at Cheltenham College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Edward William Purvis served as a sub-lieutenant of the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot in Bengal, where he learned Hindi, and later as a sub-lieutenant for the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot in Chatham, Kent. Around 1879 he resigned his British Army post and traveled to the Hawaiian Islands, where his father and older brother Robert William Theodore Purvis had already settled, having arrived on December13, 1877; his brother Theodore had started a sugar plantation business on the island of Kauai. A distant cousin of theirs was William Herbert Purvis, known for introducing <b>macadamia</b> nuts to Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|The only Australian native {{plant food}} {{developed}} and cropped {{on a large}} scale is the <b>macadamia</b> nut, with the first small-scale commercial plantation being planted in Australia in the 1880s. Subsequently, Hawaii was where the <b>macadamia</b> was commercially developed to its greatest extent from stock imported from Australia.|$|E

50|$|Native to Australia, <b>macadamias</b> {{have been}} {{grown in the}} Uruapan area since the late 20th century. The city makes a number of {{products}} from the nut such as nuts flavored with garlic, chili peppers, soy sauce or salt. They are also made into brittle, cookies, candies and oil.|$|R
50|$|There is farming {{within the}} area with crops such as pineapples, lychees, <b>macadamias,</b> mangoes, bananas, citrus, {{avocados}} and a small quantity of coffee beans grown. Some of the older settlers trialled Shiraz grapes in the region {{but it did not}} rate in James Halliday's Wine Companions. Livestock include cattle, alpacas and honey-bees.|$|R
50|$|The climatic {{contrasts}} {{between the}} drier Highveld region, with its cold winters, and the hot, humid Lowveld {{allow for a}} variety of agricultural activities. 68% of Mpumalanga is used by agriculture. Crops include maize, wheat, sorghum, barley, sunflower seed, soybeans, <b>macadamia's,</b> groundnuts, sugar cane, vegetables, coffee, tea, cotton, tobacco, citrus, subtropical and deciduous fruit.|$|R
25|$|A {{cross-reactivity}} apparently {{exists between}} sesame allergens and peanut, rye, kiwifruit, poppy seed, and various tree nuts (such as hazelnut, black walnut, cashew, <b>macadamia,</b> and pistachio).|$|E
25|$|Grevilleoideae is a {{subfamily}} of {{the flowering}} plant family Proteaceae. Mainly {{restricted to the}} southern hemisphere, it contains around 44 genera and about 950 species. Genera include Banksia, Grevillea and <b>Macadamia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Continued {{domestication}} was gradual, {{a process}} of intermittent trial and error. Over time perennials and small trees including the apple and the olive were domesticated. Some plants, such as the <b>macadamia</b> nut and the pecan, were not domesticated until recently.|$|E
50|$|Located {{close to}} the town of Hazyview, Kiepersol is named after the {{indigenous}} cabbage tree, also called the Kiepersol, which grows in abundance in the lowveld, although the surrounding cultivations are mostly banana plantations. Other fruit grown nearby include mangos, avocados and <b>macadamias.</b> The town is {{close to the}} Phabeni Gate of the Kruger National Park.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{crops are}} grown {{throughout}} Mareeba Shire, including avocados, mangoes, lychees, longans, sugar cane, cashews, <b>macadamias,</b> bananas, pineapples, tea tree oil, coffee, {{and a variety}} of vegetables and tropical fruits. Poultry and cattle are also common. Tobacco was once the main grown crop of the local economy, but is no longer grown within the Mareeba shire.|$|R
50|$|Well-known {{members of}} the Proteales include the proteas of South Africa, the banksias and <b>macadamias</b> of Australia, the London plane, and the sacred lotus. The origins of the order are clearly ancient, with {{evidence}} of diversification in the mid-Cretaceous, over 100 million years ago. Of interest are the current family distributions, with the Proteaceae a mostly Southern Hemisphere family, while the Platanaceae and Nelumbonaceae are Northern Hemisphere plants.|$|R

25|$|Refined oils high in {{monounsaturated}} fats, such as <b>macadamia</b> oil, keep up to a year, {{while those}} high in polyunsaturated fats, such as soybean oil, keep about six months. Rancidity tests {{have shown that}} the shelf life of walnut oil is about 3 months, a period considerably shorter than the best before date shown on labels.|$|E
5000|$|Note. The horticultural use of {{the term}} [...] "variety" [...] refers to {{selected}} clones usually propagated by grafting. A parent tree is a genetically unique plant that is selected for specific traits, in the case of <b>macadamias</b> these include: strong tree growth, low incidence of pests and diseases, low incidence of stick-tights and premature germination of nuts, reduced years to bearing, high kernel quality and desirable market requirements.|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{species of}} Costa Rican Lytopylus are treated; these include all species reared from Lepidoptera {{caterpillars}} in Area de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica, over 32 years of caterpillar inventory, {{as well as}} two species recorded in the literature as occurring in Costa Rica.

50|$|Australian farmers {{rely heavily}} on the {{introduced}} western honey bee to pollinate their crops. For some crops, though, native bees may be better pollinators. Stingless bees {{have been shown to}} be valuable pollinators of crops such as <b>macadamias</b> and mangos. They may also benefit strawberries, watermelons, citrus, avocados, lychees, and many others. Research into the use of stingless bees for crop pollination in Australia is still in its very early stages, but these bees show great potential. Studies at the University of Western Sydney have shown these bees' excellent ability to work in confined areas such as glasshouses.|$|R
