25|$|The Bulgarian {{army was}} well {{equipped}} with siege engines. The Bulgarians employed {{the services of}} Byzantine and Arab captives and fugitives to produce siege equipment, such as the engineer Eumathius, who sought refuge to Khan Krum after the capture of Serdica in 809. The 9th century anonymous Byzantine chronicler known as Scrptor incertus lists the contemporary machinery produced and used by the Bulgarians. These included catapults; scorpions; multi-storey siege towers with a battering ram on the bottom floor; testudosbattering rams with <b>metal</b> <b>plating</b> on the top; τρίβόλοιiron tridents placed hidden amidst the battlefield to hinder the enemy cavalry; ladders, etc. Iron-plated wagons were used for transportation. It is known that Khan Krum prepared 5,000 such wagons for his intended siege of Constantinople in 814. Wooden pontoon bridges were also constructed for crossing rivers.|$|E
25|$|When the Central {{line was}} {{extended}} east, the stations were simplified Holden proto-Brutalist designs, and a cavernous concourse built at Gants Hill {{in honour of}} early Moscow Metro stations. Few new stations {{were built in the}} 50 years after 1948, but Misha Black was appointed design consultant for the 1960s Victoria line, contributing to the line's uniform look, with each station having an individual tile motif. Notable stations from this period include Moor Park, the stations of the Piccadilly line extension to Heathrow and Hillingdon. The stations of the 1990s extension of the Jubilee line were much larger than before and designed in a high-tech style by architects such as Norman Foster and Michael Hopkins, making extensive use of exposed <b>metal</b> <b>plating.</b> West Ham station was built as a homage to the red brick tube stations of the 1930s, using brick, concrete and glass.|$|E
25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial <b>metal</b> <b>plating</b> waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|E

50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the <b>metal</b> <b>plate).</b> This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectic plate.|$|R

By tradition from an age of leather shields the Currier is still the shield-maker, though now the shield has <b>metal</b> <b>plating.</b> It is fairly clear that Greek tradition regarded the shield of Aias as of the kind which covered the body from chin to ankles, and resembled a bellying sail, or an umbrella unfurled, and drawn in at the sides in the middle, so as to offer the semblance of two bellies, or of one, pinched in {{at or near the}} centre. This is probable, because the coins of Salamis, where Aias was worshipped as a local hero of great influence, display this shield as the badge of the AEginetan dynasty, claiming descent from Aias. The shield is bossed, or bellied out, with two half-moons cut in the centre, representing the waist, or pinched--in part, of the ancient Mycenaean shield; the same device occurs on a Mycenaean ring from AEgina in the British Museum.

40|$|Uniformity of the {{temperature}} in the mold plate is of paramount important since it will affect the dimensional stability of the part produced. To provide uniform temperature to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate,</b> many factors need to be considered such as choice of heating technology, uniformity of a heat source, a type of control, etc. This paper aims to study {{the temperature}} uniformity of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using closed-loop oscillating heat pipe (CLOHP) as a heat transfer device. The <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> which were P- 20 with the size of 306 x 130 mm 2 were used. <b>Metal</b> <b>plate</b> was gouged to a depth of 3 mm for installing the CLOHP. Distances from the heating device to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> surface were 5 and 10 mm. The surface temperatures of the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> were controlled at 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C. Sixteen pointa of temperature were recorded. The results were then compared to those using the heat source as the cartridge heater arranged in the similar way with the same heating capacity. Once the system entered the steady state, {{it was found that the}} temperature distribution of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using the CLOHP has a deviation in the range of ± 1. 00 °C and ± 0. 94 °C at the CLOHP depth of 5 mm. and 10 mm., respectively. While those of using cartridge heater deviated in the range of ± 1. 35 °C and ± 1. 16 °C. Compare to the recommended value from the ASTM Standard that the mold surface temperature need to be in the range of ± 2. 0 °C, the CLOHP shows the very promising results...|$|R
