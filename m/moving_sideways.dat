For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for <b>moving</b> <b>sideways</b> or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E

50|$|A slip is an {{aerodynamic}} {{state where}} an aircraft is <b>moving</b> somewhat <b>sideways</b> {{as well as}} forward relative to the oncoming airflow or relative wind. In other words, for a conventional aircraft, the nose will be pointing {{in the opposite direction}} to the bank of the wing(s). The aircraft is not in coordinated flight and therefore is flying inefficiently.|$|R
25|$|When {{band members}} are marching in one {{direction}} but want to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces {{in the direction of}} play. This is known as lateral marching, but is more commonly known as either shifting, traversing, or sliding. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a crab step when <b>moving</b> <b>sideways.</b> During a crab step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.|$|E
25|$|The result was, in many respects, {{the most}} {{advanced}} icebreaker {{in the world at}} the time. Although bow propellers had been a common feature in icebreakers around the world for decades, it was incorrectly believed that they helped with the actual icebreaking process by reducing the pressure under the ice in front of the ship. However, extensive research and recent experiences had shown that bow propellers improved the icebreaking capability because their flushing effect reduced the friction between the broken ice floes and the hull of the ship. The drawback of a single bow propeller was that it would lubricate only one side of the hull. As a result, the new Finnish icebreaker was designed with two bow propellers which would produce a more powerful and, more importantly, symmetric flushing effect. Furthermore, a vessel with four propellers would be extremely maneuverable and capable of even <b>moving</b> <b>sideways.</b> Prior to the new Finnish icebreaker, only the 1947-built Canadian ferry Abegweit had been fitted with such propulsion arrangement. While the new ship was not the most powerful icebreaker in the world at the time, the power-to-displacement and power-to-beam ratios of the new Finnish icebreaker put her in a class of her own among icebreaking ships.|$|E
500|$|The {{shell of}} the spiny scallop is {{slightly}} shaped like a fan {{and is able to}} grow to a height of about [...] though a more normal adult size is [...] The shell is composed of two valves, each of which is convex and has a small number of broad ribs covered with blunt spines. These radiate from the umbone, the rounded protuberance near the hinge, and between them are fine etched striations. The background colour is white with radial bands of pale purple and the right valve, which is usually underneath, is paler than the left. The annual growth rings are visible, often as concentric bands of a different hue. Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or auricles with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other. This provides an attachment for the single strong adductor muscle that closes the shell. On either side of the long hinge there are some little ridges and grooves known as teeth. Their function is to prevent the valves <b>moving</b> <b>sideways</b> with regard to each other. Some bivalve shells have large [...] "cardinal" [...] teeth on the hinge immediately below the umbone, but the spiny scallop does not. Instead it has 5 or 6 lateral teeth lying {{on either side of the}} hinge. Lining the inside of the valves is the mantle, a membrane that covers the gut and other internal organs. It can be seen round the margins of the valves as a thick layer like a sandwich filling. It is fringed with numerous short tentacles and there is a row of tiny simple eyes close to each of the valves. The animal usually lies on its right valve and its exposed, left valve often has a colonial sponge growing on it.|$|E

50|$|It {{involves}} the horse's inside fore marking {{time on the}} spot. The outside foreleg moves forward very slightly and the hind legs move in a semicircle around the inside foreleg. A clear walk rhythm and sequence should be maintained throughout. During the turn, the horse's forehand should be prevented from <b>moving</b> forwards, <b>sideways</b> or backwards. When first beginning to teach this movement, the horse bends in the direction away from {{the movement of the}} hindquarters (so he bends to the left if the hindquarters are being pushed to the right). When he advances, he may be asked to have a very slight flexion in the direction of movement.|$|R

50|$|Ocean sunfish often swim {{near the}} surface, and their {{protruding}} dorsal fins are sometimes mistaken {{for those of}} sharks.

50|$|A {{major concern}} during salvage is {{preventing}} rotational torque {{from becoming a}} transverse force <b>moving</b> the ship <b>sideways.</b> , lost like the Oklahoma in the Pearl Harbor attack, {{was meant to be}} recovered by a similar rotation after the Oklahoma.

2500|$|As with a flight, it is {{possible}} on a broad canal {{for more than one}} boat to be in a staircase at the same time, but managing this without waste of water requires expertise. On English canals, a staircase of more than two chambers is usually staffed: the lockkeepers at Bingley (looking after both the [...] "5-rise" [...] and the [...] "3-rise") ensure that there are no untoward events and that boats are moved through as speedily and efficiently as possible. Such expertise permits miracles of boat balletics: boats travelling in opposite directions can pass each other halfway up the staircase by <b>moving</b> <b>sideways</b> around each other; or at peak times, one can have all the chambers full simultaneously with boats travelling in the same direction.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 December 2011, the Russian Ministry of Transport {{ordered an}} icebreaking {{multipurpose}} emergency and rescue vessel from Arctech Helsinki Shipyard (AHS), then {{a joint venture}} between the Finnish STX Finland Cruise Oy and the Russian United Shipbuilding Corporation. The 76 million euro vessel, based on Aker Arctic's Aker ARC 100 oblique icebreaker concept developed for AHS, was designed to be capable of breaking level ice up to [...] thick both ahead and astern, and generate a [...] channel in [...] ice when <b>moving</b> <b>sideways</b> using three Z-drive thrusters with a combined output of 7,500kW. Initially, the hull of the [...] vessel referred to as [...] "NB508" [...] was to be built by Shipyard Yantar JSC in Yantar, Kaliningrad, where production began on 24 April 2012 and keel was laid on 6 July. However, instead of launching the unfinished hull in Kaliningrad and towing it to Helsinki for outfitting, the blocks were transported to Helsinki and the hull was assembled in Finland. The first blocks arrived on a barge on 9 April 2013 and the vessel, which was given the name Baltika, was completed in 2014. In 2015, the oblique icebreaker carried out ice trials in the Gulf of Ob where the sideways icebreaking was successfully demonstrated for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Tip stall can be {{prevented}} {{in a number of}} ways, at least one of which is found on almost all modern aircraft.

50|$|When {{attention}} deployment {{is driven}} by salient stimuli, it {{is considered to be}} bottom-up, memory-free, and reactive. Conversely, attention can also be guided by top-down, memory-dependent, or anticipatory mechanisms, such as when looking ahead of <b>moving</b> objects or <b>sideways</b> before crossing streets. Humans and other animals have difficulty paying attention to more than one item simultaneously, so they are faced with the challenge of continuously integrating and prioritizing different bottom-up and top-down influences.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the heavy}} masonry engine house {{used to support}} the beam and pivot of a {{conventional}} beam engine, the grasshopper beam was pivoted on a swinging link. The crankpin was carried directly by the beam and moved {{in a straight line}} vertically, the beam pivot <b>moving</b> slightly <b>sideways</b> on its link to allow this. This simplified the need for a parallel motion linkage on the piston rod. Grasshopper engines were thus lighter than conventional beam engines and could be built completely in factories, rather than requiring considerable erection work to be carried out on-site. This encouraged the use of grasshopper engines for smaller sized engines. Some makers, notably Easton & Amos of Southwark, specialised in such engines. Many were used for pumping, but not for powering large mills.|$|R
60|$|And {{yet this}} silence was {{presently}} {{broken by a}} recurring sound like breathing, interrupted occasionally by inarticulate and stertorous gasps. It was not the quick, panting, listening breath of some stealthy feline or canine animal, but indicated a larger, slower, and more powerful organization, whose progress was less watchful and guarded, or as if a fragment {{of one of the}} fallen monsters had become animate. At times this life seemed to take visible form, but as vaguely, as misshapenly, as the phantom of a nightmare. Now it was a square object <b>moving</b> <b>sideways,</b> endways, with neither head nor tail and scarcely visible feet; then an arched bulk rolling against the trunks of the trees and recoiling again, or an upright cylindrical mass, but always oscillating and unsteady, and striking the trees on either hand. The frequent occurrence of the movement suggested the figures of some weird rhythmic dance to music heard by the shape alone. Suddenly it either became motionless or faded away.|$|E
