50|$|The Prather Site {{is located}} 4.9 km {{west of the}} Ohio River and 2.4 km east of Silver Creek on a loess-capped upland ridge. It is unusual for a Mississippian mound center to {{be located in the}} upland area rather than the {{alluvial}} valley closer to the river, but the site is watered by permanent natural springs and shallow streams. Other sites in the complex to the northeast of the site are also situated primarily in the uplands, while those to the south and southwest are located in the alluvial valley. This implies the inhabitants of the area <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>settle</b> farther back from the river in an attempt to avoid contact with people traveling on the river, trading the richer soils and marine resources for this added safety.|$|E

50|$|Spurrells are {{recorded}} in Thurgarton, near Cromer, {{from the early}} 1500s and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>settled</b> there from Norwich.

The Spurrell family (the change in spelling from Sporrell to Spurrell occurred in the mid-16th century) owned several hundred acres of land in Thurgarton, Bessingham, Sustead, Gresham and Erpingham.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{literary}} {{evidence that}} monks and the Papar from a Hiberno-Scottish mission <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>settled</b> in Iceland {{before the arrival}} of the Norsemen. The twelfth-century scholar Ari Þorgilsson's Íslendingabók states that small bells, corresponding to those used by Irish monks, were found by the settlers. No such artifacts have been discovered by archaeologists, however. Some Icelanders claimed descent from Cerball mac Dúnlainge, King of Osraige in southeastern Ireland, {{at the time of the}} Landnámabóks creation.|$|R
5000|$|The name Gentilly was {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time in the 6th century as Gentilly, a royal estate of some importance where coinage was minted. The etymology of the name seems to be [...] "estate of Gentilius", a Gallo-Roman landowner. However, some other researchers think that the name is connected with Latin gentilis (meaning [...] "gentile", [...] "pagan", [...] "foreigner") in reference to foreign goldsmiths who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>settled</b> in Gentilly in the Early Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|The Romans {{built the}} Fossdyke which {{runs through the}} Saxilby area, but it is unknown whether they settled on the site.

During the 9th century, Viking invaders took many areas of Lincolnshire and some settled in Saxilby. In the 12th century, the Normans began creating Manors and the Manor in the Saxilby area was given to Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux.|$|R

5000|$|The medieval English {{word was}} Botehurst, thought to date {{at least from}} 13th century. Bote is the {{origination}} of Battle, although the family <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>settled</b> there post-dating the Conquest. This translated as 'a wood in a wood' which <b>may</b> in contradistinction <b>have</b> meant a clearing. The name of Apsley adopted by the family derived from Thakenham, near Pulborough in east Sussex, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> referred to apse - lea or a 'church in a meadow'. The Bathurst estates were at Cirencester Park and Paulspury, Northamptonshire, which Bathursts inherited before the park was {{laid out in the}} Cotswolds.|$|R
50|$|According to Peter Heather and Michael Kulikowski, the Ostrogoths did {{not even}} exist until the 5th century, when they emerged from other Gothic and non-Gothic groups. Other Gothic groups <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>settled</b> in the Crimea. It has also been speculated that the Crimean Goths were in fact Saxons {{escaping}} Christian persecution from the west, or North Germanic tribes who migrated southwards. Either way, the existence of Goths in Crimea is first testified from around the 3rd century, and after that they were well reported.|$|R
