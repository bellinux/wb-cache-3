Approximately 6,600 km of the submerged cable is buried 1 m below the sea bed. Cable burial was performed by either a submersible plough as the cable was laid or jetting the laid cable into the sea bed via remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).|$|R
50|$|Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) is a {{computer}} communications protocol. It is the layer 2 protocol for IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA).

SDLC was mainly used by IBM mainframe and midrange systems; however, implementations exist on many platforms from many vendors.

50|$|Point to Multipoint is {{the most}} popular {{approach}} for wireless communications that have a large number of nodes, end destinations or end users. Point to Multipoint generally assumes there is a central Base Station to which remote Subscriber Units or Customer Premises Equipment, CPE (a term that was originally used in the wired telephone industry) are connected over the wireless medium. Connections between the Base Station and Subscriber Units can be either Line of Sight or for lower-frequency radio systems Non-Line-of-Sight where link budgets permit. Generally, lower frequencies can offer non-Line-of Sight connections. Various software planning tools can be used to determine feasibility of potential connections using topographic data as well as link budget simulation. Often the point to <b>multipoint</b> <b>links</b> are installed to reduce the cost of infrastructure and increase the number of CPE's and connectivity.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} energy consumption of cellular access networks, energy efficiency of cellular systems should be considered jointly with spectral efficiency to obtain the overall performance metrics and trade-offs. Downlink coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission aided cell switch off schemes mitigate inter-cell interference and create an energy efficient system by eliminating the need to increase the transmit antenna powers of the active cells serving the users in the switched off cell. However, the performance of this newly proposed scheme is heavily dependent on {{the accuracy of the}} selected CoMP joint transmission set. We model the multi-point channel estimation enabled via channel state information reference symbols (CSI-RS) introduced in 3 GPP release 10 systems and simulate possible scenarios that would lead to inaccurate transmission set clustering: multi-point channel estimation errors and possible CoMP system delays due to CSI transfers, node processing delays and network topology limitations. Individual and joint impacts of system delays and estimation errors on energy efficiency and capacity performance degradations for various mobility conditions are demonstrated. These technical challenges and the clustering accuracy bottleneck are overcome by users performing multi-point channel estimation and serving eNB performing channel prediction procedures. Simulations are performed according to realistic large and small scale fading models for <b>multipoint</b> radio <b>links.</b> It is demonstrated that the users being served by larger joint transmission clusters are mor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a Local Oscillator for a new Broadband Access System based on Point to <b>MultiPoint</b> microwave Radio <b>Links.</b> The key advance is achieving good enough phase noise performance (100 dBc/Hz@ 100 KHz), over a relatively wide frequency band (15 %), with good pulling figure and harmonics suppression, at a low cost and small size, for volume production. A fully monolithic VCO/Prescaler solution, integrating the resonator, the reflection amplifier, a single-stage buffer amplifier, a divider by eight and all main bias circuitry into a 5. 16 mm 2 GaAs chip has been developed. The development procedure set to make this possible, with specific emphasis to volume production issues, is hereby described. Some simulation and measured data are also reported. Moreover, some open issues and existing problems that still hinder first run design success are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{power to}} detect disease-susceptibility loci through linkage {{analysis}} using pairs of affected relatives and affected-unaffected pairs is examined. Allelic identity by descent (ibd) for a completely polymorphic marker for sibling, uncle-nephew, grandparent-grandchild, half-sib, and first-cousin pairs is considered. Affected-unaffected pairs generally represent a poor strategy. For single-locus models, ibd depends on lambda R, the risk ratio for type R relatives compared with population prevalence, and the recombination fraction theta. The ibd for grandparent-grandchild pairs is least affected by recombination, followed by sibs, half-sib, uncle-nephew, and first-cousin pairs. For diseases with large lambda values and for small theta values, distant relatives offer greater power. For larger theta values, grandparent-grandchild pairs are best; for small lambda values, sibs are best. Additive and multiplicative multilocus models are considered. For the multiplicative model, the same formulas {{as in the}} single-locus model apply, except that lambda iR (for the ith contributing locus) is substituted for lambda R. For the additive model, the deviation from null expectation for ibd is divided among all contributing loci. Compared with the multiplicative model, for an additive model there is usually greater advantage in distant relationships. <b>Multipoint</b> analysis using <b>linked</b> marker loci for affected relative pairs is described. Simultaneous use of multiple markers diminishes the effect of recombination and allows for localization of the disease-susceptibility locus...|$|R
40|$|Lethal disease due to hepatic periportal {{fibrosis}} {{occurs in}} 2 %- 10 % of subjects infected by Schistosoma mansoni in endemic regions such as Sudan. It is unknown why few infected individuals present with severe disease, and inherited factors {{may play a}} role in fibrosis development. Schistosoma mansoni infection levels have been shown to be controlled by a locus that maps to chromosome 5 q 31 -q 33. To investigate the genetic control of severe hepatic fibrosis (assessed by ultrasound examination) causing portal hypertension, a segregation analysis was performed in 65 Sudanese pedigrees from the same village. Results provide evidence for a codominant major gene, with. 16 as the estimated allele A frequency predisposing to advanced periportal fibrosis. For AA males, AA females, and Aa males a 50 % penetrance is reached after, respectively, 9, 14, and 19 years of residency in the area, whereas for other subjects the penetrance remains <. 02 after 20 years of exposure. Linkage analysis performed in four candidate regions shows that this major locus maps to chromosome 6 q 22 -q 23 and that it is closely <b>linked</b> (<b>multipoint</b> LOD score 3. 12) to the IFN-gammaR 1 gene encoding the receptor of the strongly antifibrogenic cytokine interferon-gamma. These results show that infection levels and advanced hepatic fibrosis in human schistosomiasis are controlled by distinct loci; they suggest that polymorphisms within the IFN-gammaR 1 gene could determine severe hepatic disease due to S. mansoni infection and that the IFN-gammaR 1 gene is a strong candidate for the control of abnormal fibrosis observed in other diseases...|$|R
