50|$|In 1857 he {{introduced}} 'Mottled soap' {{which had a}} marbled appearance. This became a best seller, domestically and abroad. It was protected by Patent 1120 of 21 April 1857. The original blocks of soap were brown. Wm Gossage called in James Hargreaves, (1834-1915) a local consultant chemist. After many sleepless nights they eventually discovered a way to produce a whitish soap with the mottle (particles of ultra marine) distributed evenly through it, producing a soap that looked rather like a blue cheese. Other companies followed his lead- <b>mottled</b> <b>soaps</b> were widely made, by companies such as Christopher Price of Bristol. It is unclear whether they copied Gossage's ideas, or {{had some kind of}} licensing agreement.Some sources say that the Gossage company was responsible for 50% of all the UK's soap exports in the 1860s and 1870s. Gossage made soaps for India and China. For domestic sale, it made special soaps, such as kosher soaps.|$|R

The stairs were wet, and a pail stood in the narrow passage. From the kitchen came the sounds of crying {{children}} and a scolding mother. Master Joseph Henry Blows, aged three, was [...] "holding his breath," [...] and the family were all aghast at the length of his performance. He re-covered it as his father entered the room, and drowned, without distressing himself, the impotent efforts of the others. Mrs. Blows turned upon her husband a look of hot inquiry.|$|E

50|$|Hargreaves {{worked with}} his father for a time and began to {{experiment}} in chemistry. One of his interests was to attempt to recover sulphur from alkali waste. At the same time William Gossage {{was working at the}} same project at his factory in Widnes. In 1859 Hargreaves moved to Widnes and worked for Gossage. Here he made his first two important discoveries; the recovery of chromates which were used in the bleaching of fats and oils, and a method of bleaching brown soap. He was also involved with developing the process for making the commercially successful blue <b>mottled</b> <b>soap.</b> Around 1865 he left Gossage and worked with two other soap making firms, Hazlehurst & Sons in Runcorn and then Stephen Cox and Company in Liverpool.|$|E

40|$|The Bishop of Tasmania read an {{interesting}} paper entitled " Notes on a Recent Visit to Norfolk Island. " He stated that his visit in August, 1892, {{was but a}} hurried one, and his engagements were numerous, but I seized every opportunity that presented itself to me to discover all I could {{of the characteristics of}} this little spot so unique in its history from many points of view. My chief informant was Dr. P. H. Metcalfe, the medical officer of the island, indefatigable alike in the discharge of his professional duties and in the promotion of many branches of science. The first view obtained from the deck of a vessel reveals a larger island with two satellites. The largest of the latter is Phillip Island, a precipitous mass of red basalt set in the bluest of seas, and forming a striking feature in the landscape. Close to the shore of Norfolk Island is the little Nepean Island. The basalt of Phillip Island is remarkable for the brilliance of its colouring. A close examination shows that the rock, where disintegrated, has taken numberless delicate and vivid hues. As my informant defined it, " it is like <b>mottled</b> <b>soap.</b> " There was a time when Phillip Island was covered in many places with grass and herbage, and the pines were numerous. Sad havoc has been caused amongst the vegetation by the introduction of rabbits. These little pests ate up every green thing, the grass died, and then the heavy rains washed the soil away. The rabbits themselves are now perishing, but a few are still to be foun...|$|E
