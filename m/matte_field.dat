Up to now, the Konica K/AR cameras all had matte focus screens with a micro-diaprism dot in the center to help with focus. The split focus assist feature is not interchangeable by the user (the way some camera's focus screens are), and is pretty rare. (Note: In the earlier F/FS mount, Konica has similar screens with <b>matte</b> <b>field</b> and a central micro-diaprism dot, except for the highly valued and rare Konica F which not only had an interchangeable pentaprism, but also had the split image focus assist feature.) ...|$|E

We introduce {{a framework for}} compressing such adaptive hierarchies using a compact randomly-accessible tree structure. Prior schemes have explored compressed trees, but nearly all involve entropy coding of a sequential traversal, thus preventing fine-grain random queries required by rendering algorithms. Instead, we use fixed-rate encoding for both the tree topology and its data. Key elements include the replacement of pointers by local offsets, a forested mipmap structure, vector quantization of inter-level residuals, and efficient coding of partially defined data. Both the offsets and codebook indices are stored as byte records for easy parsing by either CPU or GPU shaders. We show that continuous mipmapping over an adaptive tree is more efficient using primal subdivision than traditional dual subdivision.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new image matting {{algorithm}} to extract consistent alpha mattes across sub-images of a light field image. Instead of matting each sub-image individually, our approach utilizes the epipolar plane image (EPI) to construct comprehensive foreground and background sample sets across the sub-images without missing a true sample. The sample sets represent all color variation of foreground and background in a light field image, and the optimal alpha matte is obtained by choosing the best combination of foreground and background samples that minimizes the linear composite error subject to the EPI correspondence constraint. To further preserve consistency of the estimated alpha mattes across different sub-images, we impose a smoothness constraint along the EPI of alpha mattes. In experimental evaluations, we have created a dataset where the ground truth alpha <b>mattes</b> of light <b>field</b> images were obtained by using the blue screen technique. A variety of experiments show that our proposed algorithm produces both visually and quantitatively high-quality matting results for light field images...|$|R
