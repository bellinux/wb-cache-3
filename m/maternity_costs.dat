40|$|Objective To {{estimate}} out-of-pocket {{medical expenses}} {{to women and}} families for maternity care {{at all levels of}} the health system in Burkina Faso, Kenya and Tanzania. Methods In a population-based survey in 2003, 6345 women who had given birth in the previous 24 months were interviewed about the costs incurred during childbirth. Three years later, in 2006, an additional 8302 women with recent deliveries were interviewed in the same districts to explore their maternity care-seeking experiences and associated costs. Findings The majority of women interviewed reported paying out-of-pocket costs for facility-based deliveries. Out-of-pocket costs were highest in Kenya (a mean of US$ 18. 4 for normal and complicated deliveries), where 98 % of women who delivered in a health facility had to pay some fees. In Burkina Faso, 92 % of women reported paying some fees (mean of US$ 7. 9). Costs were lowest in Tanzania, where 91 % of women reported paying some fees (mean of US$ 5. 1). In all three countries, women in the poorest wealth quintile did not pay significantly less for <b>maternity</b> <b>costs</b> than the wealthiest women. Costs for complicated delivery were double those for normal delivery in Burkina Faso and Kenya, and represented more than 16 % of mean monthly household incom...|$|E
40|$|ISER Working Paper Series www. iser. essex. ac. ukNon-Technical summary In many {{developed}} countries fertility rates are now too low for the population to replace itself {{from one generation to}} the next. In this context, fertility timings are particularly relevant, especially the age at first birth. Childbearing age has increased all over Europe. In England and Wales, for example, the mean age at first birth jumped from 25. 2 in 1980 to 30. 2 in 2006. Delaying motherhood has three potentially adverse effects on fertility. Firstly, it reduces the time-span for having more children; secondly, it may result in involuntary childlessness; and finally, it allows for downward revision of childbearing intentions. Great part of the empirical literature sees education as one of the main driving forces of childbearing postponement. The idea is that more educated women face higher <b>maternity</b> <b>costs</b> than less educated women because they have to forgo higher wages or put on hold better careers when having a child. In this paper we use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to explore other possible determinants. We assess the role of personality traits in timing of childbearing and investigate whether, and in what way, personality traits can explain the differences in maternity timing between more and less educated women. The personality traits are measured by the Big Five, collected for the first time in 2005. The Big Five personality traits correspond to the following five main personality dimensions: Extraversio...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVEdTo {{explore the}} {{independent}} effects of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on <b>maternity</b> care and <b>costs</b> RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdEstimates for maternity care resource activity and costs for 4, 372 women, of whom 354 (8. 1 %) {{were diagnosed with}} GDM, were generated from data from the Atlantic Diabetes in Pregnancy (ATLANTIC DIP) database. Multivariate re-gression analysis was applied to explore the effects of GDM on 1) mode of delivery, 2) neonatal unit admission, and 3) <b>maternity</b> care <b>cost,</b> while controlling {{for a range of}} other demographic and clinical variables. RESULTSdWomen with a diagnosis of GDM had significantly higher levels of emergency caesarean section (odds ratio [OR] 1. 75 [95 % CI 1. 08 – 2. 81]), their infants had significantly higher levels of neonatal unit admission (3. 14 [2. 27 – 4. 34]), and costs of care were 34 % greater (25 – 43) than in women without GDM. Other variables that significantly increased costs were weight, age, primiparity, and premature delivery. CONCLUSIONSdGDM plays an independent role in explaining variations in rates of emer-gency caesarean section, neonatal unit admission, and costs of care, placing a substantial eco...|$|R

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{discussed}} whether institutional regulations aimed at protecting specific groups of the labour market have indeed succeeded in achieving the intended goal or whether they have actually aggravated the labour market position of these groups. In our paper we analyse German maternity and parental leave regulations, concentrating on potentially negative implications of these regulations on the labour market position of mothers and young women respectively. We identify three main cost components that might influence the employment and wage position of young women: costs of wage subsidies borne by the employers during <b>maternity</b> leave, <b>costs</b> of human capital depreciation during maternity and parental leave and costs of reorganisation. We summarise empirical evidence regarding these aspects and conclude with legal and political implications concerning {{the improvement of the}} employment situation of women.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the role women groups in the Methodist church in Kenya are playing to fight poverty. To realize the aimed goal of {{exploring}} what role women are playing in the Methodist church to fight against poverty, the questions guiding the study were (a) what are women’s experiences as far as poverty is concerned {{and how do they}} conceptualize it? (b) What activities are carried out by the women groups and ways are the women in the Methodist churches under study doing to fight poverty? (c) To what extent does the Methodist church the umbrella of the women group organizations; support the women in their fight against poverty? The study used qualitative inquiry employing a multiple case study approach. The tools used for collecting data were semi-structured interviews, observations and a field notebook. Key findings from the study indicate that: The women had suffered the effects of poverty such as inability to meet basic needs: food, decent shelter, clothes, inability to cater for <b>maternity</b> <b>cost,</b> illiteracy and lacked income; Landlessness; Single parenthood; violence against women and could not access funding from regular lending agencies. The women in the Methodist churches in the study have formed self-help groups and are carrying out projects to generate income. They are planting trees to control environmental degradation. They are learning family planning and prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. They are also being educated on; human rights, curbing child labor and school-drop outs, female genital mutilation (FGM), better methods of agriculture, such as poultry rearing, production of bio-gas, making of improved Jikos (Jikos is a Kiswahili name for stoves), learning general hygiene, cookery, weaving, basketry and knitting. They sing inspiring and educative songs, dance for entertainment and dramatize bible verses as a way of expressing their ideas, feelings and opinions. All these are done in the name of fighting against poverty. This makes the style of fighting poverty employed by the women groups look complex. The focus of the thesis is the complexity of their experiences and conceptions of poverty on one hand and the activities they take part in to fight poverty on the other. Hence the title of the study is: The role of women groups in the Methodist Church in Kenya: The Complexity of Fighting Against poverty. The church is supporting women under study to fight against poverty by offering pastoral care. It offers moral support to the women as they carry out the projects. The other members in the Methodist church in study help the women to contribute when they hold Harambee. A Kiswahili word used to mean joining hands to make any challenging task easy...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Maternity</b> care <b>costs</b> in Nepal include {{formal and}} {{informal}} payment. Formal include for example the cost for blood or drugs; Informal payments can be voluntary such as gratitude payments, or bribes which patients are ‘expected’ to pay to get decent care or any care at all. One problem is that these payments are missing from formal accounts {{and they are not}} taken into account in health-policy decision-making. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate out-of-pocket expenses (formal/informal) for delivery care in the largest government maternity hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal and establish factors that affect informal costs. Methods: We used mixed-methods approach. We used questionnaire-based interviews with 234 women who had delivered in this hospital followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews with sub-sample of ten couples. SPSS software was used for analysis and cross tabulations and chi square tests, binary logistic regression were performed. Results: Women occurred various costs during a hospital confinement. The qualitative data suggested that some, but not all had started to save prior to the delivery. There is a significant association between making informal payments and whether or not the birth was planned to be in hospital or whether it was an emergency, p= 0. 025, ANC visits, p= 0. 008, woman’s occupation,p= 0. 025 and husband’s employment, p= 0. 022. Logistic regression suggested four factors associated with making informal payments, indicating a possible socio-economic link with ability to make informal payments. Conclusions: Although informal payments around birth itself were not substantial, such payments are very common. Better understanding of informal payments is important as the illegal status of unofficial health care payments means that it is difficult to establish the prevalence of this phenomenon. Moreover it forms a part of the private health expenditure rarely included in the national health statistics, they create perverse incentives, potentially reduce motivation for reform and will provide information about economic barriers to care...|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} household {{survey of}} medical care cost and health seeking behaviour in a rural community was conducted in Kirinyaga District, Central Province, Kenya from December 1990 to January 1991. Thirteen hundred and seventy (1370) households were surveyed {{in order to assess}} morbidity, utilization of health facilities for outpatient medical care, maternity and mother child health services, and expenditure on medical care including maternity. Socio-economic (education, household income, household size etc.) factors and epidemiolog ical factors (morbidity distri but ion) were also examined in relation to utilization of health care facili ties. Opinion regarding heal th prepayment schemes and cost- sharing was also sought. From the study, 605 (44. 2) households reported an illness episode that afflicted a member of the household within a recall period of two weeks. This was extrapolated thus each person experienced 2. 2 illness episodes per year. The commonest diseases that were reported (as perce i ved by the respondents) were malaria(28. 3 %), respiratory diseases (27. 6 %), gastro-intestinal diseases (18. 7 %), accidents (burns and traumatic injuries) (5. 0 %), skin diseases (3. 3 %), all other diseases (14. 0 %) and headache(2. 5 %) as a symptomatic illness. Health care facility utilization information revealed that 60 % of the households had obtained outpatient services from public health facilities and 40 % from non-governmental facilities (private and missionary health facilities). The public health facilities had provided maternity care to 55 % of the households xxi of which 45 % was provided by the district hospital. The non- governmental provided maternity care to 20 % of the population and 25 % of deliveries took place at home. 89 % of the households obtain MCH care from government health facilities. Socio-economic and epidemiological factors influenced utilization of health facilities. These includes economic status (particularly household income), type of disease and duration of illness. The proportion of households that had incurred some out-of pocket expenditure on medical care was mainly on maternity services 74. 6 %, outpatient care 41. 0 % and self-medication 24. 6 %. They were found to have spent a mean of Ksh. 8. 90 (S. D. 7. 1) on self administered medicines obtained from the local shops, Ksh. 78. 20 (S. D. 72. 0), on prescriptions bought from the chemist and Ksh. 43. 70 (S. D. 38. 0) on routine laboratory investigations. The households that paid money for butpatient treatment in both public and fee-for services facilities, incurred a mean of Ksh. 62. 70 (S. D 72. 50). Mean <b>maternity</b> <b>cost</b> was Ksh. 199. 50 S. D. 297. 70 and this was mainly in form of fees. Annual estimate of medical expenditure by households was as follows: Self-medications Ksh. 231. 40 (S. D. 187) Prescriptions Laboratory Outpatient Maternity Ks h. 2033 (S. D. 1872) Ks h. 1630. 20 (S. D. 1885) Ksh. 1136. 20 (S. D. 988) Ksh. 197. 20 Expenditure on maternity services was highly skewed. Income from regular household economic activities was found xxii to have a significant influence on the choice of the place of delivery of children (Chi-squared = 45. 92589 D. F. 8,P-value 0. 0000 < 0. 05). Expenditure on outpatient services was not influenced by salary or wage income. However there was a significant spending across the different income groups, that higher income categories spent more money for outpatient than those in lower income. (Chi-squared = 17. 15229 D. F 8 P-value 0. 0286 < 0. 05). Only about 11. 0 % of the households were enroled into a medical insurance scheme and these were mainly enroled with the compulsory National Health Insurance Fund (N. H. I. F.). There was an overwhelming posi ti ve response 76. 0 %) towards the health pre-payment scheme discussed with the respondent (s). Most household respondents did not favour the idea of cost-sharing (user- fees) in government health fac il it ies. They expressed various reasons for not favouring cost-sharing. Among the prominent reasons was that the government should provide free health services (47. 0 %), that people are paying taxes (19. 1 %) and that drugs are always in short supply in these facilities (26. 7 %). However on enquiry into what are the necessary conditions to be fulfilled for cost-sharing to be appropriate, it was observed that adequate drug supply was very crucial. The study recommended that a Rural Heal th Insurance Fund can form the backbone for a viable long-term financing of the increasingly expensive health care to the rural community and thus supplement the government's effort in the improvement of public health services...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study investigates (i) {{maternity}} care access {{issues in}} rural Tasmania, (ii) rural women's challenges in accessing maternity services and (iii) rural women's access needs in maternity services. METHODS: A mixed-method approach using a survey and semi-structured interviews was conducted. The survey explored women's views of rural maternity services from antenatal to postnatal care, while interviews reinforced {{the survey results}} and provided insights into the access issues and needs of women in maternity care. FINDINGS: The survey was completed by n= 210 women, with {{a response rate of}} 35 %, with n= 22 follow-up interviews being conducted. The survey indicated the majority of rural women believed antenatal education and check-ups and postnatal check-ups should be provided locally. The majority of women surveyed also believed in the importance of having a maternity unit in the local hospital, which was further iterated and clarified within the interviews. Three main themes emerged from the interview data, namely (i) lack of access to maternity services, (ii) difficulties in accessing maternity services, and (iii) rural women's access needs. CONCLUSION: The study suggested that women's access needs are not fully met in some rural areas of Tasmania. Rural women face many challenges when accessing maternity services, including financial burden and risk of labouring en route. The study supports the claim that the closure of rural <b>maternity</b> units shifts <b>cost</b> and risk from the health care system to rural women and their families.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. An exploratory, cross-sectional, {{qualitative}} {{survey was}} conducted to describe the market of lower income mothers who had recently {{given birth to a}} child in a state hospital in the Western Cape (WC) region of South Africa. These mothers were viewed by the researcher as potential consumers of low <b>cost</b> <b>maternity</b> plans which would provide for maternity care in Active Birthing Units (ABUs) in the private healthcare sector in South Africa. The motivation behind the research stems from various sources. The currently inequitable healthcare system in South Africa, which {{has been described as a}} two tier system in the recent Policy Paper on National Health Insurance (Republic of South Africa, 2011 : 4 - 5), is one such source. Reports of poor maternity care in the South African public healthcare system (Vogel, 2011 : E 1097 -E 1098), is another source of motivation behind the research report. It was apparent to the researcher that given the low quality of maternity care in state hospitals, a potential market of healthcare consumers – who would be willing to pay a small premium for what they considered to be a more acceptable level of maternity care in the private healthcare sector – could exist. This view was supported by research conducted by Joan Costa and Jaume Garcia (2003 : 587 - 599) in which the “quality gap” was confirmed as a driving force behind the demand for private health care. This focus on the lower socioeconomic groups as a market for private sector goods and services was found to be well described by Prahalad (2005). The researcher conducted interviews amongst mothers who had delivered a child in a public hospital in the previous two years. A convenience sample of 100 mothers was selected in a shopping mall in the Western Cape (WC). The researcher administered a structured questionnaire during a face-to-face interview with each of the 100 respondents. The respondents were rewarded with a shopping voucher to the value of 50 ZAR, which was both a prerequisite specified by the management of the shopping mall and consistent with rewards offered in similar studies (Francis, Battle-Fisher, Liverpool, Hipple, Mosavel, Soogun, & Nokuthula, 2011). Data collected from the questionnaire included both data on willingness to pay (WTP), as well as demographic data, which provided interesting insights into a relatively under-researched market segment. A statistical analysis of the data collected revealed that 31 respondents (31 %) reported a positive WTP for private maternity care. A statistically significant relationship was revealed between respondents’ WTP and the birth experience the respondents had had during their most recent pregnancy, whereby mothers who had described their most recent birth experience as “poor” were significantly more likely to exhibit a positive WTP for private maternity care (p= 0. 00006). Significant relationships between respondents' WTP for private maternity care and their age and household size were also discovered, whereby younger mothers were more likely to be willing to pay than older mothers (p= 0. 02) and mothers from smaller households were also significantly more likely to be willing to pay than mothers from larger households (p= 0. 02). Amongst a sub group of 32 respondents deemed to have potential monthly savings, those with a higher monthly household income were more likely to exhibit positive WTP (p= 0. 02753) than were those with higher levels of monthly expenditure (p= 0. 04093). The researcher acknowledged that the limitations of the research included the fact that respondents were selected non-randomly, as a small isolated sample, which made the extrapolation of the results to the larger population of South African mothers impossible. The research did, however, serve to describe the demographic characteristics of a new and relatively under researched target market of mothers from the lower socioeconomic segment of the WC. Data gleaned from this survey will serve to inform further research into this target market, so as to complete a more comprehensive feasibility analysis for the establishment of low <b>cost</b> <b>maternity</b> care packages and ABUs in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|Background: In high-income countries, {{hospital}} {{length of}} stay after a normal birth has gradually decreased correspondingly to {{length of stay}} in care of other patients. A short stay provides a greater opportunity for autonomy and an increased sense of participation, but it may involve great challenges satisfying parental guidance {{as well as on}} the possibility of preventing, discovering, and treating neonatal medical conditions. Aim: This study evaluates postnatal care based on cost calculations, risk assessments, and parents’ satisfaction with care. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 1 122 new mothers and her partner during 1998 - 1999. For the summary of utilization of health care services during the first 28 days postdelivery, the participants were linked with registry data from the hospital administration system for mothers and newborns (n= 773). The answers were also used to describe new parents’ experiences with postnatal care (n = 1 479). The costs for five postnatal care models were estimated, including three care options: Maternity Ward, Family Suite, and Early Discharge. Data about neonatal readmissions and death within 28 days was retrieved from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry, and the Swedish Cause-of-Death Register between 1999 and 2002 (n = 197 898). This data was related to data about postnatal follow-up practices from all 48 Swedish delivery wards. Results: The readmission rate for the mothers was similar among the various care options, and there was no difference in utilization of health care or breastfeeding outcome due to type of maternity care. As a proxy for morbidity, the readmission rate for the newborns was influenced by postdelivery follow-up routines as routine neonatal examination timing. Depending on the proportion of mothers receiving care at the <b>Maternity</b> Ward, the <b>costs</b> differed significantly between the various care models, while parents’ preferences complied with the cost-minimizing option Family Suite. Most mothers and fathers (70 %) were satisfied with the overall impression of the postnatal care, but 72 % were dissatisfied with at least one particular topic. A main finding was that the parents experienced a close emotional attachment, an affinity that was not always supported by the staff. The father was not treated as a principal character even though the parents wanted the father’s to be involved and recognized. Conclusions: Since the postnatal care options are not always the most cost minimizing and postnatal routines influence neonatal morbidity and parental satisfaction, the postnatal services need to be improved. Without increasing risks or costs, every postnatal care option ought to meet the families’ need for support, security, autonomy, and attachment with each other...|$|R
