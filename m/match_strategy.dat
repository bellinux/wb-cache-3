This paper presents a new customizable and effective matchmaker, called SAWSDL-iMatcher. It supports a matchmaking mechanism, named iXQuery, which extends XQuery with various similarity joins for SAWSDL service discovery. Using SAWSDL-iMatcher, users can flexibly customize their preferred <b>matching</b> <b>strategies</b> according to different application requirements. SAWSDL-iMatcher currently supports several <b>matching</b> <b>strategies,</b> including syntactic and semantic <b>matching</b> <b>strategies</b> {{as well as several}} statistical-model-based <b>matching</b> <b>strategies</b> which can effectively aggregate similarity values from matching on various types of service description information such as service name, description text, and semantic annotation. Besides, we propose a semantic <b>matching</b> <b>strategy</b> to measure the similarity among SAWSDL semantic annotations. These <b>matching</b> <b>strategies</b> have been evaluated in SAWSDL-iMatcher on SAWSDL-TC 2 and Jena Geography Dataset (JGD). The evaluation shows that different <b>matching</b> <b>strategies</b> are suitable for different tasks and contexts, which implies the necessity of a customizable matchmaker. In addition, it also provides evidence for the claim that the effectiveness of SAWSDL service matching can be significantly improved by statistical-model-based <b>matching</b> <b>strategies.</b> Our matchmaker is competitive with other matchmakers on benchmark tests at S 3 contest 2009...|$|R

5000|$|Valcareggi is also {{remembered for}} devising the infamous [...] "staffetta" [...] (relay) <b>match</b> <b>strategy</b> during the 1970 World Cup. Due to {{his focus on}} {{defensive}} stability, {{as well as the}} presence of two pure, prolific goalscoring strikers, Riva and Boninsegna, Valcareggi felt {{that it would not be}} possible to field Italy's two most revered advanced playmakers at the time, Gianni Rivera, and Sandro Mazzola, alongside each other. He believed the two creative players to be incompatible with each other, due to the rivalry between their respective clubs, and as he felt that deploying both players alongside the forwards would offset the balance within the starting line-up, in particular as Rivera, unlike Mazzola, was not renowned for his athleticism or defensive work-rate. He therefore conceived the plan, which essentially consisted of Mazzola playing the first half of each match, whilst Rivera would play the second half. Despite Italy's victory at the 1968 European Championship and their second-place finish at the 1970 World Cup, the tactic was widely criticised by the media, in particular due to Italy's negative performance during the group-stage and in the final defeat to Brazil, despite demonstrating their ability to successfully apply a more offensive, exciting style of play with Rivera in the semi-final against West Germany. The two players only played together briefly in the final, when Rivera came on for Boninsegna for the last six minutes of the match.|$|E

Preliminary experimentation over two speech databases in Spanish reveal that both the clustering algorithm and the fast <b>match</b> <b>strategy</b> are consistent and reliable. The histogram models, though being suboptimal – they succeeded in guessing the right cluster for unseen test speakers in 85 % of the cases with read speech, and in 63 % of the cases with spontaneous speech –, yielded around a 6 % decrease in error rate in phonetic recognition experiments. ...|$|E
