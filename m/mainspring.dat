5|$|Rand {{worked long}} hours through 1942 to {{complete}} the final two-thirds of her manuscript, which she delivered on December 31, 1942. Rand's working title for the book was Second-Hand Lives, but Ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story's villains. Rand offered The <b>Mainspring</b> as an alternative, but this title had been recently used for another book. She then used a thesaurus and found 'fountainhead' as a synonym. The Fountainhead was published on May 7, 1943, with 7,500 copies in the first printing. Initial sales were slow, but they began to rise {{in the fall of}} 1943, driven primarily by word of mouth. The novel began appearing on bestseller lists in 1944. It reached number six on The New York Times bestseller list in August 1945, over two years after its initial publication. By 1956, the hardcover edition sold over 700,000 copies. The first paperback edition was published by New American Library in 1952.|$|E

25|$|In 1675, Huygens {{patented}} {{a pocket}} watch. The watches which {{were made in}} Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the <b>mainspring</b> torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, {{in the same way}} that he thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, it {{has become}} popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as {{increase}} corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil spring guide rod which is now also fluted, magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the <b>mainspring</b> cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.|$|E
25|$|Some {{wristwatches}} are {{powered by}} kinetic energy (called automatic watches), {{in this case}} movement of the arm is used. The arm movement causes winding of its <b>mainspring.</b> A newer design introduced by Seiko ("Kinetic") uses movement of a magnet in the electromagnetic generator instead to power the quartz movement. The motion provides a rate of change of flux, which results in some induced emf on the coils. The concept is simply related to Faraday's Law.|$|E

50|$|Because {{they are}} {{subjected}} to constant stress cycles, up until the 1960s <b>mainsprings</b> generally broke from metal fatigue long before {{other parts of the}} timepiece. They were considered expendable items. This often happened {{at the end of the}} winding process, when the spring is wound as tightly as possible around the arbor, with no space between the coils. When manually winding, it is easy to reach this point unexpectedly and put excessive pressure on the spring. Another cause was temperature changes. If a watch was fully wound in the evening and the temperature dropped at night, without any slack between the coils the thermal contraction of the long spring could break it loose from its attachments at one end. In earlier times, watch repairers noted that changes in the weather brought in a rash of watches with broken <b>mainsprings.</b> Broken <b>mainsprings</b> were the largest cause of watch repairs until the 1960s. Since then, the improvements in spring metallurgy mentioned above have made broken <b>mainsprings</b> rare.|$|R

25|$|Each {{time the}} {{pendulum}} swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the escape wheel (g). The {{force of the}} clock's <b>mainspring</b> or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses {{against one of the}} pallets (h), giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, geared to the escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.|$|E

500|$|The first {{mechanical}} clocks, {{employing the}} verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around {{the start of}} the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. [...] The invention of the <b>mainspring</b> in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century.|$|E

500|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>mainspring</b> in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring {{was added to the}} balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the balance spring. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{limitations}} of the knee brace, Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at Ohio Stadium. The official [...] "Dedication Day" [...] for the stadium was October 21, 1922, and the opponent was Michigan. Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate Harry Kipke managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes. Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19–0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points. In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble. As the game wore on, the Buckeyes [...] "seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment." [...] Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel's performance against Ohio State this way: [...] "No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the <b>mainspring</b> of the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who was gumming things up for State. No man could go through an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters. It was beyond the power of any human being. With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed. Even when three or four of his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there. He tried to induce his teammates {{that he was able to}} play, and tried to break away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo. If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel." ...|$|E
500|$|The Type 94 pistol is {{operated}} by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James [...] D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil <b>mainspring</b> is positioned around the barrel instead of {{to the rear of}} the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. [...] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the [...] pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.|$|E
