Design/methodology/approach: The geometry of the helical rotor is designed based on the ruled surfaces.

40|$|This {{article is}} part of the {{research}} on the microstructural phenomena that take place during hot deformation of intermetallic phase-based alloy. The research aims at design an effective thermo - mechanical processing technology for the investigated intermetallic alloy. The iron aluminides FeAl have been among the most widely studied intermetallics because their low cost, low density, good wear resistance, easy of fabrication and resistance to oxidation and corrosion. There advantages create wide prospects for their industrial applications for components of machines working at a high temperature and in corrosive environment. The problem restricting their application is their low plasticity and their brittle cracking susceptibility, hampers their development as construction materials. Consequently, the research of intermetallic-phase-based alloys focuses on improvement their plasticity by hot working proceses.

50|$|CNC {{plunge milling}} {{is often called}} z-axis milling also. In this process, the feed is {{provided}} linearly along the tool axis while doing CNC processing. Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In <b>multi</b> <b>axis</b> plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E
5000|$|In wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides. The guides, usually CNC-controlled, move in the x-y plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z-u-v axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in x-y-u-v-i-j-k-l-. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to 0.004 mm, and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as 0.021 mm using Ø 0.02 mm wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is 0.335 mm using Ø 0.25 mm brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This [...] "overcut" [...] is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long — an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as [...] and the geometry precision is not far from ± [...] The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing {{is an important factor in}} determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness.Along with tighter tolerances, <b>multi</b> <b>axis</b> EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation.Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process.The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.|$|E

First one uses retrieved Slant Column Densities (SCD) of O 4. On second method, path is estimated from LIBRADTRAN radiative transfer model for the region and season. Results show that under low aerosol loading, O 3 and NO 2 mixing ratios concentrations can be retrieved with moderately low errors. Obtained concentrations have been compared with in situ instrumentation on the observatory. O 3 concentration in FT {{is found to be}} in the range of 40 – 80 ppb, approximately. NO 2 is in the range of 20 – 30 ppt, below the detection limit of in situ instrumentation. The different air masses scanned by each instrument have been identified as a cause of discrepancy between O 3 observed by MAX-DOAS and in situ...|$|E
