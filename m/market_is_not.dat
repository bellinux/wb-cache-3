25|$|The {{commercialization of}} the paper began in the mid-20th century. The Otomi began selling {{handcrafts}} in Mexico City in the late 1950s. Sale {{of the paper}} as a handcraft is traced {{as far back as}} the 1960s, but its exact introduction to the <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear. However, its recognition as an important craft came when it became tied to paintings done by the Nahuas from the state of Guerrero, who adopted styles from their ceramics to the new medium. At first, nearly all of the San Pablito amate production was bought by the Nahuas, leading to a standard 40 by 60cm paper sheet. Then the federal government intervened, mostly through FONART, at first to promote the craft internationally at the 1968 Olympic Games and later as the main buyer of the paper to keep Nahua painters supplied.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{importance}} of flavoproteins, it is unsurprising that approximately 60% of human flavoproteins cause human disease when mutated. [...] In some cases, this is due to a decreased affinity for FAD or FMN and so excess riboflavin intake may lessen disease symptoms, such as for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. [...] In addition, riboflavin deficiency itself (and the resulting lack of FAD and FMN) can cause health issues. For example, in ALS patients, there are decreased levels of FAD synthesis. [...] Both of these paths can result in a variety of symptoms, including developmental or gastrointestinal abnormalities, faulty fat break-down, anemia, neurological problems, cancer or heart disease, migraine, worsened vision and skin lesions. [...] The pharmaceutical industry therefore produces riboflavin to supplement diet in certain cases. [...] In 2008, the global need for riboflavin was 6,000 tons per year, with production capacity of 10,000 tons. This $150 to 500 million <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only for medical applications, but is also used as a supplement to animal food in the agricultural industry and as a food colorant.|$|E

2500|$|Sundaygar Dearboy {{was born}} in District 2, Grand Bassa County, Liberia. He {{is the father of}} two and the {{guardian}} of several others. Dearboy graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice from AME Zion College. He is the Project Manager for Liberia Trading & Investment Company (LINTRACO), one of Liberia's newest trading groups. Dearboy has a huge following among Liberians in the diaspora, particularly in the United States. In an interview posted on Oberia.net, Sundaygar said: [...] "Outside Liberia, my music is highly appreciated and supported by those who think my music helps virtually transport and reconnect them with their homeland. I find it gratifying that they support me. However, it is very disappointing that such support is not given to my music or artists locally. I also think that my music comes fore front as we rebuild our lives and try to reconsolidate our culture and tradition." [...] Speaking on the challenges currently facing the Liberian Music Industry, Dearboy said: [...] "Not many local artists listen to other music and try to emulate or learn from them. Plus, the local <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> accustomed to promoting what belongs to them. They prefer something from outside. Perhaps, the generally quality of production does not meet the standard as those produced in other countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{sell their}} extra tickets on StubHub at a profit, often tickets {{which are in}} high demand which are {{difficult}} to find. While concert tickets can get expensive when the demand is high, {{more than half of}} all tickets sold on StubHub go for at or below face value. Tsakalakis has stated that he believes the ticket <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a level playing field for the average person, in that before a ticket goes on sale, promoters have already sold the vast majority of seats to everyone from fan club members, American Express card holders and ticket brokers. He has said, [...] "There is this whole mentality within concerts that if it doesn't sell out right away it's not a hit. It just doesn't make sense. Nothing works that way. There isn't a supplier out there that says, 'The first day I put my product out there I want all of it to sell out and I don't want to have any more supply.' What business works that way?" [...] Sellers choose what they want to charge for the ticket. A range of tickets are listed, mainly sporting, concert, theater, and other live entertainment events. Music categories are divided into Classical and Vocal, Country and Folk, Dance and Electronica, Jazz, Blues and RnB, Rock, Pop and Hip-Hop, and World and New Age music. Theatre and comedy is organized by Cirque du Soleil, Classical music and opera, dance/ballet, family, festivals and fairs, film festival, museum, musicals, play, and other/miscellaneous.|$|E

The title is [...] "Some Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War in the Fourth Week of October, 1795." [...] The time is critically chosen. A month or so earlier {{would have made it}} the anniversary of a bloody Parisian September, when the French massacre one another. A day or two later would have carried it into a London November, the gloomy month in which it is said by a pleasant author that Englishmen hang and drown themselves. In truth, this work has a tendency to alarm us with symptoms of public suicide. However, there is one comfort to be taken even from the gloomy time of year. It is a rotting season. If what is brought to <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good, it is not likely to keep long. Even buildings run up in haste with untempered mortar in that humid weather, if they are ill-contrived tenements, do not threaten long to incumber the earth. The author tells us (and I believe he is the very first author that ever told such a thing to his readers) [...] "that the entire fabric of his speculations might be overset by unforeseen vicissitudes," [...] and what is far more extraordinary, [...] "that even the whole consideration might be varied whilst he was writing those pages." [...] Truly, in my poor judgment, this circumstance formed a very substantial motive for his not publishing those ill-considered considerations at all. He ought to have followed the good advice of his motto: [...] "Que faire encore dans une telle nuit? Attendre le jour." [...] He ought to have waited till he had got a little more daylight on this subject. Night itself is hardly darker than the fogs of that time.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} over to-day to the weekly fair at Attegrat. I was also there last Monday, but had no space to give to its {{description}} in my last letter. A more amusing sight I have seldom or never seen. Some two or three thousand people must have been present. The fair or market, as I suppose it should be called, is held upon a flat rocky slope {{on the other side}} of the village, and this is packed so close that one moves about among the squatting and standing groups with difficulty. At one end is the cattle-fair. The number each grazier brings into <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> large (seldom over two or three), and there they stand in little quiet groups surrounded by their master and several of his friends, and submitting to be felt, pinched, and examined as well as the best-behaved English cow would do. Here, too, are the donkeys, sturdy little beasts, not much bigger than a Newfoundland dog, but which will carry nearly as great a weight as a mule. I wonder our Transport Corps does not buy a lot of them for carrying commissariat stores. They will take two bags each, that is 150 pounds’ weight, and require no saddles, for the bags are merely laid upon their broad little backs and strapped there with a few strips of hide; they require no grain, and very little hay, and cost only five or six dollars. Any number of them might be purchased. These, like the oxen, stand very quietly, and appear perfectly indifferent as to any possible change in their ownership. They not unfrequently have young ones by their side, little round rough beasts with disproportionately-long ears and shaggy coats. The goats appear to take matters with less indifference. Their masters endeavour to keep them in little circles, with their heads towards the centre; but they are continually trying to escape from this arrangement, and to make a bolt for it. They keep up a constant bleating as a protest against the whole proceeding. Near to them is the grain-market. Here are men and women with their grain-bags, made of skins of goats sewn up, and with only an opening at the neck. They sit about everywhere, while the buyers walk about among them and inspect the samples with a gravity and intentness which would do no discredit to Mark-lane. Their purchases probably will not exceed two or three pounds’ weight, but they are as careful over the matter as a brewer would be who was going to make a bid for a ship’s cargo. The grain is almost entirely barley, and splendid barley too. There are beside, however, a variety of other grain, of which I do not know the names. The natives distil a spirit from their barley, which is said to be something between gin and hollands in flavour. I have not yet tasted any. Very thick is the throng round a Parsee belonging to the commissariat, who is buying up all he can get for Government at a dollar for nineteen pounds. Near him is another little crowd: here another commissariat employé is similarly engaged in buying up ghee—that is, clarified or boiled butter—for the native troops. It does not look very nice, and what does not make the sight the pleasanter is, that the women, when they have emptied the jars into the commissariat casks, invariably wipe them out with their hands, and then plaster the remainder upon their heads. An Abyssinian does not consider himself properly dressed unless his hair is shining with oil, not put on or rubbed on, but plastered on, and running down his neck as the sun melts it. The idea is not, according to our notions, pleasant, but it is a matter of taste. When an Abyssinian really wants to make a great effect he uses butter, not ghee, and puts it on until his head is as white as that of a London footman. Then he is conscious that he has indeed done it, and walks with a dignity befitting his appearance. There were several swells of the period so got up at the market, and as they stood under the shelter of their straw umbrellas—for the sun would melt it and destroy the whole effect—I could not but wonder at and admire the different forms which human vanity takes.|$|E
