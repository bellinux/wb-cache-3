5|$|Many {{basketball}} commentators picked UTEP to {{pull the}} upset, and at halftime it looked like they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> as UTEP led 33–27. Stevens {{made a number of}} halftime adjustments, and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. The team dominated the second half and won the game 77–59. Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State. The game was close throughout, but Butler emerged victorious 54–52 when Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the clock. The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career.|$|E
25|$|Middlesbrough faced Bristol City away in {{the third}} round of the FA Cup, the same tie they faced in the fourth round the {{previous}} year. Prior to the match, many pundits were predicting that the game could see a shock result with Bristol City winning. After 18 minutes it seemed they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> as Boro conceded a sloppy goal to Liam Fontaine, but the Premier League side fought back, with goals from Stewart Downing and David Wheater giving Boro a 2–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|Zhuge Liang <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about Fa Zheng, as {{inferred}} from an incident during the Hanzhong Campaign. During one battle, when the odds turned against Liu Bei, Liu's subjects urged their lord to retreat but he stubbornly refused. They {{did not dare}} to advise him again for fear of incurring his wrath. Fa Zheng rushed forth and {{stood in front of}} Liu Bei when Cao Cao's forces rained arrows on their camp. Liu Bei told Fa Zheng to stay under cover to avoid the arrows, but Fa insisted on braving the arrows with his lord. Liu Bei then decided to retreat together with Fa Zheng.|$|E
5000|$|Another of his targets {{is what he}} terms [...] "moral historicism", {{the attempt}} to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that [...] "history is the world's court of justice". This may {{take the form of}} {{conservatism}} (former <b>might</b> <b>is</b> <b>right),</b> positivism (<b>might</b> <b>is</b> <b>right)</b> or futurism (presumed coming <b>might</b> <b>is</b> <b>right).</b> As against these, Popper says that he does not believe [...] "that success proves anything or that history is our judge". Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.|$|R

25|$|Demosthenes's arrival {{provided}} little {{relief to}} the other Athenians. Their camp was located near a marsh {{and many of them}} had fallen ill, including Nicias. Seeing this, Demosthenes thought they should all return to Athens to defend Attica against the Spartan invasion that had taken Decelea. Nicias, who had opposed the expedition at first, now did not want to show any weakness either to the Syracusans and Spartans, or to the Athenians at home who would likely put him on trial for failing to conquer the island. He hoped the Syracusans would soon run out of money, and he had also been informed that there were pro-Athenian factions in Syracuse who were ready to turn the city over to him. Demosthenes and Eurymedon reluctantly agreed that Nicias <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> but when reinforcements from the Peloponnese arrived, Nicias agreed that they should leave.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{was dismayed}} by the album's lackluster reception. He noted that he [...] "thought {{it was the end}} of [...] career". Yankovic {{explained}} that [...] "I figured I'd peaked with 'Eat It' and 'Like a Surgeon' and now people were slowly forgetting about me and I was well on my way to obscurity." [...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever I go through the rough times, another peak <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> around the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Tyrion's {{meeting with}} Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) an [...] "iconic meetup" [...] that [...] "delighted fans, who were universally {{enthusiastic}} (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R. Martin’s novels." [...] Dinklage {{said in the}} interview, [...] "That’s {{the great thing about}} my character: He’s been everywhere. He’s the only character that goes searching. He’s been to The Wall and now he has to find the dragons." [...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him [...] "back into power".|$|E

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
500|$|Gold's {{plan was}} to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her {{conscience}} would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals {{to the public that}} Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue [...] "Operation Cobra." [...] Regina, Archie (Raphael Sbarge), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would {{do the right thing and}} tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed at the time, Pratt said [...] "I'm playing {{only for}} the money" [...] but when his wife Olive {{interrupted}} {{and said that he}} would still play for nothing, Pratt replied [...] "Well, she <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Remembering his and Barger’s structure-activity {{analysis}} of 1910, Dale wrote in 1953: “Doubtless I {{ought to have}} seen that nor-adrenaline might be the main transmitter – that Elliott’s theory <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> in principle and faulty only in this detail. … It is easy, of course, to be wise {{in the light of}} facts recently discovered; lacking them I failed to jump to the truth, and I can hardly claim credit for having crawled so near and then stopped short of it.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{felt the}} {{subtitle}} of the book, The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, overpromises. Some protested that pattern recognition {{does not explain}} the [...] "depth and nuance" [...] of mind including elements like emotion and imagination. Others felt Kurzweil's ideas <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> {{but they are not}} original, pointing to existing work {{as far back as the}} 1980s. Yet critics admire Kurzweil's [...] "impressive track record" [...] and say that his writing is [...] "refreshingly clear", containing [...] "lucid discussions" [...] of computing history.|$|E
2500|$|Overall {{critical}} {{reception for}} Mega Man V has been average to positive. While {{many aspects of}} the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. VideoGames summarized, [...] "If you don't have a Mega Man game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's Mega Man. If you're thinking 'rehash', you <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> and it's still a pretty fun game, though." [...] Nintendo Power was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, [...] "especially when you sit down with the Super Game Boy and cruise". GamePro was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler.|$|E
60|$|That night, {{when the}} warriors were asleep, Sigtryg and Hereward talked out their plans. They would equip two ships; they would fight all the kinglets of Cornwall at once, if need was; they would carry off the Princess, and burn Alef's town over his head, {{if he said}} nay. Nothing could be more simple than the tactics {{required}} {{in an age when}} <b>might</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
