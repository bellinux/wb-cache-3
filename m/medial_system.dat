25|$|The reticulospinal tracts, {{also known}} as the {{descending}} or anterior reticulospinal tracts, are extrapyramidal motor tracts that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. The reticulospinal tracts works with the other three pathways to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a <b>medial</b> <b>system</b> and a lateral system. The <b>medial</b> <b>system</b> includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the lateral system which provides fine control of movement.|$|E

40|$|The {{social world}} is {{incredibly}} complex {{and the ability}} to keep track of various pieces of social information at once is imperative for success as a social species. Yet, how humans manage social information in mind has to date remained a mystery. On the one hand, psychological models of working memory, or the ability to maintain and manipulate information in mind, suggest that managing social information in mind would rely on generic working memory processes. However, recent research in social neuroscience questions this possibility, as the same neural <b>system,</b> the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system,</b> that supports basic social cognitive processing disengages during working memory (McKiernan et al., 2003). In fact, a failure to decrease the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> during working memory actually interferes with working memory performance (Anticevic et al., 2010). However, prior to this dissertation, no research had examined the neural mechanisms supporting the ability to maintain and manipulate social cognitive information in mind, or engage in `social working memory' (SWM). Thus, the goal of the present dissertation was to examine, for the first time, the extent to which SWM and non-social, cognitive working memory (CWM) rely on the same or different underlying neural mechanisms. Paper 1 employed a novel SWM paradigm to examine which neural regions support SWM. In a within-subject design, participants (N= 16) completed SWM trials that required them to consider two, three, or four of their friends along a trait dimension during a delay period while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Linear increases in neural activity {{as a function of the}} number of friends considered (a response pattern characteristic of working memory systems (Rypma et al., 1999)) were found in two neurocognitive networks: the lateral frontoparietal system associated with CWM and the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> previously associated with basic forms of social cognitive processing (Meyer et al., Evidence for social working memory from a parametric functional MRI study, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2012). Thus, SWM and CWM may both rely on the lateral frontoparietal system supporting generic working memory processes, but only SWM may specifically recruit the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system.</b> Results from Paper 1 are discussed in terms of updating theories of effortful social cognition, <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> function, and implications for clinical populations with dual and/or differential impairments in social cognition and working memory. To confirm whether there may be a full dissociation in the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> across SWM and CWM, Paper 2 compared, within a new sample of subjects (N= 25), neural responses to the SWM paradigm (thinking about 2, 3, or 4 friends along a trait dimension during a delay period) to a difficulty-matched CWM paradigm (alphabetizing 2, 3, or 4 friends' names during a delay period). Results showed that the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> differentially responds to SWM and CWM: these regions linearly increased as a function of the number of friends considered along trait dimensions in working memory, but linearly decreased as a function of the number of friends' names alphabetized in working memory. Thus, the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> may uniquely support SWM processes, despite interfering with CWM processes. Moreover, linear increases as a function of the number of friends considered during SWM in the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system,</b> but not lateral frontoparietal system associated with generic forms of working memory, predicted individual differences in experimentally measured perspective-taking ability. These results suggest that working memory properties in the <b>medial</b> frontoparietal <b>system</b> track with social cognitive ability and may serve as a useful biomarker for social cognitive ability in clinical populations with deficits in social cognition and perspective-taking, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and/or social anxiety. Inspired by these neural results, Paper 3 examines the extent to which, just as CWM training can improve performance on tasks measuring cognitive ability (e. g., math and reading ability; Chein et al., 2010; Holmes et al., 2009), SWM training may improve social cognitive performance, and the extent to which such transfer effects may be unique to SWM (versus CWM) training. 57 participants were randomly assigned to complete SWM or CWM training. Both training interventions improved SWM, as well as perspective-taking performance. Thus, social cognition may be plastic and bolstered by working memory training. However, SWM training (vs. CWM training) uniquely related to the social cognitive gains in perspective-taking. Moreover, individuals with the most autistic traits, an index of social competence, showed the most gains in SWM only if they had undergone SWM (but not CWM) training. Consistent with the brain imaging results from Papers 1 and 2, results from Paper 3 suggest that SWM and CWM training may improve social cognition through at least partially different underlying mechanisms. Together, these studies suggest that SWM relies on at least partially unique neurocognitive mechanisms than CWM and that these unique mechanisms may be trained to bolster social cognitive ability. Results are discussed in terms of advancing theories of social cognition and working memory, as well understanding the etiology of various clinical disorders associated with social cognitive deficits...|$|R

40|$|Active {{cochlear}} micromechanisms, {{involved in}} auditory sensitivity, are modulated by the <b>medial</b> olivocochlear efferent <b>system,</b> which projects {{directly onto the}} organ of Corti. Both processes can be assessed non-invasively by means of evoked otoacoustic emissions. Animal experiments have revealed top-down control from the auditory cortex to peripheral auditory receptor, supported by anatomical descriptions of descending auditory pathways from auditory areas to the <b>medial</b> olivocochlear efferent <b>system</b> and organ of Corti. Through recording of evoked otoacoustic emissions during presurgical functional brain mapping for refractory epilepsy, we showed that corticofugal modulation of peripheral auditory activity also exists in humans. In 10 epileptic patients, electrical stimulation of the contralateral auditory cortex led to {{a significant decrease in}} evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude, whereas no change occurred under stimulation of non-auditory contralateral areas.

40|$|The {{avoidance}} of aversive events {{is critically important}} {{for the survival of}} organisms. It has been proposed that the <b>medial</b> pain <b>system,</b> including the amygdala, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), contains the neural circuitry that signals pain affect and negative value. This system appears to have multiple defense mechanisms, such as rapid stereotyped escape, aversive association learning, and cognitive adaptation. These defense mechanisms vary in speed and flexibility, reflecting different strategies of self-protection. Over the course of evolution, the <b>medial</b> pain <b>system</b> appears to have developed primitive, associative, and cognitive solutions for aversive avoidance. There may be a functional grading along the caudal-rostral axis, such that the amygdala-PAG system underlies automatic and autonomic responses, the amygdala-orbitofrontal system contributes to associative learning, and the ACC controls cognitive processes in cooperation with the lateral prefrontal cortex.

40|$|Background and objectives. Motor neglect (MN) is a {{clinically}} important condition whereby {{patients with}} unilateral brain lesions fail {{to move their}} contralateral limbs, despite normal muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation. MN {{has been associated with}} various lesion sites, including the parietal and frontal cortex, the internal capsule, the lenticulostriate nuclei, and the thalamus. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that MN depends on a dysfunction of the <b>medial</b> motor <b>system</b> by performing a detailed anatomical analysis in four patients with MN. Methods. Ten patients participated in the study: four with MN, four with left visual neglect but without MN, and three patients with left hemiplegia without MN. We used specific scales for clinical and neuropsychological assessment. We drew the lesion borders directly onto the original brain images of each patient, and plotted the lesions on anatomical atlases for grey and white matter. Results. Lesion locations were highly heterogeneous in our MN patients, and included frontal and parietal sites, basal ganglia and white matter. The only consistently damaged structure across all MN patients was the cingulum bundle, a major pathway of the <b>medial</b> motor <b>system</b> important for motor initiative, and a key connection with limbic structures crucial for motivational aspects of actions. Three MN patients with additional damage to lateral fronto-parietal networks had also signs of contralesional visual neglect.

40|$|Stuttering {{is one of}} {{the most}} common speech disorders. However, the {{etiology}} is poorly understood, and is likely to be heterogeneous. The aim of this thesis was to clarify causal mechanisms, focusing the brain. The project included theoretical development based on published data, and a broad approach of explorative studies and testing of hypotheses. The theoretical work focused the basal ganglia, leading to a model based on the dual premotor systems hypothesis (G. Goldberg, 1985, 1991), which defines two parallel premotor systems: the medial (the basal ganglia and the SMA), and the lateral (the lateral premotor cortex and the cerebellum). Stuttering is suggested to be caused by a disturbance of the <b>medial</b> <b>system,</b> in most cases in the basal ganglia. The core dysfunction is proposed to be impaired "go-signals" from the <b>medial</b> <b>system,</b> supposed to trigger the next motor segment in speech. According to this model, under some conditions speech control is shifted from the medial to the lateral system, thereby bypassing the dysfunction and resulting in fluent speech. The lateral system is suggested to be active when speech is combined with sensory input, like chorus speech or metronome. Also the effect of altered auditory feedback in reducing stuttering is proposed to be based on this mechanism. It seems as the lateral system is able control speech timing without sensory input, but that this demands increased attention to some particular aspect of speech, as occurs in imitation of dialects, exaggerated rhythm, reduced speech rate, or role play. Also singing is suggested to be based on the lateral system. Superfluous muscular activation accompanying stuttering may be a type of dystonia: involuntary contractions related to the basal ganglia disturbance. The high prevalence of stuttering at age 2. 5 to 3 years is proposed to reflect a normally occurring peak in the number of dopamine receptors at this age. A total of 35 stuttering adults participated. Two studies, of copper metabolism and "startle prepulse inhibition", did not indicate any significant differences in comparison with matched controls. It has previously been reported that stuttering may be associated with increased neuromuscular reactivity, measured as exaggerated eye-blink in response to noise. This aspect was investigated. The stuttering group showed somewhat stronger eye-blink, though not statistically significant. Strong eye-blink was not related to anxiety, but was clearly related to low calcium, which is known to increase the excitability of the nervous system. The stuttering group showed somewhat lower calcium, and a weak tendency towards more severe stuttering in case of low calcium. It is possible that low calcium can increase the severity of stuttering in some cases. A subgroup reported some traits of childhood ADHD, and this group typically also reported neurological incidents before the onset of stuttering. The subgroup without traits of ADHD typically reported having stuttering relatives but no neurological incident...|$|E

After applying the inclusion criteria, the sample was constituted by 24 individuals. The procedures used on the evaluation were audiological anamnesis, Transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAES) and research for the suppressive effect of TEOAES. A group control (GC) compounded by 23 individuals was compared to individuals exposed and non-exposed individuals. The data collection {{has been done in}} the room of Speech Therapy of Workers Health Reference Center of Santa Maria. Results: The TEOAES presence was major in the left ear in both groups; the average relation of TEOAES signal/noise in both ears was greater in GE; the TEOAES suppressive effect in the right ear was higher in the individual of GE (62, 5 %) and in the left ear was superior in GC (86, 96 %), with statistically significant difference.

Current knowledge indicates that the lateral system is involved in processing the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain, and that the <b>medial</b> <b>system</b> is involved in processing the affective-motivational aspects of pain. Hemispheric differences in brain activation (lateralisation) during nociceptive processing were studied to further clarify the division of function between the lateral and medial pain systems. Hemispheric lateralisation was studied by applying painful CO 2 laser stimuli of 3 -s duration sequentially {{to the left and}} right medial lower calves of five normal right-handed human subjects. The resultant brain activity was measured using 3 -T functional magnetic resonance imaging, by determining significant changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and applying a general linear modelling approach. Volumes of interest were defined for the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), the insular cortex, and the thalamus, on individual subjects' high-resolution structural scans. Hemispheric lateralisation was quantified by comparing the level of activation between brain hemispheres within each volume of interest. In SII, no significant hemispheric difference in activation was detected. In the insula, activation was significantly greater in the left hemisphere than the right. In both SI and the thalamus, activation in response to painful stimulation was significantly greater in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulus, which is consistent with these areas being involved in processing the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—At the {{auditory}} periphery, the <b>medial</b> olivocochlear <b>system</b> {{is assumed to}} be involved in complex sound processing and may be influenced by feedback from higher auditory nuclei. Indeed, the descending auditory pathway includes fibers coming from {{the auditory}} cortex that are anatomically well positioned to influence the superior olivary complex, and thus the <b>medial</b> efferent <b>system.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the hypothesis of an implied influence of the auditory cortex on the peripheral auditory system. In three rare cases of patients presenting with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, Heschl’s gyrus (i. e. the temporal superior gyrus) was surgically removed in the right hemisphere in two patients and in the left hemisphere in a third patient, in order to minimize epilepsy attacks, as preoperative stereo-encephalography had shown the epileptic focus or tumor to be situated in those locations. In all three cases, several weeks after the operation the <b>medial</b> olivocochlear <b>system</b> was clearly less functional on both sides, but especially on the side contralateral to the resection. In healthy controls, no such pattern was obtained. In four other epileptic patients, who were operated unilaterally at the anterior temporal pole, amygdala and hippocampus with the temporal gyrus partially spared, efferent suppression grew stronger in the ear ipsilateral to surgery. These results revealed that, in humans, the primary and secondary auditory cortex play a role in modulating auditory periphery activity through direct or indirect efferent fibers. In accordance with previous findings, this descending influence may improve the auditory afferent message by adapting the hearing function according to cortical analysis of the ascendin...|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{hypothyroidism}} induces developmental abnormalities in {{the auditory}} receptor, causing deafness {{due to a}} poor development of the outer hair cells (OHCs) {{and a lack of}} synaptogenesis between these cells and the olivocochlear axons. This efferent innervation is formed by two separate systems: the lateral system, which originates in the lateral superior olive (LSO) and reaches the inner hair cells; and the <b>medial</b> <b>system,</b> which originates in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB) and innervates the OHCs. A previous study carried out in our laboratory showed that in congenitally hypothyroid animals, the neurons which give rise to the efferent system are normal in number and distribution, although smaller in size. The aim of the present work was to study the efferent fibers in the auditory receptor of hypothyroid animals, by means of stereotaxic injections of biotinylated dextran amine in the nuclei that give rise to the olivocochlear system: LSO and VNTB. In hypothyroid animals, injections in LSO gave rise to lateral olivocochlear fibers lacking their characteristic dense terminal arbors, while injections in the VNTB-labeled fibers terminating in the spiral bundle region, far from the OHCs with which they normally contact. In the latter case, {{only a small percentage of}} labeled fibers reached the OHCs area, giving off only two radial branches maximum. Because the number of neurons which develop into the efferent innervation was normal in hypothyroid animals, we conclude that medial fibers may contact a new target.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is situated}} {{within the field}} of media studies, with a particular focus on the "materialities of communication. " The concept of "materialities" is oriented to the underlying conditions that allow communication to take place: the places, carriers and modes of communication that serve to shape and even alter meaning. My dissertation asks how this "material turn" can usefully be applied to and help develop the study of theatre. The dissertation is divided into four chapters. In Chapter 1, I undertake a critical review of the theoretical literature regarding materialities and its applications to media theory. In Chapter 2, I begin to explore the implications of the material turn for theatre. Scholarly interest in the relation of media and theatre has largely been focused on the use of media and technology within theatrical practice. I argue that theatre cannot be conceived of separately from the prevailing communicational possibilities of a given era, even if we accept the capacity for artistic intervention within these parameters. I integrate theoretical standpoints on the reproducibility, iterability and liveness of theatrical presence into a broad discussion of media and communication and thereby demonstrate a more fundamental relationship between theatricality and mediality. In Chapter 3, I extend my discussion of a "materialities of theatre" to the subject of translatability. Translation has long functioned as a metaphor for media as well as for theatrical representation. Discourses of the translatability between media forms have recently been revived by digital technologies that present translation as a model of universalization: the search for the perfect language into which all forms of knowledge can converge. Theatre works to converge media forms as a point of intersecting bodies, texts, voices and technologies, yet also remains persistently aware of the economy of shifting linguistic exchanges that renders total translation an impossible pursuit. I thus develop a study of the materialities of theatre that can attend to this disjunction in translation theory by addressing theatre as a point of medial convergence as well as a site of linguistic difference. In Chapter 4, I elaborate upon these standpoints by discussing circulation as a theoretical concept that, on the one hand, complements the study of materialities of communication and, on the other hand, seeks to overcome the abovementioned disjunction of translation theory. Concentrating on the case of Montreal as a site of heightened linguistic interaction, I investigate theatre as a <b>medial</b> <b>system</b> that works to absorb, interrupt and rediffuse the linguistic materialities of this city...|$|E

40|$|Efferent {{innervation}} of {{the inner}} ear is extensively studied but the whole model revealing the development of efferent synapses is not clear yet. In mammals the lateral and <b>medial</b> olivocochlear <b>systems</b> are known {{as the source of}} efferent fibers. The lateral olivocochlear system innervates the ipsilateral cochlea, terminating on the dendrites beneath the inner hair cells (IHCs), the dendrites being spiral ganglion neuron compounds. The <b>medial</b> olivocochlear <b>system</b> is involved in forming synapses directly on the outer hair cells (OHCs). To reach the final targets efferent axons use the afferent fibers as a scaffold. Efferent synaptogenesis occurs just before the onset of hearing. At P 0 in rats we observed synaptic-like contacts lacking typical features. At P 3 the synapses were immature. At P 4 – P 5 efferent contacts with IHCs were clearly defined. At P 6 – P 7 the efferent terminals were larger with distinct synaptic vesicles. During maturation, at P 8 – P 10, the number of efferent synapses {{at the base of the}} ICHs reduced alongside with a decrease in the synaptic cisternae. After P 12 efferent terminals formed axodendritic synapses below IHCs and large axosomatic synapses on OHCs. The innervation of OHCs underwent two stages, i. e. transitional with simultaneous innervation of IHCs and OHCs and a final OHC-targeted innervation.

The research is motivated by questioning and reflecting on my own mediality, a term defined here as the perceived reality that one is influenced by via the media, and an ongoing interest in the systems that enable the distribution, control, flow and ownership of ideas and imagery in media saturated environments. These systems are: methods and forms of media transmission and reception such as television, radio, internet, and distributed media such as films and music, and the resulting protocols or rules that sit alongside these transmission forms such as copyright, authorship, ownership and re-numeration. The work addresses both the personal, internal concerns of myself as author and the disconnected, autonomous qualities of the resultant work to reflect on larger observations about media saturated culture. It articulates a studio language designed to straddle the gulf between these two dynamics. The research output consists predominantly of installation environments comprising video, projection, sound, objects and images connected by series of static imagery. These explore the occurrence of an appropriation of the act of appropriation itself - a loop in space and time. This is achieved by capturing, observing, altering and re-transmitting the glimmers of this occurrence back into the <b>medial</b> <b>system.</b> This looping is the both the key strategic device and conceptual premise underlying the research. It uses both local and global sources of data, and mixes of information that include personal anecdotes, clichés and grand narratives, drawn from my observation of and intrigue with sub-cultures that can be loosely classified as taking a D. I. Y. or 'Do It Yourself" approach. These include Software and Hardware Hacking, Noise Music, Heavy Metal and Car Customisation. While appropriation {{is a part of}} all cultural development since the beginning of time, the project extends the discussion of appropriation in post-modern art practice. The defining period of appropriation art is seen by many as the post-Pop period of the late 1970 's in the work of artists such as Richard Prince, Sherrie Levine and Cindy Sherman. These artists use appropriation as both a direct strategy, and as a totalising subject matter of their work. My work extends a current dialogue surrounding appropriation strategies, with specific reference to the writings of Paul Taylor, Sean Lowry and Brogan Bunt, who posit a shift from direct, strategic appropriation strategies to a more innate, almost default presence of an appropriative urge operating in contemporary art production. This is considered in the light of works by Banks Violette, Takeshi Murata and Ondrej Brody & Kristofer Paetau, who all operate from a position of a subliminal appropriative urge or logic in their work. My project adds another discursive node to this field by making work that uses appropriation to loop and synthesise ideas, objects and images into installation environments. It synthesizes the experiential residues of personal encounters with mediated signals, contains them within new cultural statements and re-transmits them into the passing flow of time. Through the application of various appropriative strategies including sampling, remixing, collage and synthesis, the project generates new knowledge about cultural appropriation. It achieves this by creating a looping, referential system of production that operates as a reference-machine, a cascading system that creates overloaded medial transmissions. These transmissions submerge the audience into sensorially excessive installed environments that encourage contemplation about the role and place media occupies in our lives...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hypersensitivity to {{proximal}} gastric distention as {{a result}} of abnormal central nervous system processing of visceral stimuli is a possible pathophysiologic mechanism in functional dyspepsia (FD). Increasing evidence suggests involvement of both lateral and <b>medial</b> pain <b>systems</b> in normal visceral sensitivity and aberrant brain activation patterns in visceral hypersensitivity. We hypothesized that there is involvement of aberrant brain activation in FD with hypersensitivity to gastric distention. Our aim was to investigate regional cerebral blood flow during painful proximal gastric distention in hypersensitive FD. METHODS: Brain (15) O-water positron emission tomography was performed in 13 FD patients with symptoms of gastric hypersensitivity during 3 conditions: no distention, sham distention, and isobaric distention to unpleasant or painful sensation. Pain, discomfort, nausea, and bloating during maximal distention were rated on visual analogue scales. Data were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: The threshold for painful distention was 6. 6 +/- 3. 8 mm Hg greater than the minimal distending pressure. At the corrected P level of less than. 05, subtraction analysis (painful distention - no distention) showed activations in bilateral gyrus precentralis, bilateral gyrus frontalis inferior, bilateral gyrus frontalis medialis, bilateral gyrus temporalis superior, bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, and left gyrus temporalis inferior. Sham distention minus no distention showed no activations. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to healthy volunteers, proximal stomach distention in FD activates components of the lateral pain system and bilateral frontal inferior gyri, putatively involved in regulation of hunger and satiety. In hypersensitive FD, these activations occur at significantly lower distention pressures. In contrast to findings in normosensitivity, none of the components of the <b>medial</b> pain <b>system</b> were significantly activated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Auditory {{processing}} difficulties {{have been}} reported in schizophrenia. This study explores peripheral auditory function in patients with schizophrenia in whom certain early disturbances of auditory message filtering have been found and may be associated with certain abnormalities which are particularly localised in the left temporal lobe.  METHODS—Otoacoustic emissions, including click evoked and spontaneous emissions and measurements of functioning of the <b>medial</b> olivocochlear efferent <b>system</b> were obtained from 12 chronic schizophrenic patients and compared with normative data recorded from 12 normal controls.  RESULTS—Otoacoustic emission amplitudes and medial olivocochlear functioning were similar between the normal controls and schizophrenic patients; the schizophrenic patients did, however, differ from the normal controls in otoacoustic emission intensity and in medial olivocochlear asymmetry. A tendency to a higher number of spontaneous peaks, and a significantly higher click evoked otoacoustic emission response amplitude were found in the right ear compared with the left ear of schizophrenic patients. For the <b>medial</b> olivocochlear <b>system,</b> whereas normal controls showed greater attenuation in the right than in the left ear, schizophrenic patients lacked such an asymmetry.  CONCLUSION—In the absence of any attention task, the findings show disturbed peripheral lateralisation in schizophrenia of mechanisms involved in auditory information filtering. Such a lack of right ear advantage in medial olivocochlear functioning may thus be a peripheral reflection of central lateralisation anomalies. ...|$|R

Initially, the memory trace (features of the experience represented by red circles) is weak in the neocortex and is reliant on its connections to the <b>medial</b> temporal hippocampal <b>system</b> (MTH) for retrieval. Over time, an intrinsic process results in the strengthening of the connections between memory trace representations in the neocortex. Since the connections are consolidated, the memory can now be retrieved without the hippocampus.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the central processing of dynamic mechanical allodynia in patients with mononeuropathy. Regional cerebral bloodflow, as an indicator of neuronal activity, was measured with positron emission tomography. Paired comparisons were made between three different states; rest, allodynia during brushing the painful skin area, and brushing of the homologous contralateral area. Bilateral activations were observed in the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S 2) during allodynia compared to rest. The S 1 activation contralateral to the site of the stimulus was more expressed during allodynia than during innocuous touch. Significant activations of the contralateral posterior parietal cortex, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the thalamus bilaterally and motor areas were also observed in the allodynic state compared to both non-allodynic states. In the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) there was only a suggested activation when the allodynic state was compared with the non-allodynic states. In order to account for the individual variability in the intensity of allodynia and ongoing spontaneous pain, rCBF was regressed on the individually reported pain intensity, and significant covariations were observed in the ACC and the right anterior insula. Significantly decreased regional blood flow was observed bilaterally in the medial and lateral temporal lobe as well as in the occipital and posterior cingulate cortices when the allodynic state was compared to the non-painful conditions. This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting attentional modulation and a central coping strategy for known and expected painful stimuli. Involvement of the <b>medial</b> pain <b>system</b> has previously been reported in patients with mononeuropathy during ongoing spontaneous pain. This study reveals a bilateral activation of the lateral pain system as well as involvement of the <b>medial</b> pain <b>system</b> during dynamic mechanical allodynia in patients with mononeuropathy...|$|R
50|$|The {{dopamine}} reward circuitry in {{the human}} brain involves two projection systems from the ventral midbrain to the nucleus accumbens-olfactory tubercle complex. First, the posteromedial VTA and central linear raphe cells selectively project to the ventromedial striatum, which includes the medial olfactory tubercle and the medial NAC shell. Second, the lateral VTA projects largely to the ventrolateral striatum, which includes the NAC core, the medial NAC shell, and the lateral olfactory tubercle. These pathways are called the meso-ventromedial and the meso-ventrolateral striatal dopamine <b>systems,</b> respectively. The <b>medial</b> projection <b>system</b> {{is important in the}} regulation of arousal characterized by affect and drive and plays a different role in goal-directed behavior than the lateral projection system. Unlike the lateral part, the medial one is activated not by rewarding but by noxious stimuli.|$|R
