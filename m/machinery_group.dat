50|$|As {{relations}} between China and the Soviet Union gradually worsened, {{it led to}} border clashes in 1969. The People's Liberation Army requested new tanks that could match the Soviets, {{which led to the}} development of Type 69 by 617 Factory (now Inner-Mongolia First <b>Machinery</b> <b>Group</b> Company Ltd), incorporating some technologies from a captured Soviet T-62 tank. During the 1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict, the PLA was able to capture a Soviet T-62 MBT. The captured tank was examined, and some of its components, such as the Soviet Luna IR searchlight system, were copied and integrated into the Type 69 design. The Type 69 and Type 79 tanks became the first independently Chinese-developed main battle tank. However, the Type 69 wasn't formally accepted into PLA service until 1982, and then only in limited quantities. The PLA was unsatisfied with the Type 69's performance, but it became one of China's best armored vehicle exports. Over 2,000 were sold worldwide in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|The {{ship was}} {{propelled}} by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers, feeding Parsons single reduction geared turbines, which supplied [...] {{to the four}} propeller shafts.

The cruiser had two boilers and the turbines for the outer shafts forward, and two boilers and the turbines for the inner shafts aft; as steam from any boiler could be routed to any turbine, the ship could continue operating if one space was damaged. Each space had its own uptake, giving the modified ships a different profile to the single-funnelled early Leanders; an arrangement which contributed to naval historian Henry Lenton's description of the Modified Leanders as [...] "the most handsome cruisers ever built by the Royal Navy, with a symmetry that was as attractive as it was functional." ...|$|R
