In the US, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) urges consumers to dispose properly of end-of-life electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs {{that use the}} strictest standards and third-party certified recycling locations, to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA {{research has found that}} 58 percent of consumers know where to take their end-of-life electronics, and the electronics industry would very <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.|$|E

500|$|By 1564 Dudley had {{realised}} {{that his}} chances of becoming Elizabeth's consort were small. At {{the same time he}} could not [...] "consider ... without great repugnance", as he said, that she chose another husband. Confronted with other marriage projects, Elizabeth continued to say that she still would very <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> marry him. Dudley was seen as a serious candidate until the mid-1560s and later. To remove this threat to Habsburg and Valois suitors, between 1565 and 1578, four German and French princesses were mooted as brides for Leicester, as a consolation for giving up Elizabeth and his resistance to her foreign marriage projects. These he had and would continue to sabotage. In 1566 Dudley formed the opinion that Elizabeth would never marry, recalling that she had always said so since she was eight years old; but he still was hopeful—she had also assured him he would be her choice in case she changed her mind (and married an Englishman).|$|E
500|$|Ali died on November5, 1937, in Wolverhampton, England, {{from heart}} failure during {{a bout of}} bronchitis. Even before his death, a rumor had {{circulated}} that the Rockefeller Institute sought to procure Ali's stomach upon his death, and would {{pay as much as}} $50,000 for it. This claim appeared in a poster advertising Ali's impending appearance at a theater during his lifetime. After Ali's death was reported, the rumor resurfaced as an active offer of $10,000. When a Rockefeller Institute manager was interviewed about the story, he said the offer had never been made but that nevertheless, [...] "we should very <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see the body." [...] Almina and Julian transported Ali's body back to the United States on board the Queen Mary. According to a November29, 1937 article in [...] the New York Post, upon their arrival, Almina offered her father's body to Maryland's Johns Hopkins University for investigation by surgeons, after which it would be transported to Egypt for interment in a mausoleum. However, The Afro-American newspaper reported on December11, 1937, that Johns Hopkins' officials had declined the offer.|$|E
500|$|Although {{for much}} of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly {{preferred}} the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, [...] "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all." [...] Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as [...] "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, [...] "the greater they are, the worse they play me." [...] Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, [...] "I've run out of fingers". [...] Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns wrote to him in 1917, [...] "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to {{get to the end of}} it by dint of absolute determination." ...|$|E

It is terribly steep and broken." [...] Shipton and Bryant reached the same point on 9 August 1935 but, despite waiting several hours, mist prevented any view of the Cwm. They again reached the col on 11 August and on this occasion the mist cleared after many hours {{and they were able to}} get the first photograph of the Khumbu Icefall leading up to the Western Cwm. Bryant wrote [...] "A westerly spur of Nuptse curled round to the north thus squeezing the glacier of the upper basin into a narrow lip over which it poured in a gigantic ice-fall, a wild tumble of contorted ice, to the Khumbu Glacier 2,000 feet below. The cwm itself must be an amazing place, completely ringed in as it is, except for that narrow entrance, by a mountain wall nowhere less than 25,000 feet high." [...] Shipton reported how the Sherpas became quite excited as they recognised landmarks in their homeland, the Solu Khumbu.
