50|$|Diethylene glycol (DEG) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (HOCH2CH2)2O. It is a colorless, practically odorless, poisonous, and hygroscopic liquid with a sweetish taste. It is <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> water, alcohol, <b>ether,</b> acetone, and ethylene glycol. DEG {{is a widely}} used solvent.

2500|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> water, ethanol, <b>ether,</b> and chloroform.

The process is colloquially called salting out, and causes concentrated isopropyl alcohol to separate into a distinct layer.|$|R

50|$|For small molecules, the {{existence}} of an LCST is much less common than {{the existence}} of an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), but some cases do exist. For example, the system triethylamine-water has an LCST of 19 °C, so that these two substances are <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> all proportions below 19 °C but not at higher temperatures. The nicotine-water system has an LCST of 61 °C, and also a UCST of 210 °C at pressures high enough for liquid water to exist at that temperature. The components are therefore <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> all proportions below 61 °C and above 210 °C (at high pressure), and partially <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> the interval from 61 to 210 °C.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} ubiquinone- 3 (UQ) on dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) {{membrane}} were studied by surface monolayer, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and fluorescence techniques. DPPC and UQ are proved to be freely <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> the mixed monolayer at an air/water interface, and to be partially <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> bulk phase, i. e. bilayer and solid phase. There is a condensing interaction between UQ and DPPC in the UQ/DPPC mixed monolayers. The solubility of UQ in the DPPC is about 20 mole% and the solubility of DPPC in UQ is about 10 mole%.

50|$|The upper {{critical}} {{solution temperature}} (UCST) or upper consolute temperature {{is the critical}} temperature above which the components of a mixture are <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> all proportions. The word upper indicates that the UCST is an upper bound to a temperature range of partial miscibility, or miscibility for certain compositions only. For example, hexane-nitrobenzene mixtures have a UCST of 19 °C, so that these two substances are <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> all proportions above 19 °C but not at lower temperatures. Examples at higher temperatures are the aniline-water system at 168 °C (at pressures high enough for liquid water to exist at that temperature), and the lead-zinc system at 798 °C (a temperature where both metals are liquid).|$|R

40|$|A large {{secondary}} solvent {{effect on}} the reaction rate has been experimentally observed in the excited-state tautomerization of a 7 -hydroxyquinoline (7 HQ) molecule complexed cyclically with two water molecules <b>in</b> <b>ethers.</b> The proton acceptance of a water molecule from the enolic group of 7 HQ is the rate-determining step while the proton donation of a water molecule to the imino group of 7 HQ is followed rapidly to complete the triple proton transfer of the 7 HQ·(H 2 O) 2 complex <b>in</b> both diethyl <b>ether</b> and di-n-propyl ether.

25|$|In general, the {{hydroxyl}} group makes the alcohol molecule polar. Those groups can form hydrogen bonds {{to one another}} and to other compounds (except in certain large molecules where the hydroxyl is protected by steric hindrance of adjacent groups). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as protic solvents. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> water because the {{hydroxyl group}} wins out over the short carbon chain. Butanol, with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons such as pentanol and higher are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are <b>miscible</b> <b>in</b> organic solvents.|$|R
