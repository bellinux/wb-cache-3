40|$|This {{article is}} an {{exploratory}} {{examination of the}} benefits and risks associated with <b>opening</b> of stock <b>markets.</b> Specifically, we estimate changes in the level and volatility of stock returns, inflation, and exchange rates around <b>market</b> <b>openings.</b> We find that stock returns increase immediately after <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> without a concomitant increase in volatility. Stock markets become more efficient as determined by testing the random walk hypothesis. We find no evidence {{of an increase in}} inflation or an appreciation of exchange rates. If anything, inflation seems to decrease after <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> as do the volatility of inflation and volatility of exchange rates. Copyright 2000 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R

Against this background, we examine the extent of liberalisation and the nature of market performance in a group of European network industries – namely, electricity, gas, rail transport, and telecommunications. To determine the extent of liberalisation, we will use a composite index of <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> for each industry in EU- 15. To determine the impact of <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> on performance in network industries, we will examine a number of indicators for prices, employment, productivity, and customer perceptions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the introduction of}} the extended opening session of the futures market affects stock price behavior around the <b>market</b> <b>opening.</b> On January 1, 2001, the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) extended the trading hours by opening earlier 15 minutes than the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE). This change presents an opportunity to analyze how the extended opening session of futures market affects stock price behavior. Compared with the pre-extension period, the empirical results show that stock returns are less volatile and return autocorrelations are less positively correlated around the stock <b>market</b> <b>opening.</b> Moreover, overreaction for opening prices of the stock market is mitigated in the post-extension period. Finally, unexpected futures returns during the extended opening session can predict overnight stock returns. Overall, the empirical results are consistent with Foster and Viswanathan (1990) in that informed traders will trade aggressively at the <b>market</b> <b>opening.</b> Extended opening session of futures market, stock price behavior, informed traders, G 14, G 15, G 18...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} multiple {{approaches to}} examine the liberalization of rail transport in the European Union. A legislative review {{highlights the importance of}} unbundling infrastructure management and service operations in railway reforms. Furthermore, simultaneous and sequential decision making models specify how <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> minimizes the social deadweight loss and lead to more competitive pricing. Two production frontier models also analyze the effects of vertical disintegration and <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> on network outputs. Results suggest that both vertical unbundling and increasing competitiveness help improve productivity. Lastly, three case studies compare policy implementations across Europe. The United Kingdom, a front runner in railway liberalization, has used franchising to split up British Rail extensively. Germany’s integrated model, which keeps the infrastructure manager and the service operator under one umbrella company, has also reached the advanced level. Still, the incumbent Deutsche Bahn has maintained its dominance in long-distance routes. Meanwhile in France, reluctance to replace public ownership in railway companies poses a substantial obstacle for <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> reforms...|$|R

40|$|There are {{frequently}} regulatory and antitrust pressures for firms to cease price discrimination and practice uniform pricing. Such pressures, however, generally have negative welfare consequences when they lead to weaker markets not being served. This paper derives conditions that determine when price discrimination will induce service to a <b>market</b> (<b>market</b> <b>opening)</b> {{that would not}} be served under a regime of price uniformity. The factors that favor <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> under price discrimination are a large market share for the strong market, profit margins in the two markets that are far apart, and concave rather than convex demand curves.

Methods: With the use of key word ‘‘Taiwan’’, the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library of the University of California, San Francisco, was searched for internal documents related to smuggling activities, promotion of light cigarettes, and market share analyses in Taiwan. Age adjusted smoking rates and cigarette and betel quid consumption before and after <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> were compared. Results: By 2000, the market share of imported cigarettes increased from less than 2 % in 1986 to nearly 50 %, and per capita cigarette consumption increased 15 % following <b>market</b> <b>opening.</b> Because of the sharp increase in smuggling, with contraband cigarettes being as popular as legal imports, and the rapid proliferation of retail outlets, such as betel quid stalls, the market penetration by foreign tobacco companies was greater in Taiwan than among the other Super 301 Asian countries. Aggressive cigarette marketing strategies were associated with a 6 % increase in adult male smoking prevalence, and with a 13 % increase in the youth rate, within three years after <b>market</b> <b>opening.</b> The <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> also had an incidental effect on increasing the popularity of betel quid.

In addition, socially optimal degree of privatization has strong relations with <b>market</b> <b>opening</b> as well as foreign acquisition of domestic private firms.
