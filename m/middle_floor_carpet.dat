40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research project is to design, develop and validate an innovative vehicle <b>floor</b> <b>carpet</b> system with improved acoustic performance, and thus reduce noise levels inside the vehicle cabins. The proposed solutions are expected to improve vehicle <b>floor</b> <b>carpet</b> product in areas of acoustic performance, cost, weight and waste reduction, to be environmentally friendly and sustainable in manufacturing. The following are main research outcomes of the project. • Acoustically improved vehicle <b>floor</b> <b>carpet</b> with higher sound transmission loss and in-cabin sound absorption coefficient, compared to current production carpet designs. • Vehicle <b>floor</b> <b>carpet</b> designs that introduce minimum weight and cost penalty for the acoustic performance improvement obtained. • Material database, i. e. measured acoustic parameters for mathematical modelling, of different vehicle carpet layers. • Virtual modelling and validation method for design evaluation at component and vehicle levels. • In-situ vehicle on-road validation test methods for carpet designs • Optimization methods for further improving the design The following are identified as recommendations for future design work in improving vehicle carpet acoustics. • Introducing air-gaps {{in the range of}} 10 mm in between the heavy layers by use of a honey-comb structure improves the transmission loss by up to 20 dB in the frequency range of 1 kHz – 2 kHz, and up to 10 dB in the frequency range of 500 Hz – 1 kHz, and achieves the best sound transmission loss in these frequency ranges. • The introduction of honey-comb structure as an air-gap structure does not add any over-head in terms of weight or thickness, compared to foam, nor affects the total absorption of the carpet system. • Special tuned absorber layers like the perforated facing foam Helmholtz resonator and the corrugated foil faced foam membrane absorbers are excellent in extending the noise reduction frequency ranges to specific low frequency ranges of interest...|$|R

40|$|Optimizing {{acoustic}} {{performance of a}} vehicle at component or system levels is always a challenge to NVH Engineers. This paper {{is to develop a}} full vehicle statistical energy analysis (SEA) model for acoustic package application and focus on <b>floor</b> <b>carpet</b> system design optimization over cost and weight. Simplification and remodelling process of a vehicle SEA model were achieved from importing CAD model into the AUTOSEA 2 software. A procedure of the model development in AUTOSEA 2 was described and the vehicle was remodelled using plate/shell functions. The excitation and cavities were then applied to the model. Finally vehicle trim components in the model were assigned by correct materials. After the AUTOSEA 2 model was established, vehicle acoustic transfer function tests have been conducted to validate the vehicle AUTOSEA 2 model. Taguchi method has been introduced to find which location of the vehicle <b>floor</b> <b>carpet</b> will have the largest influences on the sound pressure levels inside the passenger compartment in consideration of power-train and tyreroad noise excitation...|$|R

50|$|In this lithograph, Escher uses {{two-dimensional}} {{images to}} depict objects {{free of the}} confines of the three-dimensional world. The image is of a rectangular three-story building. The upper two floors are open at the sides with the top floor and roof supported by pillars. From the viewer's perspective, all the pillars on the <b>middle</b> <b>floor</b> are the same size at both the front and back, but the pillars at the back are set higher. The viewer also sees by the corners of the top floor that it is at a different angle {{than the rest of the}} structure. All these elements make it possible for all the pillars on the <b>middle</b> <b>floor</b> to stand at right angles, yet the pillars at the front support the back side of the top floor while the pillars at the back support the front side. This paradox also allows a ladder to extend from the inside of the <b>middle</b> <b>floor</b> to the outside of the top floor.|$|R
