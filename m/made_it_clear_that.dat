He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E

50|$|The film did {{not follow}} Fleming's novel closely. A {{separate}} novelisation of the film was published {{at the time of}} the film's release. It basically followed the film's story but with some differences of tone and emphasis, e.g. it mentioned that Caractacus Potts had had difficulty coping after the death of his wife, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> the sequences including Baron Bomburst were extended fantasy sequences. It was written by John Burke.|$|R
5|$|Following his conviction, Brady {{was moved}} to Durham Prison, where he asked to live in solitary confinement. He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he never wanted to be released.|$|E

Although this <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> {{they were not}} [...] "real", Moffat thought that it looked odd, and [...] "hell to look at". The same script used for the pilot, with minor changes, was reshot by Bob Spiers for the first episode of the series proper.

50|$|During the 3rd century, three crises {{threatened}} the Roman Empire: external invasions, internal civil wars and an economy riddled with weaknesses and problems. The city of Rome gradually became less important as an administrative centre. The {{crisis of the}} 3rd century displayed the defects of the heterogeneous system of government that Augustus had established to administer his immense dominion. His successors had introduced some modifications, but events <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> a new, more centralized and more uniform system was required.|$|R

5|$|Most recently, Triumph International {{has been}} the subject of even greater {{criticism}} after mass layoffs in Thailand and the Philippines at the end of 2009 were met with transnational protests by trade unions.

Allegations that, parallel to the redundancies, another location was being set up in Thailand, were rejected.|$|E

Involvement in illegal resistance activity was a decision made by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school early for the NFL since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season.

40|$|Recently the Supreme Court has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> minimum {{scrutiny}} is {{a factual}} analysis. Whether in any government action {{there is a}} rational relation to a legitimate interest {{is a matter of}} determining whether there is a policy maintaining important facts. This has come about in the Court’s emerging emphasis on developing fact-based criteria for determining government purpose. Thus, those who want to affect zoning and eminent domain outcomes should look to what the Court sees as important facts, and whether government action is maintaining those facts with its proposed land use or eminent domain action...|$|R

The Queen <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, Beatrice and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without Beatrice, she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Britten died of {{congestive}} heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

500|$|The pilot, {{directed}} by John Kilby, was filmed at Pebble Mill in Birmingham on 9–10 August 1990. It is practically {{identical to the}} first episode of the series proper; some scenes are even reused, notably the scene with Mark and Becky meeting when he accidentally turns up at a funeral. The reused footage {{gave rise to the}} first episode's shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby. The stand-up sequences were shot against a black background. Although this <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> they were not [...] "real", Moffat thought that it looked odd. The pilot was transmitted on BBC2 as part of its Comic Asides series of pilot shows on 12 July 1991.|$|R
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally {{did so in}} September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in {{the birth of the}} modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC {{to limit the}} amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E
