25|$|The {{number of}} loci in a {{vertebrate}} species {{has been estimated}} at about 40,000. 'Good' species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci, even if the differences at {{most of them are}} very slight. But it takes as many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one. If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of gene substitution, as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000 generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in the existing environment and the residual environment.|$|E

Pierre-Simon Laplace had given an explanation in 1787 in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon, from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations.|$|E

The authors extend the literature by manipulating rater goals {{in the context of}} peer evaluations of graded group projects with a sample of 104 undergraduate students. They find that (a) pursuing a harmony goal increased <b>mean</b> <b>rating</b> and decreased discriminability, and (b) pursuing a fairness goal increased <b>mean</b> <b>rating</b> and decreased discriminability when the group projects had not ended and increased <b>mean</b> <b>rating</b> but did not change discriminability when the group projects had ended...|$|R

2500|$|By {{comparing}} extant sequences, one {{can determine}} the amount of sequence divergence. This raw measurement of divergence provides information about the number of changes that have occurred along the path separating the sequences. The simple count of differences (the Hamming distance) between sequences will often underestimate the number of substitution because of multiple hits (see homoplasy). Trying to estimate the exact number of changes that have occurred is difficult, and usually not necessary. Instead, branch lengths (and path lengths) in phylogenetic analyses are usually expressed in the expected number of changes per site. The path length is the product of the duration of the path in time and the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of substitutions. [...] While their product can be estimated, the rate and time are not identifiable from sequence divergence.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{interesting}} problems in Schumann resonances studies is determining the lightning source characteristics (the [...] "inverse problem"). Temporally resolving each individual flash is impossible because the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of excitation by lightning, ~50 lightning events per second globally, mixes up the individual contributions together. [...] However, occasionally extremely large lightning flashes occur which produce distinctive signatures that {{stand out from the}} background signals. Called [...] "Q-bursts", they are produced by intense lightning strikes that transfer large amounts of charge from clouds to the ground and often carry high peak current. Q-bursts can exceed the amplitude of the background signal level by a factor of 10 or more and appear with intervals of ~10 s, which allows to consider them as isolated events and determine the source lightning location. The source location is determined with either multi-station or single-station techniques and requires assuming a model for the Earth–ionosphere cavity. The multi-station techniques are more accurate, but require more complicated and expensive facilities.|$|E

According to a 2008 study by the University of Michigan, water is delivered once a week in big cities like Amman and once every twelve days in some rural areas. According to a 2007 survey the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of supply per week was 1.5 days in Madaba governorate, 2.9 days in Balqa governorate and 3.2 days in Zarqa governorate. In Amman, [...] according to the water distribution plan of Miyahuna, 8 out of 44 main distribution zones received continuous water supply [...] "except in emergency cases" [...] in 2012. Most other distribution zones were scheduled to receive water for either once a week for 24 hours or twice a week for a total of 36–48 hours.

Since the Disi-Amman Conveyor became operational in summer 2013 the continuity of supply in Amman has increased.|$|E
6000|$|Now a {{coast line}} of 100,000 miles with a width of 30 gives {{an area of}} 3,000,000 square miles, on which the denuded matter of the whole land-area of 57,000,000 square {112} miles is deposited.

But the <b>mean</b> <b>rate</b> of denudation over the whole earth is about one foot in three thousand years; therefore the rate of maximum deposition will be at least 19 feet in the same time; and as the total maximum thickness of all the stratified rocks of the globe is, according to Professor Haughton, 177,200 feet, the time required to produce this thickness of rock, at the present rate of denudation and deposition, is only 28,000,000 years.[43] ...|$|E

[86] It has {{usually been}} the {{practice}} {{to take the}} amount of denudation in the Mississippi valley, or one foot in six thousand years, {{as a measure of}} the rate of denudation in Europe, from an idea apparently of being on the [...] "safe side," [...] and of not over-estimating the rate of change. But this appears to me a most unphilosophical mode of proceeding and unworthy of scientific inquiry. What should we think of astronomers if they always took the lowest estimates of planetary or stellar distances, instead of the mean results of observation, [...] "in order {{to be on the safe}} side!"? As if error in one direction were any worse than error in another. Yet this is what geologists do systematically. Whenever any calculations are made involving the antiquity of man, it is those that give the lowest results that are always taken, for no reason apparently except that there was, for so long a time, a prejudice, both popular and scientific, against the great antiquity of man; and now that a means has been found of measuring the rate of denudation, they take the slowest rate instead of the <b>mean</b> <b>rate,</b> apparently only because there is now a scientific prejudice in favour of extremely slow geological change. I take the mean of the whole; and as this is almost exactly the same as the mean of the three great European rivers--the Rhone, Danube, and Po--I cannot believe that this will not be nearer the truth for Europe than taking one North American river as the standard.|$|E
