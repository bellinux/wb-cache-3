40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to upper bound the {{expected}} value of the second largest eigenvalue in magnitude of random regular graphs with a given <b>minimum</b> <b>girth.</b> Having a small upper bound implies such random graphs {{are likely to be}} expanders and thus have several combinatorial properties useful in various fields of computer science. The best possible upper bound asymptotically on the second eigenvalue has already been proven for random regular graphs without conditions on the girth. Finding this upper bound though required long and complicated analysis due to tangles, which are certain small subgraphs that contain cycles. This thesis thus hypothesizes that specifying a <b>minimum</b> <b>girth</b> large enough will prevent tangles from occurring in random graphs and thus proving an optimal upper bound on the second eigenvalue can avoid the difficult analysis required in order to handle tangles. To find such an upper bound on random regular graphs with specified <b>minimum</b> <b>girth</b> we consider the probability that a random walk in such a random graph returns to the first vertex of the walk in the k-th step of the walk. We prove for 2 -regular graphs that the random walk is more likely to visit any given vertex not in the walk than the starting vertex of the walk on the k-th step, and bound how much more likely this event is. We also analyze the d-regular case and we believe our findings will lead to a similar result in this case. ii Table of Contents Abstract [...] . i...|$|E

40|$|In {{the theory}} of digraphs, the study of cycles is a subject of great {{importance}} and has {{given birth to a}} number of deep questions such as the Behzad-Chartrand-Wall conjecture (1970) and its generalization, the Caccetta-Häggkvist conjecture (1978).

In this note, we prove these conjectures for digraphs with girth is at least as large as their minimum out-degree and without short even cycles. More generally, we prove that if a digraph has sufficiently large girth and does not contain closed walks of certain lengths, then the conjectures hold. The proof makes use of some of the known results on the Caccetta-Häggkvist conjecture, properties of direct products of digraphs and a construction that multiplies the girth of a digraph.

Besides, the parameter 0 < α ≤ 1 is used to implement a random variation in the selection. The value α = 1 corresponds to the original Dijkstra's algorithm. We noticed that if we fix α = 1 in our algorithm, the obtained interleavers produce high values of girths but sometimes unacceptable values of <b>minimum</b> distances. The <b>girth</b> is the length of a shortest cycle contained in the graph. This criterion of selection was a priority for the author of [30]. In fact, his first purpose was to maximize the correlation girth while keeping an acceptable minimum Hamming distance. However, the minimum Hamming distance is our most important criterion of selection in order to improve the distance properties of irregular TCs. If the pilot bits are highly correlated, they may dramatically degrade error performance and even ruin the possible gain due to a large minimum distance. In order to reduce the auto-correlation effect, the interleaver should spread the pilot bits by increasing the correlation <b>girth.</b> However, the <b>minimum</b> distance can suffer since a long cycle has more probability to contain parity bits of the same data bit. Thus, we do not look for maximizing this criterion but only increasing the correlation girth and searching for higher minimum distances. Therefore, different values were tested for the parameter a, and we finally set a to 0.85, giving a reasonable space of search. Every time an interleaver is found, we estimate the minimum Hamming distance of the irregular TC using the all-zero iterative decoding algorithm [13]. Only interleavers that improve the asymptotic performance of irregular TCs are memorized.|$|R

For <b>girth</b> 10, we provide a lower bound on the lifting degree which is tighter than the existing bound. More important, for an exponent matrix whose first row and first column are all-zero, we demonstrate that the non-existence of 8 -cycles proves the non-existence of 6 -cycles related to the first row of the exponent matrix too. All non-isomorphic QC-LDPC codes with girth 10 and n= 5, 6 whose numbers are more than those presented in the literature are provided.
