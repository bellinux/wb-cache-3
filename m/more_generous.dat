5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} {{dining rooms}} {{for males and}} females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, although <b>more</b> <b>generous.</b> The master and matron, for instance, received six times the amount of food given to a pauper.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi was {{originally}} created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> to calm his students in difficult situations {{to the point}} of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{would support}} Baptist missionary activity, fund universities, and heavily engage in {{religious}} activities at his Cleveland, Ohio church. While traveling the South, he would donate {{large sums of}} money to churches belonging to the Southern Baptist Convention, various Black churches, as well as other Christian denominations. One time, he paid for a slave's freedom and donated to a Roman Catholic orphanage. As he grew rich, his donations became <b>more</b> <b>generous,</b> especially to his church in Cleveland; nevertheless, it was demolished in 1925, and replaced with another building.|$|E

50|$|Later, Cheung {{appealed to}} the court for a lesser {{sentence}} similar to Won's, but on 6 April 2006 the verdict came down denying Cheung's request, citing that due to the heinous nature of the crime, that 35 years for Cheung was <b>more</b> than <b>generous.</b>|$|R
5|$|Aerojet's {{first two}} {{contracts}} {{were from the}} U.S. Navy; the Bureau of Aeronautics requested a solid-fuel JATO and the Wilbur Wright Field requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky was brought in {{as head of the}} company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.|$|E
5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{opinion of}} the theatre is <b>more</b> <b>generous,</b> with English Heritage {{describing}} the building as both Phipps' finest work {{and one of the}} best planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the Commonwealth Institute. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture. The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.|$|E
50|$|Officially, {{members of}} the corps {{received}} one pound per month in wages, although in practice they earned <b>more</b> from <b>generous</b> Americans for souvenirs or personal services. Political ideas from Americans about self-determination and class consciousness spread, and it was former {{members of the}} SILC who began the anti-colonial Maasina Ruru movement after the war.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{can tell}} you at once which she would choose. Your offer is very <b>generous.</b> It is <b>more</b> than <b>generous.</b> But, Sir John, a single life will not suit her; and my belief is, that were you to offer her the money without your hand, she would not take a farthing of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Others accused Father Peyton {{of living}} an ostentatious lifestyle, {{living a life}} with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Father Peyton {{maintained}} that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were <b>more</b> than <b>generous</b> to voluntarily donate {{a portion of their}} wealth {{all in the name of}} the Blessed Mother.|$|R
5|$|The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one {{of several}} {{companies}} that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> than that received by more established railways, such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above par value, but the government only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
5|$|When Metternich {{returned}} to Vienna in October 1810, {{he was no}} longer as popular. His influence was limited to foreign affairs, and his attempts to get a full Council of State reintroduced had failed. Convinced that a much weakened Austria should avoid another invasion by France, he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812. He also supported a period of moderate censorship, aimed at preventing provocation of the French. Requiring that only 30,000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French, the alliance treaty was <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions. He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon embarked upon the French invasion of Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Léone Teyssandier {{writes that}} a {{possible}} motive for Iago's actions is envy towards Desdemona, Cassio and Othello; Iago sees them as <b>more</b> noble, <b>generous</b> and, {{in the case}} of Cassio, more handsome than he is. In particular, he sees the death of Cassio as a necessity, saying of him that [...] "He hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Roberta, [...] "would {{it not be}} <b>more</b> {{fair and}} <b>generous</b> {{for you to go}} away now, and {{postpone}} this proposal until some time when you would each have an equal chance?" ...|$|R
25|$|How each bill determines {{subsidies}} also differs. Each bill subsidizes {{the cost}} of the premium and the out-of-pocket costs but are <b>more</b> or less <b>generous</b> based on the relationship of the family's income to the federal poverty level.|$|R
5|$|In July–September 830, al-Ma'mun, {{encouraged}} by perceived Byzantine weakness and suspicious of collusion between Emperor Theophilos and the Khurramite rebels of Babak Khorramdin, launched the first large-scale invasion of Byzantine territory {{since the start}} of the Abbasid civil war, and sacked a number of Byzantine border fortresses. Following his return from Egypt, Abu Ishaq joined al-Ma'mun in his 831 campaign against the Byzantines. After rebuffing Theophilos' offers of peace, the Abbasid army crossed the Cilician Gates and divided into three columns, with the Caliph, his son al-Abbas, and Abu Ishaq at their head. The Abbasids seized and destroyed several minor forts as well as the town of Tyana, while al-Abbas even won a minor skirmish against Theophilos in person, before withdrawing to Syria in September. In 832 al-Ma'mun repeated his invasion of the Byzantine borderlands, capturing the strategically important fortress of Loulon, a success that consolidated Abbasid control of both exits of the Cilician Gates. So encouraged was al-Ma'mun by this victory that he repeatedly rejected Theophilos' ever <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> offers for peace, and publicly announced that he intended to capture Constantinople itself. Consequently, al-Abbas was dispatched in May to convert the deserted town of Tyana into a military colony and prepare the ground for the westwards advance. Al-Ma'mun followed in July, but he suddenly fell ill and died on 7 August 833.|$|E
5|$|The 1601 Act {{sought to}} deal with 'settled' poor who had found {{themselves}} temporarily out of work—it was assumed they would accept indoor relief or outdoor relief. Neither method of relief was {{at this time in}} history seen as harsh. The act was supposed {{to deal with}} beggars who were considered a threat to civil order. The Act was passed at a time when poverty was considered necessary as fear of poverty made people work. In 1607 a House of Correction was set up in each county. However, this system was separate from the 1601 system which distinguished between the settled poor and 'vagrants'. There was much variation in the application of the law and there was a tendency for the destitute to migrate towards the <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> parishes, usually situated in the towns. This led to the Settlement Act 1662 also known as the Poor Relief Act 1662, this allowed relief only to established residents of a parish; mainly through birth, marriage and apprenticeship. Unfortunately the laws reduced the mobility of labour and discouraged paupers from leaving their parish to find work. They also encouraged industry to create short contracts (e.g. 364 days) so that an employee could not become eligible for poor relief.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the film's release, Bosley Crowther of the New York Times wrote in a review that the film [...] "is larded with rich and {{wholesome}} portions of nourishing Ma-Loves-Pa and it is seasoned with <b>more</b> than <b>generous</b> sprinklings of standard bucolic farce." [...] He summarized that it [...] "tends to monotony." [...] TVGuide.com rates the film 2½ out of four stars and calls it [...] "light comedy [...] [...] [...] amusing, but poorly directed." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Generous?</b> I was <b>more</b> than <b>generous</b> to him. They {{say that}} the poor are {{the friends of the}} poor, and I told you how poor we were in those days! Ah! but poor! my dear Sir, you have no conception! Meat in Paris in the autumn of 1816 was 24 francs the kilo, and milk 1 franc the quarter litre, not to mention eggs and butter, which were delicacies far beyond the reach of cultured, well-born people like myself.|$|R
60|$|Pala. No, never, except I {{were married}} to you: married people can never oblige one another; for {{all they do is}} duty, and {{consequently}} there can be no thanks: But love is <b>more</b> frank and <b>generous</b> than he is honest; he's a liberal giver, but a cursed pay-master.|$|R

25|$|A {{more active}} {{regional}} and industrial policy was pursued, tighter rules against dismissal were introduced, day care was introduced for {{children between the}} ages of three and six, spending on dental services, drugs, and appliances was increased, environmental protection legislation was passed, expenditure on education at all levels was increased, a tax reform bill was passed, lowering the tax burden for low-income and middle-income groups, the average age of entry into the workforce was increased, working time was reduced, social assistance and unemployment compensation were made <b>more</b> <b>generous,</b> early-retirement options were introduced, and municipalities received <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> federal grants to expand social infrastructure such as conference halls, sports facilities and public swimming pools.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> settlement, two mercenaries, Spendius and Mathos, {{organized}} a rebellion, based on speculation {{that after the}} foreigners left Africa, Carthage would be unwilling, or simply unable, to pay those remaining. In 240 BC Gesco and other officials were taken prisoner by the mercenary leadership and open warfare ensued.|$|E
60|$|FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF INDIANA:--I am here {{to thank}} you much for this {{magnificent}} welcome, and still <b>more</b> for the <b>generous</b> support given by your State to that political cause which I think is the true and just cause of the whole country and the whole world.|$|R

Willomena's sister, {{who also}} {{appeared}} in the episodes [...] "The Boy Who Cried Witch", [...] "The Pumpking King", and [...] "Which Witch?". While often assisting her sister in evil schemes, Ernestina also {{tends to be a}} bit <b>more</b> worldy and <b>generous.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kita is the pronoun {{used for}} first person plural inclusive. In some cases kita {{is used to}} replace kami (first {{personal}} plural exclusive) when talking about belongings or possession. This switch in pronoun to include the addressee(s) makes the speaker appear <b>more</b> community-minded and <b>generous</b> opposed to being arrogant or selfish.|$|R
25|$|Watkin's Great Central Main Line was {{designed}} to a continental European loading gauge, <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> than the usual specification on British railway lines, and {{it is thought that}} Watkin's aim was to construct a line which, when connected to a future channel tunnel, would be able to accommodate larger continental rolling stock.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after his}} marriage, Augustus desired a more {{imposing}} establishment. The {{result was that}} Maurice made <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> provision for his brother, who acted as Regent of Saxony in 1552 during {{the absence of the}} elector. Augustus was on a visit to Denmark when by Maurice's death in July 1553 he became elector of Saxony.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to create a single regime for both provinces, the {{incoming}} government of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper proposed an alternative approach. The two provinces could stick with the deals they had already signed, or they could accept a <b>more</b> <b>generous</b> formula that included 50 per cent of resource revenue in the equalization formula. Nova Scotia signed on October 10, 2007.|$|E

Colonel Pedro Julio Goico Guerrero (a.k.a. Pepe Goico), who served as Mejía's Head of Security and who guarded former U.S. president Bill Clinton on visits to the United States, got ten solid-gold President Rolex watches worth US $15,000 each and use of a credit card that the bank would pay off.|$|R
2500|$|Nudity was {{effectively}} the preserve {{of the history}} painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did.

50|$|Despite the Greek {{government}} receiving <b>more</b> than <b>generous</b> {{funding from}} Evangelis Zappas, back in 1856, for Athens to host athletic Olympic Games at the Panathinaiko Stadium, in perpetuity, {{members of the}} Greek government, notably Trikoupis and Stephanos Dragoumis, were resoundingly against them being athletic games. Trikoupis preferred an agro-industrial Olympics instead. The Zappeion, built to honor Zappas, was intended, by Trikoupis, to host agro-industrial competitions. Despite Trikoupis' anti-athletic politics, the Zappeion {{not only was the}} first indoor Olympic arena, hosting fencing in 1896, it also became the first Olympic Village in 1906. Coincidentally, Trikoupis died {{during the first week of}} the Athens 1896 Olympics.|$|R
