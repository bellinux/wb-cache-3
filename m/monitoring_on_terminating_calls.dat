50|$|Operation Maritime Monitor was a NATO {{operation}} {{during the}} Bosnian War {{to monitor compliance}} with sanctions imposed against the former Yugoslavia under United Nations Security Council resolutions 713 (1991) and 757 (1992). The operation began on July 16, 1992 and ran until November 22, 1992. Under Maritime Monitor, NATO ships from STANAVFORMED and STANAVFORLANT, NATO's standing naval force in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, patrolled in international waters {{off the coast of}} Montenegro. While NATO forces patrolled off the Montenegrin coast, the Western European Union ran a parallel operation, code-named Operation Sharp Vigilance in the Otranto Strait. Maritime <b>Monitor</b> was <b>terminated</b> <b>on</b> November 22, 1992 and replaced by the more aggressive Operation Maritime Guard.|$|R
30|$|System-level {{analysis}} involves statistics such as channel holding {{times for}} successful <b>terminated</b> <b>calls</b> and for forced <b>terminated</b> <b>calls</b> which are easily obtained at real networks while link-level statistics involve channel characterization (i.e., {{in terms of}} channel states characteristics and the probability distributions of the channel states duration), which are not easily obtained at real cellular networks.|$|R
5000|$|Bill {{and keep}} (B&K or BAK),also known as net payment zero (NPZ), is a pricing {{arrangement}} for the interconnection (direct or indirect) of two telecommunications networks {{under which the}} reciprocal call termination charge is zero. That is, each network agrees to <b>terminate</b> <b>calls</b> from the other network at no charge. According to the OECD, Bill and Keep is defined as [...] "A pricing scheme for the two-way interconnection of two networks under which the reciprocal call termination charge is zero - that is, each network agrees to <b>terminate</b> <b>calls</b> from the other network at no charge".|$|R
50|$|Termination {{rates are}} the charges which one {{telecommunications}} operator charges to another for <b>terminating</b> <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> its network. Traditionally three models of charging these fees are known: calling party pays (CPP), {{bill and keep}} (BAK, peering), receiving party pays (RPP).|$|R
50|$|For example, BT and the Australian carrier Telstra send {{each other}} traffic over a {{satellite}} link or by submarine communications cable. Telstra <b>terminate</b> <b>calls</b> to Australians from British callers, while BT <b>terminate</b> <b>calls</b> in the UK from Australians. At {{the end of}} the year Telstra and BT add up the traffic, measured in minutes, they have sent each other and settle net: if BT had sent more minutes to Telstra than vice versa, BT would pay at the settlement rate for the excess minutes. Settlement rates can be in the range of $0.10 - $2 per minute, depending on the countries involved. If the traffic balanced, neither company pays the other anything.|$|R

40|$|The {{accounting}} rate system currently in place {{is used to}} reimburse telephone companies {{around the world for}} <b>terminating</b> <b>calls</b> originating in foreign countries. Increased competition in more liberalized countries has led to imbalances between traffic originating in these countries and traffic coming in from less liberalized countries, leading to huge settlement payments being made to less liberalized countries. Some variation in {{accounting rate}}s across countries can be explained by traditional factors such as the actual cost of <b>terminating</b> <b>calls.</b> Our results suggest that accounting rates are also significantly affected by non-traditional factors such as the extent of government regulation, the level of corruption, and the like. These findings support the need for consideration of these factors in reforming the accounting rate system currently in place. “High settlement rates are a product of oligopolistic cooperation in a market with little transparency and anti-competitive regulation in the majority of nations” [Cowhey, 1998; p. 908].

5000|$|A Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is an E.164 defined {{telephone}} number used to route telephone {{calls in a}} mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Centre) to the target MSC (see Network Switching Subsystem). It can also {{be defined as a}} directory number temporarily assigned to a mobile for a mobile <b>terminated</b> <b>call.</b> A MSRN is assigned for every mobile <b>terminated</b> <b>call,</b> not only the <b>calls</b> where the <b>terminating</b> MS lives <b>on</b> a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN' ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ⎯ We {{investigate}} the statistical properties of both originated and <b>terminated</b> <b>call</b> arrivals in sets of real GSM telephone traffic data (TIM, Italy), emphasizing results {{obtained by the}} Modified Allan Variance (MAVAR), a widely used timedomain quantity with excellent capability of discriminating power-law noise. The call arrival rate exhibits a diurnal trend, with peak hours {{in the morning and}} late afternoon. Besides this diurnal change, the number of call arrivals in a second is found perfectly uncorrelated to the number of arrivals in other seconds and Poisson distributed, with good consistency by χ 2 -test evaluation. Uniform and accurate whiteness of call arrivals per second is verified in all hours, regardless the time of the day. In all series analyzed, the empirical statistics of both originated and <b>terminated</b> <b>call</b> arrivals proved excellent consistency with the ideal Poisson model with variable rate λ(t). This study may be valuable to researchers concerned about realistic modelling of traffic in planning and performance evaluation of cellular networks.

40|$|Our {{companion}} article {{developed a}} clear conceptual framework of negotiated or regulated interconnection agreements between rival operators and studied competition between interconnected networks, {{under the assumption}} of nondiscriminatory pricing. This article relaxes this assumption and allows networks to charge different prices for <b>calls</b> <b>terminating</b> <b>on</b> the subscriber's network and those <b>terminating</b> <b>on</b> a rivals network. This creates a price differential between services that are identical for the consumer and generates network externalities despite network interconnection. We show that in both the mature and entry phases of the industry, the nature of competition is substantially affected by such price discrimination. ...|$|R
