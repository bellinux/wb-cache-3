Software defined radio (SDR) techniques replace many of these analog components with digital signal processing (DSP) on rapidly sampled signals. We demonstrate that, generically, commercially available multi-channel SDRs are capable of time and frequency metrology, outperforming purpose-built devices {{by as much as}} an order-of-magnitude. For example, for signals at 10 MHz and 6 GHz, we observe SDR time deviation noise floors of about 20 fs and 1 fs, respectively, in under 10 ms of averaging.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 35). The {{growing number}} of users {{in the world of}} mobile communications and the ever increasing demand for higher data rates calls for inexpensive and flexible transmitter/ receiver architectures in wireless communication systems. Achieving such data rates imposes serious challenges on underlying hardware and RF circuitry causing non idealities and impairments more so than current systems. This can lead to significant performance degradation at the transmitter and receiver. In this thesis, we consider the problem of imbalances between the I- and Q- branches of the modulator/demodulator, in particular for OFDM systems. A novel compensation approach is proposed to solve this problem using baseband processing techniques, allowing for flexible RF design for high speed wireless systems. In particular, the proposed solution models transmit and receive side impairments such as receiver <b>mixers,</b> <b>filters,</b> phase and frequency errors and even channel distortions. The solution is obtained by joint estimation and compensation of the I/Q imbalance caused by the above impairments.

40|$|Abstract—Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) {{has emerged}} as a hot topic in {{wireless}} communications during the last decade. This is due to possible dramatic increases in reliability and capacity as compared to single-antenna solutions. However, much of the existing theoretical results are based on very simplistic models of the antennas and transciever circuitry. Within the Strategic Research Center on Atenna Systems Charmant at Chalmers, we are developing a systems simulator for making more realistic studies of MIMO systems. Models of different complexity can be used for the different components. For the linear components, S-parameters are used as the interface. These can come from theoretical models, electromagnetic field simulations, or directly from measurements. For the non-linear components, simple memoryless models can be used, as existing in the RF Toolbox. However, wideband applications demand more elaborate models. We have implemented a so-called memory polynomial model, which has been found to match measurements of nonlinear wideband power amplifiers well. Since RF Toolbox cannot handle multi-port scattering matrices (yet), the MIMO part is here computed in a Matlab function, and then implemented as a MIMO transfer function. The paper describes an implementation of a transciever chain including <b>mixers,</b> <b>filters,</b> PA/LNA, matching network, MIMO antennas and channel models.

30|$|In the literature, {{timing and}} carrier {{synchronization}} techniques are sometimes considered {{in conjunction with}} radio frequency (RF) front-end impairments. RF impairments arise {{as a result of}} the intrinsic imperfections in many different hardware components that comprise the RF transceiver front ends, e.g., amplifiers, converters, <b>mixers,</b> <b>filters,</b> and oscillators. The three main types of RF impairments are I/Q imbalance, oscillator phase noise, and high-power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities [26]. I/Q imbalance refers to the amplitude and phase mismatch between the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal branches, i.e., the mismatch between the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal. Oscillator phase noise refers to the noise in an oscillator, mainly due to the active devices in the oscillator circuitry, which introduces phase-modulated noise, directly affecting the frequency stability of the oscillator [27]. The HPA nonlinearities refer to the operation of the HPA in its nonlinear region when working at medium- and high-power signal levels. The influence of these RF impairments is usually mitigated by suitable compensation algorithms, which can be implemented by analog and digital signal processing. For a detailed discussion of RF impairments, the reader is referred to [28]. In cases where RF impairments (typically I/Q imbalance or phase noise) are considered in conjunction with timing and carrier synchronization, they are identified separately in the classification.|$|R
3000|$|Assume {{that the}} 2 -D angle {{estimation}} {{is divided into}} two separate steps, with each 1 -D angle computed from a subset of array elements, or sub-array. The separate bound cannot be lower than the joint bound, as any information about angle 2 that appears in sub-array 1 is ignored, and vice versa. Likewise, any noise correlation due to common elements in the sub-arrays will be ignored. Separate processing is of interest as it may lower the computational complexity of the angle estimation algorithm (performing two, 1 -D searches may be much easier than performing a single 2 -D search). Hardware savings are also possible if the radio frequency (RF) chains (i.e., amplifiers, <b>mixers,</b> <b>filters,</b> etc.) associated with the sensors are shared among the sub-arrays, reducing the overall cost, size, weight, and power of the system. For example, M sensors will only require M/ 2 RF chains if a switching mechanism is used and only one sub-array collects data at a time. As the system spends half the normal observation time collecting samples from each sub-array, and the below bounds would be modified by simply dividing the number of snapshots by 2 (our results do not include this factor of 2). The separate bound will enable us determine the performance cost of [...] "separate" [...] processing relative to the full (joint) array processing.|$|R

A local consortium was established to demonstrate a consolidated South African SAR ability to demonstrate to the local and international communities, by generating high quality images with a South African X-band demonstrator. This dissertation forms part of the project. It aims to describe the design {{and implementation of the}} transmitter and associated frequency distribution unit (FDU) for the SASAR II, X-band SAR. Although the transmitter and FDU are two separate units, they are ultimately linked. The transmitter has the task of taking a low-power, baseband, chirp waveform and. through a series of <b>mixers,</b> <b>filters</b> and amplifiers, converting it to a high-power, microwave signal. The FDU is essentially the heart of the transceiver and provides drive to all the mixer local oscillator (LO) inputs. It also clocks the DAC and ADC which allow the essentially analogue transceiver to communicate with the digital circuitry. It is found that the chirp signal produced is of satisfactory fidelity. LO feed through, however, is superimposed at the chirps' centre frequency. As a result of previous stages, spurious signals exist at 16 MHz offset from the chirps' centre frequency and at 9142 MHz. The system transfer function reveals that 2 dB roll-off is present at the outer frequencies of the chirp signal.

40|$|Radio {{receiver}} architectures with Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) {{close to}} the antenna can perform reconfigurable band selection in the digital domain hence resulting in increased integration and improved performance. Techniques such as Bandpass Sampling (BPS) require a sampling rate of at least twice the bandwidth of the received signal to sample and downconvert it to the baseband. Quadrature Bandpass Sampling (QBPS), on the other hand, accomplishes this with half the sampling rate of BPS, but utilises two ADCs. QBPS operates on the received Radio Frequency (RF) signal and uses two ADCs with sampling clocks separated by {{one quarter of the}} carrier signal period, 1 /(4 f c), relative to one another. For GPS L 1 signal, this delay corresponds to 158. 69 ps, which is not trivial to generate accurately. The use of QBPS in the analog front-end eliminates the need for expensive <b>mixers,</b> <b>filters</b> and the impairments associated with them. However, impairments associated with accurately generating the delay required between the sampling clocks, along with impairments in the signal paths between the ADCs result in performance degradation. This paper investigates the influence of these RF impairments associated with the QBPS scheme and compares its performance with different traditional RF front-end architectures in generating in-phase and quadrature signals. A quantitative comparison of architectures is performed using simulation case studies in MATLAB environment and their performance with respect to Image Rejection Ratio (IRR) and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is analysed. Results show that QBPS based architecture outperforms other architectures as well as resulting in reduced hardware complexity and subsequent reduced power consumption...|$|R
