5|$|An air well {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a dew pond. A dew pond is an artificial pond intended for watering livestock. The name dew pond (sometimes cloud pond or mist pond) derives from the widely held belief that the pond was filled by <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> air. In fact, dew ponds are primarily filled by rainwater.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants}} of Isis {{spread across the}} southwestern United States, and rainfall reached over 0.75inches (19mm) in Nevada and Utah. Low-level moisture dissipated as it continued inland, due to dry air, although upper-level moisture produced light rain across the Northwestern United States; Pocatello, Idaho recorded 0.59inches (15mm), while Missoula, Montana recorded 0.39inches (10mm).|$|E
5|$|<b>Moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants}} of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper-level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas, producing flooding near Waco that forced {{a family to}} evacuate in McGregor. The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. The system also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E
50|$|Memphis has a humid {{subtropical}} climate, {{with four}} distinct seasons. The summer months are persistently {{hot and humid}} due to <b>moisture</b> encroaching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Western Uttar Pradesh {{receives}} rain {{through the}} Indian Monsoon and the Western Disturbances. The Monsoon carries <b>moisture</b> northwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean, occurs {{in late summer}} and {{is important to the}} Kharif or autumn harvest. Western Disturbances, on the other hand, are an extratropical weather phenomenon that carry <b>moisture</b> eastwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. They primarily occur during the winter season and are critically important for the main staple of the region, wheat, {{which is part of the}} Rabi or spring harvest.|$|R
5|$|Southerly {{flow from}} Hurricane Norbert over <b>the</b> Pacific brought <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> Dolly over <b>the</b> Southwestern United States, {{resulting}} in possible life-threatening flash flooding.|$|R
5|$|September 2, 2006– The {{remnants}} of Hurricane John, an East Pacific storm, cause moderate to heavy rainfall. In northern Texas, <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm {{combined with a}} cold front produces rainfall of over , helping alleviate severe drought.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{first brought}} gusty winds and heavy {{rainfall}} to Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. While it was weakening, Alma produced flooding {{in central and}} eastern Cuba, causing seven deaths and forcing 3,000people to evacuate. Moderate precipitation spread across Florida, while thunderstorms from the storm caused light damage and killed one girl. <b>Moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm spread up the Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its path, Domoina left {{thousands}} of people homeless, and caused widespread flooding due to drawing <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean and the Mozambique channel. The rains led to rivers bursting their banks, which isolated tens of {{thousands of}} people. In the months before Domoina struck, dry conditions persisted across southeastern Africa.|$|E
50|$|Shred’s {{patented}} NoDistortion technology uses a semi-permeable valve {{to equalize}} the pressure between a goggle’s dual lens chamber {{and the current}} atmospheric conditions. This eliminates optical distortion while preventing <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> entering <b>the</b> goggles’ lens chamber. Shred introduced its NoDistortion technology in 2011.|$|R

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, {{the storm}} spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm produced light to heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7inches (175mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. Subsequent to becoming extratropical, {{the remnants of}} Jeanne turned eastward, exited into the Atlantic Ocean, and merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E
5|$|Although Blanca {{remained}} {{far from}} Jalisco, large swells and rip currents {{produced by the}} hurricane claimed four lives. In Northwestern Mexico, watches and warnings were raised prior to the storm's landfall. Blanca caused generally light damage in the region, consisting of downed trees and power lines. Remnant <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> system spread across the Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, washing out roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.|$|E

50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{significance of}} human underarm hair is still debated. It may naturally wick sweat or other <b>moisture</b> away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skin, aiding ventilation. Colonization by odor-producing bacteria is thereby transferred away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> skin (see skin flora).|$|R
5|$|Although {{the storm}} never made landfall, the fringe {{effects of the}} storm {{produced}} significant flooding across the Baja California Peninsula which damaged agricultural land and dozens of homes. Howard also produced large swells which reached 18ft (5.4m) along the Baja coastline and 10ft (3m) along the California coastline. About 1,000 lifeguard rescues took place in California due to the waves. <b>Moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm also enhanced rainfall in parts of Arizona, leading to minor accumulations.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable air over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight in South Carolina, and eight in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive <b>moisture</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Mexico and as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The region {{receives}} {{rain and}} snow precipitation through two primary weather patterns: the Indian Monsoon and the Western Disturbances. The Monsoon carries <b>moisture</b> northwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean, occurs {{in late summer}} and {{is important to the}} Kharif or autumn harvest. Western Disturbances, on the other hand, are an extratropical weather phenomenon that carry <b>moisture</b> eastwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. They primarily occur during the winter season and are critically important for the Rabi or spring harvest, which includes the main staple over much of North India, wheat. The states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand receive sustained snowfall in winter months.|$|R
