40|$|Extract: Mandatory {{mediation}} is not {{frequently used}} in Sweden. This {{is also true}} {{with respect to the}} other Nordic countries. However, the mediation of labour disputes has a long-standing history in Sweden and many labour disputes must be mediated. Labour disputes are heard by a special institute, the National Mediation Office in Stockholm, which is {{not a part of the}} court system. Some landlord/tenant and intellectual property disputes must be mediated, and on 1 July 2002 an Act regarding <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> came into effect. The Paternity Act also specifies that the local Social Welfare Board shall provide an opportunity to the spouses or cohabitants to participate in conciliation discussions together with a professional social worker...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the current social relations generates the necessity of developing and applyingnew methods of settling conflicts. Mediation can serve as an effective tool in resolving various conflictsincluding the criminal matters. This article gives a panoramic view on {{the application of the}} concept ofmediation and highlights the main features of <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> as they are reported to the nationallegislation and the legislation of Romania. Therefore the advantages of mediation and the opportunity toapply the latter in order to slave the conflicts caused by the commission of criminal offences are still beingdiscussed. The Romanian legislation and the Community rules establish the scope of expressly exemptedareas, the sides of freedom being the main principle, the mandatory dispositions being the exception. Fromthe contents of the Law 192 / 2006 result that mediation is exercisable in all areas with the condition that therights which make the subject of mediation could be used by the sides of the mediation. The mediation theoryanalyses the extrajudicial mediation and judicial mediation settlement...|$|E
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of {{the requirements of the}} Bachelor of Laws Degree at Strathmore University Law SchoolThe purpose of carrying out this study is to discover whether mediation can be applied in the resolution of criminal disputes in Kenya and specifically, to find out at what point of the trial process criminal cases can be referred to mediation; whether mediation by itself, is sufficient for the resolution of criminal disputes; and the contribution that mediation can make to the offender’s rehabilitation. The research methodology for this study entails the use of journals and other secondary sources from Strathmore University’s online library resources, and international legal instruments. This study begins with the research proposal under which the problem, the research questions, and {{the purpose of the study}} are introduced. Chapter 2 deals with the theoretical framework, consisting of three interrelated theories, and the views of different authors are encompassed under the literature review. Chapter 3 entails a critical interrogation into the applicability of <b>mediation</b> <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> Chapter 4 is an examination of the international legal framework in place to deal with mediation of criminal matters. The last chapter contains a summary of the main findings of this study, in addition to the conclusion and recommendations. The main findings of this study are the following: mediation can be used to resolve criminal disputes; mediation can be introduced prior to the presentation of the case before court, after a guilty verdict but before sentencing, or after sentencing; and mediation can lead to a positive outcome for the case and a positive change on the offender’s behaviour. The major recommendations of this study are that mediation should be applied in Kenya in the resolution of criminal cases and that a legislation on criminal mediation would be necessary and would have to address three key areas- the conditions of referral of cases to mediation; the training and qualifications of mediators; and the outcome of cases after mediation...|$|E

5000|$|Special verdict {{forms are}} common in civil cases. However, many courts disfavour their use <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> This is because juries {{traditionally}} {{have the power to}} issue a one- or two-word general verdict <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases,</b> simply pronouncing a defendant [...] "guilty" [...] or [...] "not guilty." [...] By this means, criminal juries are never required to explain their verdicts. The right to issue a general verdict <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> is thus considered one of the great protections of trial by jury.|$|R
50|$|Verdicts <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> must be unanimous, {{with the}} {{following}} exceptions: Currently, two states, Oregon and Louisiana, do not require unanimous verdicts <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> Each requires a 10-2 majority for conviction, except for capital crimes: Oregon requires at least 11 votes and Louisiana requires all 12.|$|R
25|$|A {{different}} {{pattern has}} emerged <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>In</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases,</b> {{the prosecution has}} {{the burden of proof}} and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case. But, Daubert motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges. Some critics of the use of unreliable science in court argue that Daubert has had beneficial effects in civil litigation, but fails to address the underlying pathologies of the forensic science system that leads to dubious verdicts <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R
