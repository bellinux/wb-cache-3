40|$|IN 1888 Winkler {{published}} his well-known method for {{the determination of}} oxygen dissolved in water. The principle of the method is as follows. A solution of man-ganous chloride {{is added to the}} water to be analysed, followed by a solution of sodium hydroxide containing potassium iodide. A precipitate of <b>manganous</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is first formed thus: zMnClj + 4 NaOH = 4 NaCl + 2 Mn(OH) j. Part of this <b>manganous</b> <b>hydroxide</b> is then converted into manganic hydroxide by the oxygen dissolved in the water sample: 2 Mn(OH) a + HaO + O = 2 Mn(OH) 3. The solution is then acidified and oxidation of the potassium iodide takes place, iodine being liberated: 2 Mn(0 H) 3 + 2 KI + 6 HC 1 = 2 MnCla + 2 KCI + 6 H 2 O + 12. It is clear from the equations that each atom of oxygen in solution finally liberates one molecule of iodine. The iodine is titrated against sodium thiosulphate solution using starch as indicator; 1 c. c. of normal sodium thiosulphate solution corre-sponds to 8 mg. of oxygen, or 5 - 6 c. c. of oxygen at N. T. P. A number of modifications of the original technique of Winkler has been described. The accuracy both of the original method and also of any of its modi-fications is necessarily limited by the accuracy of the sampling technique. This factor is especially important when dealing with water of low oxygen concentration, for in order to obtain accurate analyses it is necessary to keep the water sample out of contact with the air. Krogh (1935) described a syringe pipette which could be used in the estimation of the oxygen content of water; by the use of such a pipette contamination of the water sample with atmospheric air was completely avoided. Van Dam (1933, 1935) modified Krogh's syringe pipette, {{and in the course of}} our studies of the respiration of aquatic animals we have further modified the syringe pipette of van Dam by replacing the metal collar with two locknuts. By our method...|$|E
40|$|THE method usually {{employed}} for {{the determination of}} oxygen in natural waters is that described in Standard Methods of Water Analysis (1925). The basis of this method is the Winkler chemical method for the estimation of dissolved oxygen. A sample of the water to be examined is collected in a bottle of about 250 c. c. capacity. The usual Winkler reagents are added and the iodine liberated is titrated against a standard sodium thiosulphate solution. The amount of oxygen originally present in the sample can then be deduced. 1 The disadvantages of this method for the determination of oxygen in the field come mainly under two categories: inaccuracy, and the bulkiness of the apparatus that {{must be taken into}} the field. The inaccuracies arise chiefly from the contami-nation of the water sample with atmospheric air during the taking of the sample and during the addition of the reagents. The error is often quite large when dealing with very low oxygen concentrations. There is also difficulty in ensuring complete absorption of the oxygen by the <b>manganous</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> unless plenty of time is allowed for the absorption. Consequently, in practice, a single determination take...|$|E
