25|$|The issuing authority, {{usually a}} branch of the country's foreign {{ministry}} or department (e.g. U.S. State Department), and typically consular affairs officers, may request appropriate documentation from the applicant. This may include proof that the applicant is able to support himself in the host country (lodging, food), proof that the person hosting the applicant in his or her home really exists and has sufficient room for hosting the applicant, proof that the applicant has obtained health and evacuation insurance, etc. Some countries ask for proof of health status, especially for long-term visas; some countries deny such visas to persons with certain illnesses, such as AIDS. The exact conditions depend on the country and category of visa. Notable examples of countries requiring HIV tests of long-term residents are Russia and Uzbekistan. However, in Uzbekistan, the HIV test requirement is sometimes not strictly enforced. Other countries require a medical test that includes an HIV test, even for a short-term tourism visa. For example, Cuban citizens and international exchange students require such a test approved by a <b>medical</b> <b>authority</b> to enter Chilean territory.|$|E
500|$|As [...] "one of {{the reasons}} for the lamentable record in malaria control in 1942 and early 1943 was the absence of <b>medical</b> <b>authority</b> at the level of the theatre commander's headquarters", Fairley {{suggested}} that there be a body responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the South West Pacific Area. General Blamey took the matter up with the General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander. MacArthur, who had himself suffered an attack of malaria back in 1904 (and a serious relapse the next year), created the Combined Advisory Committee on Tropical Medicine, Hygiene and Sanitation with Colonel Fairley as its chairman in March 1943. After its first meeting, Fairley met with MacArthur, who emphasised that he did not wish the committee to concern itself with matters of academic interest but to make concrete recommendations on essential medical matters. The committee proceeded to make a series of recommendations regarding training, discipline, equipment, procedures and priorities, which then went out as GHQ orders to all commands.|$|E

500|$|The average anatomist had {{difficulty}} challenging Galen's or Vesalius's research; Galen {{was the most}} famous physician of the Greek era and his works were considered the standard of medical understanding up to and throughout the Renaissance (i.e. for almost two thousand years), and various terms being {{used to describe the}} clitoris seemed to have further confused the issue of its structure. In addition to Avicenna's naming it the albaratha or virga ("rod") and Colombo's calling it sweetness of Venus, Hippocrates used the term columella ("little pillar'"), and Albucasis, an Arabic <b>medical</b> <b>authority,</b> named it tentigo ("tension"). The names indicated that each description of the structures was about the body and glans of the clitoris, but usually the glans. It was additionally known to the Romans, who named it (vulgar slang) landica. However, Albertus Magnus, one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages, felt {{that it was important to}} highlight [...] "homologies between male and female structures and function" [...] by adding [...] "a psychology of sexual arousal" [...] that Aristotle had not used to detail the clitoris. While in Constantine's treatise Liber de coitu, the clitoris is referred to a few times, Magnus gave an equal amount of attention to male and female organs.|$|E

2500|$|In today's society, {{abortion}} {{has become}} a common practice, defended by deceptive arguments. Latter-day prophets have denounced abortion, referring to the Lord's declaration, [...] "Thou shalt not ... kill, nor do anything like unto it" [...] (Doctrine & Covenants Section 59, Verse 6). Their counsel on the matter is clear: Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints must not submit to, perform, encourage, pay for, or arrange for an abortion. Church members who encourage an abortion in any way {{may be subject to}} Church discipline .... Church leaders have said that some exceptional circumstances may justify an abortion, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, when the life or health of the mother is judged by competent <b>medical</b> <b>authority</b> to be in serious jeopardy, or when the fetus is known by competent <b>medical</b> <b>authority</b> to have severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth. But even these circumstances do not automatically justify an abortion. Those who face such circumstances should consider abortion only after consulting with their local Church leaders and receiving a confirmation through earnest prayer." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, an invited {{group of}} clinicians met in Chicago and {{reviewed}} clinical evidence and protocols, argued that and adopted a new term for intersex conditions: [...] "Disorders of sex development" [...] (DSD). More specifically, these terms refer to [...] "congenital {{conditions in which}} development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical." [...] The term has been controversial and not widely adopted outside clinical settings: the World Health Organization and many medical journals still refer to intersex traits or conditions. Academics like Georgiann Davis and Morgan Holmes, and clinical psychologists like Tiger Devore argue that the term DSD was designed to [...] "reinstitutionalise" [...] <b>medical</b> <b>authority</b> over intersex bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Paramedics {{have a close}} {{relationship}} with the physicians who (in most systems) grant paramedics the legal right to practice their profession with a regulated paramedic service. Some systems in Canada are transitioning to a self regulated organization, where <b>medical</b> <b>authority</b> dervies directly from legislation and self-regulation rather than the approval of a medical doctor. Also, because physician assistants in Canada exist primarily in the Canadian Forces, the role of clinical paramedic practitioners is under serious study.
