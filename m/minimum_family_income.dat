Although Karchick, Star Ikan, and Bugun are considered growing villages, off-farm income generating opportunities are quite limited and agriculture remains the main source of livelihood. Production risks thus bear great weight in farmers’ decision making. A closer look at farmers’ agricultural practices, primarily crop choices and irrigation methods in the three villages, indicated that farmers grow three to five main types of crops that are carefully selected to (i) generate a certain minimum yield under existing biophysical conditions including water scarcity, land size and quality, (ii) generate a certain <b>minimum</b> <b>family</b> <b>income,</b> (iii) minimize dependence on local market for own consumption, and (iv) meet household food needs.|$|E
40|$|Keywords: farm diagnosis, farming systems, soil degradation, intercropping, maize, roselle, legumes, {{nutrient}} management, vermicompost, crop residues, decomposition, explorations.   In the Costa Chica, {{a region}} of Southwest Mexico, farming systems are organized in smallholder units. The dominant cropping systems are based on maize (Zea mays L.), either as monocrop or intercropped with roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.). Continuous cropping, and unbalanced fertilizer management systems with an inadequate replenishment of organic matter stocks have caused depletion of soil fertility and low crop yields. This thesis aimed to evaluate alternative cropping systems {{in terms of their}} contribution to on-farm productivity and to regeneration of the soil resource base. A set of approaches including farm surveys, on-farm experiments and model-based calculations was applied to characterize farming systems, identify main livelihood constraints and evaluate alternative cropping and farming systems. Main constraints identified were low yields of the major crops maize and roselle, low levels of nitrogen, potassium and soil organic matter, low resource use efficiencies, high production costs, limited marketing opportunities and low prices of products. To address prevailing production constraints, farmer-managed experiments were established in two communities within the region. In on-farm experiments the legumes Canavalia (Canavalia brasiliensis Mart. Ex Benth) and Mucuna (Mucuna pruriens L. var. utilis (Wall ex Wight) Burk) were intercropped in (added to) maize monocrops and maize-roselle mixtures. Intercropping did not decrease maize and roselle yields, and resulted in major reductions of the weed biomass, as well as an increased N uptake by both the food crops and the cropping system as a whole. In nutrient management trials different sources of macro-nutrients were evaluated in maize monocrops and maize-roselle intercrops. The results showed that improvements at field scale are feasible in the short term. Partial replacement of mineral NPK by organic NPK in the form of vermicompost, leading to 10 - 20 % lower total N and K inputs, did not result in lower maize yields or a reduced uptake of N and K. This suggests that the N and K from the vermicompost were utilized better by the maize crop than from the inorganic fertilizers due to lower leaching losses. An experiment on decomposition of and N release from aboveground biomass residues, crop root residues and vermicompost demonstrated that, although the pattern of decomposition varied {{depending on the type of}} organic material, most of the N was released within the cropping season. Particularly for vermicompost, only one third of its initial dry mass was decomposed, thus leaving significant amounts of residues for soil organic matter build-up. Model-based explorations were developed to assess the consequences of the experimental results at the field level for whole-farm performance. Results for eight case study farms demonstrated that changes in crop nutrition and animal husbandry can increase farm family income and improve organic matter balances. However, strategies to achieve these goals most effectively were distinct. To maximize family income required fertilizer-based cropping strategies, while rebuilding soil organic matter required investment in retaining, obtaining and applying sources of organic matter. Farms responded differently to the explored options, highlighting the need for crop nutrition strategies that are adjusted to the soil fertility status of individual fields to be most efficient. The explorations also showed that for six out of the eight farms the <b>minimum</b> <b>family</b> <b>income</b> standard could not be attained. The results imply that the current emphasis in policies to support smallholders by fertilizer subsidies requires adjustment to include promotion of technology development aimed at regeneration of the degraded resource base and to offer off-farm economic options...|$|E

40|$|In many {{developing}} countries, overnutrition and undernutrition in children are seen alongside {{the rise of}} middle class communities and increased participation {{of women in the}} workforce. As mothers are recognised as the primary caregivers for young children, it is widely assumed that deprivation in maternal care when the mother works is associated with malnutrition in young children. Whilst previous studies have examined the relationship between maternal employment and child malnutrition, few of them have explored that relationship amongst the emerging middle class in developing countries. Indonesia provides an excellent setting for the study because of the emergence of a middle class in urban areas since the 1980 s, an increasing proportion of middle class mothers who work and evidence of the double-burden of child undernutrition and overnutrition. This thesis explores the relationship between maternal employment and child outcomes in terms of nutritional status in an urban area of Indonesia within a middle class community. In an attempt to examine the relationship in a broad socio-economic, demographic and cultural perspective, a mixed method study design was adopted and the study was divided into two parts. Middle class families were defined as having a <b>minimum</b> <b>family</b> <b>income</b> of 2. 5 million Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) per month. The inclusion criteria for children participating in this study were those aged 12. 0 - 36. 0 months, had no congenital abnormalities, severe allergies or chronic illnesses, had normal birth weight (at least 2. 5 kg) and were born full-term (gestational age of at least 37 weeks). The study was conducted in Depok city, a growing urban area on the southern side of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. The first phase of the study was a qualitative multiple case study involving 26 middle class families in 13 residential housing estates in Depok city. The expected outcome of this qualitative study was a rich description of the domestic environment and child caring experience which related to maternal employment and child nutritional status. Child nutritional status was determined from weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ). Families were chosen in order to provide a mix of those with working mothers and non-working mothers, children cared for by family caregivers or Domestic-Paid Caregivers (DPC) and children that were underweight, normal weight and overweight. The primary data collection method was semi-structured in-depth interviews with the mothers and the children’s caregivers as the study participants. The children’s weight was measured prior to the in-depth interviews to determine the WAZ of the children. Children’s food intake was assessed by a repeated 24 -hour recall amongst the mothers and primary caregivers on two non-consecutive days; a week day and a week-end day, to obtain the children’s dietary diversity data. The qualitative research provided a description of child care arrangements that existed in urban middle class families and found that both working and non-working mothers experienced problems of child rearing. Five themes emerged from this study in regard to socio-economic and demographic environments of the families. The themes were mothers’ reasons for working/not working, support for mother and caregiver, decision-maker on child’s food and food preparation, maternal self-confidence, and access to resources. The non-working mothers of underweight and overweight children perceived their role of homemaker as an obligation which occurred due to limitations in child care arrangements available to them. Non-working mothers of normal weight children described feelings of “mother is the best caregiver for a child”. The availability of acceptable and trusted alternative caregivers and the need to provide additional income for the family were the reasons described by working mothers regarding whether to seek employment or return to employment after having a child. Several non-working mothers and caregivers appeared to experience a lack of support in performing child care and domestic tasks which may have compromised their children’s nutritional status. Working mothers tended to allow family caregivers and long standing DPCs to decide and prepare the child’s meals. Working mothers with new DPCs chose and prepared the children’s meals or supervised the DPC to prepare the meals, whilst non-working mothers tended {{to be involved in the}} decision-making process and preparation of their children’s meals. Several working mothers who had family caregivers expressed feelings of low confidence in child care matters especially in regard to food preparation. Several non-working mothers had limited access to big traditional markets or supermarkets and purchased raw foods only at mobile street vendors. The qualitative study also provided descriptions of child feeding practices from which five themes emerged. These were breastfeeding and formula milk; child’s appetite; meal time; snacking; and mother’s involvement in child feeding, mother’s trust in caregiver and child’s dietary diversity. Twenty-three out of 26 children were breastfed but 11 of these children were also receiving infant formula milk from birth. Only 5 children were exclusively breastfed for the optimum duration of 6 months. Working was not the main reason for mothers supplementing breastmilk with formula milk. Mother’s familiarity with many brands of formula milk was reported in this study and the aggressive marketing of formula milk companies was mentioned. Several mothers, both working and non-working, described challenges in encouraging a child to eat. The underweight children in this study were described by their mothers and caregivers as having poor appetite, “difficult” to feed and having poorly regulated meal times because they frequently refused to eat. Overweight children were also described as having poorly regulated meal times due to long afternoon naps and a plentiful consumption of formula milk and snacks. Snacking was related to child’s appetite (underweight children with poor appetite were offered snacks to increase their food intake) and related to poorly regulated meal times (overweight children were given snacks every time they asked for them). Working mothers with trustworthy caregivers (family and long standing DPCs) appeared to have a reduced involvement in child feeding practices while their children were found to have lower dietary diversity on weekends compared to that of weekdays due to conflicts of shared responsibility during the weekends between mothers and caregivers. The second phase of the study was a case-control study, with underweight children as cases and normal weight children as controls. The overall aim of the case-control study was to quantify the associations between maternal employment and child nutritional status, considering the socio-economic and demographic characteristics and other factors identified in the qualitative study as well as those identified from the literature review. The case-control study involved 288 children, comprising 109 cases and 179 controls. Child underweight was chosen over child overweight as the case to study because the prevalence of underweight is still higher than overweight amongst children under 5 years in Indonesia and there were constraints in time and available funding to include overweight children as another case group. Cases were defined as children who met the general inclusion criteria and were mild to moderately underweight (WAZ ranging from - 1. 00 to - 3. 00 SD). Control children were those who met the general inclusion criteria and were defined as normal weight children with a WAZ of at least - 1. 00 SD to a maximum + 2. 00 SD. Cases and controls were residents of Beji district and were drawn from the Posyandus (Pos Pelayanan Terpadu, the community-run health centres responsible for monitoring the growth of children under 5 years) registries in Beji district. Random sampling of controls was drawn from this population. The data collection methods consisted of structured interviews, 24 -hour food recalls to measure the children’s food intake, Infant and Child Feeding Index (IFCI) to measure the children’s feeding practices and HOME (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment) questionnaires to measure the psychosocial care received by the children. The structured interviews consisted of questions pertaining to socio-demographic characteristics of the families, maternal employment characteristics (working hours, regularity of income) and availability of caregivers, feeding practices, child illnesses in the preceding 2 weeks and support for mothers and caregivers. The case-control study presented factors associated with child underweight amongst Indonesian urban middle class families. The univariate logistic regression showed that children whose mothers did not have income earning activities was 1. 63 (CI = 1. 00 – 2. 66, p = 0. 049) times as likely to be underweight compared to children of working mothers, suggesting that maternal employment was beneficial for children’s weight-for-age in this study. Mothers working outside the home for less than 20 hours per week was associated with 6. 04 higher odds (CI = 1. 20 – 30. 57, p = 0. 030) of their children being underweight, compared to mothers working outside the home for more than 40 hours per week, after adjusting for children’s characteristics, socio-economic and demographic characteristics, support for mother, child care arrangements, children’s food intake and children’s health status. Mothers working outside the home for 20 – 40 hours per week and mothers not working outside the home were associated with higher odds of their children being underweight, but the association was not significant. When feeding practices and psychosocial care were included in the model, mothers working outside the home for less than 20 hours per week was associated with 8. 53 higher odds (CI = 1. 29 – 56. 18, p = 0. 026) of a child being underweight compared to a child whose mother worked for more than 40 hours per week. The main caregiver of the children whose mothers worked outside the home for less than 20 working hours per week and those not working outside the home were the mothers themselves, whereas the majority of child’s caregivers in the group of mothers working 20 – 40 hours and more than 40 hours were family members. A child having a non-mother caregiver, whether it was a family (OR = 1. 59, CI = 0. 37 – 6. 82, p = 0. 531) or a non-family caregiver (OR = 3. 10, CI = 0. 77 – 12. 43, p = 0. 111), was associated with higher odds of being underweight in the multivariate model, but the associations were not significant. When feeding practices and psychosocial care were included in the model, the association of having a non-family member as the child’s main caregiver and child underweight was significant (OR = 4. 89, CI = 1. 00 – 23. 93, p = 0. 050), the association of having a family member as the main caregiver and child underweight was not significant. The socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the families and support for mothers for performing child care and domestic tasks were not associated with child underweight.

40|$|This author {{accepted}} manuscript (post print) is {{made available}} {{in accordance with}} publisher copyright policy'In the quarter century since 1982 male earnings inequality increased substantially in most industrialized countries, as did women’s participation in paid work. Both trends impacted on <b>family</b> <b>income</b> inequality. However, our analysis of Australian data shows the impact of changes in women’s earnings on <b>family</b> <b>income</b> inequality changed over the study period. Between 1982 and 1995 - 96 the growth in women’s earnings was concentrated in households with high male earnings, pushing <b>family</b> <b>income</b> inequality higher. However, after 1995 - 96 the growth in women’s earnings had a moderating influence on <b>family</b> <b>income</b> inequality as it was concentrated in households with lower male earnings. These findings contribute new evidence {{on the importance of}} trends in family formation and the correlation of husbands’ and wives’ earnings to the evolution of <b>family</b> <b>income</b> inequality. They also are suggestive of a dynamic relationship between rising <b>family</b> <b>income</b> inequality and women’s participation in paid work...|$|R
