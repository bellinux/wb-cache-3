25|$|Eagleton died on March 4, 2007, “relieving <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need {{to conceal}} his identity,” Novak wrote. Some of Eagleton’s former aides were {{reportedly}} angry that Eagleton’s name was attached to a quote that made him appear duplicitous. Asked about the story, Novak acknowledged that disclosing Eagleton’s identity was “a judgment on my part.” If there is any disagreement, Eagleton could settle it with him in heaven “or wherever we end up,” Novak added.|$|E
25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E

500|$|I {{wanted the}} words to reflect the {{architecture}} of the building. Its copper dome reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> furnaces from Wales's industrial heritage and also Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his inspiration ('awen'). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It was important to me that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by the art of music. —Gwyneth Lewis ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myoepitheliomas (MEs) {{are rare}} tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parotid gland. Only a few case reports {{describing}} CT imaging features <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> have been published. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was}} to describe and characterize <b>the</b> CT findings <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parotid gland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed CT images <b>of</b> <b>ME</b> with pathologic correlation in 10 cases (4 men and 6 women; age range, 30 – 70 years) collected between August 2003 and October 2007 from our pathologic database. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CT images were retrospectively evaluated with respect to the location, size, marginal morphology, enhancement, and enhancement pattern by 2 experienced radiologists. RESULTS: Nine tumors were located in <b>the</b> superficial lobe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parotid gland, and 1 was located in <b>the</b> tail <b>of</b> parotid gland. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumors abut on <b>the</b> capsule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gland. Nine tumors had well-defined margins with lobulations in 5 patients. Two cases showed homogenous enhancement. In the other 8 cases, the enhancement was inhomogeneous because of enhancing nodules and nonen-hancing areas of linear bands, slitlike-shaped or of cystic configuration. CONCLUSION: CT imaging findings <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> were well circumscribed, enhancing the mass lesion with smooth or lobulated margins, located chiefly in the superficial lobe and abutted on <b>the</b> capsule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gland. They may contain enhancing nodules and nonenhancing areas of linear bands, slitlike-shaped or of cystic configuration. Although MEs are a rarity, they should be suspected when a tumor shows all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characteristics noted here. Myoepithelioma (ME) is a benign salivary gland tumorcomposed almost exclusively of sheets, islands, or cords of cells with myoepitheliomal differentiation. 1 MEs account for 1. 5 % <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumors in the major and minor salivary glands, 2 and 40 % arise in the parotid glands. 2 <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> CT for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> parotid tumors is well established. Al-though much has been written on <b>the</b> CT appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin tumors, 3 - 9 the detailed imaging features <b>of</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parotid gland have not been described previously in the English language literature.

500|$|Flaming Pie is {{the tenth}} solo studio album by Paul McCartney {{under his own}} name, first {{released}} in 1997. His first studio album in over four years, it was mostly recorded following McCartney's involvement in the highly successful Beatles Anthology project. The album was recorded in several locations over two years, 1995 and 1997, featuring two songs dating from 1992. The album featured several of McCartney's family members and friends, most notably McCartney's son, James McCartney. In Flaming Pies liner notes, McCartney said: [...] " [...] reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Beatles' standards and the standards that we reached with the songs. So {{in a way it}} was a refresher course that set the framework for this album." ...|$|E

LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about.

500|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel {{called the}} LP [...] "probably the most {{valuable}} contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver", praising it for being completely dissimilar from anything the Beatles had done. The magazine Cheetah gave the album a rave review, observing that [...] "the mood is rather childlike (not childish)—the kind of innocence that shows on the album cover, with its Rousseau-like animals and forest, and {{the smoke from the}} cabin chimney spelling out the title.... The expression that emerges from this music is very strange: it's a very personal mood." [...] Journalist Richard Goldstein remembers his review for The New York Times: [...] "I was struck by its fragile melodies and their relationship to sacred music; those familiar ride-the-curl voices, now 'hushed with wonder,' reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fauré Requiem, but they were utterly American." ...|$|E

I just remember someone telling <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supposed fact that in the Hebrew language, especially in the Bible, you can find lots of references to man in the 5th and Satan in the 6th and God in the 7th. [...] I didn't go to the library and figure it out". The song's numerology is alluded to on the single's cover, which features figures of five, six and seven, and also a monkey with a halo.|$|E

Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene lauded Räikkönen's drive as [...] "absolutely spectacular", adding: [...] "If you look at the overtake around the outside of [...] Ricciardo, he reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driver from the old times. It was very, very good for me." [...] Lewis Hamilton rued his second unfortunate start incident in a row, which he described as [...] "perhaps [...] more painful" [...] than the incident at the previous race.

500|$|While the {{hurricane}} was passing nearby, Grand Turk reported winds of 120mph (193km/h). According to a ship {{report in the}} region, [...] "The force of the wind... could only {{be judged by the}} noise made by the storm, which reminded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York subway going full speed passing switches." [...] Winds approached 120mph (193km/h) at Nassau before the anemometer failed. In addition to the winds, the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region, totaling 9in (228mm) in Nassau. As in Puerto Rico, authorities in the Bahamas had ample warning of {{the hurricane}}'s approach, and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands. Two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in Grand Turk, although the crews were saved. A sloop traversing from Ambergris Caye to Grand Turk was lost, killing all 18people on board. The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Bahamas, mostly to property and crops.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the realist}} {{nature of the}} bronze statues in the design, {{commentators}} have often also noted the dehumanising aspects of the memorial. Its sheer size and {{the bulk of the}} howitzer serve to distance the observer, dehumanising the soldiers in a similar way to the Cubist war paintings of Wyndham Lewis and Richard Nevinson. Even the carved stone reliefs have an aggressive, hostile quality to them, a consequence of their focus on surface detail {{at the expense of the}} humans in the design. When questioned about his lifelike depictions, Jagger remarked to The Daily Express newspaper that the [...] "experience in the trenches persuaded <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessity for frankness and truth". Using what historian John Glaves-Smith describes as themes of [...] "endurance and sacrifice, not dynamism and conflict", the memorial can be felt to speak to its audience about the experience of war in a way that the Cenotaph, for example, does not.|$|E

Stölzl's reworked storyboard featured Manson as an android clone who kills her human counterpart, a concept the band also liked. He provided a special-effects company with sketches of the android, and a replica was constructed with aircraft and missile parts, tubing, metal and plastic. The android was combined with Manson in post-production to show its mechanical interior. [...] "It reminds <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Man Who Knew Too Much. Some of the shots look like Stanley Kubrick", recalled Vig. [...] "For us it was just important that the music video was also a Garbage video." [...] " [...] like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a kamikaze warrior. That's as close as we'll ever get ," [...] Manson later said.|$|E
