However, {{it was soon}} realised that a twin-engine design was needed and it was re-designed in 1969 with two Allison 250-C14 turboshaft engines. A projected military version (the A109B) was considered early on but Agusta initially chose not to pursue immediate development, instead concentrating on the eight-seat A109C version. The first of three prototypes made its maiden flight on 4 August 1971.

40|$|With systems {{operating}} at higher frequencies, parasitic effects are taking larger {{shares of the}} voltage and timing budget of a circuit. Also smaller devices have shrunken landscape for components, increasing coupling between critical physical features. These undesired loading on otherwise uniform transmission lines introduce impedance discontinuities which degrades signal quality and strains the performance metrics. This paper introduces a concept of compensating coupling effects by <b>modifying</b> <b>transmission</b> line physical characteristics. The modification in the line dimensions is calibrated to compensate the lumped equivalent of the coupling effect.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} effects of short range surface plasmon polariton excitation on sub-wavelength bridges in metal gratings. We show that localized resonances in thin metal bridges placed within the slit of a free-standing silver grating dramatically <b>modify</b> <b>transmission</b> spectra and boost absorption regardless of the periodicity of the grating. Additionally, the interference of multiple localized resonances makes it possible to tailor the absorption properties of ultrathin gratings, regardless of the apertures' geometrical size. This tunable, narrow-band, enhanced-absorption mechanism triggered by resonant, short range surface plasmon polaritons may also enhance nonlinear optical processes like harmonic generation, in view of the large third-order susceptibility of metals...|$|R

50|$|The cross-layer design {{deviates}} {{from the}} traditional network design approach in which each layer of the stack would be made to operate independently. The <b>modified</b> <b>transmission</b> power will help that node to dynamically vary its propagation range at the physical layer. This is because the propagation distance is always directly proportional to transmission power. This information is passed from the physical layer to the network layer {{so that it can}} take optimal decisions in routing protocols. A major advantage of this protocol is that it allows access of information between physical layer and top layers (MAC and network layer).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{detection}} performance of distributed detection system under noisy fading channel, two analog transmission schemes, i. e. an analog <b>transmission</b> and a <b>modified</b> analog <b>transmission,</b> were proposed. Simulations show that, when the channel SNR is high, such as larger than 20 dB, the system with the proposed analog transmission scheme can approach that with ideal transmission condition in detection performance. For low channel SNR, such as less than 10 dB, the <b>modified</b> analog <b>transmission</b> scheme results in better detection performance than the binary transmission scheme proposed in literature. Therefore, according to the channel state information at the sensor, the sensor can select appropriate transmission scheme to improve the system’s detection performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} <b>modify</b> {{synaptic}} <b>transmission</b> between neurons {{is a fundamental}} process {{of the nervous system}} that is involved in development, learning, and disease. Thus, synaptic plasticity is the ability to bidirectionally <b>modify</b> <b>transmission,</b> where long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTD) represent the best characterized forms of plasticity. In the hippocampus, two main forms of LTD coexist that are mediated by activation of either N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Compared with NMDAR-LTD, mGluR-LTD is less well understood, but recent advances have started to delineate the underlying mechanisms. mGluR-LTD at CA 3 :CA 1 synapses in the hippocampus can be induced either by synaptic stimulation or by bath application of the group I selective agonist (R,S) - 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenylglycine. Multiple signaling mechanisms have been implicated in mGluR-LTD, illustrating the complexity of this form of plasticity. This review provides an overview of recent studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying hippocampal mGluR-LTD. It highlights the role of key molecular components and signaling pathways that are involved in the induction and expression of mGluR-LTD and considers how the different signaling pathways may work together to elicit a persistent reduction in synaptic transmission...|$|R

On the other hand, transmission power management may result in disconnected networks and increased level of collisions. In this paper, we introduce a transmission power control based on stochastic learning automata (SLA) to <b>modify</b> the <b>transmission</b> power. Based on the level of successful transmissions and the level of packet retransmissions, the SLA will <b>modify</b> the <b>transmission</b> power level either by increasing it or decreasing it. The probabilistic nature of SLA makes it a useful choice for ad-hoc networks. Using the network simulator NS, we show that using SLA for transmission power will result in an increased system bandwidth and a decrease in the collision levels...|$|R

By inserting TED packets into packet flows at the ingress router periodically, the BSS schedulers of the intermediate nodes can dynamically allocate the necessary bandwidth to each flow to enforce the end-to-end delay, according to the information in TED packets. The introduction of TED packets incurs a lower overhead than the per-packet marking approaches. Three flow bandwidth estimation methods are presented and their performance properties are analyzed. BSS also provides a dropping policy to discard late packets and a feedback mechanism to discover and resolve the bottlenecks. The simulation results show that BSS performs efficiently as expected.
