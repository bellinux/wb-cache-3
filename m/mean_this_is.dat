2500|$|The {{mean and}} the {{standard}} deviation {{of a set of}} data are descriptive statistics usually reported together. In a certain sense, the standard deviation is a [...] "natural" [...] measure of statistical dispersion if the center of the data is measured about the <b>mean.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the following: suppose x1, ..., x'n are real numbers and define the function: ...|$|E

2500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{felt the}} mixed {{influences}} didn’t work in Swift’s favor: “A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here {{as an object}} of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to ‘driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,’ like Swift is about to brawl with Rick Ross.” [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly, joked, saying: [...] "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I’m being serious — I kept waiting for some other hue to pop up, and it never did.(... And then, said: [...] "Lyrically, (...) [...] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a bad song, just maybe an underwhelming one." ...|$|E

60|$|Darmstadt is one {{of those}} towns which are laid out on so large a scale as to appear <b>mean.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a common fault, both in Germany and America; for the effect of {{throwing}} open wide avenues, that one can walk through in five minutes, is to bring the intention into ludicrous contrast with the result.

6000|$|You {{will say}} nevertheless, {{that even the}} wicked will be raised [...] incorruptible to inherit incorruption, because being once raised, [...] their bodies will no more change or be dissolved, but must {{continue}} [...] entire, for ever united with their sad and miserable souls. Well, and [...] would you call this corruption or incorruptibility? Certainly this is [...] not {{the sense of the}} Apostle, when he formally assures us, yea, even [...] threatens us, that corruption cannot inherit incorruption. 'Neither [...] doth corruption inherit incorruption'. What then may this singular [...] expression <b>mean?</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> what it manifestly means;--that no person, [...] whoever he may be, without any exception, who possesseth a corrupt [...] heart and corrupt actions, and therein persevereth unto death, shall [...] have reason to expect in the resurrection a pure, subtile, active and [...] impassible body.|$|E
60|$|If, {{like the}} robber in the Arabian Nights, {{we make a}} mark with chalk on a house to enable us to know it again, the mark has a purpose, {{but it has not}} {{properly}} any meaning. The chalk does not declare any thing about the house; it does not <b>mean,</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> such a person’s house, or This is a house which contains booty. The object of making the mark is merely distinction. I say to myself, All these houses are so nearly alike that if I lose sight of them I shall not again be able to distinguish that which I am now looking at, from any of the others; I must therefore contrive to make the appearance of this one house unlike that of the others, that I may hereafter know when I see the mark—not indeed any attribute of the house—but simply that it is the same house which I am now looking at. Morgiana chalked all the other houses in a similar manner, and defeated the scheme: how? simply by obliterating the difference of appearance between that house and the others. The chalk was still there, but it no longer served the purpose of a distinctive mark.|$|E
