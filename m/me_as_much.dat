She told the interviewer that Barack Obama's mixed-race heritage did not worry her; [...] "'That didn't concern <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as had he been completely white." ...|$|E

He painted {{directly on}} the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I {{was struck by the}} keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm...|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{also cited}} H. Rider Haggard's novel She in a {{telephone}} interview: [...] "I suppose as a boy She interested <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as anything—like the Greek shard of Amyntas , which {{was the kind of}} machine by which everything got moving." [...] A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Jackson told Rabbi Shmuley: Shields was [...] "one of the loves of my life. I just {{wished she}} loved <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as I loved her", and, they [...] "dated a lot." [...] Before meeting her, {{he said that}} he had {{pictures}} of her all over his room. He recalled his happiness when they first met in 1981. He was at the 53rd Academy Awards with Diana Ross, and Shields walked up and introduced herself; then at the after-party she asked him to dance with her. They exchanged numbers, and he [...] "was up all night, singing, spinning around my room, just so happy." [...] He also said, “We had one encounter when she got real intimate and I chickened out. And I shouldn’t have.” ...|$|E
500|$|Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times, though mildly {{critical}} {{of a few}} of the show's elements still was impressed with Fun Home, saying [...] "There have been plenty of new American musicals better put together than Fun Home, but I can't think of one in recent years that has touched <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> with its tender, ironic and courageous vulnerability." [...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E

Likewise, Give Me My Remote contributor Marisa Rothman ranked [...] "The Day We Died" [...] one of the best episodes of the year, explaining [...] "Between Walter's eventual reunion with his loved ones and Olivia's tragic demise, few episodes were as heartbreaking as 'The Day We Died'...not to mention, no episode shocked <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> with a plot twist. (I literally bolted up in my seat when Peter vanished into thin air after creating a bridge between the universes.)" [...] Entertainment Weekly included the episode's ending in their list of television's best cliffhangers of 2011, and later named it the sixteenth best episode of the series. Time gave [...] "The Day We Died" [...] an honorable mention on their list of the best episodes of the season.|$|E
500|$|Adele {{performed}} [...] "Turning Tables" [...] at Live at Largo in Los Angeles on 9 February 2011. Robie Daw of Idolator {{recognized the}} performance as [...] "intimate" [...] and commented that it featured Adele's soulful vocals simply accompanied by [...] "haunting" [...] piano chords. She performed the single on VH1 Unplugged on 3 March 2011. Adele performed the song at Late Night with David Letterman; the performance was later uploaded to her Vevo account on YouTube. On 4 September 2011, the singer performed [...] "Turning Tables" [...] at {{the premiere of}} The Jonathan Ross Show and was also interviewed. [...] "Turning Tables" [...] {{was part of the}} set list on Adele's second concert tour entitled Adele Live (2011). On 22 November 2011, Adele unveiled a video of her performance of the song from the concert held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The performance was later included in her first video album Live at the Royal Albert Hall which was released on 25 November 2011. Adele described the concert as the most special show that she would ever play. Adele performed the song on 27 January 2012 at Live from the Artists Den. During the performance the singer stated: [...] "Nothing in life moves <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as being on stage does. I love the closeness of playing in small rooms, and this room was lovely and simple, just beautiful." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the {{captaincy}} announcement, the Harvey-led Victorians met Craig's New South Welshmen at the SCG in the last match of the Shield season. Harvey admitted to being irked by the board's snub and {{felt that it was}} because of his blunt nature. The men were cordial at the toss and Craig sent the Victorians in to bat. At the same time, Victorian batsman Colin McDonald hit a ball into his face and broke his nose while practising, as Harvey and Craig went out to toss. Harvey asked for a gentleman's agreement to allow a substitute for McDonald. Craig refused, citing the importance of the match. This evoked a rare angry response from Harvey, according to Benaud. Playing with ten men, Benaud said that Harvey [...] "proceeded, {{with a certain amount of}} anger, to play one of the best innings I have seen in Sheffield Shield". He made 209 and later forced New South Wales to follow-on. In the end the match was drawn and Harvey was unable to deny New South Wales the title. Harvey said that his first double century for Victoria [...] "gave <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> pleasure as any innings I had ever played". He finished his only season as Victorian captain by leading the Shield averages with 836 runs at 104.50.|$|E

I’ve done it in sparring with some hard kickers to let them know not to kick me anymore. Their legs didn’t break, but they would either take a minute to walk it off or they wouldn’t be kicking <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much.</b> It’s something I’ve definitely been working on, thanks to Longo.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to reports, Weise was teased {{by fellow}} {{students}} {{because of his}} physical appearance: he was six feet tall and 250 pounds; he dressed in all-black clothing with a full-length coat. He usually {{did not respond to}} their taunts. Weise said, [...] "Because of my size and appearance people don't give <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> trouble as they would if I looked weak." [...] Several students remember Weise as being non-violent. In addition, a family member said that students were aware of the suicide of Weise's father and his mother's being confined to a nursing home while he attended the high school.|$|E

2500|$|His manager Louis Walsh {{was unaware}} of Gately's {{sexuality}} when he selected him for Boyzone and has said that, had he known, he would have thought twice before picking him, claiming {{less than a year}} before his death that [...] "it wasn't cool then to have a gay guy in a band". Walsh described Gately as his [...] "very, very best friend" [...] after the singer's death, saying: [...] "Of all the people I've worked with I don't think anybody thanked <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as Stephen. He used to always say to me, 'If I wasn't in Boyzone I don't know where I'd be today, thank you'".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{contemporary}} adventure novel, H.

[...] A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.|$|E
2500|$|Philip French of The Guardian {{commented that}} he had [...] "seen nothing in the cinema this past year that {{impressed}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as BBC2's 10-part Band of Brothers, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and Ken Loach's The Navigators on Channel 4", {{and that it was}} [...] "one of the best films ever made about men in war and superior in most ways to Saving Private Ryan." [...] Matt Seaton, also in The Guardian, wrote that the film's production was [...] "on such a scale that in an ad hoc, inadvertent way it gives one a powerful sense of what really was accomplished during the D-Day invasion - the extraordinary logistical effort of moving men and matériel in vast quantities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been a blame fool once {{or twice}} in my time," [...] Stirling admitted. [...] "It's curious that it didn't cost <b>me</b> quite <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> most people expected. Still, what I've given you is {{excellent}} advice." ...|$|R

2500|$|On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur {{appeared}} at the New York screening of Schemel's documentary [...] at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance {{was the first time}} in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it. That's just my thing. There's rumblings; there's always bloody rumblings. But if it's not miserable and it's going forward and I'm happy with it… that's all I have to say about that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999. He spoke to his step-siblings, saying, [...] "All {{the people who are}} hating me right now and are here waiting to see me die, when {{you wake up in the}} morning, you aren't going to feel any different. You are going to hate <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him touch your hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the modern}} style in which {{multiple}} sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and another as color commentator), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956–1987) and Ross Porter (1977–2004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game {{except for the}} 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels. Drysdale died {{in his hotel room}} following a heart attack before a game against the Montreal Expos in 1993, resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made. Scully announced the news of his death by saying, [...] "Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as this one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart." ...|$|E
