40|$|Setting kanban sizes {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{decisions}} that users of kanban system must address, yet researchers have largely assumed kanban sizes to be given. This paper investigates the effect of varying kanban size on the performance of just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing systems. Two types of JIT production systems, the Pull-type and the Hybrid-type are analysed using computer simulation models. The performance measures considered simultaneously are the fill rate, in-process inventory, and manufacturing lead time. Parameters such as demand rate, processing time, and kanban size are taken into consideration, thereby finding the possible solutions of the kanban size that can be employed to achieve the most favourable conditions for production. A favourable condition usually refers to the ability of the system to produce finished goods at a shortest possible lead time, which the customers are always demanding for. Both the single product and <b>multi-products</b> manufacturing environments are investigated. With reference to the analysis, for a single product, as the kanban size increased, the fill rate decreased, whilst with both the in-process inventory and the manufacturing lead time increased. Generally, for <b>multi-products</b> manufacture, it was observed that as the kanban size increased, the fill rate increased with a decrease in the manufacturing lead time. However, for <b>multi-products</b> the interaction between the manufacturing lead time and the fill rate is discussed in depth in this paper. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Although {{the concept}} of <b>multi-products</b> {{biorefinery}} provides an opportunity to meet the future demands for biofuels, biomaterials or chemicals, it is not assured that its implementation would improve the profitability of kraft pulp mills. The attractiveness will depend on several factors such as mill age and location, government incentives, economy of scale, end user requirements, and how much value {{can be added to}} the new products. In addition, the effective integration of alternative technologies is not straightforward and has to be carefully studied. In this work, detailed balances were performed to evaluate possible impacts that lignin removal, hemicelluloses recovery prior to pulping, torrefaction and pyrolysis of wood residues cause on the conventional mill operation. The development of mill balances was based on theoretical fundamentals, practical experience, literature review, personal communication with technology suppliers and analysis of mill process data. Hemicelluloses recovery through pre-hydrolysis of chips leads to impacts in several stages of the kraft process. Effects can be observed on the pulping process, wood consumption, black liquor properties and, inevitably, on the pulp quality. When lignin is removed from black liquor, it will affect mostly the chemical recovery operation and steam generation rate. Since mineral acid is used to precipitate the lignin, impacts on the mill chemical balance are also expected. A great advantage of processing the wood residues for additional income results {{from the fact that the}} pulping process, pulp quality and sales are not harmfully affected. For pulp mills interested in implementing {{the concept of}} <b>multi-products</b> biorefinery, this work has indicated possible impacts to be considered in a technical feasibility study...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{magnitude}} and even the direction of change may differ depending on the demand and supply curves and on {{the magnitude}} of the shifts. For example, in response to CO 2 fertilization, production may decrease in a region if the price effect (movement along the supply curve) exceeds the effect of the supply shift. Also, net trade may increase if the differential in CO 2 fertilization change the comparative advantage of a region relative to the other. Thus, in a multi-region, <b>multi-products</b> situation, the adjustment of the global equilibrium due to CO 2 fertilization is hard to predict from purely theoretical considerations, and requires a more elaborate model of the forest sector.|$|R

Because a single-product firm whose sales are zero is indifferent between exiting and staying, and its cost re-ductions always increase its profits, our results are unique to the multiproduct firm, and they suggest that extending oligopoly studies from a single product to <b>multi-products</b> could be as significant as the extension of calculus from a single variable to multi-variables...|$|R

We assume that product flow runs only in the forward direction, either via in-sequence or bypass movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by solving a typical layout design problem taken from literature, and several randomly generated problems.
