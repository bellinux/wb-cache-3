This was done through two channels: first, an appropriate exchange policy ensured an adequate tradable supply of bonds priced near par (at the expense of premium bonds, which some classes of investors avoid). Second, debt exchanges increased the outstanding amounts of strippable bonds that were critical in supporting bond dealer stripping and reconstitution operations in the new strips market (see Díaz et al. 2006 for details).|$|E

40|$|The {{policy of}} {{liberalization}} {{of the labor}} <b>market</b> <b>undertaken</b> in Peru during the nineties {{does not seem to}} have produced the expected results. Although the varieties and flexibility of labor contracts were increased and the average cost of lying off an employee was reduced, the weight of the formal portion of the labor market did not grow. On the contrary, what has been observed is a persistent increment of informality (employment without contract). In this paper it is maintained that this results from the fact that the liberalization process did not give an impulse to the labor market institutions, as a way to compensate for the asymmetries of the labor market. On the contrary, the existing institutions -unions and labor authority resulted even more weakened. It is now necessary to increase the institutionalization of the labor market and, instead of introducing more legislation, to promote its observance making that legislation simpler. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In 2012, China {{became the}} largest spender in {{international}} tourism, benefiting many destinations worldwide. Even if for Poland {{it is not}} an important source market yet, the Polish authorities have <b>undertaken</b> some <b>marketing</b> activities in China. The main aim of the paper is to explore the profile, motivations, and perceptions of the Chinese tourists visiting Cracow. The secondary aim is to check the effectiveness of the marketing efforts dedicated to the Chinese <b>market</b> <b>undertaken</b> by Poland since 2010. Material and methods. Data for the study (n = 100) were collected using a paper survey in English carried out among mainland Chinese tourists in Cracow in 2015. Results. The Chinese usually visit Poland for the first time, often in transit. They are prompted by the information found online and by word of mouth. Their main reasons to come are tradition, culture, historical sites, landscapes, and low costs. These expectations are well fulfilled, and the tourists’ overall satisfaction is very high. The Chinese find Poland to be different from other Western European countries. For them, Poland is a remarkable, traditional, safe, and developing country. Yet, their knowledge about the destination is limited. The main problem encountered is the language barrier, both online and once on site. The <b>marketing</b> efforts <b>undertaken</b> by Poland in the Chinese market have had weak and ambivalent effects. Conclusion. In order to attract Chinese tourists, {{there is a need to}} intensify expenditure not only on promotion (mainly online) but also on the removal of language-based communication problems. There is also scope for expanding the tourist offer dedicated to Chinese tourists - both in Poland and in cooperation with other Central European countries...|$|R
