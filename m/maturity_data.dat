40|$|The main {{objective}} of this experimental and analytical research project was to develop maturity-based guidelines for early opening-to-traffic of concrete pavements {{in the state of}} Indiana. Currently, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) specifies that pavements can be opened to traffic when the concrete reaches the strength of at least 3. 8 MPa (550 psi). During this study modulus of rupture (MOR) and <b>maturity</b> <b>data</b> were collected and strength gain characteristics were analyzed. Also, fatigue experiments were performed at different stress levels and ages. Based on the experimental results, modulus of rupture of concrete was correlated with corresponding fatigue life for a specific age. The <b>maturity</b> <b>data</b> was then linked with fatigue results through flexural strength correlation. A safe early opening age was determined based on design load used by INDOT and specifications for allowable repetitions. The results of this research should be useful to both INDOT and contractor by allowing for quantification of the impact of early opening on performance of the pavement. In addition, early pavement opening will reduce the cost to the travelling public by reducing construction time and improving safety in the construction zone. ...|$|E

40|$|Big Data {{is defined}} as high volume, high {{velocity}} and high variety information assets, {{a result of the}} explosive growth of data facilitated by the digitization of our society. Data has always had strategic value, but with Big Data and the new data handling solutions even more value creation opportunities have emerged. Studies have shown that adopting Big Data initiatives in organizations enhance data management and analytical capabilities that ultimately improve competitiveness, productivity as well as financial and operational results. There are differences between organizations in terms of Big Data capabilities, performance and to what effect Big Data can be utilized. To create value from Big Data, organizations must first assess their current situation and find solutions to advance to a higher Big Data capability level, also known as Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity.</b> Conceptual artefacts called Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity</b> models have been developed to help in this endeavor. They allow organizations to have their Big Data methods and processes assessed according to best practices. However, it is a tough job for an organization to select the most useful and appropriate model, as there are many available and each one differ in terms of extensiveness, quality, ease of use, and content. The objective of this research was to evaluate and compare available Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity</b> models in terms of good practices of maturity modeling and Big Data value creation, ultimately supporting the organizational maturity assessment process. This was done by conducting a benchmarking study that quantitatively evaluated maturity model attributes against specific evaluation criteria. As a result, eight Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity</b> models were chosen, evaluated and analyzed. The theoretical foundations and concepts of the research were identified through systematical literature reviews. The benchmarking scores suggest that there is great variance between models when examining the good practices of maturity modeling. The degree of addressing Big Data value creation opportunities is more balanced. However, total scores clearly lean towards a specific group of models, identified as top-performers. These top-performers score relatively high in all examined criteria groups and represent currently the most useful Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity</b> models for organizational Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity</b> assessment. They demonstrate high quality of model structure, extensiveness and detail level. Authors of these models use a consistent methodology and good practices for design and development activities, and engage in high quality documentation practices. The Big <b>Data</b> <b>maturity</b> models are easy to use, and provide an intuitive tool for assessment as well as sufficient supporting materials to the end user. Lastly, they address all important Big Data capabilities that contribute to the creation of business value...|$|R

40|$|The {{generalized}} {{linear model}} (GLM) is a class of versatile models suitable for several types of dependent variables. GLMs are commonly used to model <b>maturity</b> <b>data.</b> Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are a useful extension of the GLM {{with the addition of}} random effects. GLMMs have previously been used to improve the estimates of the maturities and provide better predictions of maturities in the near future. Dowden (2007) used GLMMs to model a Atlantic cod <b>maturity</b> <b>data</b> set. His research found that GLMMs improved maturity estimates and forecast accuracy over the GLM commonly used. The results also revealed potential year effects in the cod data. This may be due to actual year effects or some other source such as sampling error. In general it is unknown whether year effects are present in a data set. In this practicum we first provide an overview of Dowden's results. Then we conduct a simulation study to investigate which GL 11 M provides the most accurate estimates of the simulated maturities and parameters under a range of simulation factors including the presence of year effects. The two GLMMs used to model the simulated data are an autoregressive (AR) mixed model and a AR mixed effects model with random year effects (AR YE). In this research we find the AR YE model appears to be more appropriate than the AR model when the presence of year effects are unknown. The AR YE model's estimates are similar or better than the AR model's and it also tends to be either as efficient or more efficient depending on the presence or size of the year effects...|$|E

In contrast, the stationarity of the premium is less supported by the longer <b>maturity</b> <b>data.</b> Furthermore, {{a large portion of the}} premium fluctuation is shown to be due to a common factor, particularly over the short time horizon, which in turn can be explained by economic and financial developments in the US.
