25|$|On {{the basis}} of past and recent field observations, the {{specific}} habitat requirements of Newcomb's snail include fast-flowing perennial streams and associated springs, seeps, and vertical or overhanging waterfalls. Surveys of <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> channels {{of many of the}} perennial streams of Kaua`i indicate Newcomb's snail is only found in areas protected from high scouring flows within <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> channels. The limited occurrence of this snail in <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> channels is likely due to periodic channel scouring by sediment, rocks, and boulders that are moved downstream during high flow runoff events. Consequently, suitable habitat is generally restricted to protected, small, spring-fed tributaries, or to stream segments with overhanging waterfalls that have perennial flows supported by stable groundwater input. The common element among sites harboring snail populations is that the water source appears to be consistent and permanent, even during severe drought.|$|E

25|$|The Ohio River, which streams westward from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, is {{the largest}} tributary, by volume, of the Mississippi River in the United States.

25|$|Wash load {{is carried}} within {{the water column}} {{as part of the}} flow, and {{therefore}} moves with the mean velocity of <b>main</b> <b>stream.</b> Wash load concentrations are approximately uniform in the water column. This is described by the endmember case in which the Rouse number is equal to 0 (i.e. the settling velocity is far less than the turbulent mixing velocity), which leads to a prediction of a perfectly uniform vertical concentration profile of material.|$|E
25|$|Because islands on the Argun, Amur, and Ussuri rivers often {{split the}} rivers into {{multiple}} streams, {{the location of}} the <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> (and thus the border) was often not immediately apparent. Obviously, each country would receive a greater number of islands if the recognized main channel was closer to the opposite bank. Thus, the demarcation work was often controversial and subject to local protests over disputed territories. The demarcation work continued nearly up until its 1997 deadline.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} railway line is {{to consist}} of two sets of tracks, a high-speed line above ground, carried partially on a viaduct across the valley floor, and a TGV line which will run through the park in a tunnel. The lines are to run parallel to each other, 150m apart, for about 500m {{from north to south}} through the central and widest part of the park, neatly bisecting both the valley above the chateau and the <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> running through it which feeds the hydraulic system.|$|E
25|$|The {{upstream}} states, Victoria and New South Wales, favoured the riparian doctrine, {{under which}} landowners {{are free to}} take water from streams flowing through their property.

South Australia relied on provisions of the newly enacted Constitution under which the Commonwealth government had authority over navigation along the Murray River and an implied obligation to preserve flows in the South Australian section of the river.|$|E

25|$|A {{distributary}}, or a distributary channel, is {{a stream}} that branches off and flows {{away from a}} <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> channel. They are a common feature of river deltas. The phenomenon is known as river bifurcation. The opposite of a distributary is a tributary. Distributaries usually occur as a stream nears a lake or an ocean, but they can occur inland as well, such as on alluvial fans or when a tributary stream bifurcates as it nears its confluence with a larger stream. In some cases, a minor distributary can divert so much water from the main channel that it can become the main route.|$|E
25|$|Anglers {{of the era}} who {{ventured into}} the Esopus valley were usually advised by guidebooks and {{magazine}} articles touting the Catskills' trout populations to bypass the <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> {{in favor of the}} tributaries, since the Esopus itself was generally too warm for brook trout, the favored species at that time, and still too polluted by runoff from the tanneries. In the 1880s pioneering fish farmer Seth Green advocated the stocking of rainbow trout in streams where the brook trout population was beginning to thin {{as a result of the}} fishing pressure, as they could handle warmer water better. Other anglers feared that, if introduced, the more aggressive rainbows would displace the native brooks.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{boundaries}} of the fell are Bassenthwaite Lake to the east, Wythop Valley {{to the south and}} west, and the Vale of Embleton to the north. Sale Fell is a satellite of Lord's Seat, the highest of the hills north of Whinlatter. The connecting high ground runs south eastward above the shore of Bassenthwaite before turning inland to the summit of the parent fell. The connection is extremely tenuous, passing along a very narrow strip of land between Wythop Beck and Beck Wythop. These two streams run side by side down the slopes of Lord's Seat before diverging to surround Sale Fell on all sides. Wythop Beck is the <b>main</b> <b>stream</b> of the Wythop Valley, running west around Sale Fell and then out down the narrow wooded defile which stands between it and Ling Fell. Joining the Dubwath Beck it then flows eastward along the Vale of Embleton and into the northern end of Bassenthwaite. Beck Wythop by contrast cuts through the ridge of high ground running alongside Bassenthwaite, and drops directly into the lake.|$|E
40|$|EP 983965 A UPAB: 20000412 NOVELTY - A {{secondary}} gas stream is {{injected into the}} <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> in a mixing chamber at an angle of 10 - 170 deg. to the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream.</b> The flow cross-section of the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> before the injection site of the {{secondary gas}} <b>stream</b> into the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> is reduced {{in such a way}} that the flow speed of the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> is increased. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Production of dinitrogen pentoxide comprises: (a) forming ozone containing a main gas stream; (b) forming nitrogen dioxide containing a secondary gas stream; (c) injecting the secondary gas <b>stream</b> into a <b>main</b> gas stream; (d) feeding the total gas stream formed through a flow reactor in which nitrogen dioxide reacts with the ozone; and (e) removing the dinitrogen pentoxide formed. The secondary gas stream is injected into the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> in a mixing chamber at an angle of 10 - 170 deg. to the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream.</b> The flow cross-section of the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> before the injection site of the secondary gas <b>stream</b> into the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> is reduced {{in such a way that}} the flow speed of the <b>main</b> gas <b>stream</b> is increased.
