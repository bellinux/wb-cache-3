40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical features of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases reported in the United States during 1980 through 1995. METHODS: <b>Respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were reviewed. Cases were defined as physician-diagnosed cases with signs and symptoms compatible with <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> including the presence of a pseudomembrane without other apparent cause. RESULTS: From 1980 through 1994, 41 <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> cases were reported; none were reported in 1995, and no secondary cases were identified. Nine (22 %) case patients were 4 years of age or younger, and 28 (68 %) were 15 years of age or older. None of the case patients were up to date with diphtheria vaccination; 4 unvaccinated children died. Seventeen (43 %) of 40 case patients had positive culture results. CONCLUSIONS: Available surveillance data suggest that <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> has become a rare disease in the United States. However, importation and circulation of toxigenic strains continue to present a threat and require achieving and maintaining high coverage with diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines in both children and adults...|$|R
40|$|Diphtheria is an {{uncommon}} {{disease in the}} United States. It is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of gram-positive Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Important sites of infection are the <b>respiratory</b> mucosa (<b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria)</b> and the skin (cutaneous diphtheria). Rarely, extra-respiratory mucosal sites, e. g., the eye, ear, or genitals, may be affected. Humans are the only known reservoir of C. diphtheriae. The disease is transmitted {{from person to person}} by respiratory droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions, discharges from skin lesions or, rarely, fomites. The onset of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is insidious and begins after an incubation period of 2 – 5 days. Initial symptoms of illness include a sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, malaise, and low-grade fever. The hallmark of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is the presence of an exudate that organizes into a tough, grayish-white pseudomembrane over the tonsils, the pharynx, or larynx. The pseudomembrane is strongly adherent to the underlying tissue, and attempts to dislodge it usually result in bleeding. Accompanying inflammation of the cervical lymph nodes and surrounding soft-tissue swelling of the neck give rise to a “bull-neck ” appearance and are a sign of moderate to severe disease. The membrane may progressively extend into the laryn...|$|R

This Pennsylvania resident had reportedly never been vaccinated against diphtheria. From October 3 - 10, this man and seven other men from New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia had worked in a rural village in Haiti. On return to Pennsylvania, the man was admitted to a hospital because of his severe sore throat and <b>respiratory</b> distress. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> was suspected when, during a tracheostomy procedure, a pseudomembrane was seen throughout his upper airways consistent with <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> Several days later, {{a sample of the}} pseudomembrane was PC R positive for Corynebacterium diphtheriae tox genes. Based on his history of travel to Haiti where diphtheria is endemic, his clinical symptoms, and the positive PC R results, this patient has a confirmed case of <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all persons aged 6 weeks to 6 years of age. The five DTaP doses are administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, at 15 - 18 months and at 4 - 6 years. Adolescents and adults should receive the adult formulation of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) every 10 years. Health care providers should ensure that travelers to all countries with endemic diphtheria are up-to-date with diphtheria and other vaccinations according to the ACIP guidelines.

40|$|Diphtheria {{is caused}} by {{diphtheria}} toxin-producing Corynebacterium species. While classical <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is transmitted by droplets, cutaneous diphtheria often results from minor trauma. This report concerns the first case of sexually transmitted diphtheria in a patient with non-gonococcal urethritis after orogenital contact. Diphtheria and diphtheria-like illness {{is caused by}} Corynebacterium species harbouring the diphtheria toxin-encoding tox gene. Diphtheria is a WHO-notifiable disease and alerts both clinicians and public health authorities. Infections caused by toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae are now extremely rare in industrialised countries and are mostly associated with travel or contact with a person from an endemic area such as India, Indonesia, Brazil or the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. 1 <b>Respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is usually transmitted by droplets, whereas cuta-neous diphtheria often results from minor trauma and frequently shows co-infection with other bacteria such as staphylococci and streptococci.

Among 676 patients hospitalized with <b>respiratory</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> 163 (24 %) were car-riers, 186 (28 %) had tonsillar forms, 78 (12 %) had combined types or delayed diagnosis, and 201 (30 %) had severe forms of diphtheria. The highest age-speci®c incidence rates occurred among persons 15 ± 34 years old, and 70 % of cases were among those> 15 years of age. Myo-carditis occurred among 151 patients (22 %), and 19 patients died (case fatality ratio: 3 %).

40|$|There is a {{need for}} quick, reliable, and noninvasive lung {{function}} tests to assess airway obstruction in preschool children both for pediatric pulmonary care as well as for research purposes. We studied feasibility, reproducibility, and validity of measurements of the respiratory system using the interrupter technique (interrupter resistance [Rint]) and obtained reference values in children from a general population, 2 to 7 yr of age. Accuracy was studied by comparisons of Rint with plethysmographic airway resistance (Raw) in 20 patients (7 to 14 yr) with mild to severe chronic airways obstruction and was satisfactory in patients with FEV(1) > 60 % predicted. The technique proved sensitive enough to detect changes in airway caliber within a small group of 12 children who developed <b>mild</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract infections. Among children from a general population, subgroups with <b>mild</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms or <b>mild</b> <b>respiratory</b> disease had higher mean Rint values. Airway obstruction was better detected using expiratory rather than inspiratory interruptions, both programmed at peak tidal ventilatory flow. Reproducibility within subjects was satisfactory (intraclass correlation 0. 82 and 0. 79). The same applied to interobserver agreement (intraclass correlation 0. 98).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{respiratory}} {{symptoms in}} asthmatic patients {{are likely to}} be caused by bronchoconstriction, this should be confirmed by spirometry. In this study, our aim was to determine the percentage of asthmatic patients who present with <b>mild</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms but fail to show any evidence of bronchoconstriction in spirometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 428 known asthmatic patients (57. 5 % females) participated in the study. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 16 years, known asthmatics for at least 1 year, presenting with <b>mild</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms including cough, wheezes, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Patients presenting with moderate or severe asthma exacerbations were excluded from the study. Spirometry measurements were performed according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society. SPSS was used for data analysis. The percentage of patients who did not show any evidence of airway obstruction was calculated. For spirometry variables, mean and standard deviation were calculated. For the categorical variables, Chi-square test was performed to determine statistical significance at alpha= 0. 05. RESULTS: Typical obstructive pattern was found in 38 (or 9 %) of all participants. Evidence of obstruction within small or middle airways was found in all those who showed an obstructive pattern and more than 90 % of those who showed restrictive or mixed patterns. About 11 % of the participants showed a normal spirometric pattern with no evidence of small airway obstruction. Statistical analysis showed an insignificant relation between patterns of spirometry and gender or body mass index of the participants.
