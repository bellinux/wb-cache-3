5|$|On 24 January 2000, after SMU chaired a {{technical}} workshop to obtain feedback on three alternative proposals, a well-known architect named Tay Kheng Soon {{held a press}} conference at The Substation to unveil his unofficial SMU <b>masterplan.</b> URA was invited to the presentation but did not show up. His proposal entailed re-routing the tunnel to save the National Library building. A week later, Tay wrote to the Prime Minister's Office regarding his proposal which was referred to the MND. Many members of the public wrote in publicly either in support of Tay's plans or argue for heritage conservation in general. A few articles and letters highlighted that the adamant official response to public dissent ran counter to the spirit of the Government's S21 Vision, which expressed a desire to foster civic participation and active citizenry.|$|E

Due to growing health concerns linked to inactive living, a number of new <b>masterplanned</b> communities in South East Queensland are creating supportive environments for physical activities.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 150 years, and {{particularly}} after WWII, comprehensive spatial <b>masterplans,</b> aimed at increasing efficiency, amenity, {{and value of}} degraded urban neighbourhoods, were developed all over the UK. However, contrary to the implicit assumption of their creators that stable long-term outcomes could be planned and achieved, resulting environments often failed to demonstrate the resilience necessary {{to deal with the}} multi-scale changes cities constantly face throughout their existence, often worsening the problems they set out to solve. <b>Masterplans</b> were hence object of strong criticism and only very recently, guided by new place-making principles, they started to be re-evaluated. Yet, are today’s <b>masterplans</b> shaping places any better equipped to respond to the pace of current urban change? How can <b>masterplans</b> help making places better suited to positively respond to changes over time? To answer these questions, we explore the concept of resilience in comparing examples of pre-Industrial, post-WWII and contemporary <b>masterplans.</b> We present a longitudinal study that looks at the Gorbals district of Glasgow over time as it undergoes three emblematic <b>masterplanned</b> redevelopments, and observe them against the five resilience proxies of diversity, redundancy, modularity, connectivity and efficiency. Results suggest that the transition from the 19 th century original development to the post-WWII modernist redevelopment produced a remarkable drop in overall place resilience, only partially recovered by the recent multi-agency mixed-use redevelopment...|$|R
