Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different.

500|$|Akin to the films, the Saw {{video game}} {{has been the}} subject of much controversy, often being {{classified}} as [...] "torture porn" [...] by its critics. Its violence and visual intensity sparked many allegations that the main goal of the game is to mutilate characters simply for the sake of doing so. It was compared to games such as Grand Theft Auto IV, MadWorld, and Manhunt, but contrasted for the claim that the aforementioned games' violence served a somewhat humorous purpose or had some type of moral reprieve. William Usher of Cinema Blend wrote that Saw pushed controversial boundaries and called it a [...] "tutorial for sadists to get pleasure from".

500|$|In {{more recent}} years, AllMusic critic Mark Deming {{noted in his}} review of the album that [...] "no major band had gone so deep into the sound and feeling of classic country (without parody or condescension) as the Byrds did on Sweetheart; {{at a time when}} most rock fans viewed country as a musical [...] "L'il Abner" [...] routine, the Byrds dared to declare that C could be hip, cool, and heartfelt." [...] Alexander Lloyd Linhardt, {{reviewing}} the album for Pitchfork Media, described it as [...] "a blindingly rusty gait through parched weariness and dusted reverie. It's not the natural sound of Death Valley or Utah, but rather, a false portrait by people who wished it was, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more melancholy and charismatic." [...] Journalist Matthew Weiner commented in his review for Stylus that [...] "Thirty-five years after it startled Byrds fans everywhere with its Podunk proclivities, Sweetheart remains a particularly fascinating example of two musical ships passing in the night, documenting both Parsons’ transformation into a visionary country-rock auteur and a pop band’s remarkable sense of artistic risk." ...|$|E

The high-pressure {{match was}} unlocked in the 83rd minute when Luisão jumped higher than Ricardo and {{headed in the}} winning goal. Trapattoni tried to calm excess confidence by saying Benfica still had not won the league title. Two days after the game, in an interview to Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport, Trapattoni announced his intention to leave Benfica {{at the end of}} the season and return to Italy. On 22 May, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bessa to face Boavista, needing just one point to win the title. Benfica scored the opening goal with a penalty from Simão. Boavista equalized minutes later but the score remained drawn, ensuring the title for Benfica, their first in ten years and 31st overall. Trapattoni said, [...] "Winning is always hard. This title was amazing and one of the most important of my career. It was won in a new culture for me and that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> better." [...] In the last game of the season, the 2005 Taça de Portugal Final, Benfica's Simão opened the scoring but allowed Vitória de Setúbal to score twice, losing Benfica their ninth tournament final. The loss also prevented a double for Benfica; it would have been their first since 1987. Two days after the defeat, Trapattoni confirmed he was leaving Benfica for personal reasons, ending his one-year tenure in Portugal.|$|E

2500|$|Ataxic {{cerebral}} palsy is observed in approximately 5-10% {{of all cases}} of {{cerebral palsy}}, making it the least frequent form of cerebral palsy. Ataxic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to cerebellar structures.

Ataxic cerebral palsy is known to decrease muscle tone. [...] The most common manifestation of ataxic cerebral palsy is intention (action) tremor, which is especially apparent when carrying out precise movements, such as tying shoe laces or writing with a pencil.

[...] "That's just what was interesting to me as a postcollegiate bohemian", he later remarked. [...] "We didn't have a manifesto. Nothing was off-limits; it's just that that's what came up most of the time."

2500|$|The {{first account}} to include this detail is the {{so-called}} Vita altera Bonifatii, which was written in Utrecht (the closest Frankish/Christian settlement to Friesland) and which is preserved in a revision ascribed to Utrecht's bishop, Radbod, who held the seat from 900–917. It is repeated in most other vitae that followed, of which Otloh of St. Emmeram's (eleventh century) is the most important. This book, though it is called a [...] "gospel" [...] in the Utrecht and Otloh vitae, is usually identified with the Ragyndrudis Codex. Adding to the Schutzhypothese are five deep cuts which appear to strengthen the theory, but von Padberg argues that the position and character of the cuts do not match the hypothesis; in addition, Boniface was an uncommonly tall man, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more unlikely that such cuts would have been made while he held the Codex over his head. According to von Padberg, the Codices Bonifatiani must have left Utrecht and been in Fulda in 825, or the Utrecht tradition would have more clearly identified them. Images of the saint holding up a book for protection are being produced in Fulda by the year 970, when a series of sacramentaries are illustrated with images of Boniface's work as a missionary and his martyrdom.|$|E
