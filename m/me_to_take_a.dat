25|$|The Desire Line {{ran from}} 1920 to 1948, {{at the height}} of {{streetcar}} use in New Orleans. The route ran down Bourbon, through the Quarter, to Desire Street in the Bywater district, and back up to Canal. Blanche's route in the play—"They told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> streetcar named Desire, transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at—Elysian Fields!"—is allegorical, taking advantage of New Orleans's colorful street names.|$|E

The peculiar features seen on those trips led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> third across {{the region in the}} hope that even more interesting phenomena might be encountered." ...|$|E
500|$|Suffering from {{asthma and}} gout, Disraeli went out {{as little as}} possible, fearing more serious episodes of illness. In March, he fell ill with bronchitis, and emerged from bed only {{for a meeting with}} Salisbury and other Conservative leaders on the 26th. As it became clear that this might be his final sickness, friends and opponents alike came to call. Disraeli {{declined}} a visit from the Queen, saying, [...] "She would only ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> message to Albert." [...] Almost blind, when he received the last letter from Victoria of which he was aware on 5 April, he held it momentarily, then had it read to him by Lord Barrington, a Privy Councillor. One card, signed [...] "A Workman", delighted its recipient, [...] "Don't die yet, we can't do without you." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2013, Gosling {{announced}} that he was taking a break from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing. I think it’s good for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break and reassess why I’m doing it and how I’m doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that.” Gosling's directorial debut Lost River competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as [...] "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself", while Varietys Justin Chang dismissed the [...] "derivative" [...] film as a [...] "train-wreck." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] I like it though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It inspired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E

I am an Englishman and a Liberal; {{and now that}} South Africa has been enslaved and destroyed, there is no country left <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> {{interest}} in but Ireland. Mind: I don't say that an Englishman has not other duties. He {{has a duty to}} Finland and a duty to Macedonia. But what sane man can deny that an Englishman's first duty is his duty to Ireland? Unfortunately, we have politicians here more unscrupulous than Bobrikoff, more bloodthirsty than Abdul the Damned; and it is under their heel that Ireland is now writhing.|$|R

[...] "It {{is not your}} kind, perhaps, but there is room and need for all kinds in this lusty young country of ours. Yes, I am going into the business. In the first place, it has been father's cherished desire ever since I was born, and it would hurt him pretty badly if I backed out now. He wished <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> Arts course because he believed that every man should have as liberal an education as he can afford to get, but now that I have had it he wants me in the firm." ...|$|R

60|$|I greatly {{feared that}} she advised <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> {{imprudent}} step; {{but she was}} my guide, my teacher and friend in the house, and I resolved to do as she wished. There were no lights in the long gallery when we entered it again, only the white moonbeams coming through the tall windows here and there lit up a column {{or a group of}} statues, which threw long, black shadows on floor and Wall, giving the chamber a weird appearance. Once more, when I reached the middle of the room, I paused, for there before me, ever bending forward, sat that wonderful woman of stone, the moonlight streaming full on her pale, wistful face and silvery hair.|$|R

2500|$|Moriarty has {{respect for}} Holmes's intelligence, stating that [...] "It {{has been an}} {{intellectual}} treat for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see {{the manner in which}} you [...] have grappled with this case" [...] and that [...] "it would be <b>a</b> grief for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> extreme measure." [...] Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted and he is placed [...] "in positive danger of losing my liberty" [...] as well as furiously elbowing aside passengers in the train station in his pursuit of the disguised Holmes. Moriarty also shows a fiercely independent streak, pursuing Holmes to Switzerland alone, while by contrast Holmes takes Watson with him everywhere he goes.|$|R

Ralph Olifaunt, my grandfather, separated from him in disgust, and settled at Barcelona, where, by the friendship of the governor, his heresy, as it was termed, was connived at. My father, {{in the course of his}} commerce, resided more at Barcelona than in his native country, though at times he visited Genoa.|$|R
