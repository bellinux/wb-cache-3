Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E

Accepted as such by most islanders, when broadcast from Germany it was viewed differently in Britain, coming as it did in the midst of the Battle of Britain. The BBC did not repeat the broadcast as requested.|$|E

Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> always at transitional phases in the game. He applied principles of fuzzy logic to improve its play between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 {{was strong enough to}} play against the reigning world champion Luigi Villa. It won the match, 7–1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any board game. Berliner stated that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls.|$|E

Architecture that <b>is</b> full of <b>mistakes.</b> San Rocco 3 does not talk about that. San Rocco 3 is interested in another kind of mistake: <b>mistakes</b> that <b>are</b> {{the product of a}} disproportion, of a displacement; <b>mistakes</b> that <b>are</b> somehow generous, open, brave; mistakes that involve some sort of heroic failure; mistakes that shed a new light on the limits of the very same rule that labels them as <b>mistakes.</b> <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> evident, public. Like rules, they involve some sort of agreement. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> the opposite of opinions. Actually, mistakes despise opinions even more than rules do. Mistakes can happen only if there is a shared knowledge. Mistakes do not imply a complete refusal of the rule; rather, a rule is opposed by a new and different rule, not by a mistake. Mistakes do not want {{to do away with the}} rule; instead, mistakes try to establish a relationship with the rule (even if this is not a very relaxed one). <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> episodes in which the rule manifests itself in all its weakness and clumsiness. <b>Mistakes</b> <b>are</b> a comedy about rules, or the stumbling and stuttering little brothers of rules.

Senior Supt.

Interior secretary Jessie Robredo, {{who is in charge of}} the national police, also admitted problems with how the crisis was handled. Manila Police District director Rodolfo Magtibay, as commander of the rescue operation, took leave and four members of the SWAT team were suspended, pending investigation.|$|E
25|$|Remaining {{challenges}} However, in {{the rush}} to construct planning <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> made. Demand was overestimated, the construction of sewerage lagged behind the construction of treatment plants, designs were sometimes inappropriate, there was no requirement for pre-treatment of industrial effluents thus affecting the effectiveness of treatment processes, and the sites chosen for the first priority investments within a river basin were not always those where the highest impact could have been achieved in terms of improving river water quality. As a result, many plants are underutilized or poorly functioning. According to the Ministry of Construction, more than 50 wastewater treatment plants in more than 30 cities operated at only 30 percent of their capacity or did not even come into operation. Consequently, the impact of the investment program on the water quality in rivers and coastal waters has been limited.|$|E

Although the {{audience}} was small, the two were so impressed with Van Halen that within a week they offered the band a recording contract. The group recorded their debut album at Sunset Sound Recorders studio in mid-September to early October 1977, recording guitar parts for one week and then recording vocals for two additional weeks. All of the tracks were laid down with little over-dubbing or double-tracking. Minor <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> purposely left on the record and a simple musical set-up was used to give the record a live feel.

25|$|Another {{component}} to filming the show came {{when it was}} decided to use three 35mm film cameras to simultaneously film the show. The idea had been pioneered by Ralph Edwards on the game show Truth or Consequences, and had subsequently been used on Amos 'n' Andy as a way to save money, though Amos n' Andy did not use an audience. Edwards's assistant Al Simon was hired by Desilu to help perfect the new technique for the series. The process lent itself to the Lucy production as it eliminated the problem of requiring an audience to view and react to a scene three or four times in order for all necessary shots to be filmed. Multiple cameras would also allow scenes to be performed in sequence, as a play would be, which was unusual at the time for filmed series. Retakes were rare and dialogue <b>mistakes</b> <b>were</b> often played off for the sake of continuity.|$|E
25|$|On four {{occasions}} since 1990, the Middletown Times-Herald Record has run lengthy investigative {{articles on}} claims of electoral {{fraud in the}} village. A 1996 article found that Kiryas Joel residents who were students at yeshivas in Brooklyn had on many occasions apparently registered and voted in both the village and Brooklyn; a year later the paper reported that it had happened again. In 2001 absentee ballots were apparently cast by voters who did not normally reside in the village. In some cases, ballots were cast by people who seemed to reside in Antwerp, Belgium, without a set date of expected return and thus {{would not be allowed}} under New York law to vote in any election for state or local office.
