5000|$|<b>Mesitylene</b> {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1837 by Robert Kane, an Irish chemist, by heating acetone with concentrated sulfuric acid. He named his new substance [...] "mesitylene" [...] because the German chemist Carl Reichenbach had named acetone [...] "mesit" [...] (from the Greek μεσίτης, the mediator), and Kane believed that his reaction had dehydrated mesit, converting {{it to an}} alkene, [...] "mesitylene". However, Kane's determination of the chemical composition ("empirical formula") of <b>mesitylene</b> was incorrect. The correct empirical formula was provided by August W. von Hofmann in 1849. In 1866 Adolf von Baeyer showed that mesitylene's structure was consistent with that of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene; however, conclusive proof that <b>mesitylene</b> was identical to 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene was provided by Albert Ladenburg in 1874.|$|E

50|$|The {{selection}} of {{conditions for the}} process allows for control of pore sizes, particle diameter, and their distributions, {{as in the case}} of the one-step approach. Porosity in the modified process is controllable through the introduction of a swelling agent, the choice of temperature, and the quantity of sodium fluoride catalyst added. A swelling agent (such as <b>mesitylene)</b> causes increases in volume and hence in pore size, often by solvent absorption, but is limited by the solubility of the agent in the system. Pore size varies directly with temperature, bound by the lower out of the surfactant cloud point and the boiling point of water. Sodium fluoride concentration produces direct but non-linear changes in porosity, with the effect decreasing as the added fluoride concentration tends to an upper limit.|$|E

Dynamics of the free phenol in CCl 4 or the mixed solvent are very similar, and dynamics of the complex in <b>mesitylene</b> and in the mixed solvent are very similar. However, {{there are differences in}} the slowest time scale dynamics between the pure solvents and the mixed solvents. The mixed solvent produces slower dynamics that are attributed to first solvent shell solvent composition variations. The composition variations require a longer time to randomize than is required in the pure solvents, where only density variations occur.

Compounds 1 - 4 have been characterized by analytical and spectroscopic (IR, NMR, and MS) techniques. The X-ray structural investigations on all the three compounds reveal that the central <b>mesitylene</b> ring is a robust platform for hosting multiple methylene phosphonic acid groups. <b>Mesitylene</b> mono-methylene phosphonic acid 1, which {{can be considered as}} the sterically encumbered modification of benzyl phosphonic acid, interestingly associates as a one-dimensional tubular structure through extensive O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding between adjacent -PO(3) H(2) groups, albeit with no such interactions between the tubes due to the highly hydrophobic nature of the surface. The X-ray structure of mesitylene- 1, 3 -diphosphonic acid 2 reveals that the molecules exhibit a syn-orientation of the -CH(2) PO(3) H(2), which are involved in extensive P-OH center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding to result in a two-dimensional layered structure.
