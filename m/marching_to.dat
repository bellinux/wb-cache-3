5|$|At Doncaster, {{the king}} awaited Montagu, {{who was in}} the north raising a {{substantial}} force in Edward's name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called 'decisive'. The king was trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade {{began in}} 1979, {{and has been}} held every year. In 2007, the parade {{attracted}} wider attention when parade organizers approved {{the inclusion of a}} group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error.|$|E

5|$|Boycott's {{regiment}} {{transferred to}} Belfast {{shortly after his}} arrival. Six months later, it was sent to Newry before <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Dublin, where it remained for a year. In 1852, Boycott married Anne Dunne in StPaul's Church, Arran Quay, Dublin. He was ill between August 1851 and February 1852 and sold his commission the following year, but decided to remain in Ireland. He leased a farm in County Tipperary, where he acted as a landlord on a small scale.|$|E
5|$|By 622, Heraclius {{was ready}} to mount a counter-offensive. He left Constantinople the day after celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622. His young son, Heraclius Constantine, was left behind as regent under the charge of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Cappadocia. This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under Shahrbaraz to retreat from the front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, emulating Clark's {{success at}} Vincennes, French officer Augustin de La Balme {{organized}} a militia force of French residents to capture Fort Detroit. While <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Detroit, the force stopped to sack Kekionga. The delay proved fatal when the expedition met the warriors of the Miami tribe under Miami Chief Little Turtle along the Eel River, {{and the entire}} force was killed or captured. Clark organized another assault on Fort Detroit in 1781, but it was aborted when Chief Joseph Brant captured {{a significant part of}} Clark's army at a battle known as Lochry's Defeat, near present-day Aurora, Indiana.|$|E

5|$|In Besançon, {{the people}} called for Catholic Philip II of Spain {{to help fight}} all heresies in 1571. In {{response}} to this, the new archbishop, Claude de La Baume, demanded that anybody suspected of heresy be expelled from Besançon. Local authorities kept count of the Protestants in the city, expelling fifty of them later. The outcast Protestants took refuge in Switzerland and Montbéliard. In the midst of increasing violence in the region after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, the Protestant personae non gratae gathered in Montbéliard and Neuchâtel before <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Besançon in 1575.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{learned of}} the {{approach}} of royalist reinforcements and departed, but instead of <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join up. More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E

5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 223 BC, Antigonus {{advanced}} upon Tegea. He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it. The Tegeans held {{out for a few}} days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons. After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to Laconia, where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him. When his scouts brought news that the garrison of Orchomenus was <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke camp and ordered a forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia. Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops to winter at home.|$|E
5|$|Mardonius {{moved to}} break the stalemate, by {{offering}} peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the offer, but rejected it. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not. The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision for 10 days. However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> meet the Persians.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November, the Germans {{launched}} an assault from Podgorica towards Nikšić {{to clear a}} corridor through which the German forces in Montenegro could withdraw towards the Reich. This operation {{was supported by the}} Italian 86th National Republican Guard (GNR) Battalion. Around 1,200 of Đurišić's Chetniks were deployed on the flanks of the attack. Twelve days of fierce fighting resulted in significant casualties, and the Germans made no progress, losing Boka in the meantime. On 25 November, the Germans decided to abandon this line of attack and attack Kolašin. Chetniks under Đurišić's command continued to fight alongside the Germans. After reaching Kolašin, Đurišić's force separated from the Germans to relieve pressure on the German route of march and headed towards Bosnia, <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> the west of the Germans and bypassing Pljevlja. During the breakout and subsequent withdrawal, both the Germans and Chetniks were subjected to frequent attacks by the Allies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 May both sides formed up again. Beresford's orders {{indicated}} that he would retreat if Soult advanced. All day Soult held his ground, long enough to arrange for transportation of his wounded to Seville. It was not apparent to Beresford {{that there was little}} chance of Soult resuming hostilities, even when Kemmis's 1,400 strong brigade (previously stranded on the north bank of the Guadiana) joined the Allied army on the battlefield at dawn. Beresford also had the relatively unscathed Portuguese division, Alten's KGL and several Spanish battalions ready for duty; Soult, in contrast, only had Godinot's brigade and Latour-Maubourg's cavalry in a fit state to fight. News that Wellington was <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Elvas with a further two divisions hastened the Marshal's decision to retreat, as well as persuading Beresford not to launch a premature offensive against Soult's superior artillery and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Pedrarias' {{forces in}} the Olancho valley treated the natives harshly, {{provoking}} the Indians to rise against them throughout the province. They attacked the newly founded settlement and killed many of the Spanish there, including their commanding officer. The Spanish survivors fled and found refuge with an indigenous leader who had not joined the revolt. Natives in the north launched an overwhelming assault upon Natividad de Nuesta Señora near Puerto Caballos, forcing the Spanish there to hold up in a natural stronghold, and send a request for reinforcements to Saavedra, who was unable to spare any men to relieve them. Pedrarias' men who were <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> attack Puerto de Caballos turned back to Olancho, to find the Spanish settlement there had been sacked. They found refuge with the survivors to maintain a precarious presence in support of Pedrarias' claim over Honduras.|$|E

5|$|The Royalists in Chester saw the Parliamentarian {{reinforcements}} under Jones and Booth advance, {{and sent}} Shakerley to warn Langdale's force. After receiving the message, Langdale withdrew nearer to Chester, reforming at Rowton Heath, an entirely open space. At {{the same time}} the Royalists in Chester began to move, with Gerard advancing with 500 foot and 500 cavalry. Gerard hoped to attack Jones's force from the rear, but the Parliamentarians responded by dispatching 200 cavalry and 200 infantry to prevent this. With a shorter distance to travel, this force met Gerard on Hoole Heath, and after a confused engagement in which Lord Bernard Stewart was slain, Gerard's force was prevented from <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Langdale's aid. Instead, Jones and Booth linked up with Poyntz, giving a combined Parliamentarian force of 3,000 horse and 500 musketeers against a tired Royalist army of approximately 2,500 horse. At approximately 4:00pm Poyntz advanced, covered by the musketeers firing a full volley.|$|E
5|$|With the Crimea {{identified}} as the target, Nolan and his fellow staff officers had to plan the assault, which eventually included 30,000 infantry, 1,240 cavalry and 54 guns, along with 24,000 French soldiers and 70 of their guns. The cavalry alone required 3,379 horses, and with such {{a small number of}} ships available the Heavy Brigade would be part of a second wave – until it arrived, the Light Brigade would be relied on as the sole unit of cavalry. The force departed for the Crimea on 2 September 1854, and began landing at Kalamita Bay, 35 miles north of Sevastopol itself. Airey had the light cavalry engage in reconnaissance and screening {{while the rest of the}} force moved off the transports, and they were fully ashore by the 18th. On the 19th, they began <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Sevastopol – still without the Heavy Brigade.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Belgrade, he began writing poetry {{at an early}} age and {{published}} a number of literary reviews under a pseudonym while he was still a teenager. He rose to prominence during the Balkan Wars, writing about his experiences in territories newly retaken from the Ottoman Empire. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Bojić's studies at the University of Belgrade and forced him to postpone marrying his girlfriend, Radmila Todorović. The couple were separated in the chaos of war, and Bojić left Belgrade with his family and relocated to Niš, where he worked as a military censor and wrote articles for a local newspaper to pay his family's bills. In October 1915, the Serbian Army was overwhelmed by a combined Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German invasion and forced to retreat to neutral Greece via Albania. Bojić and his younger brother joined the exodus, marching for several weeks through Kosovo, Montenegro and northern Albania, where they were finally reunited with Bojić's fiancée. Bojić was not allowed to accompany his brother and fiancée on a ship destined for Italy because he was of fighting age, and had to continue <b>marching</b> <b>to</b> Greece without them.|$|E
