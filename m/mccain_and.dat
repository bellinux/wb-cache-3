5|$|<b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> Keating {{had become}} {{personal}} friends following their initial contacts in 1981, and McCain {{was the only}} one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. Like DeConcini, McCain considered Keating a constituent since Keating lived in Arizona. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates. In addition, McCain's wife Cindy <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> her father Jim Hensley had invested $359,100 in the Fountain Square Project, a Keating shopping center, in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard Keating's jet; three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating's Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain did not pay Keating (in the amount of $13,433) for some of the trips until years after they were taken, when he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2008, Fey {{once again}} portrayed Palin, {{this time in}} a sketch {{featuring}} the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator.

In the sketch, <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> Palin can only afford to buy airtime on QVC, a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, Cindy, also made an appearance in the sketch as herself.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits {{were filed}} against Barr by GOP members in Pennsylvania {{to prevent the}} {{candidate}} from appearing on the state's ballot on charges that the Libertarian Party tricked individuals into signing the state's ballot access petition. Commonwealth Court Judge Johnny Butler dismissed these allegations on September 16, allowing Barr {{to remain on the}} state's ballot. The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> Barack Obama from appearing on the ballot in Texas, charging that the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline to report their nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated their candidates (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E

Deciding to thank Limbaugh for his newfound conservatism, Brian is taken by Limbaugh to the National Republican Party headquarters in Washington, D.C., in order to meet former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain from Arizona. McCain then recalls when he and Limbaugh solved mysteries together. A parody of the animated television series Scooby-Doo is then shown, including <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> Limbaugh capturing United States Congressman Barney Frank from Massachusetts, disguised as a mummy.|$|E

The following morning, Jack discovers that C.C. is suing the Sheinhardt Wig Company, the fictional subsidiary of General Electric (GE) and owner of NBC, the company that Jack works for. This is because the company is allegedly leaking Auburn Fantasy Dye Number 260 into the Chicktaugua River, causing the children of Chickataugua to turn orange. After discovering that Jack works for GE, C.C. leaves and goes to work at Bill Clinton's office in Harlem. Jack and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), follow her there and Jack and C.C. decide to carry on their relationship in secret.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia students could participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John <b>McCain,</b> <b>and</b> Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
5|$|During July 1945 the U.S Third Fleet, {{which was}} led by Admiral William Halsey, {{conducted}} a series of air raids and naval bombardments against targets in Japan. These attacks were made by the Third Fleet's striking force, Task Force38 (TF38), which was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. <b>McCain</b> <b>and</b> included nine fleet carriers, six light carriers and their escorts. Almost one thousand aircraft were embarked on board these carriers. On 10July TF38's aircraft struck airfields around Tokyo and claimed to have destroyed 340 Japanese aircraft on the ground and two in the air. No Japanese aircraft responded to this attack as they were being held in reserve to mount large-scale suicide attacks on the Allied fleet during the expected invasion of the country later in 1945. Following this raid, the Third Fleet conducted raids on Hokkaido and northern Honshu on 14 and 15July which sank large numbers of ships and destroyed 25 aircraft on the ground. The American warships then sailed south and on 16July were joined by the British Pacific Fleet's (BPF's) main striking force, which was designated Task Force37 (TF37), and comprised three aircraft carriers and their escorts.|$|E
