40|$|Abstract: Tasks, such {{as those}} in patient care practice, require {{constant}} monitoring of a dynamic context and environment based on best practices in the form of predefined experience-based information or knowledge. These applications could take the form of reactive applications. The problem of incorporating best practices into routines used in such tasks requires advanced approaches and methods for comprehensively managing complex information. This paper presents a generic and unified framework for Complex Information Management (CIM) in domains where best practices need to be incorporated into day-to-day work. The CIM framework is supported by a high level declarative language, called AIM. The approach adopted here uses the combined application of the event-condition-action (ECA) rule paradigm, a temporal mechanism, advanced DBMS features and XML technologies. Furthermore, the paper also presents the conceptual architecture for the complex information management system, AIMS. The main contribution of CIM framework and approach lays in managing the complex information by introducing multiple <b>management</b> <b>planes</b> under a unified framework. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{its great}} importance, modern network {{infrastructure}} is remarkable {{for the lack}} of rigor in its engineering. The Internet which began as a research experiment was never designed to handle the users and applications it hosts today. The lack of formalization of the Internet architecture meant limited abstractions and modularity, especially for the control and <b>management</b> <b>planes,</b> thus requiring for every new need a new protocol built from scratch. This led to an unwieldy ossified Internet architecture resistant to any attempts at formal verification, and an Internet culture where expediency and pragmatism are favored over formal correctness. Fortunately, recent work in the space of clean slate Internet design [...] -especially, the software defined networking (SDN) paradigm [...] -offers the Internet community another chance to develop the right kind of architecture and abstractions. This has also led to a great resurgence in interest of applying formal methods to specification, verification, and synthesis of networking protocols and applications.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{networking}} paradigm introducing the broker-plane above the <b>management</b> <b>planes</b> of Autonomous Systems (ASes). The brokers {{communicate with the}} manager of each AS to assist coordinate end-to-end resource management and path provisioning across the multi-AS networks involving multiple operators. The broker plane updates the virtual network topology, manages the resource information of inter-AS links and aggregated (abstracted) intra-AS links, and computes end-to-end routing, modulation formats, and spectrum assignment (RMSA). Notwithstanding, due to the different dynamicity of each AS, the probability of finding a multi-AS transparent path fulfilling the spectrum continuity and contiguity constraints might be low. To improve the grade of the inter-domain connectivity service, spectrum converters can be installed in inter-domain nodes or per-AS defragmentation can be performed with a global view. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism where each AS can advertise its internal capabilities, e. g., spectrum conversion, their ability to implement spectrum defragmentation or any other network feature. The Multi-AS RMSA with Defragmentation Capability problem is presented and mathematically modeled. A heuristic algorithm is designed to solve it. The mechanism's workflow is comprehensively tested using simulations. Results show connection blocking reduction as high as 26 %, clearly validating {{the benefits of the}} proposed mechanism.

50|$|Internet {{architecture}} is organized into several planes. The data plane represents how data is actually forwarded between routers. Topologies {{based on the}} data plane reflect physical nodes and connections but these topology graphs are hard to create and harder to validate for correctness or completeness. The control plane represents how ISP's create and configure organizational routing policy. While the data plane is responsible for forwarding data based on policy, the control plane is responsible for configuring policy. As far as topology is concerned, nodes in this plane are autonomous systems, (AS) and links between nodes represent some type of relationship. There {{are two types of}} relationships. Customer-Provider links involve one AS providing Internet access to a smaller AS at a monetary cost. Peering links are agreements between two AS networks to exchange certain types of traffic free of charge. These types of Internet topologies have become a hot area of research in academia. There is a third less known plane called the <b>management</b> <b>plane</b> but the topology maps it produces are incredibly inaccurate since its data can be directly modified by network operators with no effects on routing dynamics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Networks {{are hard}} to manage {{and in spite of}} all the so called {{holistic}} management packages, things are getting worse. We argue that this is an outcome of two fundamental flaws in the existing architecture: the <b>management</b> <b>plane</b> depends on the data plane and the complexity of the ever-evolving data plane en-cumbers the <b>management</b> <b>plane.</b> Consequently, addressing these flaws can make the network amenable to management. In this paper, we present Complexity Oblivious Network Management (CONMan), a network architecture in which the <b>management</b> <b>plane</b> does not depend on the data plane and all data plane protocols expose a generic management interface. This restricts the operational complexity of protocols to their implementation and allows the <b>management</b> <b>plane</b> to achieve high level policies in a structured fashion.

40|$|Today’s data {{networks}} are surprisingly fragile {{and difficult to}} manage. We argue that the root of these problems lies in {{the complexity of the}} control and management planes—the software and protocols coordinating network elements—and particularly the way the decision logic and the distributed-systems issues are inexorably intertwined. We advocate a complete refactoring of the functionality and propose three key principles—network-level objectives, network-wide views, and direct control—that we believe should underlie a new architecture. Following these principles, we identify an extreme design point that we call “ 4 D, ” after the architecture’s four planes: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The 4 D architecture completely separates an AS’s decision logic from protocols that govern the interaction among network elements. The AS-level objectives are specified in the decision plane, and enforced through direct configuration of the state that drives how the data plane forwards packets. In the 4 D architecture, the routers and switches simply forward packets {{at the behest of the}} decision plane, and collect measurement data to aid the decision plane in controlling the network. Although 4 D would involve substantial changes to today’s control and <b>management</b> <b>planes,</b> the format of data packets does not need to change; this eases the deployment path for the 4 D architecture, while still enabling substantial innovation in network control and management. We hope that exploring an extreme design point will help focus the attention of the research and industrial communities on this crucially important and intellectually challenging area...|$|R

The results of the trend analysis highlighted a clear subdivision of the European domain into two sub-regions: a South-West portion with mostly positive trends (drying of the soil) and a North-East part with decreasing soil water deficit. Overall, about 19 % of the domain was affected by a significant linear trend according to the Mann-Kendall test and the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure (p = 0. 05), with about 11. 6 % having a negative (wetting) and 7. 6 % a positive (drying) slope. A spatial cluster analysis identified 11 major areas (with extension > 10, 000 km 2) affected by significant trends, including the Ebro and Garonne basins (for positive slopes), and the Dniester watershed (for negative trends). A final analysis at national and sub-national levels highlights that most of the observed trends are also significant when aggregated at regional (NUTS- 1) spatial scale, detecting the administrative areas where water <b>management</b> <b>planes</b> are likely most affected.
