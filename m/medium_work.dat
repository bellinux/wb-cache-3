40|$|Based on {{the results}} of a {{parametric}} finite element study on single edge notch specimens with shallow crack geometries (0. 05 less-than-or-equals, slant a/W less-than-or-equals, slant 0. 1) under large plastic deformation, a revised J-estimation method is presented. The revised scheme focused on material laws which can be approximated by a power law representation. The scheme uses the format of an existing method which adopts Turner's EnJ tripartite approach of J-estimation: Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics, Net Section Yield and Gross Section Yield. The form of the J vs strain relationship in the gross section yield region was derived from a consideration of the HRR strain field equation, the EPRI plastic J equation and the definition of J in terms of the energy release rate. Comparison with finite element results shows that the revised scheme generally provides safe predictions of the crack driving parameter. For low to <b>medium</b> <b>work</b> hardening materials (power law exponent n greater-or-equal, slanted 5), the accuracy of prediction is within about 5 %.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of job stress on cellular immune function, such as NK cell activity and NK cell subsets. The participants were 61 female nurses aged 23 - 59, who worked in a public psychiatric hospital in Ishikawa, Japan. Each subject completed the Nursing Job Stressor Scale (NJSS) and their NK cell activity and lymphocyte surface antigens (CD 16 + 56 +) were evaluated as immune system parameters. The NJSS has seven subscales: conflict with other nursing staff, nursing role conflict, conflict with physicians or autonomy, conflict with death or dying, quantitative work load, qualitative work load and conflict with patients. Factors influencing NK cell activity, and the proportion and cell counts of CD 16 + 56 + lymphocytes were evaluated. Increase in quantitative work load significantly decreased NK cell activity. Conversely, no linear relationship was observed between qualitative work load and immunological variables, with {{the highest percentage of}} CD 16 + 56 + lymphocytes observed among participants in the <b>medium</b> <b>work</b> load group. The other five NJSS subscales did not relate to immune parameters.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interpretation}} of creatine kinase (CK) flux measured by 31 P NMR magnetization transfer in vivo is complex {{because of the}} presence of competing reactions, metabolite compartmentation, and CK isozyme localization. In the isovolumic perfused rat heart, we considered the influence of both ATP compartmentation and ATP-Pi exchange on the forward (Ff: PCr → ATP) and reverse (Fr) CK fluxes derived from complete analysis of inversion transfer. Although Ff should equal Fr because of the steady state, in both protocols when PCr (inv-PCr) or ATP (inv-ATP) was inverted and the contribution of ATP-Pi was masked by saturation of Pi (sat-Pi), Ff/Fr significantly differed from 1 (0. 80 ± 0. 06 or 1. 32 ± 0. 06, respectively, n= 5). These discrepancies could be explained by a compartment of ATP (fATP) not involved in CK. Consistently, neglecting ATP compartmentation in the analysis of CK in vitro results in an underestimation of Ff/Fr for inv-PCr and its overestimation for inv-ATP. Both protocols gave access to fATP if the system was adequately analyzed. The fraction of ATP not involved in CK reaction in a heart performing <b>medium</b> <b>work</b> amounts to 20 – 33 % of cellular ATP.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Marine mussels anchor to {{a variety}} of {{surfaces}} in turbulent intertidal zones through the use of adhesive plaques formed from hardened mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs). It is believed that 3, 4 -dihydroxyphen-ylalanine (DOPA) imparts both water-resistant adhesive characteristics and rapid curing ability to MAPs. In this paper, DOPA-modified triblock copolymers were synthesized and used to form adhesive hydrogels. Amphiphilic block copolymers with DOPA content as high as 10 wt % were prepared, and aqueous solutions of the polymers rapidly (< 1 min) formed hydrogels by photopolymerization of methacrylate end groups attached to the hydrophobic segments. Contact mechanics adhesion tests were performed on the photocured hydrogels, and it was shown that incorporating DOPA into the polymer structure significantly enhanced work of adhesion to titanium surfaces submerged in an aqueous <b>medium.</b> <b>Work</b> of adhesion values as high as 410 mJ/m 2 were recorded for polymers containing 10 wt % DOPA, although the introduction of Lys {{in the form of a}} DOPA-Lys copolypeptide reduced the work of adhesion. Oxidation of DOPA was shown to reduce work of adhesion to Ti, confirming earlier studies suggesting that the catecholic form of DOPA is largely responsible for adhesion to metal oxide surfaces. The DOPA-containing block copolymers described in this study are candidates for use as adhesive biomaterials for medical applications...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the effects of bio-stabilization on geomaterials as an alternative to chemical and mechanical stabilization. Microbially induced precipitation was used as a method of bio-stabilization. An indigenous microorganism, Bacillus pasteurii, was used to prompt calcite and other precipitates that stabilized geomaterials. A standard procedure for bacteria cultivation and bio-treatment soil stabilization and aggregate coating was developed. Two types of liquid incubation medium, one containing NH 4 Cl and one containing (NH 4) 2 SO 4, were tested. After conducting unconfined compression tests, it was discovered that both <b>medium</b> <b>work</b> well for bacteria incubation and treated samples have similar strength performance. In addition, double bio-treated samples were stronger than single treated samples, and oven-dried bio-treated samples were stronger than air-dried treated samples. In aggregates, lower porosity helps to resist the negative effects of freezing and thawing. Mercury intrusion porosimetry confirmed that bio-treatment decreased the porosity of aggregates. At five to six bio-treatment cycles the lowest porosity values were achieved. More than six cycles of bio-treatment showed an increase in the porosity. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, were conducted and confirmed that bio-treatment produces precipitate coatings on the surfaces of aggregate. Dynamic modulus tests of concrete beams with bio-treated aggregates showed that treated aggregate improved the durability of the concrete. Freeze-thaw soundness tests on the treated aggregate confirmed these results. This {{is believed to be the}} first study of its kind...|$|E

40|$|Thirteen {{paintings}} were {{made as a}} result of Geraint Evans' residency at the Berwick Gymnasium Fellowship, funded by the Arts Council and English Heritage, and based in the Grade I listed Berwick Barracks in Berwick-upon-Tweed. Evans, along with fellow resident artists Marcus Coates and Annie Cattrell, were invited to respond to the very particular environment of the Barracks, the town and its immediate environs, utilizing existing practices and based upon submitted proposals for a period of four months between October 2002 and March 2003. The outcomes of this Fellowship were presented {{in the form of a}} solo exhibition at Berwick Barracks (31 May - 6 July 2004), supported by a modest catalogue with a short text. 'The Berwick Gymnasium Fellowship 1993 - 2005 ' has been published by English Heritage and Art Editions North (September 2007), including an essay on Evans' project edited by Cherry Smyth. The project explored notions of aspiration and the parochial/suburban in relation to a particular location. Evans was interested in notions of failure and aspiration in relation to Berwick's isolated geographical position and through the influence of external cultural forces, particularly the influence of mass-mediated Americana, (making direct references to American Graffiti, Dogtown and Z Boys and Bruce Springsteen). The project asks how painterly narrative fictions can investigate and describe notions of failure and aspiration in direct response to Berwick's unique cultural configuration. Drawing and photographic documentation formed the basis of this investigation, articulated through figuration.

Evaluation of hybridization is performed automatically. For culturing sputum liquid culture medium used - Middlebrook broth 7 N 9 VASTES MGIT system. Results and discussion. The results of molecular genetic studies of samples of sputum-concentrated and concentrated by a system GenoType not differed (P> 0. 05). Diagnostic value of two methods (molecular and genetic – system GenoType and phenotype – VASTES MGIT 960 system) was very high (100 %). Two systems have tested positive in the study 756 (95. 5 %) Mycobacterium strains that were identified in the system VASTES MGIT 960, formed Cord Factor and the results were positive identification test ID MTB MGIT they attributed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. 36 (4. 5 %) samples from positive MGIT tubes were negative. As a result of molecular-genetic identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria complex it was found that 18 (2. 3 %) strains of mycobacteria belonging to the M. avium-intracellulare, 12 (1. 5 %) mycobacterial cultures were attributed to M. kansasii, 6 (0, 7 %) cultures were identified as M. fortuitum. The results of the molecular study of MS on Mycobacterium resistance profile INN + RIF coincided in 95. 5 % (894 strains) the results of testing by phenotypic proportions. In the presence of mutations associated with resistance to INH, only 93. 1 % of cases observed MC M. tuberculosis to INH during TMCH in a liquid medium Middlebrook 7 N 9. In the presence of mutations in the genes responsible for resistance to the presence of Q, in a liquid medium only 288 (90. 6 %) strains of M. tuberculosis have MS to Ofx. The strains of mycobacteria DNA were detected mutations in genes associated with MS to aminoglycosides / cyclic peptides in 299 (94. 0 %) cases were resistant to Am and 302 (94. 9 %) cases were resistant to the results Cm DST system VASTES MGIT 960.
