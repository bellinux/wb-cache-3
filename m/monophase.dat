The laser welds behaved substantially different from the base material under creep and high temperature oxidation.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{thoroughly}} {{describes the}} decomposition procedure, using {{the example of}} DE-COMPXR (Lanson 1990). The steps of the decomposition procedure are: 1) preliminary data processing; 2) decomposition; 3) validation of results; and 4) use of the results. The use of decomposition is restricted to the separation of contributions from various phases. The effect of preliminary data processing steps (data smoothing, background stripping) on profile shape is shown to be limited and their implementation is detailed. Potential experimental limitations uch as peak symmetry, experimental reproducibility or discrimination are equally minor. A logical decomposition process tarts from {{the definition of the}} angular range to be fitted, proceeds with the determination of the number of elementary peaks to be fitted and ends with the check for results consistency. Numerical data processing is a powerful tool for the accurate identification of <b>monophases,</b> because of the additional parameters available to constrain XRD profile simulation. Ultimately, however, the match over the whole angular ange of both the experimental nd the simulated patterns remains the only valid way to characterize the phases present in the sample. Additionally, the decomposition procedure permits both the identification of complex clay mineral assemblages and the characterization f their evolution. This step constrains, and may help to determine, the reaction mechanisms of a transformation; and, as a consequence, to characterize and to model the kinetics of this transformation...|$|R

Three systems were made. In the first (already studied in detail), the microemulsions are in equilibrium with an oil and/or water phase in excess, the microemulsion composition varies as a fonction of the brine salinity. The two other systems are <b>monophases</b> made with a brine of salinity 6. 5 %. In the second system, we vary the oil volume fraction Φo from 20 to 90 % at constant SdS concentration (5 x 10 - 2 g/ml). In the third, we chose the component proportions such that the quantity ΦoΦw/cs (Φw : brine volume fraction, cs : SdS concentration) remains constant as Φo varies from 20 to 80 %. Thus one fixes the theoretical microemulsion characteristic length according to the expression $$ predicted by Talmon-Prager and de Gennes (Σ is the area per SdS polar head). 1) The SdS polar head contribution to the contrast and to the intensity scattered at large angle in the asymptotic domain is large.

40|$|Objectives. (1) To {{synthesize}} 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (3 Y-TZP) powders via coprecipitation route, (2) {{to obtain}} zirconia ceramic specimens, analyze surface characteristics, and mechanical properties, and (3) {{to compare the}} processed material with three reinforced dental ceramics. Methods. A coprecipitation route was used to synthesize a 3 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic processed by uniaxial compaction and pressureless sintering. Commercially available alumina or alumina/zirconia ceramics, namely Procera AllCeram (PA), In-Ceram Zirconia Block (CAZ) and In-Ceram Zirconia (IZ) were chosen for comparison. All specimens (6 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm) were polished and ultrasonically cleaned. Qualitative phase analysis was performed by XRD and apparent densities were measured {{on the basis of}} Archimedes principle. Ceramics were also characterized using SEM, TEM and EDS. The hardness measurements were made employing Vickers hardness test. Fracture toughness (K(IC)) was calculated. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test (alpha = 0. 05). Results. ANOVA revealed that the Vickers hardness (p < 0. 0001) and fracture toughness (p < 0. 0001) were affected by the ceramic materials composition. it was confirmed that the PA ceramic was constituted of a rhombohedral alumina matrix, so-called alpha-alumina. Both CAZ and IZ ceramics presented tetragonal zirconia and alpha-alumina mixture of phases. The SEM/EDS analysis confirmed the presence of aluminum in PA ceramic. In the IZ and CAZ ceramics aluminum, zirconium and cerium in grains involved by a second phase containing aluminum, silicon and lanthanum were identified. PA showed significantly higher mean Vickers hardness values (H(V)) (18. 4 +/- 0. 5 GPa) compared to vitreous CAZ (10. 3 +/- 0. 2 GPa) and IZ (10. 6 +/- 0. 4 GPa) ceramics. Experimental Y-TZP showed significantly lower results than that of the other <b>monophased</b> ceramic (PA) (p < 0. 05) but it showed significantly higher fracture toughness (6. 0 +/- 0. 2 MPa m(1 / 2)) values when compared to the other tested ceramics (p < 0. 05). Significance. The coprecipitation method used to synthesize zirconia powders and the adopted ceramic processing conditions led to ceramics with mechanical properties comparable to commercially available reinforced ceramic materials.

40|$|Spinel {{materials}} {{based on}} Mn and Ni has been intensively studied {{over the past}} years due to their excellent semiconductor properties. Nickel manganite as NTC thermistor is widely used today in different industrial sectors. Here we report the complex polymerization method (CPM) for producing nickel manganite fine particles with a homogeneous distribution of constituent cations in the crystal lattice that ensures formation of dense <b>monophased</b> ceramic with the novel magnetic properties after been sintered in oxygen and air atmosphere. Phase composition of the synthesized materials was examined by XRPD, while the morphology of the powder and microstructure of ceramic were investigated using FESEM and SEM analyses, respectively. The magnetic properties of the samples have been studied by measuring the temperature and field dependence of magnetization. Magnetic measurements of M(T) reveal rather complex magnetic properties and multiple magnetic phase transitions. In the case of air atmosphere we found three magnetic phase transitions with transition temperatures at TM 1 = 35 K, TM 2 = 101 K and TM 3 = 120 K. TM 1 maximum is strongly dependent on the strength of the applied magnetic field (TM 1 decreases with increasing applied field) whereas the TM 3 is field independent The values of the coercivity, remanent magnetization and saturation magnetization at 100 K are: HC = 184 Oe, Mr = 1. 92 emu/g and MS = 7. 88 emu/g, respectively. The measured values at 5 K are HC = 1035 Oe, Mr = 7. 70 emu/g and MS = 14. 47 emu/g. Moreover, hysteresis properties measured after cooling of the sample in magnetic field show exchange bias effect with an exchange bias field |HEB= 196 Oe. For the sample synthetized in oxygen atmosphere, the magnetization dependence of temperature M(T) and AC susceptibility data obtained from SQUID measurements clearly demonstrates that quadruple magnetic phase transitions can be readily detected at TM 1 ~ 115 K, TM 2 ~ 105 K, TM 3 ~ 38 K and TM 4 ~ 7 K. These findings suggest the novel magnetic transition for nickel manganite at low temperature TM 4. The temperatures of observed maximums in χ’(T) and χ’’(T) parts of susceptibility are frequency independent, whereas the height of the peaks decreases with increasing frequency. The fact that TM 4 does not shift with the increase of the frequency led us to the conclusion that there are no spin-glass/surface effect and/or blocking temperature/finite size effect connected to the NiMn 2 O 4 ceramic. Therefore, the low-temperature peak TM 4 in AC susceptibility is associated with ferromagnetic-like and antiferromagnetic-like magnetic transition in the interfacial FM/AFM internal structure. The exchange bias effect was found in a field cooled hysteresis loops at 5 K. The field cooling of the sample was under a magnetic field of 100 Oe and 10 kOe whereas the determined exchange bias fields were |HEB|= 129 Oe and 182 Oe, respectively. The analysis of the results and comparison with literature data allowed us to conjecture that the mixed oxidation states of Mn ions and ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic sublattice orders tailor these interesting magnetic properties...|$|R

The impression materials used were impression plaster (Plastogum), a polyether (Impregum Penta), and two polyvinyl siloxane materials (Aquasil <b>Monophase</b> and Aquasil putty with light body wash). Five impressions were made with each impression material and cast in Satin stone under controlled conditions. The positions of the implants on the master model, the impression copings, and the implant analogues in the subsequent cast were measured using a co-ordinate measuring machine which measures within 4 μm of accuracy. Results Statistical analysis using a one factor t-test indicated that distortion occurred in all the impression materials, but inconsistently. Aquasil <b>Monophase</b> reproduced the master model most accurately. Although there was no significant distortion between the Aquasil <b>monophase</b> impressions and the master model or between the impressions and their casts, there were distortions between the master model and the master cast, which highlighted the cumulative effects of the distortions. Impregum’s performance proved to be the most reliable in terms of predictability. Plastogum displayed cumulative distortion and with Aquasil putty with light body, these impression materials had the least reliability. Conclusions Some of the distortions observed are of clinical significance and likely to contribute to a lack of passive fit of any superstructure. The unpredictability of such distortions may mean that the future of accurate impressions and superstructures may lie in the digital world...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: A {{limitation}} of vinyl polysiloxane (VPS) impression materials is hydrophobicity, and manufacturers have added surfactants and labeled these new products as "hydrophilic. " The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to evaluate and compare the dimensional accuracy and surface detail reproduction of two hydrophilic VPS impression materials under dry, moist, and wet conditions. Materials and Methods: Ten impressions were made under dry, moist, and wet conditions respectively, with <b>monophase,</b> and regular body VPS impression material using a stainless steel metal die similar to that described in American Dental Association (ADA) specification 19, with lines scribed on it. Dimensional accuracy was measured by comparing the average length of the middle horizontal line in each impression to the same line on the metal die, by using a measuring microscope. The surface detail was evaluated. A one-way analysis of variance and Student t-test were used to compare mean dimensional changes (α = 0. 05). Results: Conditions (dry, moist, and wet) did not cause significant adverse effects on the dimensional accuracy of either material. The mean dimensional changes were 0. 00084 % (+ 0. 00041 %) for <b>monophase</b> and 0. 00119 % (+ 0. 00033 %) for regular body. <b>Monophase</b> material was satisfactory in detail reproduction 100 % of the time in dry conditions, 90 % in moist, and only 20 % in wet conditions. The regular body showed 100 % satisfactory impressions in dry, 80 % in moist, and 10 % in wet conditions. With the additional smooth surface evaluation, only under dry conditions impressions with clinically acceptable surface quality were produced. Conclusions: Dimensional changes for both materials were well within ADA standards of minimal shrinkage value of 0. 5 %...|$|E
