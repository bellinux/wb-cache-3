5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A <b>melanophore</b> is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} able to {{translocate}} the pigment inside their chromatophores, resulting in an apparent change in body colour. This process, known as physiological colour change, is most widely studied in melanophores, since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment. In most species with a relatively thin dermis, the dermal melanophores tend to be flat and cover a large surface area. However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal chromatophore units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like <b>melanophore</b> layer with processes covering the iridophores.|$|E
25|$|Both {{types of}} <b>melanophore</b> are {{important}} in physiological colour change. Flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores, so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark. When the pigment is aggregated toward {{the centre of the}} cell, the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue. Likewise, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (yellow) filtering of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.|$|E
40|$|Barfin {{flounder}} larvae exhibit unique black coloration, {{as well as}} left-right asymmetry {{in juvenile}} stage as in other flatfish. In this study, we first assessed the changes in <b>melanophores</b> with development and then investigated their responsiveness to melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) during metamorphosis. Larval-type <b>melanophores</b> appeared {{on both sides of}} the body before metamorphosis, whereas adult-type <b>melanophores</b> appeared only on the ocular side after metamorphosis. Even in the individuals of this species displaying black coloration, the density of larval-type <b>melanophores</b> was similar to that in transparent larvae of other species. However, unlike in transparent larvae, larval-type <b>melanophores</b> completely dispersed in the black larvae of this species. Therefore, the black coloration during larval stages was mainly due to dispersion, and not the density, of larval-type <b>melanophores.</b> In vitro MCH treatment revealed, for the first time, the responsiveness of <b>melanophores</b> in larval stages. On the ocular side, larval-type <b>melanophores</b> aggregated against MCH during larval stages, while, in the larvae at later metamorphic stages and in juveniles, larval-type <b>melanophores</b> did not aggregate, although aggregation of adult-type <b>melanophores</b> was noted. In contrast, on the blind side, the responsiveness of larval-type <b>melanophores</b> to MCH was consistently present from larval to juvenile stages. The metamorphic transition of MCH responsiveness from larval- to adult-type <b>melanophores</b> only on the ocular side suggests the larval (therefore, immature) nature of the blind side skin. We propose that the inhibited development, and thus the retention of the larval-type skin leads to the formation of the blind side characteristics and is the central mechanism for the flatfish asymmetry...|$|R

The {{intensity of light}} used for illumination was about 2, 000 lux. <b>Melanophores</b> remained {{in a state of}} melanosome dispersion in physiological saline in the presence of light. However, the majority of <b>melanophores</b> did not maintain the fully dispersed state under dark conditions, showing various degrees of melanosome dispersion. In many cases when the <b>melanophores</b> were exposed to intermittent light and dark in physiological saline they responded by melanosome dispersion to light and by melanosome aggregation to dark.

25|$|MC1R has a {{slightly}} different function in cold-blooded animals such as fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Here, α-MSH activation of MC1R results in the dispersion of eumelanin-filled melanosomes throughout the interior of pigment cells (called melanophores). This gives {{the skin of the}} animal a darker hue and often occurs in response to changes in mood or environment. Such a physiological color change implicates MC1R as a key mediator of adaptive cryptic coloration. The role of ASIP's binding to MC1R in regulating this adaptation is unclear; however, in teleost fish at least, functional antagonism is provided by melanin-concentrating hormone. This signals through its receptor to aggregate the melanosomes toward a small area in the centre of the <b>melanophore,</b> resulting in the animal's having a lighter overall appearance. Cephalopods generate a similar, albeit more dramatic, pigmentary effect using muscles to rapidly stretch and relax their pigmented chromatophores. MC1R does not appear {{to play a role in}} the rapid and spectacular colour changes observed in these invertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Melanophores contain eumelanin, {{a type of}} melanin, {{that appears}} black or dark-brown because of its light {{absorbing}} qualities. It is packaged in vesicles called melanosomes and distributed throughout the cell. Eumelanin is generated from tyrosine {{in a series of}} catalysed chemical reactions. It is a complex chemical containing units of dihydroxyindole and dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid with some pyrrole rings. The key enzyme in melanin synthesis is tyrosinase. When this protein is defective, no melanin can be generated resulting in certain types of albinism. In some amphibian species there are other pigments packaged alongside eumelanin. For example, a novel deep (wine) red-colour pigment was identified in the melanophores of phyllomedusine frogs. This was subsequently identified as pterorhodin, a pteridine dimer that accumulates around eumelanin core, and it is also present in a variety of tree frog species from Australia and Papua New Guinea. While it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex <b>melanophore</b> pigments, it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{control and}} {{mechanics}} of rapid pigment translocation {{has been well}} studied {{in a number of}} different species, in particular amphibians and teleost fish. It has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormonal or neuronal control or both and for many species of bony fishes it is known that chromatophores can respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light, UV-radiation, temperature, pH, chemicals, etc. [...] Neurochemicals that are known to translocate pigment include noradrenaline, through its receptor on the surface on melanophores. The primary hormones involved in regulating translocation appear to be the melanocortins, melatonin, and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), that are produced mainly in the pituitary, pineal gland, and hypothalamus, respectively. These hormones may also be generated in a paracrine fashion by cells in the skin. At the surface of the <b>melanophore,</b> the hormones have been shown to activate specific G-protein-coupled receptors that, in turn, transduce the signal into the cell. Melanocortins result in the dispersion of pigment, while melatonin and MCH results in aggregation.|$|E

Innervated <b>melanophores</b> remained {{in a state of}} melanosome dispersion in physiological saline and in a state of melanosome aggregation in M/ 7. 5 KC 1 solution, regardless of exposure to light or dark conditions.
