2500|$|... "In {{the roar}} {{greeting}} the announcement, I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{man who had}} begged for four votes. He was jumping up and down, slapping a beaming Ted Kennedy on the back, apparently beside himself with joy. I recognized him as our old friend Senator Gale McGee." ...|$|E
60|$|Still I {{could neither}} speak nor move. I could only {{look away from}} him in horror, and fix <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "This may be true, Strides, and {{certainly}} I shall keep <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Indian. Can you mention any particular act, that excites your suspicion?" ...|$|E
60|$|Every word of that 'par' was a staggerer. I sat as one stunned, dazed, stupid, motionless, with <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sheet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{waiting for}} that eclipse," [...] I answered; [...] "I have had <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moon for the last half-hour, and I never saw it look healthier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{can follow}} {{it if it}} gets no fainter, but there's no time to lose," [...] he said. [...] "It might be safer if I went first and kept <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail." ...|$|R
60|$|I kept my {{head down}} and <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. I was ashamed of my {{weakness}} and my want of spirit. I {{was determined not to}} look at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had the sense, dazed as I was, to {{take the}} hint, and slewing round at right-angles, but still keeping <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lioness, I {{continued}} my backward walk.|$|E
6000|$|I {{pointed out}} to him concisely, and keeping <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of the hotel, {{that he and his}} wife were the only bond with the land Captain Anthony had. Who else could he have asked? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This old gentleman," [...] said I, fixing <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> painted panel, [...] "seems to {{have had}} HIS arms painted as well as Mr. Treddles--that is, if that {{painting}} in the corner be a scutcheon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thought so," [...] he replied, as one versed. His tones {{took on a}} nasal twang. [...] "Well, as I was saying, I've about {{got ready}} to settle down, and I've had <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lady this seven years." ...|$|R
60|$|He readdressed {{himself to}} the telephone, and I kept <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} to the southward. A Blue Peter climbed {{up to the top}} of the flagstaff that crowned it and blew out in the summer breeze. A black storm-cone followed.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} what I had dropped. It was {{the heart of the}} shark, and as I looked, there under <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{scorching}} deck where the pitch oozed from the seams, the heart pulsed with life.|$|E
60|$|As she had promised, it was Michelot who {{greeted me}} when next I opened <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} day. There were {{tears in his}} eyes--eyes that had looked grim and unmoved upon {{the horrors of the}} battlefield.|$|E
60|$|I wonder, when I {{look back}} at it, at my own obstinacy. I am almost ashamed to relate that I made Mr. Playmore no reply. He waited, still looking at me. I felt irritated by that fixed look. I arose, and stood before him with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a {{few notes}} for your guidance, Mr. Malone. I've had <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Professor for some little time." [...] He took a paper from a drawer. [...] "Here is a summary of his record. I give it you briefly:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{said with}} raw self-confidence. [...] "I'm not one to run away; but I'll promise to keep <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fellow after this and be cautious. All his schemes aren't {{in the same class}} as those mining shares, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|My blood {{seemed to}} stand still. A deadly paralysing coldness stole {{all over me}} as I turned my head round <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow and {{determined}} to test whether the bed-top was really moving or not, by keeping <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man in the picture.|$|R
6000|$|I turned <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old man, still bending forward, intently {{watching}} for the sign {{he had asked}} her to make. My anger and disgust at his gross earthy egoism had vanished. [...] "Let us thank God, old man," [...] I said, the tears of joy half choking my utterance. [...] "She lives--she is recovering from her fit." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{was about}} to answer, and raised my eyes for the purpose, they {{encountered}} those of Miss Vernon, who, having entered the room unobserved during the conversation, had given it her close attention. Abashed and confounded, I fixed <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, and made my escape to the breakfast-table, where I herded among my busy cousins.|$|E
60|$|For {{directly}} I opened <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morrow, I saw daylight. Well, I don't {{mean that}} exactly, because naturally I did. What I {{mean is that}} I found I had the thing all mapped out. The good old subconscious m. had delivered the goods, and I perceived exactly what steps must be taken {{in order to put}} Augustus Fink-Nottle among the practising Romeos.|$|E
60|$|I believe I was {{the butt}} {{of more than one}} jest for my aloofness, though I could not hear {{distinctly}} for the noise they made. I commanded some French cognac, and kept <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rector, and the sight of him was making me dangerous.|$|R
5000|$|Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews {{rated the}} episode with 3/4 saying: [...] "I sort of kept <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clock as this episode went by: each scene {{was about a}} minute and a half long. No wonder this show is so intense. Something new is {{happening}} every 90 seconds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, lad, I had <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> window, countin' {{to throw}} my shoe {{through the glass}} when he showed his ugly face again, hopin' that he'd get cut a bit, an', besides, I somehow had it in my head that you an' Jerry would flash up sooner or later." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that moment}} on time did not matter to me. I forgot all about it. I felt only my leaden feet and my laboring chest and {{dripping}} skin. I did not even notice the additional weight of my rifle and camera though they must have overburdened me. I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lion runway and plunged away with short steps. To look at these towering walls {{would have been to}} surrender.|$|E
6000|$|As if {{the sight}} of that shoe had renewed the spell, I gave up {{suddenly}} the idea of leaving the house there and then. It had become impossible. I sat down, keeping <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fascinating object. Jacobus turned his daughter's shoe {{over and over in}} his cushioned paws as if studying the way the thing was made. He contemplated the thin sole for a time; then glancing inside with an absorbed air: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{clouds were}} wild {{in the western}} heaven, and the wind blew chill from the sea. Far as the shore was, {{the sound of the}} surf swept over the {{intervening}} moorland, and beat drearily in my ears when I entered the churchyard. Not a living creature was in sight. The place looked lonelier than ever as I chose my position, and waited and watched, with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> white cross that rose over Mrs. Fairlie's grave.|$|E
60|$|He fixed a {{time for}} me to call again upon him the next day, when Mrs. O'Kelly would be away from home. He {{instructed}} me to walk quietly up and down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite side of <b>the</b> road with <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attic window, and not to come across unless he waved a handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|No such item of news met <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> Joyously I rose to go, when <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Standard.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{ends with}} Datak taking his place on town's council, and Nolan realizing that Stahma {{is the more}} {{dangerous}} of the two. The last scene contains an allusion {{to the character of}} Madame Defarge in A Tale of Two Cities: as Stahma sits outside the door to the council chamber knitting, Nolan tells her [...] "I had <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong snake. You are the dangerous one." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had emerged}} by another door, {{and stood in}} the street for a little while, as if I really were a {{stranger}} upon earth: but the unceremonious pushing and hustling that I received, soon recalled me to myself, and put me in the road back to the hotel; whither I went, revolving the glorious vision all the way; and where, after some porter and oysters, I sat revolving it still, at past one o'clock, with <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coffee-room fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's exactly it!" [...] said Mr. Burke. [...] "'Twas pretty near midnight when {{we started}} off to run along the forty-eighth parallel, but I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> man at the wheel and on the compass, and I {{let them know that}} that ship was under the command of an able-bodied seaman who knew what he was about, and if they skipped to one side of that line or to the other he would find it out in no time.|$|E
60|$|I had, but my feet seemed {{glued to}} the floor and <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> swaying crowd, so that it cost me an effort to tear them free and follow Boone and Haldane into the open air. He {{presently}} led us into the grateful coolness of a big basement saloon, and, scarcely drawing breath, I emptied the contents of a tumbler filled with iced liquid, and then I looked at Boone, who had pushed aside the glass set before him and reached for the ice bowl.|$|E
60|$|I {{was afraid}} to trust myself {{to look at her}} yet, and I kept <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> view.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't quite sich a fool as that, lad, {{even though}} I did advise 'em to go. I kept <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gang, however, an' was {{hidden in the}} horn-works when they made the final plans. Those who {{had been left behind}} seemed to be frightened, an' I reckon there'll be less show of mutiny in this 'ere fort to-morrow mornin' than we've seen in the past four an' twenty hours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Meanwhile I {{was walking}} backward, keeping <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lioness, who was {{creeping}} forward {{on her belly}} without a sound, but lashing her tail and keeping her <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> me; and in it I {{saw that she was}} coming in a few seconds more. I dashed my wrist and the palm of my hand against the brass rim of the cartridge till the blood poured from them--look, there are the scars of it to this day!" ...|$|R
