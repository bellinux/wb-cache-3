25|$|Electron lenses are {{designed}} {{to act in a}} manner emulating that of an optical lens, by focusing parallel electrons at some constant focal distance. Electron lenses may operate electrostatically or magnetically. The majority of electron lenses for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. Electron lenses are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy. These are selected for their magnetic properties, such as magnetic saturation, hysteresis and permeability.|$|E
25|$|Manipulation of the {{electron}} beam is performed using two physical effects. The interaction of electrons with a magnetic field will cause electrons to move according to the left hand rule, thus allowing for electromagnets to manipulate {{the electron}} beam. The use of magnetic fields allows {{for the formation of}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> of variable focusing power, the lens shape originating due to the distribution of magnetic flux. Additionally, electrostatic fields can cause the electrons to be deflected through a constant angle. Coupling of two deflections in opposing directions with a small intermediate gap allows for the formation of a shift in the beam path, this being used in TEM for beam shifting, subsequently this is extremely important to STEM. From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the beam path is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the beam path can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid electrical switching, the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.|$|E

50|$|Both {{electrostatic}} and <b>magnetic</b> <b>lenses</b> may be used. However, electrostatic lenses {{have more}} aberrations {{and so are}} not used for fine focusing. There is no current mechanism to make achromatic electron beam lenses, so extremely narrow dispersions of the electron beam energy are needed for finest focusing.|$|R

50|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} several electromagnets {{arranged in a}} quadrupole (see quadrupole magnet), sextupole, or higher format; the electromagnetic coils are placed at the vertices of a square or another regular polygon.

50|$|A <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> is {{a device}} for the {{focusing}} or deflection of moving charged particles, such as electrons or ions, {{by use of}} the magnetic Lorentz force.

50|$|The {{focusing}} {{effect of}} a rotationally symmetrical magnetic field on the trajectory of electrons {{is the result of}} the complicated influence of a magnetic field on a moving electron. This effect is a force proportional to the induction B of the field and electron velocity v. The vector product of the radial component of induction Br and axial component of velocity va is a force perpendicular to those vectors, causing the electron to move around the axis. Additional effect of this motion in the same magnetic field is another force F oriented radially to the axis, which is responsible for the focusing effect of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens.</b> The resulting trajectory of electrons in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> is a curve similar to a helix. In this context it should be mentioned that variations of focal length (exciting current) cause a slight rotation of the beam cross-section.|$|E

40|$|Electron vortex beams {{carrying}} intrinsic orbital {{angular momentum}} (OAM) are produced in electron microscopes where they are controlled and focused using <b>magnetic</b> <b>lenses.</b> We observe various rotational phenomena arising from {{the interaction between the}} OAM and <b>magnetic</b> <b>lenses.</b> First, the Zeeman coupling, proportional to the OAM and magnetic field strength, produces an OAM-independent Larmor rotation of a mode superposition inside the lens. Second, hen passing through the focal plane, the electron beam acquires an additional Gouy phase dependent on the absolute value of the OAM. This brings about the Gouy rotation of the superposition image proportional to the sign of the OAM. A combination of the Larmor and Gouy effects can result in the addition (or subtraction) of rotations, depending on the OAM sign. This behaviour is unique to electron vortex beams and has no optical counterpart, as Larmor rotation occurs only for charged particles. Our experimental results are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Instead of an {{electrostatic}} field {{we can also}} use a magnetic field to focus charged particles. The Lorentz force acting on the electron is perpendicular to both the direction of motion, and to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field (vxB). A homogeneous field deflects charged particles, but does not focus them. The simplest <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> is a donut-shaped coil through which the beam passes, preferably along the axis of the coil. To generate the magnetic field an electric current is passed through the coil. The magnetic field is strongest in the plane of the coil, and gets weaker as we move away from it. In the plane of the coil, the field gets stronger as we move away from the axis. Thus, a charged particle further from the axis experiences a stronger Lorentz force than a particle closer to the axis (assuming that they have the same velocity). This gives rise to the focusing action. Unlike the paths in an electrostatic lens, the paths in a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> contain a spiraling component, i.e. the charged particles spiral around the optical axis. As a consequence, the image formed by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> is rotated relative to the object. This rotation is absent for an electrostatic lens. The spatial extent of the magnetic field can be controlled by using an iron (or other magnetically soft material) magnetic circuit. This makes it possible to design and build more compact magnetic lenses with well defined optical properties. The vast majority of electron microscopes in use today use magnetic lenses due to their superior imaging properties, and the absence of the high voltages that are required for electrostatic lenses.|$|E

(2) Power density (focusing of the beam) - The {{power density}} {{at the spot}} of {{incidence}} of the beam with the workpiece depends on factors like {{the size of the}} electron source on the cathode, the optical quality of the accelerating electric lens and the focusing <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens,</b> alignment of the beam, the value of the accelerating voltage, and the focal length.

50|$|In {{a typical}} RHEED setup, one {{magnetic}} and one electric field focus the incident beam of electrons.

An adjustable <b>magnetic</b> <b>lens</b> focuses the electrons onto the sample surface after they pass through the anode. A typical RHEED source has a focal length around 50 cm.
