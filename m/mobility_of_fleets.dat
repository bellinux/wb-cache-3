By the time of the writing of his official report on the same subject at the end of March 1873, however, the supply had ‘diminished’ indicating the rapidity with which beds were exploited and abandoned. Several boats moved elsewhere, some to the west of Nickol Bay or further still to Exmouth Gulf, and others east to Condon or to Peedamurra near Port Hedland. A few went much further. Eventually the centre of activity drifted away from Nickol Bay and its Cossack and from other centres such as Condon, Bannangarra (on Pardoo Station) on to Roebuck Bay, where modern day, Broome is situated.|$|R
40|$|Relations between coastal {{countries}} and fishing fleets from non-adjacent countries changed radically in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. This {{was primarily a}} consequence of the declaration of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) by many coastal states in the years leading up to the close of the negotiations of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982. Most significantly, by recognizing the right of coastal states to determine how their waters were to be exploited, the UNCLOS provided a legal basis and economic motivation for the negotiation of access agreements between coastal states and distant water fishing fleets. This paper examines some of the economic issues which arise out of such agreements, particularly as they relate to relations between relatively poor coastal states and fishing fleets from richer non-adjacent countries. Using Senegal-EU agreements as a case study it examines the economics of the agreements {{from the perspective of the}} coastal country. Factors related to the characteristics of the distant water fleet (ie, relative discard rates, fleet infractions, changes in fleet efficiency, and the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fleet)</b> and the characteristics of the coastal country (ie, public debt and discount rates, capital constraints, access to overseas markets, and national political considerations) are examined in order to cast light on the incentives for signing the agreements.

40|$|During the 16 th century, {{while the}} Portuguese Crown was concentrating {{its best efforts}} on {{exploring}} the Cape sea route ("The India Run"), {{as well as the}} far-eastern circuits, from Lisbon, commercial shipping agents from other Portuguese seaports sought alternative outlets for their business. It was due to the existence of ports such as Oporto, Viana do Castelo, Vila do Conde, etc., long considered to be minor, that the Portuguese Kingdom was able to make its definitive contribution to the formation of the first Atlantic system. The present essay follows a tendency in modern historiography and pays attention to one particular case: that of the evolution of the city of Oporto, the building and organization of its seaport, its inclusion in an international port system, the <b>mobility</b> <b>of</b> its merchant <b>fleet</b> and the extent of their enterprise.

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the {{relation}} between entrepreneurship and different aspects <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> and provides a basis for further studies. To date the entrepreneurship field has focused little on the role <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> and the studies that do, have predominantly focused on labour mobility. We argue that entrepreneurship and mobility are intertwined and that limiting the concept <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> to labour mobility limits {{our view of the}} entrepreneurial process. The study is based on a literature review and interviews with established entrepreneurship scholars. We aim at widening the concept <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> and we discuss what aspects <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> could be relevant to entrepreneurship and we discuss how these aspects can be explored further. We build our analysis on two cornerstones. Firstly, a general framework of entrepreneurshipbased on known established scholarly work. In this study we view entrepreneurship as creative organising where the entrepreneur interacts with and depends on other people and organizations. Moreover, entrepreneurship is a process. The entrepreneurship process involves; idea generation and development, opportunity identification/creation and resource allocation in a network context. Knowledge is a central part of the entrepreneurial work and we discuss the distinctions between explicit and tacit knowledge and how they relate to mobility. The other cornerstone in our analysis is a reassessment of the limited previous research that has focused on mobility in association with entrepreneurship. We derive relevant aspects <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> through a discussion about how the term mobility has been used and what implicit and explicit assumptions about mobility that are made in the literature. From previous research and our framework we discuss and propose eight aspects <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> in relation to entrepreneurship: <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> people; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> knowledge; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> ideas; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> opportunities; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> resources; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> social relations/networks or Social mobility; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure; <b>Mobility</b> <b>of</b> organisations...|$|R
