5000|$|The Mark 17 and Mark 24 {{were the}} first mass-produced {{hydrogen}} bombs deployed by the United States. The two differed in their [...] "primary" [...] stages. The MK 17/24 bombs were 24 ft long, 61.4 in diameter. They weighed 21 tons. The Mark 17 had a yield {{in the range of}} 15 to 20 <b>megatons</b> TNT <b>equivalent.</b> Total production of Mk 17s was 200, and there were 105 Mk 24s produced, all between October 1954 and November 1955.|$|R
50|$|Most Americans {{have studied}} metric units at school. While {{there are many}} {{customary}} units for properties measured {{in the distant past}} such as length, weight, time, and capacity, multiples and submultiples of 10 are used with more recent units such as kilovolts, megabytes, megapixels, and kilotons and <b>megatons</b> of TNT <b>equivalent</b> of nuclear explosions.|$|R
40|$|The {{explosion}} over Tunguska, Central Siberia, in 1908 released 10 to 20 <b>megatons</b> (high explosive <b>equivalent)</b> {{of energy}} {{at an altitude}} of about 10 km. This event represents a typical fate for stony asteroids tens of meters in radius entering the Earth's atmosphere at common hypersonic velocities. Comets and carbonaceous asteroids of the appropriate energy disrupt too high, whereas typical iron objects reach and crater the terrestrial surface...|$|R
5000|$|The {{publication}} of the shape model and of astrometry based on radar observations obtained in 1999, 2005, and 2011, made possible an improved estimate of the Yarkovsky acceleration and a revised assessment of the impact probability. The [...] best estimate of the impact probability is a cumulative probability of 0.037% in the interval 2175 to 2196. This corresponds to a cumulative score on the Palermo scale of −1.71. If an impact were to occur, the expected kinetic energy associated with the collision would be 1200 <b>megatons</b> in TNT <b>equivalent.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the surprising result. Of bombs and storms A quick search turned up nine sites that refer to the power or energy of a hurricane. Of these, five state that a single hurricane {{over the course of}} one day releases an amount of energy equivalent to 400 bombs. (A sixth states that this amount of energy is released in one minute. Presumably, this is a misquotation of another source.) As one <b>megaton</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to joules; the quoted power amounts to about 4 x watts. Only one of these five sites quotes a source a popular book on hurricanes (Lee 1993). The sites range from the Web page of a high-school science teacher to the home page of {{a former director of the}} US National Hurricane Center. Two further sites, one from a small college and the other from an advanced placement high-school physics course, quote a power output of 2 x watts, but do not give source...|$|R
50|$|This {{presented}} {{a serious problem}} for the Air Force. While still pressing for development of newer bombers, like the supersonic B-70, it appeared the countervalue role was served by the Navy's UGM-27 Polaris. Polaris had enough range that the submarines could roam open areas of the ocean, and would be essentially invulnerable to attack {{no matter how many}} missiles the Soviets had, or how accurate they were. Based on the same 400 <b>equivalent</b> <b>megatons</b> calculation, they set about building a fleet of 41 submarines carrying 16 missiles each, giving the Navy a finite deterrent that was unassailable.|$|R
50|$|A {{solar flare}} is a sudden flash of {{brightness}} observed over the Sun's surface or the solar limb, which is {{interpreted as an}} energy release of up to 6 × 1025 joules of energy (about a sixth of the total Sun's energy output each second or 160 billion <b>megatons</b> of TNT <b>equivalent,</b> over 25,000 times more energy than released from the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter). They may {{be followed by a}} coronal mass ejection. The flare ejects clouds of electrons, ions and atoms through the corona into space. These clouds typically reach Earth a day or two after the event. Similar phenomena in other stars are known as stellar flares.|$|R
50|$|The Tsar Bomba (Царь-бомба) was the largest, most {{powerful}} nuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a three-stage hydrogen bomb with a yield of about 50 <b>megatons.</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to {{ten times the}} amount of all the explosives used in World War II combined. It was detonated on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, and was capable of approximately 100 megatons, but was purposely reduced shortly before the launch. Although weaponized, it was not entered into service; it was simply a demonstrative testing of the capabilities of the Soviet Union's military technology at that time. The heat of the explosion was estimated to potentially inflict third degree burns at 100 km distance of clear air.|$|R
50|$|The Tsar Bomba was a three-stage bomb with Trutnev-Babaev {{second and}} third stage design, with a yield of 50 <b>megatons.</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to about 1,570 times the {{combined}} energy of the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 10 times the combined energy of all the conventional explosives used in World War II, one-quarter of the estimated yield of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, and 10% of the combined yield of all nuclear tests to date. A three-stage H-bomb uses a fission bomb primary to compress a thermonuclear secondary, as in most H-bombs, and then uses energy from the resulting explosion to compress a much larger additional thermonuclear stage. There {{is evidence that the}} Tsar Bomba had several third stages rather than a single very large one.|$|R
50|$|The {{larger in}} size an {{asteroid}} or other near-Earth object (NEO), the less frequently it impacts the planet's atmosphere — large meteors {{seen in the}} skies are extremely rare, while medium-sized ones are less so, and much smaller ones are more commonplace. Although stony asteroids often explode high in the atmosphere, some objects, especially iron-nickel meteors and other types descending at a steep angle, can explode close to ground level or even directly impact onto land or sea. In the U.S. State of Arizona, the 1200 m-wide Meteor Crater (officially named Barringer Crater) formed in {{a fraction of a}} second as nearly 160 million tonnes of limestone and bedrock were uplifted, creating its crater rim on formerly flat terrain. The asteroid that produced the Barringer Crater was only about 46 meters (150 ft.) in size; however it impacted the ground at a velocity of 12.8 kilometers per second (28,600 mph) and struck with an impact energy equivalent to a 10 <b>megaton</b> (TNT <b>equivalent)</b> nuclear bomb — about 625 times greater than the bomb that destroyed the city of Hiroshima during the Second World War. Tsunamis can also occur after a medium-sized or larger asteroid impacts an ocean surface or other large body of water.|$|R
2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, LeMay clashed {{again with}} U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Defense Secretary McNamara, arguing {{that he should}} be allowed to bomb nuclear missile sites in Cuba. He opposed the naval {{blockade}} and, {{after the end of the}} crisis, suggested that Cuba be invaded anyway, even after the Soviets agreed to withdraw their missiles. Kennedy secretly agreed to remove US missiles from Turkey and Italy. Unknown to the US, the Soviet field commanders in Cuba had been given authority to launch nuclear weapons under their controlthe only time such authority was delegated by higher command. They had at least 20 nuclear warheads for medium-range R-12 Dvina (NATO Code SS-4 Sandal) ballistic missiles capable of reaching US cities (including Washington DC), each carrying a one <b>megaton</b> warhead (<b>equivalent</b> to 50 Hiroshima bombs), and nine tactical nuclear missiles. [...] A Soviet submarine flotilla in the area commanded by Kapitan (later Vice Admiral) Vasili Arkhipov had nuclear torpedoes. [...] Because a US Navy surface flotilla was harassing the Soviet submarines with small depth charges, both the flagship's captain and its Zampolit, believing that war had started, voted to launch their nukes. [...] But Captain Arkhipov, a veteran of the K-19 disaster, voted to wait and see, thus averting World War III. If the Soviet officers on land and at sea had chosen to launch, many millions of US citizens could have been killed. The ensuing SAC retaliatory thermonuclear strike would have killed roughly one hundred million Soviet citizens. Kennedy refused LeMay's requests, and the naval blockade was successful.|$|R
5000|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by the Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission on the economic circumstances of China's crude oil and chemical industry as of 2007, in recent years China has wasted an average of 400 <b>megatons</b> of coal <b>equivalents</b> per year. In 2006, China consumed a total of 2.46 gigatons coal equivalents, up from 1.4 gigatons of coal equivalents consumed nationwide in 2000. With energy consumption increasing at the rate of 10%/year, in the last 5 years total energy consumption has exceeded the combined amount of energy consumption over the previous 20 years. According to Dai Yande, the chairman of the Energy Research Institute of the NDRC, while continued high consumption of energy is unavoidable, China must take steps to change the form of its economic growth and increase substantially the energy efficiency of Chinese industry and society generally. Among other things China should find new points of economic development that moves China away from being the [...] "World's Factory" [...] and improves energy efficiency. China also must avoid unnecessary waste, foster a sustainable economy and encourage renewable energy sources to reduce China's reliance on petrochemical energy resources.|$|R
40|$|A key {{consideration}} {{for development of}} energy and climate policy affecting the forestry and agricultural sectors is that the selection of specific mechanisms implemented to achieve bioenergy production and/or greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation targets may have substantial effects on landowner incentives to adopt alternative practices. For instance, the prices of allowances and offsets are expected to diverge under some policies being considered {{where there is a}} binding cap on the quantity of offsets from the agricultural and forest sectors. In addition, provisions that limit or exclude specific practices from receiving carbon payments will affect the quantity and cost of GHG mitigation opportunities available. In this study, the recently updated Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model with GHGs (FASOMGHG) was used to estimate GHG mitigation potential for private land in the contiguous U. S. under a variety of GHG price policies. Model scenarios suggest that U. S. forestry and agriculture could provide mitigation of 200 – 1000 <b>megatons</b> carbon dioxide <b>equivalent</b> per year (Mt CO 2 e/year) at carbon prices of $ 15 to $ 50 /tCO 2 e. Binding limits on offsets have increasingly large effects on both the total magnitude and distribution of GHG mitigation across options over time. In addition, discounting or excluding payments for forest sinks can reduce annualized land-based mitigation potential 37 - 90 percen...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} major {{mechanisms}} proposed to cause extinctions at the Cretaceous-Tertiary geological boundary following an asteroid impact. We then discuss how the proposed extinction {{may relate to}} the impact of asteroids or comets in general. We discuss the limitations of these mechanisms in terms of the spatial scale that may be affected, and the time scale over which the effects may last. Our goal is to provide relatively simple prescriptions for evaluating the importance of colliding objects having a range of energies and compositions. We also identify the many uncertainties concerning the environmental effects of impacts. We conclude that, for impact energies below about 10 (exp 4) Mts (<b>megatons</b> of TNT <b>equivalent)</b> - i. e., impact frequencies less than in 6 x 10 (exp 4) yr, corresponding to comets and asteroids with diameters smaller than about 400 m and 650 m, respectively - blast damage, earthquakes, and fires should be important on a scale of 10 (exp 4) or 10 (exp 5) km (exp 2), which corresponds to the area damaged in many natural disasters of recent history. However, tsunami could be more damaging, flooding a kilometer of coastal plane over entire ocean basins. In the energy range of 10 (exp 4) to 10 (exp 5) Mts (intervals up to 3 x 10 (exp 5) yr; comets and asteroids with sizes up to 800 m and 1. 5 km, respectively) water vapor injections and ozone loss become significant on the global scale. In the submicrometer dust injection fraction from the pulverized target material is much higher than is presently thought to be most likely, then dust injection could be important in this energy range...|$|R
