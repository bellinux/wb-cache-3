40|$|The {{trustworthiness}} {{of business}} services is widely recognised {{as a critical}} factor {{for the success of}} an organization. Businesses are increasing in complexity and unpredictability, while demand for accountability, as well as regulatory compliance is becoming mandatory. Yet, some reports indicate that the level of fraud within an organization is far from decreasing. Thus, a structured approach to Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) has become a high priority goal for many organizations. GRC solutions enable organizations to address various business challenges related to risk management and regulatory compliance. For example, GRC solutions provide end-to-end control management, deployment of controls through risk-based approaches and automatic <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> across different entities and applications. Furthermore, GRC solutions enable standardization of methodologies, vocabulary and measurements across an organization, therefore facilitating the detection of risks, the prioritization of corrective actions and so the enforcement of compliance...|$|E
40|$|A {{statement}} of record {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an abstract that begins "Under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund program, parties responsible for pollution bear the cost of cleaning it up. However, these parties sometimes no longer exist, leaving the problem for others, typically the federal government, to address. Furthermore, many sites' cleanup remedies leave some waste in place, relying on institutional controls [...] legal or administrative restrictions on land or water use [...] to limit the public's exposure. GAO was asked to summarize the findings of its August 2005 report, Environmental Liabilities: EPA Should Do More to Ensure that Liable Parties Meet Their Cleanup Obligations (GAO- 05 - 658) and its January 2005 report, Hazardous Waste Sites: Improved Effectiveness of Controls at Sites Could Better Protect the Public (GAO- 05 - 163). GAO's statement addresses the actions EPA could take to better ensure that parties meet their cleanup obligations and the long-term effectiveness of institutional controls in protecting the public. GAO's reports recommended, among other things, that EPA (1) implement a financial assurance mandate for businesses handling hazardous substances; (2) enhance its oversight and enforcement of existing financial assurances and authorities; (3) ensure that the frequency and scope of <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> sufficiently maintain their effectiveness; and (4) ensure that information on controls reported in new tracking systems accurately reflects actual conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{immunohistochemistry}} (IHC) {{techniques are}} not yet fully standardized. In this project, a standardization method was developed and tested for proficiency testing (PT) in external quality assurance (EQA) and quality control (QC) in clinical IHC laboratories. The breast cancer markers estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER 2) were used as a model system. Digital image analysis (IA) was {{used in conjunction with}} new calibrated and standardized cell line microarrays (CLMA). CLMAs built from nine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer cell lines were used for both QC controls and PT samples, instead of traditionally used FFPE tissues, in the standardization of breast cancer IHC. IA was used for measurement of IHC results, and compared to evaluation by the traditional expert-assessment method. Laboratory Score: Reference Score Ratio (LSRSR) was derived from Histo-Scores (HScores) determined by IA. HScores and LSRSRs were examined statistically and evaluated as histograms and boxplots to summarize and rank participant laboratory EQA results, in comparison to a reference sample or reference laboratories in two consecutive Canada-wide EQA runs. LSRSR-derived reference ranges were highly sensitive in evaluating laboratory EQA performance in PT as well as for <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> for QC. Laboratory on-slide tissue and cell-line IHC QA controls were assessed using IA and Levey Jennings QC charts. These charts were determined to be an excellent way to observe trending in laboratory IHC staining over time, particularly when cell line controls were used. This approach also reduced the time and labor costs for PT evaluation. 	 Overall, cell line calibration controls were functionally equivalent or better than tissue-based controls in QC and PT mainly because of cell line biological homogeneity and sample availability. This study identified an optimal design for preparation of IHC cell line controls and PT samples for breast cancer markers. Optimal, intermediate staining cell line IHC controls were identified for all three breast cancer markers. Using IA with LSRSR and cell line samples is recommended for standardization of IHC methodology. This approach advances QA for diagnostic IHC and when implemented will improve patient car...|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{performance}} <b>of</b> controllers and <b>control</b> loops {{is crucial}} for process economy, quality and safety in chemical plants. Industrial statistics show that often {{a significant percentage of}} them are performing sub-optimally at any given time. Effective realtime <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> loops is a difficult task as there may be dozens <b>of</b> loops to <b>monitor</b> in a typical process. In addition, abnormal or suboptimal performance is often not apparent under cursory inspection. Hence, automated approaches for the realtime <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> loop performance is of considerable interest. In this paper. we propose an automated qualitative shape analysis (QSA) formalism for detecting and diagnosing different kinds <b>of</b> oscillations in <b>control</b> loops.

The analysis algorithms are adapted to the non-uniform sampling that is widely spread in building automation.
