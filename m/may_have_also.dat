5|$|Henry and his {{new wife}} did not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E
5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. That is to say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E

5|$|Most {{accounts}} {{declare that}} Kanhopatra {{was forced into}} the courtesan's life, though she detested it, while some say that Kanhopatra firmly declined to become a courtesan. Some authors believe that she <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> worked as a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|The castle <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> {{been added}} {{as a result}} of the {{contribution}} made to the club by players of Old Castle Swifts, or even the adoption (in 1904) of Boleyn Castle FC as their reserve side when they took over their grounds on the site.|$|E
5|$|The chronicler {{known as}} Florence of Worcester {{incorporated}} parts of Asser's Life into his chronicle, {{in the early}} 12th century; again, he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> used the Cotton manuscript.|$|E

5|$|Although the Earth is {{the only}} body within the solar system known to support life, {{evidence}} suggests that {{in the distant past}} the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface. For a brief period in Mars' history, it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.|$|E
5|$|Amanda E. Clement (March 20, 1888 – July 20, 1971) was {{the first}} woman paid to umpire a {{baseball}} game, and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been the first woman to referee a high school basketball game. Clement served as an umpire on a regular basis for six years, and served occasionally for several decades afterwards. An accomplished athlete in multiple disciplines, Clement competed in baseball, basketball, track, gymnastics, and tennis, and has been attributed world records in shot put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

It was eventually featured as the fourth track on Mayhem. American record producer Tony Visconti became {{a fan of the}} song soon after its release and forwarded the song to former Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed who then invited May to fly to New York City to specifically rerecord the song. <b>May</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> admitted that she found it strange to work with a musician as iconic as Reed stating that [...] ""It was weird asking, 'Would you mind doing that line again, Mr Reed, please?'. And he was like, 'Sure! It's your song!'" [...] <b>May</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> said that in-studio she and Reed [...] "got on like a house on fire." ...|$|R
50|$|Corey Lemard Mays (born November 27, 1983, in Chicago, in the U.S. {{state of}} Illinois) {{is a former}} American {{football}} linebacker.

5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless {{to focus on the}} display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, but they do not explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{flesh of}} the victims <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been sold as medicine. As an {{official}} punishment, death by slicing <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> involved slicing the bones, cremation, and scattering of the deceased's ashes.|$|R

25|$|Gaulish had six {{or seven}} cases. Like Latin, Gaulish had nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, and dative cases; however, while Latin had an ablative, Gaulish had an {{instrumental}} and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> a locative case. Greater epigraphical evidence attests common cases (nominative and accusative) and common stems (-o- and -a- stems) than for cases less frequently used in inscriptions or rarer -i-, -n- and -r- stems. The following table summarises the reconstructed endings.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According to Dean, Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that Michael Jackson earned about $750 million in his lifetime. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including {{his share of the}} Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket is difficult because one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.|$|E

50|$|The local parish church, {{built on}} the highest point in the settlement, dominates its {{landscape}} and appears in the municipal coat of arms. It is dedicated to Saint Urban and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It dates to the 16th century with 18th-century adaptations. The feast day of Saint Urban, 25 <b>May,</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been chosen as the official municipal holiday.|$|R

5|$|Shortly afterwards, around 5 p.m., Wick's Bf 109 E-4 (Werknummer 5344 — factory number) {{was shot}} down, {{probably}} by twelve–victory ace Flight Lieutenant John Dundas of No. 609 Squadron, {{though it is}} also possible that Wick fell victim to Pilot Officer Eric Marrs; Polish pilot Zygmunt Klein of 234 Squadron <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> scored hits on Wick's aircraft; he was also shot down and killed during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Siti Akbari {{was written}} by Lie Kim Hok, a Bogor-born peranakan Chinese who was taught by Dutch missionaries. The missionaries {{introduced}} him to European literature, including the works of Dutch writers such as Anna Louisa Geertruida Bosboom-Toussaint and Jacob van Lennep, as well as works by French authors like Jules Verne, Alexandre Dumas, and Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail. In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B. Benitez suggests that Lie <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been influenced by Malay and Javanese oral traditions, such as the travelling bangsawan theatrical troupes or wayang puppets.|$|E
5|$|The {{well-developed}} compound {{eyes were}} stalked. The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp make it very likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his TV and film work, <b>Mays</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> starred in six stage plays at London's Royal Court Theatre. The productions have included Ladybird, Motortown, The Winterling and Scarborough. Simon Stephens wrote the lead role of Danny in Motortown with Mays in mind. He {{went on to win}} critical acclaim for his performance, but the hard-hitting play was too much for some audience members and walkouts were not uncommon.|$|R
