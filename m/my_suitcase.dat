50|$|April 1, 2012 - Notes by Dale Rhoades (owner Des Moines Strength Institute)A {{key element}} of this lift is balance. The lifter should stare at the weight once {{shouldered}} and while the arm moves to a locked position overhead. In reality, the lifter bends his body and shoulder away from the weight, bending the opposite leg to help lower the shoulder away from the weight. The whole arm that holds the weight sort of rests on the lifter's back on that side. The opposite arm is held straight out for balance as well. Although most of the lockout is achieved by bending away from the weight, some pressing of the arm is also employed. The only real danger I ever found in this lift was dropping it on things if balance was lost (once on <b>my</b> mother's <b>suitcase).</b> A lifter can easily {{move away from the}} weight if it falls. In the 1963, as a 16-year-old, I could do 165 weighing 160 and in 1972, I did 200 weighing 198. When I was in my 50's, upon doing this lift again, I discovered extreme shoulder flexibility is required and could only do 100lbs. x 10 reps. Without good shoulder flexibility, a tear could occur. Dumbbells of the same weight are harder to control than a long bar as the longer bar will turn or rotate much slower while being moved.|$|R

40|$|If {{we think}} of America simply as a land of {{migration}} and settlement, we are missing the broader picture, the one Joseph Urgo draws so clearly. Urgo analyzes more than a westward movement of settlers, concentrating instead on the concepts of the movement of ideas and cultures between a variety of old worlds and. new, and making the point that Willa Cather 2 ̆ 2 is a comprehensive resource for the demarcation of an empire of migration in U. S. culture. 2 ̆ 2 As he explains, his interest in Cather 2 ̆ 7 s work lies in 2 ̆ 2 the aesthetics of migration. 2 ̆ 2 Willa Cather certainly knew migration, from her move to Nebraska from Virginia as a child to her continuous travel as an adult. Focusing on her novels, Urgo shows how Cather 2 ̆ 7 s representation of American culture {{is based on the}} perpetration of movement and impermanence-physically, intellectually, and temporally. Drawing from O Pioneers! through Sapphira and the Slave Girl, Urgo analyzes Cather 2 ̆ 7 s use of migration and her awareness that life continually brings us to crossroads. Some of these conclusions would seem selfevident- certainly the Shimerda family, Claude Wheeler, Father Latour, and Euclide Auclair come to mind. While Cather establishes the act of physical migration with these characters, she also develops the sense of cultural migration-how ideas pass between characters, leaving influence on the culture around them. Urgo 2 ̆ 7 s approach to interpreting Cather in this way keeps the reader asking what place and home and history really meant to these characters. The strength of Urgo 2 ̆ 7 s work is not only the depth of his explication of Cather 2 ̆ 7 s use of migration in her novels, moving far beyond a simple literary context, but the extent to which he establishes cultural context, citing sources as varied as Salman Rushdie and Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz. Urgo allows those of us who think that we know a bit about Cather to re-think her treatment of movement, home, and culture in her novels. Chapter one opens with this Cather quote: 2 ̆ 2 I keep <b>my</b> own <b>suitcases</b> under the bed. 2 ̆ 2 Debunking the myth of an American homeland, Urgo accurately concludes that Cather has encapsulated not only a statement of personal migration, but also that of our transitory culture...|$|R

They were dispersed all over the island, mosques and churches can still be found side by side and members of one community worked in the business of the other. Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been living on the island of Cyprus for almost five centuries. Generally all their social habits, productions, consumptions, fears, happiness, enjoyment ways, and sadness have always been the same. Being different, their religions and languages couldn‘t obstruct this; they‘ve shared the same faith. Although getting cross with each other in the past, the commonality of even the sorrow they felt is a proof that these communities possess a resolution culture, and not a conflict one!In this study, the aim of resolution, instead of positive phenomenon will be reached via a negative phenomenon as a result of conflict.

40|$|Translation begins] Hotel Albert Selma, Ala., March 15, 1945 My darling husband, One day {{has gone}} by {{and it was}} a day wasted. Any day that I don’t see you is. Just woke up a few seconds ago, sweetheart. It was awful to sleep along without you, honey. One good thing was that I was so tired hat I went right to sleep + slept until around nine almost without waking up. Gee, darling, {{marriage}} sure {{can make a difference in}} a person’s life. I feel so sorry for all my friends who aren’t’ married. The poor girls- oh, well, they don’t know what they’re missing so that probably is all right. Everyone was so right who told me about you’ll wonder how you ever lived before without it. It seems as though we’d always been married. It really amazes me now more than ever how girls can marry someone they don’t really love. Julie + I were talking about that last night. If I wasn’t madly in love with you it would make me hate you more to even touch me. I just can’t see how they ever could. Marriage is the most wonderful think in the world when you’re in love. And I sure am in love with you. Being away from you is so awful. Part of me just isn’t- (this is the worst pen). Golly, darling, I hope the 31 st hurries and gets here. Golly, what a marriage. We’ve only been married less than a week and you’re miles away. They can’t do that to us. How do you like the field down there. It’s supposed to be awful from what I’ve heard. How do you like air gunnery. I suppose you do a lot. It’s miserable day today. Looks like it’s going to rain any minute. I’m so glad that we had such a beautiful day for you graduation + wedding. I wish that you had married me before you graduated- at Christmas. But I suppose it would have been awful because you never got open Post. It seems so long ago- Christmas I mean. Years and years- and it seems like eight million years since we were together. Gee, honey, I hope you’re at this post a good long time. Don’t get angry. I know you don’t but I like it here. Everyone has been so nice and besides the longer you’re here, the longer we can be together. Last night I slept in the top to your pajamas- slightly large but it was comfortable. Besides you wore them and it made me not so lonesome. I really should get up + get ready to go to Mrs. Moseley’s. I would rather write to you though. How I’ll ever get there with all this extra stuff will be a problem. <b>My</b> <b>suitcases</b> are packed real full and there’s still all the clothes in the closet to go. Oh, honey, I love you so. Being married to you is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. You’re so sweet and understanding and thoughtful and the most wonderful husband in the world. Lord, I’m lucky. Today I’ll be real good + write to mom. I just was too beat last night and too busy all day. I wish that the 31 st would hurry- Golly after we were married I never thought I’d be anxious for the days to hurry. After the 31 st though when we’re together again I hope they go so nice and slowly. Julie’s going to try to get some film for me but it won’t do much good until you fix the camera. She said she knew an officer who wanted to sell a car but can’t remember who it was. Maybe we can buy one. Julie wants me to go out to the Post + get my pass. I’m sorta afraid to go when you’re not here. It wouldn’t see right but I would like to see the bulletin board + try to get a house- I mean a room. Well, darling, I’d better get a bath + start packing- I love you so, honey. I miss you terribly. I love you more than I ever thought possible. Well, darling, here I am at Mrs. Moseley’s. It’s a nice clean place but holy cow if you breathe around here, it sounds like an A 9 - 6 taking off. Everyone is so darned quiet. We’d never be able to stay here. They’d probably throw us out at the first night. Well, I’ll look for a room tomorrow. I have to stay here a week + maybe at the end of that time something will turn up. It’s raining now I think. Golly, honey, I miss you so. Every time I say my husband- it sounds so nice. I wish you were here with me now. It’s thundering and we could be so comfortable here. The bed doesn’t squeak by the way. I hope that I can find someplace to live before this week is up because you’d go crazy here. We’d undoubtedly be requested to leave the way we carry on. Lord, in the middle of the night we get the maddest ideas- remember? Gee, honey, I wish I could tell you how very much I love you. It is so lonesome without you, honey- life just isn’t the same for me. These seventeen days shouldn’t take too long but I know every minute will seem like a thousand years. I love you so, Judd. I’m so happy honey, of course not as happy as I’d be if you were here- but you know what I mean. Everyone at the hotel is trying to find us a room, honey. I sure hope I can find one near to town for when you come back. Julie + Betty Jo + I will probably go to the movies tonight. Julie is so nice to me. She wouldn’t let me be alone at all. Afraid I’ll get lonesome but she’s no consolation. You’re all I need, baby + you’re all I’ll ever need. Without you my life just wouldn’t be anything. I couldn’t live without you, honey. What a difference marriage can make. I never thought I would ever be dependent upon one man for my happiness. It sure changes everything. Golly, I love you. Every minute we’re together makes me love you more + more. My husband- that sure sounds wonderful and you sure are- Golly, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so happy. You’re so wonderful, honey and I’m so proud to be your wife. I hope that one morning soon we’ll be able to lie in bed together + not have to get up a four or five so that I can just sit and look at you. You look so adorable when you’re asleep. I hope that you’re not working too hard + that the weather is nice down there. It would be horrible if it wasn’t and they made you stay down longer- what an awful thought. Do you miss me, honey? Golly, I miss you. Millions more than I ever did before. If these seventeen days don’t hurry I’ll be so lonesome that it will be almost dangerous for you to get back. I wish we could find a handcuff or something so that they could never make us apart. We just shouldn’t be separated darling. It’s funny, darling, ever since I first met you I’ve had that we were meant for each other feeling. As we sure were. Honey, would you mind awfully if something happened- that sounds queer but I mean if I did have a baby. I know that you’d hate to be tied down. If we were going to have one maybe it would be better if I didn’t tell you about it. I wouldn’t want you to worry or be unhappy. You know how I feel about it, honey, in case- But you know how I feel. I love you so, my darling. Being away from you is just like living in a sorta semi-existence. Life won’t be the same until you and I are together again. Then everything will be perfect + I’ll be so happy. Darling, I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you or show you. I’ll be trying to for the rest of our lives but it just can’t be done. Besides, my love for you keeps growing stronger every day. I was sure before we were married- when everyone said you’ll love each other more after you’re married that I couldn’t possible love you any more, but I do and every day I love you more. Honey, I’ll be so happy when we’re together again. Just walking down the street with you will be wonderful and being in your arms again will be heaven. Honey, I wish I could write the way I feel but I just can’t express it. You always say the sweetest things, Judd. I love you so. Golly, it’s pouring! Have to get some more ink- just a sec Oh, honey, I must remember to write to the paper. I can’t do anything- I’m much too much in love. That’s the understatement of the year. Golly, darling, you sure have changed me. How I love it, too. Julie is wrapping Tom’s glasses that he left at her house and we’ll probably mail them tonight + you can give them to Tom. I should go into town now + get some of the things that I’ve forgotten to. I can’t find my tooth brush. You must have it, honey. Do you? I’ll get one tonight anyway. Honey, I hope I’ll be a good wife. I can’t do a thing a wife is supposed to- can’t cook + don’t like to- can’t keep house + have no ambition to- can’t do much of anything but love you. That’s the only thing I like to do, too. I guess I’ll just have to devote all my time + energy to that. What a wonderful job. I have your pictures by my bed darling so that when I wake up every morning that’s the first thing I see. Honey, it sure was fate that brought us together. I’m so lucky darling to have you for my husband. I’ll be thankful for you for always. I can’t imagine what I ever would have done without you. Being your wife, darling, is so heavenly. Lord, I’m lucky- and so much in love. Don’t suppose that you’ll have any time to write will you, honey, but try to because I miss you so much and want to hear from you so. The hotel said they’d keep any mail that came for me. By the way, have you gotten any for me? Gee, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so completely in love with anyone. I was in love with you before we married but it was nothing compared to this. Every minute we’re together is wonderful. I’ll be so glad when we are together again. What a thing for the Army to do. Here we’ve practically just been married and what do they do- separate us. At a time like this, too. I tried to write a letter to mom + my mother but I just can’t. It’s just as thought they were here when we were together. I can‘t write to anyone but you. Told mom that you were going to air gunnery school. It’s awful, Judd. I could write to you all night but a page is the most I can write anyone else. Gee, honey, I’ll sure be glad when you’re back here again. Without you I’m completely lost. Like a fish out of water only worse. Golly, I love you so. I’ll be so happy to be with you again, honey. It’s going to be wonderful. That’s all I can think about- you. My darling, I miss you so. Golly, honey, you can’t imagine how much. Well sweetheart, I guess I’d better start going into Selma before all the stores close. Oh, I can eat now it’s amazing. Please try to write often darling, a letter from you would mean so much. I hope you don’t mind if I sleep in the tops of your pajamas but it makes me feel closer to you + not quite so lonesome. I love you so, darling. I’ll mail this now + will probably write when I get back from the movies. How long does it take for you to get my mail? I love you so honey. I miss you so much, darling. Til we’re together again. My darling, I love you + I’m always Yours, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R

Seventeen Magazine {{said of the}} album's composition, [...] " [...] In her first single, “All The Way Up,” she told us, “I like to keep <b>my</b> <b>suitcase</b> packed, cause I’m going far,” and that, she has! Emily has strayed away from her first EP, “All The Right Wrongs” indie vibe, giving her new eleven-song album a more pop-dance feel. The name [...] "Fight or Flight" [...] comes from, Emily’s own ambitions to fight through personal anxieties to achieve simultaneous success in two very competitive fields. The first single from Fight or Flight, “Let’s Be Friends,” showcases Emily’s ability to make a hit pop-rock song, without sounding manufactured or over-produced. The song has been a popular hit on radio airwaves across the U.S. Other songs likely to be hit singles are [...] "Lovesick," [...] "Truth or Dare," [...] and [...] "All The Boys Want." [...] She slows it down and shows off her vocal ability in [...] "Marisol" [...] and [...] "You Get Me Through." [...] "Right now/live out loud/gotta believe in something," [...] she says in her call-to-action song, [...] "Gotta Believe in Something." [...] If you're {{in the mood for}} a high energetic, fun, feel-good song, go right to [...] "Double Talk" [...] or [...] "Get Yer Yah-Yah’s Out." [...] Her song, [...] "1-800 Clap Your Hands (The Water Is Rising)" [...] goes psychedelic-funk while [...] "The Cycle" [...] takes you back to her first EP’s alternative-pop feel.|$|E
5000|$|Liebeault, Bernheim, and {{the school}} in Nancy {{believed}} that hypnosis {{was due to the}} physiological property in the brain of suggestibility. Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the [...] "idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it." [...] In Bernheim's Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions, he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis. Below is a description of one of his experiments on post-hypnotic suggestion."To one, I tell her during her sleep:—"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is on the night table {{and put it in the}} suitcase that is at the foot of your bed." [...] Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: [...] "Do you remember what I ordered you to do?" [...] She answers: [...] "Yes, I must put the glass in <b>my</b> <b>suitcase</b> Thursday morning, at eight o'clock."—"Have you thought about it since I told you?"—"No"—"Think hard."—"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock."—"Were you awake or asleep?"—"I was in a drowsy state." [...] (Bernheim, 1886a, pp. 109-110)"Bernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state.|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Well {{it finally}} happened. I’ve {{run out of}} ink- This will be a short letter honey, because I’m {{going to the movies}} in a second to see “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”. Sorry that I didn’t write {{yesterday}} but Charlotte cut school + was here all day until I went to Bobbies. Didn’t get home until quarter to eleven + so didn’t write. Nothing very interesting happened. Bobbies on the train going to New York now. Her train leaves at two. Golly, I wish I were going to leave today to see you- she’s not too excited. Guess she can’t believe it. Excuse the time elapsing. Just went to the movies or rather come back from there. Saw “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”. That was some picture. It sure made me realize there’s a war on. They should have more of the actual fighting pictures and some of the training films that the Army sees. It would make people think a lot more. But whenever they show things, the worst side of the war, all the bloody killing + wounded, people are so queer. They get the attitude of why waste our time with this. I can’t understand it. Lately they’ve been showing the pictures of the wounded men and every time someone is sure to ask why they bore “us” with this. More + more people are reacting that way. Can’t understand it. Woody wants me to come down tonight. I really don’t want to at all because I don’t feel like talking to anyone. But I’ve been postponing it for so long I guess I’ll have to. I’d much rather stay home and write you. Wait a sec. I’m going to look for some ink. Don’t know if this will work for long. My ink was all dried up + so I put some water on it. Hope it holds out til tomorrow. We’re having lousy weather again- now it’s raining today! Well, there’s one consolation about that – it washed a lot of the snow away. Last night was awful. It rained and froze as soon as it hit the ground- It was just like skating to move. We slid out of Bobbie’s house. You should have seen Daddy going down Bobbie’s steps. He just sat down and slid. Got a little damp but got down safely. Gee, darling, {{are you going to be}} able to live off the post? What’s this about you’re going to transition at Spence Field? Will you be going to transition? I thought we’d go right to Texas. Oh, not that it makes much difference. One place is just as good as the other as long as we can be together. But how long will the transition be? Will you be able to get any time off after we’re married for a honeymoon? Oh, where are we going if we go? Gee, honey, it’s not very much longer now. Wonder what it will be like to be married to a flier. Hope that you’ll be able to live with me wherever we are. Rex is licking my nose. Everything around here is always so calm and peaceful when I’m writing you. Daddy thinks that he can get a tube for my radio. Hope so. But you can sing to me. That reminds me, darling, how about it. You never did sing. I must do something about that. Happy George Washington’s Birthday. They’re playing “My Ideal”- you sure are! Ever since that first night we went out together I knew you were the only one for me. Oh, the King Cole trio is playing almost. Anyway he said they would. It’s the Ballrooms + you know those commercials – Oh, “It’s Only a Paper Moon”- Golly, that remind me of you so much. I miss you so, honey, whenever I hear songs that we heard together I get so lonesome. Songs mean so much. They bring back more memories than anything else. Was lying down but can’t write that way. There wasn’t any mail delivery. Holidays are awful. Do you miss letters as much as I do when they don’t come. This week went pretty fast. Not half fast enough though. Well, seventeen more days. Tomorrow it will only be sixteen and the next day fifteen and then two weeks- Golly, in a way time has gone real fast but in another way it seems years and years. Gee, darling, everyone keeps wanting to know if I’m excited but it doesn’t’ seem near and I’m not. But one reason is that you’re not here- whenever you call, I get excited and it seems more real. Now it’s more like a wonderful dream. Honey, how many announcements do you want printed? Can you make a list sometime? We have to order them soon- they’ll probably get them all ready except for your name. You’re such a problem- Lieutenant Wm. Judson Clark. That sounds real nice. You’re going to make a wonderful officer. Can hardly wait to see you in an officer’s uniform. I’ll bet you look sharp. You’re so handsome anyhow, honey. I’m so glad that your hair is curly. You look adorable when you wake up in the morning. When your hair is all curly and you’re half asleep. Oh, everytime they showed Van Johnson asleep it reminded me of you. He sleeps somewhat the same way you do. Except you look so much cuter than he does. Whether you’re asleep or awake. Know what? I love you. You’re without doubt the most wonderful man in the world, the best flier and if I keep this up, you’ll be the most conceited. But I love you so, honey. Gee, honey, will you have to study at night the way he did? I hope not. I wonder how often you’ll have to fly nights. What do they do to you in transition? What is that for? What do you learn? Will you fly twin engines there? Honey, I wish we were married and together now. It is so ling since the last time you were home. Golly, Christmas might be a thousand years ago. It certainly seems it. I just want to be with you again more than anything else in the world. Oh, that reminds me, Woody go a letter from Sweetie yesterday and he said he thought they were cutting his leave and that he probably wouldn’t be able to come up to see her in March. That’s getting out of it nicely but it certainly wouldn’t foo me- I don’t know how Woody could fall for his line. Guess because she wants to. It’s funny how people believe what they want to. If I were a what am I saying, if I were Woody or someone Steve had handed a lite to, I’m sure I’d see through it right away. Anyway I’ve always believed about ¼ of what a fellow says. That’s the safest way and the only practical thing I’ve ever done. Gee, honey, next time I see Bobbie I’ll be Mrs. Clark. You’ll be an officer, too. Wonder what Ace will be. Oh, honey, what will we do when you get a leave? Will we go home or what and if we do go home where will we stay. If we stay at either your house or my house where would we sleep? I was thinking about that. When you get a leave where would we go. I can think of more problems can’t I? Ricky is at the Nisar’s now. Last night they called Bobbie so that Ricky could say goodnight. She got so excited. It was the first time he talked over the phone. She was so cute. Yelling that she could hear him breathing. You’d think she’d left him there about ten months ago. Wonder where Bobbie is now. She’s on her way anyway. Wish we were. Bobbie shipped her big suitcase and had a rickety old one that was ready to give up + collapse any minute. Then she had a shoebox of sandwiches. Can’t you see her, all she needed was pigtails and a big ribbon. We’re going to be much worse. Mother doesn’t want me to ship the bag because she’s sure something will happen to them. Well, the three bags of mine, my hat box, a box with my wedding dress, another box with <b>my</b> veil, mother’s <b>suitcase,</b> Daddy’s suitcase, Mom’s suitcase, some stuff of yours that she’s bringing. Hilda’s suitcase and all of us are going to fit into a tiny drawing room for two people- that should be good- besides that we’re going to bring something to eat, too. How we’ll do it is beyond me- oh, well, that’s a minor detail. Gee, darling, I miss you so. I sure wish these seventeen days would hurry. Everyone says they will but they’re not getting married. How do you feel, honey, are you getting excited? Golly, you’ll be getting your wings and married on the same day. I hope you’ll be able to remember our anniversary. Oh, honey, in case you haven’t answered it, would you wear an identification bracelet if I got it for you. I’d like to give you one for graduation but I know how you feel about the one you have now. Well? And if you’ll wear another one, would you rather have silver or gold? And if you wait, what in the name of heave can I give you? Answer that, please. Honey, I love you so. I’m so lonesome without you. It seems a million years since we were together. It won’t be much longer now. How many hours do you have now, honey? Have you finished your night cross countries? When do you start your instruments or have you already? How many hours of instruments do you have to have? Hope that you aren’t working to hard, honey. I know how awfully hard it is for you to write but you’ve been wonderful. You’ve been really better than I have. I certainly appreciate your letters, honey, and they’ve all been marvelous. I hope we’re not apart for long ever. Never can say what I want to in a letter. I suppose that you know that Kenneth had pnomonia [sic]. Can’t spell it- But he’s much better now. Sat up for three hours yesterday. Didn’t want to tell you until someone else did because I really don’t know very much about it. Anyway now that he’s better I guess someone has told you. That reminds me if you’re ever sick or anything, promise me you’ll tell me + not try to keep it from me? I’d rather you told me than hearing someone else say something. Of course you’ll probably never be ill but just in case. Well, honey, just returned from Woody’s. Sorry but it’s late. Wish I could write more but it’s late now. I love you so much, my darling. What a night! It’s so foggy that we couldn’t see ten feet ahead of us Daddy almost drove up two trees. Golly we couldn’t even see the road. I love you so, honey, I’ll never be able to tell you how much but anyway I’ll keep trying. Golly darling 17 more days. I miss you more and more. Hope these seventeen days go real fast. I’ll write tomorrow again, honey, I love you so. You say “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” didn’t you, honey? Gee, it was good. Anything with men in reminds me of you. I love you so, honey. Goodnight for now. I adore you, honey. You’ll have all my love- Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R

I was only responsible to Prosper (Francis Suttill) whom we all called Francois [...] He liked to use me for special errands because, France being my native land, I could get away from difficulties easily enough, particularly when dealing with officialdom.Francois was an outstanding leader, clear-headed, precise, confident. I liked working on his instructions, and I enjoyed the small challenges he was placing in front of me. For instance calling at town halls in various districts of Paris to exchange the network's expired ration cards (manufactured in London) for genuine new ones. Mainly I was delivering his messages to his helpers: in Paris, in villages, or isolated houses in the countryside. From time to time I was also delivering demolition material received from England. And once, with hand-grenades in my shopping bag, I travelled in a train so full that I had to stand against a German NCO. This odd situation was not new to me. I had already experienced {{it for the first}} time on the day of my arrival on French soil, when I had to travel by train from Poitiers to Paris. A very full train also. I sat on my small suitcase in the corridor, a uniformed German standing close against me. But, that first time, tied to my waist, under my clothes, was a wide black cloth belt containing bank-notes for Prosper, a number of blank identity cards and a number of ration cards; while tucked into the sleeves of my coat were crystals for Prosper's radio transmitters; the crystals had been skilfully secured to my sleeves by Vera Atkins herself, before my departure from Orchard Court. My [...]32 revolver and ammunition were in <b>my</b> <b>suitcase.</b> The ludicrousness of the situation somehow eliminated any thoughts of danger.In any case, I believe none of us in the field ever gave one thought to danger. Germans were everywhere, especially in Paris; one absorbed the sight of them and went on with the job of living as ordinarily as possible and applying oneself to one's work.Because I worked alone, the times I liked best were when we could be together, Prosper (Francis Suttill), Denise (Andrée Borrel), Archambaud (Gilbert Norman), Marcel (Jack Agazarin) and I, sitting round a table, while I was decoding radio messages from London; we were always hoping to read the exciting warning to stand by, which would have meant that the liberating invasion from England was imminent." ...|$|E
