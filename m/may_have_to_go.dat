5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E

500|$|Amir tells Sohrab of {{his plans}} {{to take him back}} to America and {{possibly}} adopt him. However, American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab's orphan status. Amir tells Sohrab that he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the orphanage for a little while as they encounter a problem in the adoption process, and Sohrab, terrified about returning to the orphanage, attempts suicide. Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks. In the end, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, [...] "For you, a thousand times over." ...|$|E

2500|$|Preventative {{medicines}} include gabapentin (Neurontin), tizanidine (Zanaflex), fluoxetine (Prozac), amitriptyline (Elavil), and topiramate (Topamax). In testing, gabapentin {{was found}} {{to reduce the number}} of headache days a month by 9.1%. Tizanidine {{was found to}} decrease the average frequency of headaches per week, the headache intensity, and the mean headache duration. Through studies, Fluoxetine resulted in better mood ratings and [...] "significant increases in headache-free days". Despite being associated with depression, antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been found to effectively treat [...] "near-daily headaches" [...] and numerous chronic pain conditions as well as improving mood and sleep—two possible triggers for chronic headache sufferers. One study found that the headache frequency over a 28-day period lowered for chronic headache patients on topiramate. Another medication to prevent headaches is botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA or BOTOX), which is given by injection instead of being taken orally. In a clinical study of botulinum toxin type A, patients participating in the 9-month treatment period with three treatments experienced headache frequency decreases up to 50%. As with all medications, the preventative medications may have side effects. Since different people respond to drugs differently, chronic headache sufferers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a [...] "trial-and-error" [...] period to find the right medications. The previously mentioned medicines can improve headaches, but physicians recommend multiple forms of treatments.|$|E

No negative side effects were felt in the short term, but the procedure eventually resulted in serious abscess in her face. <b>May</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through multiple surgeries to remove the foreign material.

50|$|Though Herodotus {{does not}} mention the season of the year, as the Cambridge Ancient History states, it is {{possible}} to infer it, knowing that if Darius marched from Susa in spring 513, he would have reached Chalcedon in May, and mustered his forces on the European side in June.
