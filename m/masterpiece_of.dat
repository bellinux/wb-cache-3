5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> aggressive defence, yet he was not under the same pressure {{as he had been}} in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control. A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November 1909 a train {{en route}} from Bergen rolled into Oslo Østbanestasjon, and two days later the railway was officially opened at Voss. King Haakon VII stated upon the opening that the line was the Norwegian {{engineering}} <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> his generation.|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{not well}} known as a scholar. He did, however, serve as a patron to Roger of Hoveden, the medieval chronicler who started writing about 1169.

5|$|In October 2009, UNESCO {{designated}} Indonesian batik as a <b>Masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. As {{part of the}} acknowledgment, UNESCO {{insisted that}} Indonesia preserve its heritage.

5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote {{some of his most}} important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> the genre.|$|E
5|$|Major themes {{include the}} ethics of war, in light of World War II, {{forbidden}} relationship with the spirit world and neglect of family duty. The film won the Silver Lion Award at the 1953 Venice Film Festival and other honours.

5|$|The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct {{was built}} by Thomas Telford in 1805 and is the largest {{aqueduct}} in the United Kingdom; it carries the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee and is a World Heritage Site, being considered a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> civil engineering. The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley constitute an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, one of just five {{in the whole of}} Wales. Denbigh, Colwyn and Ruthin are historic towns and Llangollen hosts the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in July each year.|$|E
5|$|A {{tradition}} of making batik {{is found in}} various countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Nigeria; the batik of Indonesia, however, may be the best-known. Indonesian batik made in the island of Java {{has a long history}} of acculturation, with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures, and is the most developed in terms of pattern, technique, and the quality of workmanship. In October 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a <b>Masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, the {{painting}} was sold to a Swedish art collector who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if {{the painting}} belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that {{the painting was}} both an unsurpassed <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E

5|$|Another old {{building}} of note is the half-timbered Håndværkerhuset (at Kattesunded 20) from c.1625, which originally housed {{a number of}} warehouses. It is now used as a centre for arts and crafts. Finally, the headquarters of Danish Distillers (De Danske Spritfabrikker), {{to the west of}} the Limfjord Bridge, is noted for its Neoclassical appearance. Completed in 1931 by the architect Alf Cock-Clausen, it combines functionality with decorative classical symbolism. Considered a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Danish factory design, it is now a Danish National Heritage site. When the factory closed in 2014, was the area bought by an investor, who will use the buildings to create an international culture city with museums, theatres, apartments etc.|$|E
5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what {{had come to be}} regarded as a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

5|$|Pope Paul III came to {{the papal}} throne (1534–1549) after the sack of Rome in 1527, with {{uncertainties}} prevalent in the Catholic Church following the Protestant Reformation. Nicolaus Copernicus dedicated De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) to Paul III, who became the grandfather of Alessandro Farnese (cardinal), who had paintings by Titian, Michelangelo, and Raphael, {{as well as an}} important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Giulio Clovio, arguably the last major illuminated manuscript, the Farnese Hours.|$|E
5|$|The Castellania is {{considered}} as the <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> architecture projected by Grand Master Pinto, {{being the most}} original intact of secular High Baroque architecture and {{a relic of the}} early modern period, under the rule of the Order of St. John. It has an elaborate façade designed to be imposing, of similar proportions to an auberge, and it is a prominent building in the area. It is two stories high, being built on three sides of a small courtyard at the rear. Although the building has an asymmetrical plan, the main façade in Merchants street is symmetrical. The design prominently includes sumptuous edges, spread over the exterior.|$|E
5|$|The Palais Rohan (Rohan Palace) in Strasbourg is {{the former}} {{residence}} of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the House of Rohan, an ancient French noble family originally from Brittany. It is a major architectural, historical, and cultural landmark in the city. It was built next to Strasbourg Cathedral in the 1730s, from designs by Robert de Cotte, and is considered a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> French Baroque architecture. Since its completion in 1742, the palace has hosted a number of French monarchs such as Louis XV, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon and Joséphine, and Charles X.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected {{to become a}} part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Sinuhe, {{written in}} Middle Egyptian, {{might be the}} classic of Egyptian literature. Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons {{relating}} the marvels performed by priests. The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a <b>masterpiece</b> <b>of</b> near-eastern literature. Towards {{the end of the}} New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any. The former {{tells the story of a}} noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt. From about 700BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Greco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.|$|E
