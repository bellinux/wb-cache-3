5|$|Stews {{are basic}} fare {{for every day}} family cooking and are always served with {{vermicelli}} rice or plain rice. They are popular because they provide {{a wide range of}} nutrients from the meat, the vegetables and the rice. The extra liquid is also essential in such dry climate. Stews are also economically beneficial, as they provide relatively small amount of <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> feeding large families, especially within the poorer population.|$|E

5|$|The cat skull {{is unusual}} among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a {{powerful}} and specialized jaw. Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them {{between two of the}} prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death. Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae. The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair {{on each side of the}} mouth, which efficiently shears <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> small pieces, like a pair of scissors. These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication. Although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.|$|E

Witnesses to the tragedy say that it {{appeared}} that both of the male lions were simply roughhousing with Johari. Apparently one of the males seized Johari by the neck, cutting off her oxygen supply. Witnesses said they didn't know Johari had been killed until she went visibly limp. By then, zoo keepers were on the scene throwing <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> the habitat in an attempt to distract the two brothers. Dallas Zoo officials later confirmed that Johari sustained no other wounds and was killed quickly by the bite she suffered to the neck. A reason for the attack was not immediately determined.|$|E
500|$|Historian Hélène Adeline Guerber theorizes {{that the}} {{tradition}} traces {{back to an}} ancient Norse custom connected with the Yule feast, a Germanic pagan festival that in modern times has inextricably been absorbed into Christmas. [...] Guerber theorizes that Yule is primarily dedicated to the god Thor, but is also important for the god Freyr (who rides a wild boar, Gullinbursti). [...] A boar is eaten at Yule in Freyr's honour and the boar can only be carved by a man of unstained reputation. [...] Guerber says that Freyr was the patron of gladness and harmony and was often invoked by married couples who wished for the same, and that {{this led to the}} custom of married couples who actually succeeded in living in harmony for a given period being rewarded with a piece of boar meat. [...] Guerber states that it is this tradition that became the flitch of bacon custom after converting boar <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> bacon.|$|E

500|$|At Regent's Park David {{made little}} {{professional}} progress. The company was distinguished, headed by Nigel Playfair and Jack Hawkins, and, in the leading female roles, Anna Neagle and Margaretta Scott. David {{was restricted to}} bit parts. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. According to an interview with Chaney, [...] "Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her mother called him a 'pacifist worm'. He was a sexual presence, and slept with anything that moved." [...] David's mother strongly disapproved, and tried {{to put a stop}} to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography Artemis Cooper comments that David's lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess's cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the most important lesson she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a stringy piece of <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> a good dish.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} of the scene juxtaposes the prim and proper Huguenot man and his immaculately dressed wife and son with these three, as they form their own [...] "family group" [...] across {{the other side of}} the gutter. The head of John the Baptist on a platter is the advertisement for the pie shop, proclaiming [...] "Good eating". Below this sign are the embracing couple, extending the metaphor of good eating beyond a mere plate of food, and still further down the street girl greedily scoops up the pie, carrying the theme to the foot of the picture. I. R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as a symbol of the disorder on this side of the street. The man reduced to a head on the sign, in what is assumed to be the woman's fantasy, is mirrored by the [...] "Good Woman" [...] pictured on the board behind who has only a body, her nagging head removed to create the man's ideal of a [...] "good woman". In the top window of the [...] "Good Woman", a woman throws a plate with a leg of <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> the street as she argues, providing a stark contrast to the [...] "good" [...] woman pictured on the sign below. Ronald Paulson sees the kite hanging from the church as part of a trinity of signs; the kite indicating the purpose of the church, an ascent into heaven, just as the other signs for [...] "Good Eating" [...] and the [...] "Good Woman" [...] indicate the predilections of those on that side of the street; but he also notes it as another nod to the pastoral tradition: here instead of soaring above the fields it hangs impotently on the church wall.|$|E

[...] Also killed in the explosion was 20-year-old Preston Mackey, uncle of Robert P. Vann and son-in-law of [...] "Rich Joe".

2500|$|Due {{to serious}} {{environmental}} issues and pollution in China as well as series food safety incidents, including pet foods and milk among others, Senator Brown in 2013 criticized the Department of Agriculture over inadequate process of [...] "No routine inspections" [...] and [...] "No country-of-origin labeling" [...] for meats from that country. [...] "Given the well-documented shortcoming of the Chinese food safety system, we shouldn't allow unmarked <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> our markets that is processed in Chinese facilities that {{are not subject to}} food safety inspection,” Brown said. [...] "This action could endanger {{the health and safety of}} American consumers and potentially undermines confidence in our nation's food safety standards."

Brown highlighted the egregious record of China and demanded additional actions from USDA and Food Safety and Inspection Service for those problems as American consumers deserve to be fully informed of their product choices.|$|E
2500|$|Several acquaintances and {{criminal}} associates of Haarmann testified for the prosecution, including former neighbors who testified to having purchased brawn or mince from Haarmann, whom they noted regularly left his apartment with packages of meat, but rarely arrived with them. Haarmann's landlady, Elisabeth Engel, testified that Haarmann would regularly pour chopped pieces of <b>meat</b> <b>into</b> {{boiling water and}} would strain fat from meat Haarmann claimed was pork.

Another neighbor testified to the alarming number of youths whom he had seen entering Haarmann's Neue Straße apartment, but whom he seldom observed leaving the address. This neighbor had assumed Haarmann was selling youths to the Foreign Legion; another neighbor testified to having observed Haarmann throw a sack of bones into the Leine River.
