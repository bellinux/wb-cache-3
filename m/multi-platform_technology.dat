40|$|This book {{examines}} {{an emerging}} and fast evolving phenomena: that {{a growing number}} of people engage with two screens whilst watching television. It seems a simple concept – until we discover the important implications. In doing this, this book will move way beyond the study of online and multimedia content. It will go past the impact of mobile and <b>multi-platform</b> <b>technology</b> on the media. Instead it will examine how this new concept of second screen interactivity changes the way we watch, produce, commission and monetise television programmes in the UK...|$|E

40|$|OpenSoundEdit is a sound-editing {{system that}} {{provides}} a unified three-dimensional user interface to edit complex sounds composed from different representations. Sounds are mapped onto a single three-dimensional space representing time, amplitude and a view-dependent third dimension (e. g., frequency, channel number, etc.) Sounds can be edited by direct manipulation on the 3 D display window or using additional representation-specific controls. As the user edits sounds, changes can be heard through a synthesis server, an application that generates sound in response to commands supplied by OSE.

40|$|The {{importance}} of cross-shelf transport across the Ross Sea on local and remote processes {{has been well}} documented. In the Ross Sea, mid-water intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) are modified by shelf water near the shelf break to form Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW). In 2010 – 2011, we deployed <b>multi-platform</b> <b>technologies</b> focused on this MCDW intrusion {{in the vicinity of}} Mawson and Pennell Banks to better understand its role in ecosystem processes across the shelf. The high-resolution time and space sampling provided by an underwater glider, a short-term mooring, and a ship-based survey highlight the scales over which these critical cross-shelf transport processes occur. MCDW cores were observed as small-scale well-defined features over the western slopes of Pennell and Mawson Banks. The mean transport along Pennell Bank was estimated to be about 0. 24 [*]Sv but was highly variable in time (hours to days). The observations suggest that the core of MCDW is transported by a predominately barotropic flow that follows topography around the banks toward the south until the slope of the bank flattens and the warmer water moves up and over the bank. This pathway is shown to link the source MCDW with an area of high productivity over the shallows of Pennell Bank...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{profound}} change in the global information infrastructure {{that has the potential}} to fundamentally impact many facets of our life. An important aspect of the evolving infrastructure is the distributed system, which engenders continuous interactions between people and interconnected computers. Distributed system has become the norm for the organization of computing facilities. They can be implemented from general-purpose interactive computing systems to support a wide range of commercial and industrial applications of computers. They are increasingly being used {{as the basis for the}} new applications in areas such as networked information services, multimedia applications up to command and control systems in naval defense vehicles. However challenges from existing and new types of applications seem to indicate the need for defining a new framework for open distributed system. The new architecture should design with flexibility and adaptability in mind. The system therefore must be designed to allow seamless integration of new services without affecting existing systems and services. To address this need, we have developed a framework based on the principles of distributed multi-tier architecture, component-based approach, open standards and <b>multi-platform</b> <b>technologies.</b> Our framework as an open distributed system will give the user the opportunity to add or configure various available services according to the user need for customization without any change to the existing design of the system. Based on this framework, a prototype for such distributed system has also been developed to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

40|$|To better {{understand}} lipid biosynthesis in oil palm mesocarp, {{in particular the}} differences in gene regulation leading to and including de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, a <b>multi-platform</b> metabolomics <b>technology</b> was used to profile mesocarp metabolites during six critical stages of fruit development in comparatively high- and low-yielding oil palm populations. Significantly higher amino acid levels preceding lipid biosynthesis and nucleosides during lipid biosynthesis were observed in a higher yielding commercial palm population. Levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis revealed interesting divergence of flux towards glycerol- 3 -phosphate, while carbon utilization differences in the TCA cycle were proven {{by an increase in}} malic acid/citric acid ratio. Apart from insights into the regulation of enhanced lipid production in oil palm, these results provide potentially useful metabolite yield markers and genes of interest for use in breeding programmes...|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} several {{iterations}} of the Global Hawk with different features and capabilities. The first version to be used operationally was the RQ-4A Block 10, which performed imagery intelligence (IMINT) with a 2,000 lb payload of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors; seven A-model Block 10s were delivered and all were retired by 2011. The RQ-4B Block 20 {{was the first of}} the B-model Global Hawks, which has a greater 3,000 lb payload and employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors; four Block 20s were converted into communications relays with the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload. The RQ-4B Block 30 is capable of multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting with SAR and EO/IR sensors along with the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), a wide-spectrum signals intelligence (SIGINT) sensor. The RQ-4B Block 40 is equipped with the <b>multi-platform</b> radar <b>technology</b> insertion program (MP-RTIP) active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which provides SAR and moving target indication (MTI) data for wide-area surveillance of stationary and moving targets.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "For the last several years, the Department of Defense (DOD) has planned to invest {{billions of dollars in}} development and procurement of unmanned aircraft systems. In its fiscal year 2011 budget request the department indicated a significant increase in these investments, expecting to need more than $ 24 billion from 2010 through 2015. DOD recognizes that to leverage its resources more effectively, it must achieve greater commonality among the military services' unmanned aircraft system acquisition programs. This testimony is based primarily on GAO's July 2009 report (GAO- 09 - 520) which examined 10 unmanned aircraft acquisition programs: eight unmanned aircraft systems [...] Global Hawk, Reaper, Shadow, Predator, Sky Warrior, Fire Scout, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance, and Unmanned Combat Aircraft System-Demonstration; and two payload development programs [...] <b>Multi-Platform</b> Radar <b>Technology</b> Insertion Program, and Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload.
