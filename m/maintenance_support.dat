5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of fear for car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing activities with additional aircraft, communications and <b>maintenance</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Software {{industry}} is gaining momentum due to {{profound impact on}} the productivity of the various tasks. Typically software development life cycle includes, development activity and post release activities. The post release activities cover software <b>maintenance</b> and <b>support.</b> It is inevitable to deny the significance of software <b>maintenance</b> and <b>support</b> activities due to fairly a large size of the software. In this study we are analyzing the relationship of team size, application size and software <b>maintenance</b> and <b>support</b> activities. We used the latest dataset of International Standard Benchmark Group data repository containing the software <b>maintenance</b> and <b>support</b> information to conduct this empirical investigation. The results of this empirical investigation further reinforce the current perceptions of the significantly important role of application size, team structure and size on the software <b>maintenance</b> and <b>support</b> activities.

Right after the U.S. backed anti-communist forces {{took over the}} government, 13 Indonesian MiG-21s were delivered to the U.S. in exchange for T-33, UH-34D, and later, F-5 and OV-10 aircraft.

25|$|When the Scottish Clan Line {{shipping}} company became {{a joint venture}} partner in the Hunting Group's air transport business in late-1953, {{this resulted in a}} split of the group. As a consequence, Hunting's aircraft manufacturing activities were not transferred to the new holding company that took control of the airline and its <b>maintenance</b> <b>support.</b> At that time, the Clan Line was one of two UK shipping lines controlled by the Cayzer shipping magnates. Sir Nicholas Cayzer, who headed the Cayzer family's shipping businesses, viewed his stake in one of Britain's leading contemporary independent airlines as a defensive move to ward off air transport's growing competitive threat to the shipping industry. During that period, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the contemporary Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, signalled the Government's willingness to let Hunting-Clan shift its base to London Airport (now London Heathrow).|$|E
25|$|The park is {{maintained}} by the Central Park Conservancy, a private, not-for-profit organization that manages the park under {{a contract with the}} New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, in which the president of the Conservancy is ex officio Administrator of Central Park. Today, the conservancy employs 80% of maintenance and operations staff in the park. It effectively oversees the work of both the private and public employees under the authority of the Central Park administrator (publicly appointed), who reports to the parks commissioner, conservancy's president. , the conservancy had invested approximately $450 million in the restoration and management of the park; the organization presently contributes approximately 85% of Central Park's annual operating budget of over $37 million. The system was functioning so well that in 2006 the conservancy created the Historic Harlem Parks initiative, providing horticultural and <b>maintenance</b> <b>support</b> and mentoring in Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, and Marcus Garvey Park.|$|E
25|$|A September 2012 weapons {{technology}} swap {{deal and}} a July 2014 {{agreement on the}} sharing of defence technology were seen as preliminary steps towards Australian-Japanese collaboration on a submarine design, or towards integrating technologies like the Sōryūs Kockums designed air-independent propulsion Stirling engines and research into incorporating the Japanese boats' hydrodynamic capabilities into a potential SEA 1000 design. Advantages in such a deal between the nations include the attention that securing the SEA 1000 project would bring to Japanese arms manufacturers (particularly after loosening of defence export restrictions in 2014), the provision of a proven high-end submarine design to the Australian military, and improved relations, both directly and as mutual allies of the United States of America. However, it has been noted that co-operation on such a major defence project would be high risk due to Japan's lack of previous arms export experience, and any deal could negatively impact on both nations' relations with China. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had also been cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal, although with the caveat that a change in government in either nation would compromise any potential deal for construction, or the ongoing <b>maintenance</b> <b>support</b> of the submarines: the Australian Labor Party has a greater interest in supporting local shipbuilding than Abbott's Coalition government, while a souring of China-Japan relations is something the Democratic Party of Japan is less likely to risk than the Liberal Democratic government led by Abe.|$|E

Concorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum, beating other well-known designs such as the BMC Mini, the miniskirt, the Jaguar E-Type, the London Tube map and the Supermarine Spitfire. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of Air France Flight 4590, in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the end of <b>maintenance</b> <b>support</b> for Concorde by Airbus (the successor company of both Aérospatiale and BAC) also contributed.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, No.82 Squadron was {{selected}} to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12September and 11January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process. The squadron deployed to Bofu, a former kamikaze base, during 13–18March 1946, once again as part of No.81 Wing with Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and <b>maintenance</b> <b>support,</b> respectively. No.82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting deHavilland Mosquito, in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members. From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts. The Australians found that, far from offering resistance, the Japanese went out of their way to be accommodating. No.82 Squadron's [...] commanding officer, Squadron Leader Graham Falconer, remarked following a dinner with Bofu's mayor, [...] "I felt that we were being treated more as visitors than as an occupying force!" ...|$|E
