25|$|Since the {{takeover}} in 2011, NEEP Roma Holding S.p.A. has owned all shares Sensi previously hold. NEEP, itself a joint venture, {{was held by}} DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC (later renamed to AS Roma SPV, LLC) and Unicredit in 60–40 ratio from 2011 to 2013, which the former had four real person shareholders in equal ratio, led by future Roma president Thomas R. DiBenedetto (2011–12). The takeover also activated a <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> of shares from the general public, however not all minority shareholders were willing to sell their shares. The <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> meant NEEP held 78.038% of shares of AS Roma (increased from 67.1% of the Sensi). On 1 August 2013, the president of Roma {{as well as one}} of the four American shareholders of AS Roma SPV, LLC, James Pallotta, bought an additional 9% shares of NEEP Roma Holding from Unicredit (through Raptor Holdco LLC), as the bank was not willing to fully participate in the capital increase of NEEP from €120,000 to €160,008,905 (excluding share premium). On 4 April 2014 Starwood Capital Group also became the fifth shareholder of AS Roma SPV, as well as forming a strategic partnership with AS Roma SpA to develop real estate around the new stadium. The private investment firm was represented by Zsolt Kohalmi in AS Roma SPV, who was appointed on 4 April as a partner and head of European acquisitions of the firm. On 11 August 2014, UniCredit sold the remain shares on NEEP (of 31%) for €33million which meant AS Roma SPV LLC (91%) and Raptor Holdco LLC (9%) were the sole intermediate holding company of AS Roma SpA.|$|E
25|$|Since re-capitalization in 2003–04, Roma had a {{short-lived}} financial self-sustainability, until the takeover in 2011. The club {{had set up}} a special amortisation fund using Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981 mainly for the abnormal signings prior 2002–03 season, (such as Davide Bombardini for €11million account value in June 2002, when the flopped player exchange boosted 2001–02 season result) and the tax payment of 2002–03 was rescheduled. In 2004–05, Roma made a net profit of €10,091,689 and followed by €804,285 in 2005–06. In 2006–07 season the accounting method changed to IFRS, which meant that the 2005–06 result was reclassified as net loss of €4,051,905 and 2006–07 season was net income of €10,135,539 (€14.011million as a group). Moreover, the special fund (€80,189,123) was removed from the asset and co-currently for the equity as scheduled, meant Roma group had a negative equity of €8.795million on 30 June 2007. In 2007–08, Roma made a net income of €18,699,219. (€19million as a group) However, 2008–09 saw the decrease of gate and TV income, co-currently with finishing sixth in Serie A, which saw Roma made a net loss of €1,894,330. (€1.56million as a group) The gate and TV income further slipped in 2009–10 with a net loss of €21,917,292 (already boosted by the sale of Alberto Aquilani; €22million as a group) despite sporting success (finishing in second place in 2009–10). Moreover, despite a positive equity as a separate company (€105,142,589), the AS Roma Group had a negative equity on the consolidated balance sheet, and fell from +€8.8million to −€13.2million. In the 2010–11 season, Roma was administrated by UniCredit as the Sensi family failed to repay the bank and the club was put on the market, which also saw Roma not have a major signing in 2010–11. Concurrently with no selling profit on the players, Roma's net loss rose to €30,589,137 (€30.778million as a group) and the new owner already planned a re-capitalization after the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> on the shares. On the positive side, TV income was increased from €75,150,744 to €78,041,642, and gate income increased from €23,821,218 to €31,017,179. This was because Roma entered 2010–11 Champions League, which counter-weighed the effect of the new collective agreement of Serie A. In 2011–12, the renewal of squad and participation in 2011–12 UEFA Europa League had worsened the financial result, which the €50million capital increase (in advance) was counter-weighted totally by the net loss. In the 2012–13 season, the participation in domestic league only, was not only not harmful to the revenue but increase in gate income as well as decrease in wage bill, however Roma still did not yet break even (€40.130million net loss in consolidated accounts). NEEP Roma also re-capitalized AS Roma in advance for another €26,550,000 during 2012–13. A proposed capital increase by €100million for Roma was announced on 25 June 2014; however, until 22 May 2014, NEEP already injected €108million into the club, which depends on public subscription; more than €8million would convert to medium-long-term loan from shareholder instead of becoming share capital.|$|E

40|$|The European Commission’s draft {{directive}} (October 2002) proposes {{to introduce a}} squeeze-out right and a sell-out right and to set the price in a <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> equal to the highest price paid in the 6 or 12 preceding months.

In takeovers of widely held targets, the squeeze-out right and the sell-out right {{have the potential to}} resolve the collective action problem among shareholders, thereby ensuring the success of value-increasing takeovers and the failure of value-decreasing takeovers. Unlike the sell-out right, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule requires competition by the incumbent to provide additional shareholder protection. In firms with a dominant shareholder, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule eliminates inefficient control transfers at the cost of discouraging more efficient control transfers.

40|$|There are {{two main}} {{regulatory}} approaches in relation to private sale-of-control transactions. The ‘market rule’ confers maximum freedom on a company’s incumbent controller by enabling sale shares (hence control over the company) to any acquirer offering an acceptable price. This concept applies to most private sale-of-control transactions in the US. On the other hand, the ‘mandatory bid rule’ requires a potential acquirer to offer a buy-out to all remaining shareholders once he obtains control over a company. The <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule has its origins in the UK and now applies throughout the EU and in many other jurisdictions. Under a <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid,</b> the price offered to the remaining shareholders by the acquirer {{must be at least}} equal to the consideration received by the incumbent controller. This effectively prevents transactions with potential acquirers who are unable to offer a price acceptable to the incumbent controller to all shareholders of the company. While this warrants that no value-destroying control transfers can take place, some value-increasing takeovers are also prevented by the rule, potentially reducing the overall level of (beneficial) takeover activity. This “chilling effect” of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule, it is often argued, is too high a price to pay for the few advantages offered in exchange. This paper seeks to analyse the determinants for a re-estimation of the efficiency costs entailed by the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> and market rules and argues that the efficiency advantages of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule go far beyond simply deterring inefficient takeovers. The paper also emphasizes that private benefits of control – especially in the form of synergies – exist irrespective of the level of investor protection offered by a particular legal environment...|$|E

However, strict enforcement of the <b>Mandatory</b> <b>Bid</b> Rule (MBR) would make takeovers impossible in China. As a result, its operative effect has been diluted {{through a series of}} measures. First, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has always granted exemptions from <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> obligations to avoid the detrimental effects of strict enforcement. Second, in practice, certain firms that do not apply for exemptions or fail in their applications are able to circumvent their <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> obligations by launching takeovers within an appropriate time period when the market is booming. Third, this circumvention is facilitated by rules allowing for the adjustment of the bid consideration.

40|$|The <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> {{rule has}} {{its origins in}} the UK and now applies {{throughout}} the EU and in many other jurisdictions.

This paper challenges some of the claims made by critics of mandatory bids. Highlighting the effects of synergy gains in private sale-of-control transactions, it is shown that mandatory bids prevent inefficient control transfers, where minority shareholder protection rules provide inadequate protection. Furthermore, mandatory bids help facilitate transfers to the most efficient bidders in multi-bidder settings. The <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> is justifiable, on economic grounds, in wider circumstances than is commonly assumed by law and economics scholars...|$|E

40|$|In devising rules {{governing}} {{the conduct of}} takeover transactions, policy makers would {{serve the interests of}} investors and the economic order of society generally better by adopting regulations that maximise shareholder and social welfare. A <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule can assist to achieve this objective. By significantly enhancing the chances of a takeover succeeding, that rule potentially encourages bidders to attempt more hostile acquisitions. An increase in search for potential takeover targets is likely to create some insecurity among directors and induce them to perform to their best level. Further, as takeovers facilitate the re-allocation of scarce societal resources to the parties to whom they have the highest valued uses, greater efficiency in the allocation of resources within industries is likely to be achieved as the incidence of hostile takeover transactions increases. Also, given that hostile takeovers are invariably made at a premium, an increase in that activity is likely to enhance shareholder wealth. These are matters of significant public importance. For this reason, it is advisable to reform the law governing takeover activity to introduce a <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule in Australia...|$|E

We found empirical evidence that changes in Corporate Law decreased (increased) the advantage of voting shares in terms of tag along rights reduced (incremented) DCP. However, we did not find empirical evidence that the voluntary granting of tag along rights altered DCP. We also found evidence suggesting that family control is positively associated with DCP level. Overall, our results indicate that regulations regarding shareholders ’ rights and the identity of controlling shareholders are the two relevant corporate governance variables for DCP level in environments characterized by concentrated ownership structures.

The last chapter focuses on the pricing and timing of going-public transactions. Chapter 2 focuses on the absolute wealth effect of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule and formalises the trade-off minority shareholders of corporate raiders face {{with respect to the}} adoption of a mandatory tender offer after a shift in control. Under plausible assumptions about the distribution of security and control benefits, minority shareholders of acquirers profit from the adoption of the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule. A subsequent empirical study supports this hypothesis by measuring the stock price effects after the acceptance of the German Takeover Code. Chapter 3 uses a dataset of German dual-class shares during 1988 - 1997 to study how the change of corporate governance rules affects the price differential between voting and non-voting stock. First, the chapter discusses how mechanisms to separate control from cash-flow rights relate to the value of control. Second, the chapter analyses how minority voting and non-voting shareholders participate in transfers of corporate control under the alternative regulatory structures pre- and post- 1995. By providing an analysis of sequential going-public decisions. Chapter 4 outlines conditions under which the likelihood of a second IPO increases after a first firm has gone public ('hot issue markets'). Two effects can trigger the rise of hot issue markets in a setting with asymmetric and costly information about both firm quality and industry prospects: risk-induced selling pressure and informational free-riding on the industry news conveyed by a first IPO. Finally, the model offers an explanation for the empirical finding that hot issue markets exhibit a higher degree of underpricing than cold issue markets...|$|E
40|$|To foster {{corporate}} restructuring and capital market integration, the European Commission has repeatedly attempted to introduce Europe-wide takeover regulation, but has encountered strong resistance. We trace {{the sources of}} this resistance to differences in corporate governance arrangements across member states and outline the economic effects of takeover regulation, focusing in particular on possible provisions of particular relevance to the European debate. Regulation may stipulate that the same price be offered to all shareholders (a ‘mandatory bid’ rule) and/or that differentiation of voting-rights be voided when a bidder acquires a large enough portion of a firm’s shares (a ‘break-through’ rule). The impact {{of these and other}} rules depends on the existing structure of corporate ownership and control, which is very heterogeneous in Europe. And while a break-through rule promotes takeovers, a <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule tends to prevent them. Hence, the two rules would tend to offset each other if introduced together, and introducing a strict <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule alone would slow down {{corporate restructuring}}. We argue that hostile takeovers are a rather blunt instrument for achieving desirable contestability of control, and their regulation {{is only one of many}} corporate governance mechanisms to be honed in order to promote corporate restructuring in Europe...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of private bene…ts of control in negotiated block transactions. We estimate the block pricing model in Burkart, Gromb, and Panunzi (2000) (BGP) acknowledging the presence of both block premia and block discounts in our sample. We …nd evidence {{in favor of the}} BGP model according to which the occurrence of block premia and block discounts depends on how competitive the block seller can be in opposing a potential tender o¤er for the target’s stock. Private bene…ts represent 3 % of the target …rm’s stock market value. In addition, our approach allows us to measure the e ¢ ciency with which private bene…ts are extracted: On average, each $ 1 of private bene…ts costs shareholders $ 2 of equity value. Private bene…ts decrease with target’s size and short term debt, and increase with target’s past performance, intangible assets, and cash. The later e¤ect is stronger if the target’s cash is higher than the acquirer’s cash. Acquirer’s overpay an average of 7 % of the target’s stock price relative to the BGP benchmark. We use our structural estimation to conduct a counterfactual policy evaluation of the <b>Mandatory</b> <b>Bid</b> Rule. Our results suggest that the <b>Mandatory</b> <b>Bid</b> Rule fail...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss mainly about the Takeover Directive in Europe and the {{endeavor}} {{of the latter}} {{in order to create}} a general regulatory when dealing with the takeovers of companies that operate in each Member State. This Article focuses in determining an equivalent transaction for all this companies due to the protection given to minority shareholders and to the bidder as well. Additionally, this approach will be fulfilled by the incorporation of <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule and squeeze-out directive by each Member State as this will make possible the protection of the interest of a target company shareholder and the interest of the bidder as well...|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, if an {{acquisition}} of voting shares {{in a public}} company exceeds the statutory threshold for ‘control’, the rule is that the acquirer is obliged to make a mandatory offer to acquire the remaining shares in the target company. This <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule, as embodied in the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (‘CMSA’) and the Malaysian Code on Takeovers and Merger 2010 (‘the 2010 Code’), has the rationale that the control of a company has a value in itself and such value must be shared by all shareholders. Such concept of ‘equal opportunity’ is reflected in s 217 (5) (b) of the CMSA. Since a takeover involves a transfer of corporate control, the <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule also {{provides an opportunity for}} the remaining shareholders to exit the company because the character of the company may have changed under the new controller. Failure to make a mandatory offer may be visited with criminal sanctions as well as administrative actions by the Securities Commission. However, reported cases in Malaysia reveal a divergence in views as to whether a shareholder of the target company has a private law remedy premised on the breach of statutory duty under the predecessors of the CMSA and the Malaysian Code on Takeovers and Mergers. It is believed that similar cases in which the CMSA and the 2010 Code apply (if any), are yet to be reported. This article seeks to examine whether a shareholder of the target company can maintain a similar claim under the current laws...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{alternative to the}} commonly held belief that poison pills affect shareholder wealth negatively. Specifically, the paper models how ex ante shareholder wealth can be maximized with contractual provisions that resemble poison pill plans and, reversely, voluntary dilution à la Grossman and Hart (1980) by allowing an optimal choice of takeover probabilities and premia. The model's predicitions are consistent with recent empirical evidence [Comment and Schwert (1995) ]. The paper shows that, under optimal employment of the proposed provisionsa, the comparative statics on takeover probabilities and premia differ partially from those proposed in Shleifer and Vishny (1986). As an extension, {{an analysis of the}} wealth effects of changes in the control threshold, as implied by, e. g., supermajority rules and a <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule, is conducted. Takeover defense; poison pills; dilution...|$|E
40|$|The {{contraction}} of stock markets in some European emerging economies asks for due diligence and solutions preserving the channel of external financing. When <b>mandatory</b> <b>bid</b> rule is effective, completing takeovers at high prices makes markets shrink affecting on long term the very capitalist {{conception of the}} economic regime of those countries. Our approach aims to investigate an option asking for private law enforcement, encouraging controlling shareholder to disclose {{the real value of}} target: representation and warranties in takeover agreements. According to our theoretical findings, the value of the control would increase over the market price if the controlling shareholder commits to assume a portion of the successional liability of acquirer. From a policy standpoint, the viability of such a private mechanism revolves on the mechanics of legal system...|$|E
