5|$|Abu Bakar {{contracted}} pneumonia {{during his}} {{stay in the}} hotel, which led to his demise {{on the evening of}} 4 June 1895. His body was then brought back to Johor by an English <b>man-of-war</b> from Penang. A state funeral was given to Abu Bakar, and he was laid to rest at the royal mausoleum at Makam Mahmoodiah on 7 September 1895. His son, Tunku Ibrahim was later installed as the Sultan of Johor in November 1895.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Man-of-War</b> (as it {{is called}} by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head {{foremost}} to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, Grant {{and his family}} stayed with Fish in Washington for two months before setting out on a world tour that lasted {{approximately}} {{two and a half}} years. Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, Grant and Julia left for England aboard the SS Indiana. During the tour the Grants made stops in Europe, the Mediterranean the Holy Land and points in the Middle East, meeting with notable dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria, Pope Leo XIII, Otto von Bismarck, Emperor Meiji and others. Grant was the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. During the tour, supported by the Hayes administration transported on naval ships, Grant assumed an unprecedented diplomatic capacity, unofficially representing the United States to strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process. Homesick, the Grants left Japan sailing on the City of Tokio escorted by a Japanese <b>man-of-war,</b> crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.|$|E
60|$|The {{raising of}} the oars, and then letting them fall, all exactly together, by {{the crew of}} a <b>man-of-war's</b> boat, makes a very pretty spectacle.|$|R
60|$|Such are the {{principal}} divisions into which a <b>man-of-war's</b> crew is divided; but the inferior allotments of duties are endless, and would require a German commentator to chronicle.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{appears to}} be a <b>man-of-war's</b> cutter," [...] {{observed}} the baronet uneasily, for by this time all on board felt a sort of personal interest in their escape.|$|R
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Scottish independence, Robert I {{turned his attention to}} building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal <b>man-of-war</b> near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late 14th century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers. James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424 he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429, were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, and the office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{exhibits}} {{included a}} {{science and technology}} exhibit by Great Britain, while Mexico and Peru focused on handicrafts, and Japan and India attempted to show both of these sides of their national cultures. The Taiwan and South Korea pavilions showed their rapid industrialization {{to the world and}} the benefits of capitalism over communism during the time of cold war era. Other pavilions included one featuring Brazilian tea and coffee; a European Communities Pavilion from the then six countries of the European Economic Community; and a joint pavilion by those countries of Africa that had by then achieved independence. Sweden's exhibit included the story of the salvaging of a 17th-century <b>man-of-war</b> from Stockholm harbor, and San Marino's exhibit featured its postage stamps and pottery. Near the center of this was the DuPen Fountain featuring three sculptures by Seattle artist Everett DuPen.|$|E
5|$|Low's tactics {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} hoisting false colours and approaching an unsuspecting vessel. Off {{the coast of}} St John's, Newfoundland, Low mistook a fully armed <b>man-of-war</b> for a fishing boat, and barely escaped. He moved on to Conception Bay, capturing a number of boats around the Grand Banks southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the Azores. There, he captured a French (or Portuguese—sources differ) pink, a narrow-sterned former man of war, which Low rearmed and refitted as his new flagship, naming it the Rose Pink. He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard. Low had his crew hoist them up and drop them back down from the yard arm several times, until they died. He {{moved on to the}} Canaries, Cape Verde and then back across to the coast of Brazil, where he was driven back by foul weather.|$|E
60|$|The <b>man-of-war's</b> man was {{too well}} disciplined {{to think of}} resistance, even for a moment. With a look of {{disappointment}} and an active bound, he leaped out upon the sand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boat, ahoy!" [...] cried a deep, {{nautical}} voice, within {{twenty yards}} of them, and in-shore; the hail {{coming in the}} sudden, quick demand that distinguishes the call of a <b>man-of-war's</b> man.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} the dhow ranged up {{alongside}} the [...] "Firefly," [...] and our heroes, with the poor slaves, were quickly transferred to the <b>man-of-war's</b> deck, where Harold told his tale to Captain Romer.|$|R
5|$|The mutiny was memorialized {{most famously}} by Sergei Eisenstein in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin, {{although}} the French silent film La Révolution en Russe (Mutiny on a <b>Man-of-War</b> in Odessa or Revolution in Odessa, 1905), directed by Ferdinand Zecca or Lucien Nonguet (or both), {{was the first}} film to depict the mutiny, preceding Eisenstein's far more famous film by 20 years. Filmed shortly after the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917–22, with the derelict battleship Dvenadsat Apostolov standing in for the broken-up Potemkin, Eisenstein recast the mutiny into a predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Bolsheviks to power. He emphasized their role, and implied that the mutiny failed because Matushenko and the other leaders were not better Bolsheviks. Eisenstein made other changes to dramatize the story, ignoring the major fire that swept through Odessa's dock area while Potemkin was anchored there, combining the many different incidents of rioters and soldiers fighting into a famous sequence on the steps (today known as Potemkin Stairs), and showing a tarpaulin thrown over the sailors to be executed.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, {{after ten}} years of shore duty, Phelps was {{assigned}} to the USS Susquehanna, a side wheel <b>Man-of-war</b> and returned to serving at sea in the Mediterranean Squadron.|$|E
25|$|Spanish {{accounts}} {{note that}} Otter {{is said to}} have been the first United States vessel to arrive at Monterey, California. y]]. Otter was described as a United States <b>man-of-war.</b> She carried six cannon and a crew of twenty-six men.|$|E
6000|$|... "By heavens!" [...] cried Barnstable, [...] "'tis a <b>man-of-war's</b> stroke it pulls; I saw the oar-blades as they fell! and, {{listen to}} the sound! neither your {{fisherman}} nor your smuggler pulls such a regular oar." ...|$|R
60|$|Were it not {{for these}} {{regulations}} a <b>man-of-war's</b> crew would be nothing but a mob, more ungovernable stripping the canvas in a gale than Lord George Gordon's tearing down the lofty house of Lord Mansfield.|$|R
60|$|The Serapis was a frigate {{of fifty}} guns, {{more than half}} of which {{individually}} exceeded in calibre any one gun of the Richard. She had a crew of some three hundred and twenty trained <b>man-of-war's</b> men.|$|R
25|$|At Annapolis Royal, Major John Handfield was {{responsible}} for expelling the Acadians. The expulsion was slow to advance in this region, but finally on Dec 8, 1755 Acadians were embarked on seven vessels escorted by a <b>man-of-war.</b> About three hundred Acadians are reported to have escaped deportation.|$|E
25|$|Rev Grace, who {{had fled}} from Taupo to Opotiki, was arrested and put on trial by the Pai Mārire party. He was rescued from captivity two weeks later by a British <b>man-of-war,</b> HMS Eclipse, after an attempt by local Pai Mārire leaders to {{exchange}} him for Tauranga chief Hori Tupaea, who was in prison.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1667 the French having joined on {{the side}} of the Dutch decided to target England's Caribbean colonies. Having {{captured}} their half of St. Kitts, Antigua, and Montserrat they now threatened to invade Nevis. In March Captain John Berry, in the 56-gun <b>man-of-war</b> Coronation arrived at Barbados and the Governor decided to make an attempt to save Nevis. He bought up a number of armed merchantmen and created a squadron of ten men-of-war and one fireship under Berry's command.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare not}} {{keep my eyes}} off the {{breakers}} ahead," [...] the captain commenced, [...] "and must trust to you, Strand, to report {{what is going on}} among the <b>man-of-war's</b> men. What is the ship about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil's fangs!" [...] grumbled the schipper. If {{you should}} keep the Milk-Maid away, we shall lose a little in distance, though I think the <b>man-of-war's</b> men will be puzzled to catch her, with a flowing sheet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What news astern, boatswain?" [...] {{demanded the}} captain, {{as soon as}} this {{imminent}} danger was passed, absolutely afraid to turn his eyes off the dangers ahead for a single instant. [...] "How come on the <b>man-of-war's</b> men?" ...|$|R
25|$|Unable {{to gain a}} {{foothold}} at Spitsbergen, the Basques ventured offshore. Even here they met with trouble. In July 1637, the Fleur, of Ciboure, under Dominique Daguerre, who had been whaling between 73° and 76° N, {{made the mistake of}} straying as far north as 78° N, where he encountered the Danish <b>man-of-war</b> De To Løver ("The Two Lions"), under Corfits Ulfeldt. Ulfeldt, who had been sent to Spitsbergen to protect Danish interests, led Daguerre to Kobbefjorden, where he seized 400 barrels of blubber and 100 quintals of baleen.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{continued}} his mission, {{as he had}} {{since the beginning of}} it, in civilian clothes — running the risk of being apprehended as a spy — and, while posing as an Englishman, inspected the defenses of the castle at Chapultepec. Continuing on to Veracruz, the surgeon carefully took notes on Mexico, its condition and resources. Ultimately, the physician reached a neutral <b>man-of-war</b> and was taken to the flagship of the American blockading squadron. Sailing on a vessel especially detached for the purpose, Wood carried the vital intelligence information to Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{hoped to}} flee to the United States from the port of Rochefort, while Fouché wished to hand the ex-emperor over to the Allies. Beker {{accompanied}} his former sovereign until 15 July, when Napoleon surrendered his person to the captain of a British <b>man-of-war</b> at the Île-d'Aix. After the event, Louis XVIII's war minister Marshal Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr peremptorily ordered Beker {{to go home and}} remain there. He was not reinstated in rank until 1818. He belatedly received the Order of Saint Louis in 1825 and the Grand Cordon of the Légion d'Honneur in 1831.|$|E
50|$|The word pinas, locally {{pronounced}} almost {{sounds like}} penis, is obviously {{derived from the}} French word pinasse, which describes a small, usually two-masted sailing vessel. The English word pinnace, a <b>man-of-war's</b> tender, is a deduction from the French word.|$|R
6000|$|... "What! sink a <b>man-of-war's</b> boat!" [...] exclaimed Gascoyne; [...] "why, {{that would}} make them set us down as pirates at once, and we should have to run the {{gauntlet}} of half the British navy before this time next year." ...|$|R
60|$|Of course I {{was only}} too glad to follow him. He {{conducted}} {{me to an}} elegant mansion in Bayswater, and chatted pleasantly as we went along in somewhat nautical tones, for {{he had been a}} <b>man-of-war's</b> man. His name was Flaxmore.|$|R
25|$|Seringapatam was {{originally}} built of teak at Bombay {{as a small}} <b>man-of-war</b> of 357 tons burthen for Tippoo Sahib of Mysore. However, he died at the Battle of Seringapatam, and the British merchants who bought her used her as a whaler. Seringapatam had made several whaling and sealing voyages to the South Atlantic and this area since 1800. Her commander, Captain William Stavers, had a 41-man crew, and she was armed with fourteen 9-pounder guns. On this voyage she had captured one American whaler {{on the way to}} the whaling grounds.|$|E
25|$|Sea King sailed from London on 8 October 1864, ostensibly for Bombay, on {{a trading}} voyage. The supply steamer Laurel sailed from Liverpool the same day. The two ships rendezvoused at Funchal, Madeira, with the Laurel {{carrying}} {{the officers and}} {{the nucleus of the}} commerce raider's crew, together with naval guns, ammunition, and ship's stores. Her commander, Lieutenant James Iredell Waddell, supervised her conversion to a <b>man-of-war</b> in nearby waters. However, Waddell was barely able to bring his crew to even half strength, despite additional volunteers from the merchant sailors on the Sea King and from Laurel.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after Roberts' capture, the Royal James had to be {{abandoned}} because of worm damage. The Royal Rover headed for the island of Príncipe. Davis hoisted the flags of a British <b>man-of-war</b> and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and {{he was invited to}} call at the fort for a glass of wine first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis' party {{on its way to the}} fort, shooting Davis dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I!" [...] {{cried the}} young midshipman, laughing; [...] "then I {{have seen a}} little clipper, in disguise, out sail an old <b>man-of-war's</b> man in a hard chase, and I have seen a straggling rover in long-togs as much like my cousin----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack Tier," [...] {{called out}} Spike, some {{five minutes after}} Biddy was drowned, but not until another {{observation}} had made it plainly apparent {{to him that the}} <b>man-of-war's</b> men still continued to draw nearer, being now not more than fair musket-shot astern.|$|R
60|$|Captain Ackinson was {{standing}} {{alone on the}} deck, watching the <b>man-of-war's</b> boat which was being rapidly pulled towards the Calipha. He was obviously in a bad temper. There was a black frown upon his forehead which did not altogether disappear when {{he turned his head}} and saw them approaching.|$|R
