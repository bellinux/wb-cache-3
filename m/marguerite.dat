5|$|Some {{weeks after}} their encounter, word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife. It {{will never be}} known what basis these {{allegations}} had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386, whilst Carrouges was still in Paris, Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges' mother Nicole and there raped <b>Marguerite.</b> According to <b>Marguerite</b> de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so <b>Marguerite</b> was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave <b>Marguerite</b> a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although <b>Marguerite</b> protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When <b>Marguerite</b> refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel. As Le Gris departed, he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. <b>Marguerite</b> Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 <b>Marguerite</b> Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth to Anna Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between <b>Marguerite</b> Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when <b>Marguerite</b> Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|He married <b>Marguerite</b> Louise d'Orléans, {{a cousin}} of LouisXIV. The {{marriage}} was solemnized by proxy in the King's Chapel at the Louvre, on Sunday, 17 April 1661. It was a marriage fraught with tribulation. <b>Marguerite</b> Louise eventually abandoned Tuscany for the Convent of Montmartre. Together, they had three children: Ferdinando in 1663, Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine, in 1667, and Gian Gastone, the last Medicean ruler of Tuscany, in 1671.|$|E

In this study, the writer highlights the ignorance of the main character in sexual matter from childhood until adulthood, as the major problem of the analysis. Through the analysis, the writer intends {{to find out whether}} social norm and social value has any significant role in the main character's problem., hi this study, the writer wants to reveal <b>Marguerite's</b> problem in sexual relationship and the reasons which result in <b>Marguerite's</b> ignorance. The writer uses theory of characterization to analyze <b>Marguerite's</b> character which influences her problem. She also uses theory of psychology and setting to analyze the environment around her including momma, mother and father.

Momma, Vivian and Big Bailey have a significant role in <b>Marguerite's</b> problem. Since her parents were separated, they cannot fulfill their role as good parent.

5|$|La Rose and La <b>Marguerite</b> are rival {{societies}} that commemorate the Anglo-French {{heritage of the}} island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies {{date back to the}} early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La <b>Marguerite</b> meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La <b>Marguerite,</b> members sing or play instruments and dance. La <b>Marguerite</b> meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader, the chantwèl, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (scraper).|$|E
5|$|<b>Marguerite</b> Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state {{could no longer afford}} to pay interest on government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 <b>Marguerite</b> Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E

5|$|The {{celebrations}} {{following the}} marriage of Catherine’s daughter <b>Marguerite</b> to the Protestant Henry of Navarre in Paris on 18 August 1572, were based on Huguenot themes. The match was controversial because <b>Marguerite</b> was marrying a Huguenot. The pope refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage, and the different faiths of the bridal couple made for an unusual wedding service. After a nuptial lunch, four days of balls, masques and banquets ensued.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Marguerite</b> Louise's {{behaviour}} was tolerated by {{the previous}} Abbess of Montmartre, the new Abbess, Madame d'Harcourt, frequently complained about her to the Grand Duke and the King. In retaliation, <b>Marguerite</b> Louise threatened to kill the Abbess with a hatchet and a pistol, and formed a clique against her. It was {{in this context that}} Cosimo III consented, in line with her wishes, to <b>Marguerite</b> Louise's departure for a new convent, at Saint-Mandé on the Eastern outskirts of Paris, on the condition she go out only with the King Louis XIV's explicit permission and be attended by a chamberlain of his choice. Since she would not agree, her pension was suspended, only to be resumed when Louis XIV compelled her to yield.|$|E

5|$|Grand Duchess <b>Marguerite</b> Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). <b>Marguerite</b> Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E

5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, <b>Marguerite</b> Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, <b>Marguerite</b> Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} was unhappy from the start. A few nights following the formal entry, <b>Marguerite</b> Louise demanded the Tuscan crown jewels {{for her own}} personal use; Cosimo refused.

From there she travelled to Tønsberg, Norway, where she spent three weeks. She also visited Helgeroa, Risør, and Kristiania (now Oslo) and returned by way of Strömstad and Gothenburg, where she picked up Fanny and <b>Marguerite</b> again.
