40|$|This study {{investigates the}} means by which {{hospitals}} can improve the reliability of their medical supply value streams. Field research involving pharmacy supplies in eight Australasian public sector hospitals utilised a rigorous, multi-method data collection procedure based around the uncertainty circle model. Value stream maturity, performance inhibitors and pathways to effective improvement are explored. The high levels of value stream uncertainty detected are commonly the result of process immaturity and poor inter-functional integration. Chief among the common root causes is failure by the executive to acknowledge the strategic value of medical supplies management, which ultimately leads to higher materials cost and increased risk of a <b>medical</b> <b>mishap.</b> The study demonstrates how managers can use systems thinking and a context-free performance benchmark to identify effective interventions and potentially transferable best practices...|$|E
40|$|SummarySpontaneous {{intestinal}} perforation due to tuberculous (TB) enteritis is rare, {{occurring in}} 1 – 15 %. Much rarer are TB intestinal perforations among patients receiving their course of anti-TB treatment. This {{is the so-called}} paradoxical response phenomenon, e. g., the occurrence of clinical or radiological worsening of pre-existing TB lesions, or {{the development of new}} lesions not attributable to the normal course of the disease in a patient who initially improves from the anti-TB treatment. A 52 -year-old male patient with three episodes of spontaneous small intestinal perforations in a span of 4. 5 months while receiving anti-TB treatment is presented here and the intraperitoneal changes in each operation documented. On each occasion, he recovered uneventfully after resection of the involved segment of intestine. The pathological examination of the resected segments of bowel {{in the second and third}} operations failed to show remnant TB granuloma. Seven months after his last operation, he resumed his normal work routine and completed his TB treatment without further <b>medical</b> <b>mishap.</b> The number of spontaneous intestinal perforations in such a paradoxical response phenomenon does not appear to have any bearing on his prognosis for cure of the disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of quality improvement {{has been driven}} by the need to reduce errors and raise the standard of medical care. The publication of 2 reports by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1999 and 2001 was the catalyst for change. The findings of both studies reported that there were preventable deaths in US hospitals and that the health system was failing to provide consistent high-quality care for all patients. The additional important step made by the IOM was the appreciation that errors were due to systems failure rather than individual mistakes. It tried to move away from blaming individual health care workers. This approach encouraged a more open, honest approach by hospitals when confronted with a <b>medical</b> <b>mishap.</b> It was appreciated that discussion and medical practice modification were the best way to prevent an error being repeated. In relation to clinical care, the principle of doing the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way was proposed. On foot of these deliberations the Joint Commission in the US in 2002 directed all accredited hospitals to collect performance data for patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia and pregnancy. This has now been further extended...|$|E

Although 25 % of interactions between physicians and patients {{take place on the}} telephone, little has been written about {{telephone communication}} and <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps.</b> Similarly, training in telephone medicine skills is limited; only 6 % of residency programs teach any aspect of telephone medicine. Increasing familiarity with common telephone challenges with patients may help physicians decrease the likelihood of negative outcomes. We use case vignettes to highlight communication errors in common telephone scenarios. These scenarios include giving sensitive test results, requests for narcotics, managing ill patients who are not sick enough for the emergency room, dealing with late-night calls, communicating with unintelligible patients, and handling calls from family members. We provide management strategies to minimize the occurrence of these errors...|$|R
40|$|Little {{has been}} {{published}} on the risks of participating in an expedition. A questionnaire survey was conducted to quantify those risks and to determine how expedition organizers plan for <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps.</b> 246 expeditions, taking 2381 participants {{to more than one}} hundred countries, were studied retrospectively. 65 expeditions (26 %) reported no medical incidents; the remaining 181 reported 835 in 130, 000 man-days (6. 4 per 1000 man-days). 59 % of the medical incidents seen on expeditions were preventable, one-third of these being due to gastrointestinal upsets. 78 % of medical incidents were classified as minor and only 5 % (40) as serious. There was no excess of serious incidents in any particular organizational group or environment. The findings of this survey suggest that the health risks of participating in a well-planned expedition are similar to those encountered during normal active life...|$|R
40|$|Medical {{decisions}} in pre-clinical emergency medicine are usually made under time-sensitive and unfavorable conditions. Normally, these {{decisions are made}} exclusively by the emergency physician, which is in direct contrast to normal hospital protocol, who {{have the luxury of}} consultation with other colleagues. While making emergency-medical decisions, emergency physicians might reach or even cross medico-legal boundaries. The purpose of emergency medicine is to detect life-threatening conditions, intervene effectively and prevent further severe health issues. In this context, the emergency physician is often confronted with questions regarding the initiation and termination of resuscitation measures; as well as the possibility of <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps</b> caused by resuscitation. Furthermore, certain patients request specific treatments or DNR's in writing Advance Health Care Directive (AHCD) which the patients or their relatives then present to the emergency physician. However, it seems rather problematic that emergency physicians have to examine if and to what extent the patients’ requests apply to the current (resuscitation) situation - and then to act accordingly. They are often caught in a conflict of duties and encounter medical, ethical, and medico-legal dilemmas by having to initiate resuscitation measures immediately, instead of basing their decision on reading, verifying and interpreting an AHCD. The emergency physician will always (have to) act upon the principle of ’in dubio pro vita’ or else the resuscitation will not be successful. Studying a patient's AHCD will prove too costly in a resuscitation situation. However, if the emergency physician did not initiate or terminated resuscitation measures, he/she subsequently has to determine and certify the patient's death. This can potentially lead to investigation proceedings regarding the cause of death; indication and reasons for the non-resuscitation or <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps</b> have to be ascertained in a medico-legal post-mortem examination and collected findings have to be evaluated. Ultimately, the emergency physician could commit a statutory violation against the state’s burial and post-mortem examination laws entailing fine proceedings. Therefore, legal medicine, as a mediator between medicine and law, can substantively contribute to medical malpractice research...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostic {{errors are}} poorly {{understood}} despite being a frequent cause of medical errors. Recent efforts {{have aimed to}} advance the "basic science" of diagnostic error prevention by tracing errors to their most basic origins. Although a refined theory of diagnostic error prevention will take years to formulate, we focus on communication breakdown, {{a major contributor to}} diagnostic errors and an increasingly recognized preventable factor in <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps.</b> We describe a comprehensive framework that integrates the potential sources of communication breakdowns within the diagnostic process and identifies vulnerable steps in the diagnostic process where various types of communication breakdowns can precipitate error. We then discuss potential information technology-based interventions that may have efficacy in preventing one or more forms of these breakdowns. These possible intervention strategies include using new technologies to enhance communication between health providers and health systems, improve patient involvement, and facilitate management of information in the medical record...|$|R
40|$|Extensive use of {{automation}} in {{the clinical}} laboratory creates the potential for systematic errors that affect {{a large number of}} patient results before the error is discovered. When a large-scale testing error is found, the approaches recommended for responding to individual <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps</b> are often inadequate. This report uses 2 case studies to illustrate some of the unique challenges facing laboratory managers confronted with a large-scale testing error. We identify 9 distinct constituencies that may be impacted by large-scale testing errors, each of which requires laboratory management’s thoughtful and timely attention. In October 2008, Quest Diagnostics initiated what may have been the largest recall of clinical test results, due to a systematic laboratory error that potentially affected more than 300, 000 vitamin D values. 1 According to a company spokesperson, 7 % of vitamin D tests performed by Quest from early 2007 to mid 2008 were impacted by incorrec...|$|R
40|$|The {{motor car}} is a {{ubiquitous}} feature of modern life, {{and most of us}} spend significant amounts of time in a car, behind the wheel. Driving a vehicle requires complex coordination of cognitive, motor, and sensory skills. All of these aspects can be affected adversely by diabetes per se, with hypoglycemia being the main concern for people with diabetes who drive. Here we introduce the concept of using the motor vehicle as a device to collect and deliver physiological and clinical information, which, in turn, may enable more people to drive more safely by reducing the chances of <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps</b> behind the wheel. This is particularly relevant for people living with diabetes who are at risk from a number of medical conditions that have the potential {{to have an impact on}} safe driving.

The aim of our research is to: 1) investigate the root causes (underlying mechanisms) of ICU error related to the effects of clinical workflow: medical cognition, team communication/collaboration, and the use of diagnostic/CDS systems and 2) construct and validate a novel workflow model that supports improved clinical workflow, with goals to decrease adverse events, increase safety, and reduce intensivist time, effort, and cognitive resources. Lastly, our long-term objective is to apply data from aims one and two to design the next generation of diagnostic visualization-communication (VizCom) system that improves intensive care workflow, communication, and effectiveness in healthcare...|$|R

40|$|Patient safety {{has become}} a {{critical}} concept in healthcare as clinicians seek to provide quality healthcare to every patient in a healthcare system that has grown far {{more complex than the}} days of the independent doctor and his black bag making house calls. Accidents in present-day healthcare systems are complicated, with environmental factors, interactions between clinicians, and the pressures exerted by managerial decisions all contributing to these <b>medical</b> <b>mishaps.</b> Despite this complexity, accidents are analyzed using simplistic and outdated techniques modeling systems as mere linear chains of events, when the reality lies far from those neat cause and effect relationships. Further compounding efforts to promote patient safety is the reliance on reactive approaches to safety, waiting for accidents to occur before enacting changes, like a dangerous game of whack-a-mole. What little work is done in prospective hazard analysis tends to be concentrated in niche areas and relies heavily on older analytic techniques. This thesis demonstrates the use of systems theory based accident and hazard analysis techniques, CAST and STPA respectively, in healthcare systems. It shows proof of concept applications in two distinct fields of healthcare, accident analyses in cardiac surgery and a prospective hazard analysis in a radiation oncology process. These techniques were very amenable to adaptation to healthcare applications. The accident analyses a rich set of accident causal factors leading to a large number of strong design options to prevent future accidents. The hazard analysis identified 84 potential unsafe controls and over 200 possible causal scenarios requiring a design change to create a safer system. This work sets up future work into direct comparisons with other hazard and accident analysis techniques applied in the healthcare domain as well as larger scale studies to understand the potential impact on patient safety. Finally, this work highlights the growing role for system and safety engineers in the healthcare field to help deal with the complexity of ensuring that every patient receives safe and effective healthcare. by Aubrey Samost.

40|$|Background Adverse {{events are}} {{documented}} to affect {{more than one}} in 25 hospital patients. <b>Medical</b> <b>mishaps</b> and errors are rarely the result of incompetence, poor motivation or negligence but challenges on social and cognitive skills such as loss of situation awareness, poor communication, less than optimal teamwork, problematic stress management, and memory overload. Realising how prone we as humans are for short term memory loss, it is striking how many potentially dangerous medical procedures are based on “perfect” memory. The aims of this thesis were to develop and measure the effect of a pre-induction safety checklist in anaesthesia, explore the personnel’s acceptance and experience with this list, and further examine experiences with checklists in some non-medical high reliability organisations (HROs). This is organisations achieving high levels of safety despite facing considerable hazard and operational complexity Methods Statistical process control (SPC) was chosen as a quantitative approach to measure the effect of the pre-induction checklist implementation. Qualitative approaches using focus groups, key informant interviews, Delphi technique, and consensus process were utilized to develop the checklist and examine checklist experiences. Results During a study period of 13 weeks the 26 items checklist was used in 502 (61 %) of 829 anaesthesia inductions. One or more missing items were indentified in 17 % (range 4 - 46 %) of these procedures. It took a median of 88. 5 seconds (range 52 - 118) to perform the checklist. Some participants were concerned that patients might have become anxious about possible unpreparedness since there was a “need” for a final check. The participants had, on their own initiative, adopted strategies to reduce this potential burden to the patients. The introduction of the checklist interrupted workflow by disturbing some of the personnel’s own streamlined working habits or by causing redundant checks done by both nurses and physicians. Some participants had experienced negative or ironic comments from colleagues. They emphasised the importance of a supporting and motivating unit leader. Several of the participants had experienced increased confidence in performing challenging cases in unfamiliar places and situations. The participants discovered that the seven various operating theatres in which the checklist was used, were not designed and equipped in the same way. This highlighted the need for standardisation if the same checklist should be used in every operating theatre. The interviews with personnel from six HROs generated 84 crucial assertions in checklist development and implementation. Several of the informants underlined the importance of an early assessment if a checklist is the right tool to solve a specific problem. Proximity (defined as ownership and nearness in relation) for all stakeholders, directly or indirectly involved, was claimed to be a key-issue during checklist development. All informants also agreed that the design and length of checklists are vital. Major issues regarding checklist utilisation were: a predefined and agreed upon phraseology, understanding of the background of each point on the list, and to be aware of automaticity. Periodic revisions were described as important for two reasons; firstly to maintain an up-to-date checklist and secondly to build a culture in which the end-user feels that their feedback is valuable for the organisation. Conclusions The introduction of safety checklists in health care is more difficult than it seems at first, and the best approach for achieving success and staff compliance is dependent on several factors. Our findings have provided some new insight in the challenges of developing and implementing checklists...|$|R
40|$|Background: Eastern Health, a large {{health care}} {{organization}} in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), started a staged implementation of an electronic occurrence reporting system (used interchangeably with “clinical safety reporting system”) in 2008, completing Phase One in 2009. The electronic clinical safety reporting system (CSRS) {{was designed to}} replace a paper-based system. The CSRS involves reporting on occurrences such as falls, safety/security issues, medication errors, treatment and procedural <b>mishaps,</b> <b>medical</b> equipment malfunctions, and close calls. The electronic system was purchased from a vendor in the United Kingdom that had implemented the system in the United Kingdom and other places, such as British Columbia. The main objective {{of the new system}} was to improve the reporting process with the goal of improving clinical safety. The project was funded jointly by Eastern Health and Canada Health Infoway. Objective: The objectives of the evaluation were to: (1) assess the CSRS on achieving its stated objectives (particularly, the benefits realized and lessons learned), and (2) identify contributions, if any, that can be made to the emerging field of electronic clinical safety reporting. Methods: The evaluation involved mixed methods, including extensive stakeholder participation, pre/post comparative study design, and triangulation of data where possible. The data were collected from several sources, such as project documentation, occurrence reporting records, stakeholder workshops, surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews...|$|R
40|$|Most {{businesses}} {{recognize that}} people will make mistakes and assume errors are {{just part of the}} cost of doing business, but does it need to be? Companies with high risk, or major consequences, should consider the effect of human error. In a variety of industries, Human Errors have caused costly failures and workplace injuries. These have included: airline <b>mishaps,</b> <b>medical</b> malpractice, administration of medication and major oil spills have all been blamed on human error. A technique to mitigate or even eliminate some of these costly human errors is the use of Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). Various methodologies are available to perform Human Reliability Assessments that range from identifying the most likely areas for concern to detailed assessments with human error failure probabilities calculated. Which methodology to use would be based on a variety of factors that would include: 1) how people react and act in different industries, and differing expectations based on industries standards, 2) factors that influence how the human errors could occur such as tasks, tools, environment, workplace, support, training and procedure, 3) type and availability of data and 4) how the industry views risk & reliability influences (types of emergencies, contingencies and routine tasks versus cost based concerns). The Human Reliability Assessments should be the first step to reduce, mitigate or eliminate the costly mistakes or catastrophic failures. Using Human Reliability techniques to identify and classify human error risks allows a company more opportunities to mitigate or eliminate these risks and prevent costly failures...|$|R
