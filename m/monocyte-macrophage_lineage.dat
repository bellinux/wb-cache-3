40|$|The {{increasing}} {{application of}} heavy ions in radiotherapy {{is a strong}} motivation to expand the fundamental research in radiation biology, especially with respect to long term effects in different cell systems. The classical cytogenetic assay to estimate the radiation effect relies only on the measurement of chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes, but {{a large part of}} the damaged lymphocytes is eliminated from the population via apoptosis [1]. On the other hand, the occurrence of clonal aberrations has been reported for patients, who had received a chemotherapy years ago [2, 3]. Therefore, regarding long term effects after heavy ion therapy, it is important to assess the potential transmission of chromosomal aberrations by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to lymphocytes. HSCs are responsible for the constant renewal of blood. On the other hand they have also the ability to differentiate to a variety of specialized blood cells. As both processes have an impact on a potential transmission of chromosomal aberrations we focused in first experiments on the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells after irradiation with Carbon ions in comparison to conventional photon irradiation. cells after irradiation into erythroid, granulocytic, <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineages,</b> respectively. The size of the colony allows to distinguish between early and more differentiated progenitors, with early progenitors giving rise to larger burst forming units and more differentiated progenitors to smaller colonies. The colony forming cells were classified and enumerated based on morphological recognition of mature cells by light microscopy (figure 1). CD 34 + enriched stem and progenitor cells were exposed to X-rays or Carbon ions and then cultivated in semisolid medium.

40|$|The RNASET 2 gene encodes for {{the only}} human {{secreted}} acid ribonuclease of the T 2 family. This gene maps in 6 q 27, a region that is consistently found rearranged in many solid and hematological tumors. Experimental data gathered in our laboratory have demonstrated the role of RNASET 2 as a tumor suppressor gene which is endowed with several functions including chemotactic and possibly activating activities toward the monocyte/macrophage population. In a mouse xenograft model, we have recently reported that inoculation of human ovarian cancer-derived cells forced to overexpress RNASET 2 {{led to the development}} of small, growth-suppressed tumors, characterized by a strong infiltrate of host-derived innate immunity cells, which have been identified as mainly M 1 polarized macrophages. By contrast, control cells not expressing RNASET 2, developed large, fast-growing tumors with no sign of macrophage infiltration. Further investigations proved that recombinant RNASET 2 (produced in either baculovirus or Pichia pastoris expression system) displayed a marked chemotactic activity in vitro, most likely dependent on a subfamily of G-protein Coupled Receptors associated with inhibitory G protein. Taken together, these results led us to suggest that RNASET 2 -mediated in vivo tumor suppression is a non-cell-autonomous process which result in the recruitment of macrophages into the tumor mass. Based on such evidences, we decided to further investigate the relation between RNASET 2 and cells belonging to the <b>monocyte-macrophages</b> <b>lineage.</b> Most of the experiments we planned to carry out involved the use of purified recombinant human RNASET 2, hence, the first step of the project was the development of a reliable supply system. Two different sources of production and purification of human RNASET 2 protein were already available in our lab (P. pastoris and BEVS), however, a full exploitation of these reagents was precluded by several limitations inherent to both systems. To overcome these limitation, we decided to focus our efforts on improving the P. pastoris expression system, which was more cost-effective and easier to handle in term of available facilities. To solve the problem, we added another 6 XHis tag to the construct coding for the human RNASET 2 and managed to significantly improve the recovery of the input protein. Considering the downstream applications of the purified human RNASET 2, contamination of the preparation by metals (especially Ni, Cd, Zn) and endotoxin are important factor to control in order to properly assess a relationship between a specific treatment (in our case the addition of recombinant human RNASET 2) and immune cell response. Applying the proper care in the preparation of the buffers and the handling of the sample we manage to achieve a low endotoxin content and an undetectable level of contamination by metals (Ni, Cd, Zn). As previously mentioned, several studies have reported the consistent tumor suppressive role for several members of the T 2 RNase protein family and the recruitment of immune cells seems to be involved in this suppression. In order to improve our knowledge of these functional features of T 2 RNases and at the same time to evaluate their evolutionary conservation, we tested the role of human recombinant RNASET 2 in the activation and recruitment of immune cells by injecting recombinant human RNASET 2 in the body wall of Hirudo verbena a useful model system for our purposes. After rRNASET 2 injection, a significant increase in the production of collagen fibrils and a consequent remodeling of the muscle layers was observed. The resulting massive production of connective tissues is then used as a scaffold for immune cells migration and for proper orientation of growth of new vessels. Injection of human recombinant RNASET 2 was also shown to induce a massive migration of cells belonging to the macrophages lineage (characterized as HmAIF- 1 + and CD 68 + cells) within 24 h, coupled to the formation of new blood vessels. The observed inflammatory response was specifically dependent of recombinant RNASET 2 injection, since infiltrating macrophages and neo-vessel formation were not observed following injection of either PBS or rRNASET 2 protein that was pre-incubated with a neutralizing anti-RNASET 2 antibody. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that rRNASET 2 injection in leeches induces a marked inflammatory response characterized by macrophage recruitment. The data gathered in our lab in several in vitro and in vivo experimental systems strongly suggest the occurrence of an RNASET 2 -based intercellular cross-talk, whose molecular mechanisms are nevertheless largely unknown. As a first step in the logical sequence of events culminating in the above mentioned RNASET 2 biological activities, we hypothesized the occurrence of a putative receptor for RNASET 2. The common idea behind all our approaches was to covalently link RNASET 2 (either the endogenous protein or the human recombinant protein) to any interactor and, after purification of the complex, to perform a MS analysis to characterize the interactants. As a first approach, we carried out chemical modification of purified recombinant RNASET 2 with different compounds (SDA, LC-SDA, Sulfo SDA, Sulfo LC-SDA) in order to add a diazirine ring to all primary ammines of the target protein. The resulting modified RNASET 2 protein could then, in principle, be crosslinked to all electron donors available following UV light activation. The modified protein was then incubated with RNASET 2 -silenced OVCAR 3 cells and analyzed by western blot following UV exposure. Despite several attempts with this approach, we could not observe any shift in the molecular weight of RNASET 2. Considering that most of the result obtained show evidence of a tropism of RNASET 2 for cells belonging to the monocyte/macrophage lineage, with our last approach we tested a promyelocytic cell line. We exposed the U 937 cells preincubated with rRNASET 2 to a chemical crosslinkers (BS 3) able to covalently link two or more proteins in close proximity. By this approach we managed to see a shift in the molecular weight of the RNASET 2, but unfortunately in the next step we couldn't purify any detectable complex. Considering that TAMs are usually forced by the tumor cells to acquire an M 2 -polarized pro-tumorigenic phenotype, a key finding of our research group is that tumor xenografts that are suppressed in their growth following RNASET 2 overexpression display a strong infiltration of M 1 -polarized macrophages which are known to show anti-tumorigenic properties. Therefore, the last part of this PhD program was dedicated to investigate the molecular/cellular bases of the interaction between RNASET 2 and immune cells, in particular to describe a possible involvement of this protein in driving macrophages polarization. The main idea was to develop a system to reliably produce M 0, M 1 and M 2 macrophages that could then be used to test the effect of RNASET 2 looking at their transcriptional profile. To this end, we chose a well-known cellular model (THP- 1 cell line) and, in order to remove any bias from future analysis, we selected a pool of cells silenced for the expression of RNASET 2. THP- 1 is a promyelocytic cell line therefore in order to effectively produce polarized cells we needed to differentiate it into macrophages. Using the guidelines found in the literature we managed, by treating THP- 1 cells with PMA 5 ng/ml for 48 h, to produce M 0 macrophages. Subsequently, we developed a protocol to effectively drive naive macrophages to either M 1 or M 2 phenotype. We followed the suggested guidelines and assessed the efficacy of our system by testing a small panel of known marker of polarization (TNF, CXCL 10, CCL 19 for M 1 polarization and CCL 22, MRC 1, MSR 1 for M 2 polarization). Considering the final aim of the developed assay, we tested whether our macrophages, especially M 1 and M 2, still retained the plasticity to change their profile according to external stimuli. M 0 cells were exposed to both M 1 and M 2 stimuli; the resulting profile was neither M 1 nor M 2, suggesting that the cells prepared with our system still retained the characteristic/desired plasticity to properly respond to external signals. The data gathered so far support the idea that the system developed might be useful to study the involvement of RNASET 2 in macrophages polarization. To summarize, during these three years of my PhD program I was involved in many different parts of a project aimed at deepen our understanding of the mechanism underlying RNASET 2 tumor suppression. Although I wasn't able to identify any putative receptor for RNASET 2 experimental evidence suggests the existence of a molecular mechanism involved in the “sensing” of the RNASET 2 protein. Further studies are clearly needed in order to clarify this issue and the recent finding of RNASET 2 -containing exosomes is a promising avenue of investigation. The data collected in Hirudo strengthen our hypothesis of a close relationship between Immune cells (in particular cells belonging to monocyte/macrophages lineage) and RNASET 2 but, more importantly these results open new research opportunities to study the involvement of T 2 ribonucleases in inflammation. From a strictly technical point of view, I was able to improve the system of production and purification of the recombinant human protein, making it possible the use of RNASET 2 in conditions previously inaccessible (interaction with immune cells/injection in organism). To conclude I contributed to laid the bases for future studies aiming at dissecting the involvement of RNASET 2 in macrophages polarization and I did it by developing a simple assay that might test the "polarizing potential" of RNASET 2 (but potentially of any compound) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{has been shown}} to replicate productively in cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage,</b> although replication occurs to a lesser extent than in infected T cells. As cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> become differentiated and activated and subsequently travel to a variety of end organs, they become a source of infectious virus and secreted viral proteins and cellular products that likely initiate pathological consequences in a number of organ systems. During this process, alterations in a number of signaling pathways, including the level and functional properties of many cellular transcription factors, alter the course of HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) -directed gene expression. This process ultimately results in events that contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV- 1 infection. First, increased transcription leads to the upregulation of infectious virus production, and the increased production of viral proteins (gp 120, Tat, Nef, and Vpr), which have additional activities as extracellular proteins. Increased viral production and the presence of toxic proteins lead to enhanced deregulation of cellular functions increasing the production of toxic cellular proteins and metabolites and the resulting organ-specific pathologic consequences such as neuroAIDS. This article reviews the structural and functional features of the cis-acting elements upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site in the retroviral LTR. It also includes a discussion of the regulation of the retroviral LTR in the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> during virus infection of the bone marrow, the peripheral blood, the lymphoid tissues, and end organs such as the brain.

They derive from mononuclear precursors of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> from hemopoietic tissue, reach target mineralized tissues and degrade them under many different physiologic or pathologic stimuli. Clastic cells {{play a key role in}} calcium homeostasis, and participate in skeletal growth, tooth movement, and other physiological and pathological events. They interact tightly with forming cells in bone and dental hard tissues; their unbalance may result in disturbed resorptive activity thus, causing local or systemic diseases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) {{has been an}} important breakthrough in the treatment of HIV- 1 infection and has also a powerful tool to upset the equilibrium of viral production and HIV- 1 pathogenesis. Despite the advent of potent combinations of this therapy, the long-lived HIV- 1 reservoirs like cells from <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> and resting memory CD 4 + T cells which are established early during primary infection constitute a major obstacle to virus eradication. Further HAART interruption leads to immediate rebound viremia from latent reservoirs. This paper focuses on the essentials of the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of HIV- 1 latency with special concern to present and future possible treatment strategies to completely purge and target viral persistence in the reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Adherent, trypsin-resistant, peritoneal {{cells from}} mice with chronic {{schistosomiasis}} mansoni, and from control mice, were cultivated in vitro up to 20 days. Fibroblasts regularly appeared, about 6 days after seeding, in {{cultures of the}} manyfold more numerous cells from infected mice, concomitantly with a dramatic increase, detected by autoradiography, {{in the percentage of}} DNA-replicating cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage.</b> Peritoneal cells from healthy and from infected mice were fractionated on discontinuous Percoll gradients. Eight cell subsets were harvested in both cases, quantitated, and studied by electron microscopy. Two fractions (2 and 3 : 1. 041 < densities < 1. 060 g/ml) from infected mice were greatly enriched in monoblasts and promonocytes. The cells of the different subsets were seeded separately, trypsin-treated and cultivated in vitro. Cultures of cell fractions 2 and 3 from infected mice contained the majority of the DNA-synthesizing cells and gave regularly rise to fibroblasts. Cultures of the different fractions were used for sequential morphological observations (2 - 11 days) at the electron microscope level. Early cultures were also used for the ultrastructural detection of the Mac- 1 (CD 18 /CD 11 b) surface antigen by gold immunocytochemistry. A few fibroblasts were rarely observed in cultures of fractions 2 and 3 from control mice, while cells with ultrastructural features of myofibroblasts were regularly observed in cultures of the same fractions harvested from mice with chronic schistosomiasis. Fractions 2 and 3 from infected mice contained a large number of Mac- 1 positive monoblasts. The correlations between the presence of monoblasts, DNA replication in cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> and the appearance of myofibroblasts in cultures of the same fractions derived from infected mice are discussed.

40|$|Mononuclear {{phagocyte}} plasticity {{includes the}} expression of functions related to the resolution of inflammation, tissue repair and remodelling, particularly when these cells are set in an M 2 or an M 2 -like activation mode. Macrophages are credited with {{an essential role in}} remodelling during ontogenesis. In extraembryonic life, under homeostatic conditions, the macrophage trophic and remodelling functions are recapitulated in tissues such as bone, mammary gland, decidua and placenta. In pathology, macrophages are key components of tissue repair and remodelling that occur during wound healing, allergy, parasite infection and cancer. Interaction with cells bearing stem or progenitor cell properties is likely {{an important component of the}} role of macrophages in repair and remodelling. These properties of cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> may represent a tool and a target for therapeutic exploitation...|$|E
40|$|Alberto Mantovani {{has been}} a member of the Trends in Immunology Editorialized Th 1 cells, whereas CCR 3, CCR 4 and CCR 8 have been {{associated}} with the Th 2 phenotype. CCR 3 ligands also attract eosinophils and basophils, which are crucial for polarized type II responses (Box 2). Cells belonging to the <b>monocyte–macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> have long been recognized to be heterogeneous. Because lineage-defined subsets have not been identified to date, macrophage heterogeneity is likely to reflect the plasticity and versatility of these cells in response to exposure to microenvironmental signals. Cytokines and microbial products profoundly and differentially affect the function of mononuclear phagocytes. It has now been recognized that cells belonging to the myelomonocytic differentiation pathway, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), have a key role in polarized innate and adaptiv...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{a set of}} three {{monoclonal}} antibodies is described, each of which recognizes cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> in the rat. The tissue distribution, in particular in lymphoid organs, {{of each of the}} three monoclonals is determined by immunoenzyme histochemistry on cryostat sections, as well as on cell suspensions. Results show that ED 1 recognizes a cytoplasmic antigen in monocytes and in most macrophages, free and fixed. ED 2 and ED 3 recognize membrane antigens of tissue macrophages, discriminating between distinct subpopulations of macrophages, each with a characteristic localization in the compartments of lymphoid organs. No other cell types except cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are positive for any of the three monoclonals. Possible relations between the macrophages recognized by this set of monoclonals and dendritic cells are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate blood-brain permeability and the possible involvement of plasma proteins and blood-borne cells in amyloid plaque formation in scrapie-affected mice. No abnormal extravasation of intravenously injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was found and with immunocytochemical techniques no plasma proteins were detected in neuropil from scrapie-affected mice. In contrast to an earlier report, these findings suggest that the blood-brain barrier is essentially intact in scrapie-affected mice. Using immunohistochemical and enzyme histochemical methods no cells belonging to the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> were detected in association with amyloid plaques. Thus, by these methods {{there was no evidence that}} plasma proteins or blood-borne cells are involved in amyloid plaque formation in scrapie-affected mice. However, astrocytes were consistently found to be associated with amyloid plaques at all stages of their developmen...|$|E
40|$|Cells of the <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage</b> are {{important}} targets of HIV infection. We report {{here that the}} phenotypic differentiation of monocyte cell lines induced by phorbol esters or tumour necrosis factor [alpha] (TNF[alpha]) is associated with expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-[chi]B). In parallel with such differentiation, HIV transcription, monitored using an HIV long terminal repeat reporter gene construct, is activated in such cells {{under the influence of}} enhanced NF-[chi]B expression. Also, in a promonocyte cell line chronically infected with HIV, NF-[chi]B expression and HIV transcription were enhanced on stimulation with phorbol ester or TNF[alpha]. Thus, stimulation of monocyte cell lines by phorbol esters or TNF[alpha] induces cell differentiation and activates HIV transcription. Such a process may have fundamental implications in AIDS pathogenesis in vivo and may be important in disease progression induced by opportunistic infections directly or indirectly involving macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Total RNA was {{extracted}} from five malignant fibrous histiocytomas and two benign fibrohistiocytic lesions and assayed for mRNA expressions for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and c-sis by Northern blot analysis. Production {{of both of}} these {{has been associated with}} cells of <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage,</b> and these factors {{have been shown to be}} important in physiologic mesenchymal cell proliferation. No mRNA expression of either TGF-β or c-sis was identified in any of the fibrohistiocytic tumor samples. The lack of expression of TGF-β and c-sis may be consistent with a nonhistiocytic origin of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or may reflect transformation- associated loss of the normal molecular mechanisms of mesenchymal proliferation. The absence of c-sis mRNA expression can be reconciled with the prior immunohisto chemical demonstration of platelet-derived growth factor in tumor cells of malignant fibrous histiocytoma.

40|$|Cells cultured {{from human}} giant cell tumors of bone were {{characterized}} {{on the basis}} of morphological features, proliferative capacity, presence of granulocyte-monocyte antigens, receptors for skeletal hormones, and soluble cell products. Three major cell types were identified. One population consisted of mononuclear cells with fibroblastic morphology, which proliferated in culture and most likely represent the neoplastic element of the tumor. Phenotypically they resembled a connective tissue stromal cell. A second population of mononuclear cells lacked receptors for skeletal hormones and did not persist in culture. These cells were likely of <b>monocyte-macrophage</b> <b>lineage.</b> A third population of cells consisted of large multinucleated giant cells. These cells possessed phenotypic features of osteoclasts including receptors for calcitonin. Human giant cell tumors of bone are most likely a neoplasm of connective tissue stromal cells, which have the capacity to recruit and interact with multinucleated giant cells that exhibit phenotypic features of osteoclasts...|$|E
