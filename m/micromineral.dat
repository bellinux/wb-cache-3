40|$|<b>Micromineral</b> {{deficiencies}} in cattle are omnipresent, both {{in developing and}} industrialized regions. Little information {{is available on the}} effect of <b>micromineral</b> deficiencies on nutrient use and digestibility, in spite of many deficiency-related symptoms suggesting a relevant role, such as loss of appetite in Zn deficiency and scouring in Cu deficiency. The present study aimed to identify the importance of adequate <b>micromineral</b> provision on nutrient utilisation in zebu cattle in Ethiopia. Eight zebu steers (Bos indicus) were randomly divided into two groups. Four animals received <b>micromineral</b> supplementation (Zn, Mn, Cu chelated to glycine MAAC®, MAAC® Se Premix (Novus International, Inc.) and inorganic I and Co) for 4 weeks, the four remaining were controls. The basic diet, identical for all animals, consisted of mixed grasses. Mineral levels were determined in feed, plasma and faecal samples. Apparent nutrient digestibility (DM, ash, protein, fat, NDF, ADF, ADL, minerals) was measured by total collection (3 days), along with concentrations of ceruloplasmin (CP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acylcarnitines (ACAR) in plasma as indicators of fermentation and energy substrate use. Faecal nitrogen fractions (FNF) (bacterial, vegetal or animal) and body weight (BW) were also measured. Repeated measures analysis was performed on all data, with baseline data (sampled one week prior to supplementation) as covariate. Feed mineral analysis revealed deficient Cu (5. 53 - 9. 60 mg/kg) and Se (0. 02 - 0. 09 mg/kg) in combination with high S (0. 26 - 0. 39 %) and Mo (1. 52 - 3. 12 mg/kg) and very high Fe (619 - 1214 mg/kg) concentrations. <b>Micromineral</b> supplementation increased plasma Cu (0. 82 vs. 0. 61 mg/l), Zn (1. 40 vs. 0. 89 mg/l), Mn (0. 30 vs. 0. 05 mg/l) and Se (0. 07 vs. 0. 06 mg/l) concentrations (all P 0. 05) in this pilot study. Despite clear improvement on <b>micromineral</b> status - notwithstanding high concentrations of Cu and Se antagonists in the diet – supplementation did not impact nutrient digestibility or utilisation in a clear way. Further research should confirm the absence of this relationship...|$|E

40|$|Provision of an {{adequate}} mineral {{supply in the}} diets of ruminants fed mainly on grassland herbage can present a challenge if mineral concentrations are suboptimal for animal nutrition. Forage herbs may be included in grassland seed mixtures to improve herbage mineral content, although there is limited information about mineral concentrations in forage herbs. To determine whether herbs have greater macro- and <b>micromineral</b> concentrations than forage legumes and grasses, we conducted a 2 -year experiment on a loamy-sand site in Denmark sown with a multi-species mixture comprised of three functional groups (grasses, legumes and herbs). Herb species included chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.). We also investigated the effect of slurry application on the macro- and <b>micromineral</b> concentration of grasses, legumes and herbs. In general, herbs had greater concentrations of the macrominerals P, Mg, K and S and the microminerals Zn and B than grasses and legumes. Slurry application indirectly decreased Ca, S, Cu and B concentrations of total herbage because {{of an increase in}} the proportion of mineral-poor grasses. Our study indicates that including herbs in forage mixtures is an effective way of increasing mineral concentrations in herbage...|$|E

Four hundred and eighty Hisex strain hens, 72 to 80 weeks of age, were used. A randomized complete design was used, with six replications and 16 birds for each experimental unit. Five diets were evaluated: basal feed supplemented with all <b>microminerals</b> in inorganic form (control); basal feed supplemented with 50 % <b>microminerals</b> zinc (Zn) + manganese (Mn) + copper (Cu) in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form; basal feed supplemented with 50 % zinc in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form; basal feed supplemented with 50 % manganese in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form; and basal feed supplemented with 50 % copper in organic form and 50 % in inorganic form. There was no effect of diets on egg production, feed intake, food conversion and egg shell percentage and thickness. Birds fed basal feed supplemented only with zinc or manganese in organic form produced eggs with lower specific weight. The use of basal feed supplemented with copper in organic form has minimized egg loss. However, the best results (lower egg loss, higher specific weight and higher weight of eggs) were obtained with the basal feed supplemented with <b>microminerals</b> Zn + Mn + Cu in organic form and, therefore, it is recommended for feeding of commercial laying at the end of laying...|$|R

25|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} seen in cats fed home-made or vegetarian/vegan diets {{produced}} by owners with good intentions, and most published recipes have been only crudely balanced (by computer) using nutrient averages. Because the palatability, digestibility, and safety of these recipes have not been adequately or scientifically tested, {{it is difficult to}} characterize all of these homemade diets. Generally, most formulations contain excessive protein and phosphorus and are deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and <b>microminerals</b> such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Also, the energy density of these diets may be unbalanced relative to the other nutrients. Commonly used meat and carbohydrate ingredients contain more phosphorus than calcium. Homemade feline diets that are not actually deficient in fat or energy usually contain a vegetable oil that cats do not find palatable; therefore, less food is eaten causing a calorie deficiency. Rarely are homemade diets balanced for <b>microminerals</b> or vitamins. Owner neglect is also a frequent contributing factor in malnutrition.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Among the {{nutrients}} {{involved in the}} chicken diet, the <b>microminerals</b> deserve attention as they exert essential functions in the organism. These compounds can be provided in inorganic (traditional) and organic (chelate) forms. In organic form, the micromimerals can attend a new concept related to a better bio-availability. In this sense, {{the objective of this}} work was to evaluate the effect of the partial and total substitution of inorganic by organic sources of <b>microminerals</b> on the animal diet, assessing its concentration in the blood and liver after 21 and 40 days and also in the bones after 40 days. Moreover, the effect on the physical-chemical and sensory characteristics of the muscle after 15 days of storage at 4 °C was also evaluated. The animals were divided into five treatments: 100 % inorganic, 70 % inorganic and 30 % organic, 50 % inorganic and 50 % organic, 30 % inorganic and 70 % organic and 100 % organic-chelate. It is shown that the use of organic sources of <b>microminerals</b> in the diet of poultry induced to an increase of its concentrations in the blood and liver, with no significant alterations in the compositions of bones, compared to the use of inorganic sources. Feed formulated using 50 % of organic minerals and 50 % of inorganic minerals led to similar results. The diet with organic minerals or mixture with inorganic sources results in a low lipid oxidation in the drumsticks stored at 4 °C for 15 days, in comparison with those using only inorganic minerals.

For that, the concentration of each mineral was compared to the presence of flavours, preservatives, acidifying agents, fruit juice and/or sweeteners, according to the labelled composition. The statistical study demonstrated that flavoured waters generally have increased contents of K, Na, Fe and Cu. The added preservatives also led to significant differences in the mineral composition. Acidifying agents and fruit juice can also be correlated to the increase of Mg, K, Na, Fe and Cu. Sweeteners do not provide any significant difference in Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn contents...|$|E

Feeds and faeces were analysed for Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Co. The resulting aA coefficients, and the linear relationships of apparently absorbable dietary mineral content to total dietary mineral content [per 100 g dry matter (DM) ], were compared with data for domestic horses. Rhinoceroses had significantly higher aA coefficients for Ca and Mg (because of a higher calculated 'true' absorption), and lower ones for Na and K (because of calculated higher endogenous faecal losses). High absorption efficiency for divalent cations is hypothesized to be an adaptation to a natural diet of particularly high Ca:P ratio (approximately 14 : 1); an effective removal of Ca from the ingesta guarantees sufficient P availability at the fermentation site in the hindgut. Higher faecal losses of Na and K are hypothesized to be linked to a higher faecal bulk per DM intake in black rhinoceroses as compared with horses because of a generally lower digestive efficiency. There were no relevant differences in the absorption patterns of <b>microminerals.</b> In particular, there were no discernable differences in Fe absorption within the rhinoceroses for diets with and without tannin supplementation. Several of the zoo diets assessed in this study were deficient in Cu, Mn or Zn, and most contained excessive levels of Fe when compared with horse requirements. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} differences in mineral absorption between occur even between species of similar digestive anatomy; that in particular, Ca absorption might vary between hindgut fermenters with Ca:P ratio in their natural diet; that Na might be a particularly limiting factor in the ecology of free-ranging rhinoceroses; that moderate doses of tannins do not seem to markedly influence mineral absorption; and that diets for captive animals should contain adequate, but not excessive mineral levels...|$|R

Twenty-four hybrid females with starter weight of 66 ± 1. 4 kg and final weight of 106 ± 1. 8 kg were housed for 38 days in 24 stalls and allotted in a completely randomized experimental design with six treatments and four replications of two animals each. The following treatments were used: T 1 –basalfeed; T 2 – basal feed without micromineral-vitamin supplement; T 3 – basal feed with phytase and without micromineral-vitamin supplement; T 4 – basalfeed with phytase, without micromineral-vitamin supplement and without 1 / 3 of inorganic phosphorus; T 5 – basal feed with phytase, without micromineral-vitamin supplement ans without 2 / 3 of inorganic phosphorus; and T 6 – basal feed with phytase, without <b>micromineral</b> vitamin supplement and without inorganic phosphorus supplementation. The withdrawal of the micromineral-vitamin supplemet, the reduction of inorganic phosphorus level and the addition of phytase enzyme did not affect (P> 0. 05) the carcass characteristics, but they reduced (P< 0. 05) feed intake and weight gain, and showed worse feed conversion. Likewise, reduction of inorganic phosphorus levels and phytase addition did not improve economic efficiency when compared to basal feed...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{located within the}} {{framework}} of research on temperate agricultural grasslands. Plant diversity in temperate agricultural grasslands is impoverished today. Many conventional grasslands in Europe consist of simple grass mixtures, sometimes monocultures. Organic and increasingly conventional grasslands are sown as mixtures of grasses and legumes {{and from time to time}} as multi-species mixtures that include forage herbs. Temporary grasslands are regularly resown or incorporated in a crop rotation and produce ruminant fodder. Some studies indicate that various forage herbs have traits that may complement grass-legume mixtures; among others, increased macro- and <b>micromineral</b> concentration. Hence multi-species grassland mixtures, comprising grasses, legumes and herbs, may have a potential to improve common grasslands consisting of low plant diversity. The legume component of a grass-legume mixture contributes to nitrogen (N) self-sufficiency of the grassland because of its ability for symbiotic N 2 fixation, which allows reduced fertilizer application. Several studies present a positive plant diversityproductivity relationship for temporary European grasslands. Increased soil nutrient use in grasslands with higher plant diversity may be one explanation, where, for example, deep-rooted plant species enable nutrient uptake from deep soil layers. In a state of limbo between ecological hypotheses and agricultural needs, and with the background of limited information on forage herbs and multi-species grassland mixtures, the objective of this Ph. D. study was to quantify the performance of multi-species grassland mixtures in terms of three nutrient processes: 1) mineral accumulation, 2) nitrogen transfer and 3) nitrogen uptake. Three field experiments were conducted in Denmark: two on a loamy-sandy site and one on a sandy-loamy site. The four forage herbs – chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.) and caraway (Carum carvi L.) – grown in a nine-species grass-legume-herb mixture showed in my first field experiment, potential in increasing the macro- and <b>micromineral</b> quality of ruminant fodder derived from grasslands. In a second experiment, legumes, which were confirmed to be the N-richest forage plants of the multi-species mixture, donated N to all nine neighboring plants. Grasses (xFestulolium and Lolium perenne L.) received the largest amount of N among the receiver plants, mainly from white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and slurry application mainly stimulated N transfer from legumes towards grasses. The third experiment confirmed the strong N absorption characteristic of perennial ryegrass when grown in a multispecies mixture. When deep-rooted chicory and lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) were added to a shallow-rooted perennial ryegrass-white clover mixture, total N uptake from three vertical soil layers of this four-species grass-legume-herb mixture did not increase. Chicory, however, took up greater proportions of N from deeper soil layers compared with the other plant species. This study showed that multi-species grassland mixtures have the potential to improve the common simple grass or grass-legume mixtures by reducing the need for external mineral supplementation and by more efficient N use. Yet to use varying plant diversity as a management tool in an agricultural system based on grasslands, more knowledge from grass-legume-herb mixtures to animal performance is needed. Ecologists, agronomists and seed companies may work together to develop improved sustainable grasslands which to a certain extent may mimic natural grasslands...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the macro- and <b>micromineral</b> {{contents}} in wrapped forages in Sweden and Norway was conducted. A total of 124 forage samples collected from 124 farms were analyzed for contents of Ca, P, Mg, K, Na, Co, Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se and Zn. Information regarding forage production management was collected from each farm and included factors such as fertilization, botanical composition, sward age, etc. Mean (standard deviation) concentrations were: Ca, 5. 3 (3. 41); P, 2. 7 (0. 80); Mg, 1. 8 (0. 76); K, 21. 7 (7. 44); Na, 0. 3 (0. 45) g/kg dry matter (DM); and Co, 0. 09 (0. 15); Cu, 4. 9 (1. 61); I, 0. 2 (0. 39); Fe, 194 (288); Mn, 85 (49); Se, 0. 02 (0. 03); Zn, 23 (9. 5) mg/kg dry matter (DM). Comparisons with the daily mineral requirements of horses of different categories indicated that most samples had sufficient levels of Mg, K, Fe and Mn while a minority was sufficient in Na, Co, Cu, I, Se, and Zn. The contents of Ca and P were enough to cover requirements of horses at maintenance but borderline to deficient for heavily exercising, gestating, lactating and rapidly growing horses. Thus, supplementation with Ca, P, Na, Co, Cu, I, Se, and Zn minerals is suggested to horses fed only forages. Forage management practices influenced the content of some macro- and microminerals. Contents of several minerals were positively correlated with increasing harvest number and negatively correlated with increasing wilting time...|$|E
40|$|Low Ti basalt 12040 {{and high}} Ti basalt 75055 have {{approximately}} the same Cl/P 2 O 5 ratio; the Cl is that remaining after a hot water leach. Pyroxene, plagioclase and ilmenite minerals separated from the basalts also tend to have this same Cl/P 2 O 5 ratio. This is evidence that these major minerals do not control the ratio since Cl and P would {{not be expected to}} partition to the same extent into each mineral. Olivine appears to be a special case. It is proposed that the grains measured contained inclusions with leachable and P 2 O 5 -related Cl. Dilute acid leaches of whole rock and separated minerals have the same or nearly the same Cl/P 2 O 5 ratios as the residual samples. Apatite and whitlockite were probably the phases leached. They must be constituents of the mesostasis and are present as <b>microminerals</b> or coatings on major mineral grains. The acid leach results imply little or no partition of Cl and P 2 O 5 into major minerals...|$|R
40|$|Allometric {{growth of}} body <b>microminerals</b> was {{examined}} in slow-growing laying-type cockerels (SG) and in fast-growing male broiler hybrids (FG) {{during the growing}} period from hatch to Day 22. Allometric coefficients for dry matter, copper, zinc, manganese and iron in relation to body weight were 1. 0914, 1. 0429, 1. 2743, 1. 0299 and 1. 0730 for SG chickens and 1. 0752, 0. 9450, 1. 0459, 1. 0779 and 1. 0059 for FG chickens, respectively. Allometric coefficients describing the relationships of Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe with dry matter weight were 0. 9495, 1. 1654, 0. 9390 and 0. 9772 for SG chickens and 0. 8754, 0. 9698, 0. 9981 and 0. 9336 for FG chickens, respectively. High allometric coefficient for Zn in SG genotype likely indicate a rapid growth of skeletal tissues which requires an adequate mineral nutrition {{during this period of}} growth. The deposition of Zn relative to live body and dry matter weights was higher (P < 0. 01) in SG chickens thus suggesting that the relative growth of this trace element may be affected by genotype...|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the specic effects of {{nutrients}} on the colonic microora with special emphasis on how human milk and its components inuence the intestinal microora in early infancy compared with formula-fed infants. Some proteins such as lactoferrin and lysozyme and some casein and whey peptides, as well as non-protein nitrogen derivatives, particularly nucleotides, inuence the growth of bidobacteria. In addition, b-lactose and milk oligossaccharides, together with milk gangliosides, seem to affect the intestinal colonisation of the infant {{and the establishment of}} a particular microora. Specic effects of protein and nitrogen derivatives, carbohydrates, lipids and someminerals on colonic microorganisms and how this affects health are also considered. There is an increasing interest in how non-absorbable carbohydrates affect the colonic microecology and how they may have a role in the maintenance of human health. However, there are only few data on how other nutrients, namely non-protein nitrogen derivatives, lipids, macrominerals, <b>microminerals,</b> and other non-nutrient components of foods may affect individual colonic microorganisms. Further research in these areas is highly recommended...|$|R
