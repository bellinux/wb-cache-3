5|$|After her Army career ended, Princess Matoika was {{transferred}} to the United States <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Line for European passenger service in early 1921. After that company's financial troubles resulted in her seizure, Princess Matoika was assigned to the newly formed United States Lines and resumed passenger service. In 1922, the ship was renamed SS President Arthur, in honor of the 21st U.S. President, Chester A. Arthur. When changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s, the ship was laid up in Baltimore in late 1923.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{she carried}} 48,000 {{passengers}} to France, and returned 34,000 to the United States after the Armistice. George Washington also carried U.S. President Woodrow Wilson to France twice for the Paris Peace Conference. George Washington was decommissioned in 1920 {{and handed over}} the United States Shipping Board (USSB), who reconditioned her for passenger service. SS George Washington sailed in transatlantic passenger service for both the United States <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company (one voyage) and United States Lines for ten years, before she was laid up in the Patuxent River in Maryland in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The Romanians {{boarded the}} SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French {{were picked up}} at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930; and the Belgians {{embarked}} at Barcelona. The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian {{who may have been}} English. The Brazilian team were picked up when the boat docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July. Yugoslavia travelled via the <b>mail</b> <b>steamship</b> Florida from Marseille.|$|E
50|$|Local {{resident}} and nationally notorious mountain man Seth Kinman was alerted by distress {{signals from the}} Northerner. In the raging gale, Kinman tethered himself to the shore and waded into the surf to save many passengers. Later, he was hailed as a hero and awarded a Bible and free life-time passage on Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamships.</b>|$|R
50|$|His {{second term}} {{was marked by}} efforts to sustain the Navy's combat forces in the Gulf of Mexico and along the far-distant Pacific coast, the {{beginning}} of construction of new steamers and an effort to obtain potential warships thorough the subsidization of civilian <b>mail</b> <b>steamships.</b> The latter was an early, and ultimately unsuccessful, experiment in public-private partnership.|$|R
5000|$|Company K: Muster in at San Francisco, February 3, 1864. This {{company was}} {{stationed}} at Benicia Barracks until September, 1864; {{it was then}} on duty in San Francisco as Provost Guard until July, 1865. During this time it provided guard detachments on Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>steamships.</b> Then it was at Benicia Barracks until its final muster out at that post October 25, 1865.|$|R
5|$|After her {{delivery}} to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used to}} transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The vessel was then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|West Conob {{was built}} in 1919 for the , part of the West series of ships—steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort—and was the 14th ship built at Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in San Pedro, California. She {{initially}} sailed for the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company and circumnavigated the globe twice by 1921. She began sailing to South America for Swayne & Hoyt Lines in 1925, and then, to Australia and New Zealand. When Swayne & Hoyt's operation {{was taken over by}} the Oceanic and Oriental Navigation Company a few years later, she sailed under the name Golden Eagle until 1934, when she was taken over by the Matson Navigation Company for service between Hawaii and the U.S. mainland and renamed Mauna Loa, after the large shield volcano on the Island of Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|In 1870, Shea {{became a}} clerk in the family business, Shea and Company. The company was {{shipping}} agent for the Allan Line of Royal <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamships</b> and the Ross Steamship Line. In 1887, when his uncle Ambrose Shea was appointed governor of the Bahamas, George replaced him as the firm's managing partner. He was later an agent for the North British Mercantile Insurance Company {{and a member of}} the Newfoundland Board of Revenue.|$|R
50|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{were used}} by Aéropostale on the African mail routes connecting Casablanca and Dakar. The aircraft also inaugurated a Paris-Madrid service.It became famous in South America because of the regular mail service it ensured, from France to Argentina, and further on. With this plane {{it was possible to}} send a letter from Paris to Santiago de Chile in what seemed then like an astonishingly short four days. Previously, the <b>mail</b> <b>steamships</b> had taken weeks or months.|$|R
50|$|William H. Aspinwall, {{the man who}} had won the bid for the {{building}} and operating of the Pacific <b>mail</b> <b>steamships,</b> conceived a plan to construct a railway across the isthmus. He and his partners created a company registered in New York, the Panama Railroad Company, raised $1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama and go on to California.|$|R
25|$|In October, 1910, the San Juan was {{involved}} in a collision with its fellow Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company steamer City of Sydney. The collision occurred while the San Juan was docked at the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company's pier in San Francisco. The incident was attributed to a misunderstanding of signals.|$|E
25|$|When in 1850, the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company {{established}} a competing {{line to the}} U.S. <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company between New York and Chagres, George Law placed an opposition Pacific Line of steamers (SS Antelope, SS Columbus, SS Isthmus, SS Republic) in the Pacific running from Panama to San Francisco. In April 1851 the rivalry was ended when an agreement was made between the companies, the U.S. <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company purchased the Pacific Mail steamers on the Atlantic side (SS Crescent City, SS Empire City, SS Philadelphia), and George Law sold his ships and new line to the Pacific Mail.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1850 s there were high hopes in the Australian colonies that the establishment of government-subsidised <b>steamship</b> <b>mail</b> services between Britain and Australia would regularise the flow of news and hence enable a more predictable and productive economic, political and social engagement between the colonies and the Mother Country. There was also a growing awareness that colonial expansion by European powers and increasing globalisation of shipping and trade meant that wars amongst European states were increasingly likely to have global ramifications. Feelings of insecurity were exacerbated by the irregularity of communication and by the unreliability of much news from overseas. As it turned out, there was little improvement in communication between Britain and Australia throughout the 1850 s. Steamship services, first introduced in 1852, were plagued by technical and commercial failure. Furthermore, the Crimean War had a major impact on services as the demand for troopships it generated diverted steamship resources from the Australian route to the Mediterranean. Just when news from Europe was most eagerly wanted by colonial Australians, the system of <b>mail</b> <b>steamships</b> which promised the long sought for regularity in its flow was withdrawn, replaced for a period by unpredictable sailing packets...|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} of these ships, the passenger-cargo vessels Colon (2,686 tons) and Colima (2,906 tons), were {{delivered}} in November 1872 and April 1873 respectively, but {{in the spring of}} 1873, Pacific Mail informed Roach that it was unable to meet its obligations. Pacific Mail's President and another company director had depleted the company's cash reserves with a stock manipulation scheme, and then absconded with a large sum of money after the scheme fell through. To make matters worse, stock speculator Jay Gould, in an attempt to gain control of the company by driving down its share price, subsequently persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind Pacific Mail's $500,000 subsidy. Roach was put in a difficult position since he had several Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>steamships</b> still on the slipways, but he managed to delay his own creditors and renegotiate the Pacific Mail contract, reducing the latter's monthly obligations from $75,000 to $35,000.|$|R
500|$|Starting in October 1907, Elba was {{modified}} to handle an observation balloon. The balloon {{was linked to}} the ship via a telephone line, and was used to spot naval mines. During the annual fleet maneuvers in 1908, Elba and her balloon were used to keep watch on the harbor entrance of Augusta, Sicily, which proved to be effective in alerting defenders to attacking warships. By the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War in September 1911, Elba had been stationed in Italy's East African colonies, Eritrea and Somaliland. In January 1912, she and her sister [...] escorted a pair of <b>mail</b> <b>steamships</b> to the Red Sea, where they were used to enforce the blockade of several Ottoman ports. Elba remained in the region {{for the remainder of the}} war, assisting in the blockade effort. Ottoman naval forces had already been defeated at the Battle of Kunfuda Bay, so there was no chance for Elba to see action. The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October, ending the war.|$|R

50|$|SS Koombana was a late Edwardian-era passenger, cargo and <b>mail</b> {{carrying}} <b>steamship.</b> From March 1909 to March 1912, she operated coastal {{liner services}} between Fremantle, Western Australia and various ports {{in the northwest}} of that State. She {{is best known for}} disappearing at an unknown location north of Port Hedland, Western Australia, during a tropical cyclone on 20 March 1912, killing 74 passengers and 76 crew; in total, 150 people died.|$|R
50|$|When {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in California, the first hulk of an old iron revenue steamer, the James K. Polk, was beached {{at the foot of}} the bluff near Clarke's Point and became the foundation of the first real passenger landing in the city. It was at this site that the population of San Francisco met the Pacific mail liner the Oregon to receive the official announcement that California had been admitted to the Union. The bluff at the point was quickly leveled and on the land created a wharf was built that became the first regular berthing place, for a short time, for the Pacific <b>mail</b> <b>steamships.</b> Whatever products came to California, and whatever California produced, had to be carried by ship. In the first year of the gold rush, hundreds of ships were beached and abandoned in the tidal flats of Yerba Buena Cove, and numerous ships were run aground to become parts of the city itself. In 1853, the Vallejo Street wharf lease was granted, and a larger wharf was built.|$|R
50|$|In the meantime, on {{the second}} day of October, three days after an order was made overruling the motion, and ten days before a writ of error herein was filed in the clerk's office at the circuit court, the marshal already {{executed}} the original order of the court, placing the prisoner on board the steamship New York, one of the Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>steamships,</b> then about to start for China; she departed on said vessel on the seventh day of October. It thus appears that the order of deportation had been fully executed, with the petitioner for the writ of habeas corpus still placed outside the jurisdiction of the court and of the United States, the execution of the order having transpired six days before the writ of error was filed in the circuit court and it being several days before a decision was issued. The question, therefore, was deemed a moot question regarding a plaintiff in error, for even if she was permitted to give bail it could be of no value to her as the order by which she was remanded had already been executed and she was no longer in the custody of the marshal or in prison.|$|R

25|$|West Kasson was {{launched}} on March 15, 1919 and {{delivered to the}} United States Shipping Board on June 30, 1919. Initially, she was operated by Pacific <b>Mail</b> <b>Steamship</b> Company, who inaugurated a round-the-world service to promote American shipping.|$|E

2500|$|In 1849 William H. Aspinwall, {{the man who}} had won the bid for the {{building}} and operating of the Pacific <b>mail</b> <b>steamships,</b> conceived a plan to construct a railway across the isthmus of Panama; he and his partners created a company registered in New York, the Panama Railroad Company, raised US$1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama and go on to California or return home. Cholera, yellow fever, and malaria took a deadly toll on the Railroad workers, and despite the continual importation of large numbers of new workers, there were times when the work stalled for simple lack of alive and semi-fit workers. All railroad supplies and nearly all foodstuffs had to be imported from thousands of miles away, greatly adding to the cost of construction. Laborers came from the United States, the Caribbean Islands, and as far away as Ireland, India, China, and Australia. Upon completion in 1855 the road stretched [...] and had cost over $8,000,000 and about 5,000 lives. By 1855 this arduous trip across the Isthmus of Panama had been shortened to a one-day $25.00 excursion on the Panama Railroad.|$|R
50|$|While the Irish Sea {{trade was}} their first and main business, two other avenues opened up to James and George Burns. In 1839 the Liverpool {{connection}} was greatly strengthened when George Burns was introduced to Samuel Cunard and raised £270,000 in subscriptions to establish the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. This company secured a seven-year contract from the Admiralty to carry the American <b>mails</b> by <b>steamship.</b> James and George, with the MacIvers, were founding partners and shareholders with Cunard in the new venture. While this took George's attention south to Liverpool, James concentrated on the Glasgow business, and in 1845 G. and J. Burns acquired {{an interest in the}} developing west highland steamer services by purchasing the Castle Line. This however was quickly re-sold to their nephew David Macbrayne, their shipping clerk David Hutcheson, and his brother Alexander.|$|R
