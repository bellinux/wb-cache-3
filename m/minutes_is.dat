40|$|Silkworm rearing is an {{applied science}} based on theory of {{anatomical}} physiology of silkworm and silk worm diseases. With an ultimate aim of producing {{more and better}} {{quantity and quality of}} silk (a natural protein fiber) and to expand the areas for its production country wise regions, many strains have been introduced date to date. A new strain of silkworm (K 2) was evaluated to include it in the efforts to raise our national productive potential of natural silk. For this purpose the biology of this strain was determined under different sets of temperature and humidity. The study was carried out in the old insectary, Department of Agri. Entomology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. The eggs of silkworm were brought from Directorate of Sericulture, Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu & Kashmir. The eggs were shifted to four different sets of temperatures, 30, 25, 20 oC and at room temperature as reference. The relative humidity (R. H) 60, 70 and 80 % for first three temperatures was maintained, respectively. In each group equal number of larvae was placed and groups were assigned as: To = Room Temperature and R. H., T 1 = 30 oC with 60 % R. H., T 2 = 25 oC with 70 % R. H. and T 3 = 20 oC with 80 % R. H. The experiment was laid out in completely randomized design. It was observed that the longest period (4440 minutes) during first instar was taken when silkworm larvae were subjected to 20 oC and 80 % R. H, where as the shortest period (2010 <b>minutes)</b> <b>was</b> recorded when silkworm larvae were subjected to 30 oC and 60 % R. H.
