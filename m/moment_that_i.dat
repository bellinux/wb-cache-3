Eliezer's family is first moved to the smaller ghetto, {{but they are not}} told their final destination, only that they may each take a few personal belongings. The Hungarian police, wielding truncheons and rifle butts, march Eliezer's neighbours through the streets. [...] "It was from that <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> began to hate them, and my hate is still the only link between us today." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackman also {{watched a}} woman undergo brain tumor surgery and was shaken {{to see the}} woman have similar blond hair to his wife: [...] "All I {{could think of was}} my wife on that table. As much as I'd read the script and theorized and practiced philosophy, I knew in that <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was so not ready for death." [...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders." [...] As the space traveler, Jackman practiced the state of zen but also exhibited a continued persistence in his endeavor.|$|E
500|$|The first Sex Pistols gig {{to attract}} broader {{attention}} {{was as a}} supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. Rotten [...] "was now really pushing the barriers of performance, walking off stage, sitting with the audience, throwing Jordan across the dance floor and chucking chairs around, before smashing some of Eddie and the Hot Rods' gear." [...] The band's first review appeared in the NME, accompanied by a brief interview in which Steve Jones declared, [...] "Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos." [...] Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London {{in search of the}} Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at SEX, they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs. The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols-style group, the Buzzcocks. As Devoto later put it, [...] "My life changed the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw the Sex Pistols." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew for sure he was going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E
500|$|A New York Times {{article by}} Peter De Jonge {{explained}} that [...] "The West Wing is never plotted {{out for more}} than a few weeks ahead and has no major story lines", which De Jonge believed was because [...] "with characters who have no flaws, it is impossible to give them significant arcs". Sorkin has stated: [...] "I seldom plan ahead, not because I don't think it's good to plan ahead, there just isn't time." [...] Sorkin has also said, [...] "As a writer, I don't like to answer questions until the very <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencers TV critic John Levesque has commented that Sorkin's writing process [...] "can make for ill-advised plot developments". Further complicating the matter, in television, Sorkin will have a hand in writing every episode, rarely letting other writers earn full credit on a script. Peter De Jonge has reported that ex-writers of The West Wing have claimed that [...] "even by the spotlight-hogging standards of Hollywood, Sorkin has been exceptionally ungenerous in his sharing of writing credit". In a comment to GQ magazine in 2008, Sorkin said, [...] "I'm helped by a staff of people who have great ideas, but the scripts aren't written by committee." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{he worked}} on the mural, Picasso said: [...] "The Spanish {{struggle}} is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom.

In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death." ...|$|E

His name was Victoricus, and he carried many letters, and he gave me one of them. I read the heading: [...] "The Voice of the Irish". As I began the letter, I imagined in that <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> heard the voice of those very people who were near the wood of Foclut, which is beside the western sea—and they cried out, as with one voice: [...] "We appeal to you, holy servant boy, to come and walk among us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. I said {{a lot of things in}} the heat of the <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to say it to me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E

2500|$|British {{director}} Brian Grant {{was hired}} to direct Summer's video for [...] "She Works Hard for the Money". The video was a success, being nominated for MTV Music Video Awards for Best Female Video and Best Choreography; Summer {{became one of the}} first black artists, and the first African-American Female Artist to have her video played in heavy rotation on MTV. Grant would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa HBO concert special, A Hot Summers Night. Grant who was a fan of the song State of Independence had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal. [...] According to Grant, [...] "It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there." [...] He thought if this was that kind of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal Grant was informed that he could not use the kids because the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). [...] "It's a <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end". When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for [...] "State of Independence".|$|E
