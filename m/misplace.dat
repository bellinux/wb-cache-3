Tom {{commands}} Old Man Willow to release them, singing him to sleep, and shelters the hobbits {{in his house}} for two nights.

He even tosses the Ring {{in the air and}} makes it disappear, but then produces it from his other hand and returns it to Frodo. While this seems to demonstrate that he has unique and mysterious power over the Ring, the idea of giving him the Ring for safekeeping is rejected in Book Two's second chapter, [...] "The Council of Elrond". Gandalf says, rather, that [...] "the Ring has no power over him..." [...] and believes that Tom would not find the Ring to be very important and so might simply <b>misplace</b> it.|$|E

50|$|Property is {{generally}} deemed {{to have been}} mislaid or <b>misplaced</b> if it is found {{in a place where}} the true owner likely did intend to set it, but then simply forgot to pick it up again. For example, a wallet found in a shop lying on a counter near a cash register will likely be deemed <b>misplaced</b> rather than lost. Under common law principles, the finder of a <b>misplaced</b> object has a duty to turn it over to the owner of the premises, on the theory that the true owner is likely to return to that location to search for his <b>misplaced</b> item. If the true owner does not return within a reasonable time (which varies considerably depending on the circumstances), the property becomes that of the owner of the premises.|$|R

Still water, she pondered, runs deep; certainly under this disguise must lurk a brilliant fancy, a penetrating but a mature and ready judgment --are they not written by nature's hand on that broad high brow? With such lovely mustachios can he be aught but generous, noble-minded, magnanimous? Can such eyes belong to any but a hero? And she fed the delusion. She would smile upon him with intense fondness, when, after wasting hours over a few lines of poetry, he would <b>misplace</b> all the adjectives and barbarously entreat the metre. She laughed with gratification, when, excited by the bright sayings that fell from her lips, the youth put forth some platitude, dim as the lamp in the expiring fire-fly. When he slipped in grammar she saw malice under it, when he retailed a borrowed jest she called it a good one, and when he used --as princes sometimes will --bad language, she discovered in it a charming simplicity.|$|E
