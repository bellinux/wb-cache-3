40|$|Extract] Laryngeal {{paralysis}} is characterised by {{a failure}} of {{one or both of}} the arytenoids to move during the respiratory cycle. Failure of abduction during inspiration causes an obstruction to airflow. The disease is usually a consequence of failure of innervation to the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, rather than primary muscle disease. The condition is commonly encountered in old Labrador Retrievers, Afghan Hounds and some other large breeds. <b>Males</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> affected than females and most affected Labradors are older than 10 years. Laryngeal paralysis is usually considered to be a manifestation of a more generalised polyneuropathy. There is no compelling association with hypothyroidism. Congenital laryngeal paralysis occurs in Bouvier des Flandres as an autosomal dominant trait. Trauma and neoplasia are rather less common causes, although thyroid carcinomas and cranial mediastinal tumours can certainly cause laryngeal paralysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{different}} {{populations in}} Saylla, a Peruvian village near Cusco, known for chicharrones, a local pork dish, were surveyed by serology and stool examination {{to determine the}} prevalence and epidemiologic charac-teristics of Taenia solium infection. Group I (n 5 43), the chicharroneros, were members of families professionally devoted to the making and selling of chicharrones, and Group II (n 5 102) was {{a sample of the}} general population of the same village. Unlike people in Group I, general villagers only occasionally prepare or sell this food product, and then only to their neighbors or relatives. The prevalence of taeniasis was extremely high (8. 6 %) for the chichar-roneros and 3 % for the general villagers. Seroprevalence for cysticercosis by immunoblot was similarly high in both groups (23. 3 % and 23. 8 %, respectively). Being female, older than 30, and having daily contact with pork were factors strongly associated with a positive serologic result for cysticercosis in the chicharroneros, whereas <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> seropositive in the general villagers group.

Overall, the study explored the population characteristics and use of habitat of the Northern Map turtle (Graptemys geographica) within a small bay within the Gananoque River system in South Eastern Ontario. Results from field observations showed that the bay population of Northern Map turtles appeared to be female biased. Use of habitat features differed by females, males and juveniles at different times throughout the summer (May-August). Females were frequently observed basking within the bay in May and June while <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> observed throughout July and August. Nesting by female Northern Map turtles appeared to be concentrated atop small islands scattered throughout the bay. Nest sites were located within narrow bands of soils. The most prominent difference between site conditions at the monitored nests was soil moisture; this was likely the result of different soil materials at each site. Air and soil temperature {{did not differ significantly}} between sites. Additional research could be pursued on the bay population of Northern Map turtles looking at the following: movement patterns by females out of the bay post-nesting, genetic linkages to other satellite populations of Northern Map turtles in the Thousand Islands, hatchling success and sex composition, overall species health due to food availability and lastly the effects of anthropogenic stressors...|$|E

Data were collected retrospectively on all children under 17 years of age with a SRI, presenting to the emergency department of a major teaching hospital, over a 6 -month period, and entered into a Microsoft Access database. A total of 1143 SRIs were identified which had occurred over a 6 -month period, from 53 different sports. There was a high proportion of humerus and back SRIs in females, and a higher proportion of falls in females. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> involved in collisions. Children with SRI were not using protective equipment in 94 % of cases. Advice regarding rest, ice, compression and elevation (RICE) /general injury advice was given to 25 % of patients and regarding injury preventive measures in less than 0. 1 % of cases. Of children, 28 % had previously attended with a SRI. We also observed a lower rate of analgesia prescription to children under age 4, compared to children of an older age, and rarity of topical analgesic prescription. Overall, 10 % of SRIs required admission, with 65 % of these cases needing orthopaedic intervention.

In all cases but 2, the dislocation occurred at the fourth intersternebral joint. In 42 of the 51 cases (82. 4 %), the dislocation was encased by regenerative cartilaginous callus that protruded internally into the thoracic cavity (intrathoracic callus) and/or externally to the outer aspect of the sternum (extrathoracic callus). Displacement of dislocated ends of the sternum into the thoracic cavity was present in 19 of 51 cases (36. 5 %). Coincident minimal or mild right ventricular epicardial and subepicardial fibrosis was observed in 22 of the 51 cases (43 %) but was not observed in any of the mice in the absence of sternal segment dislocation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Emergency {{admission}} {{rates have}} been rising rapidly in Britain. Studies defining the underlying factors are needed. AIM: To determine the principal diagnoses, demographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with emergency medical admissions. METHOD: Cohort study based on the Greater Glasgow Health Board population of 810, 423 adults. A fully anonymized dataset linkage of 43, 247 adult emergency admissions to Glasgow medical beds in 1997 was obtained. Emergency admission rates were analysed by diagnosis, age, sex, Carstairs' deprivation category, and by individual general practices (after adjustment for other factors). RESULTS: The commonest principal diagnoses were chest pain (9. 6 %), chronic obstructive airways disease (5. 6 %), angina (5. 4 %), heart failure (4. 1 %), {{and acute myocardial infarction}} (3. 9 %). Twenty-one per cent of patients were coded as having 'ill-defined signs or symptoms'. Emergency medical admission rates rose with the age of the patient, doubling with every two decades' age increase. Admission rates for patients from deprived areas were twice those from affluent areas. <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> admitted than females (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 19). After adjustment for age, sex, and deprivation, the general practices' emergency medical admission rates showed an almost twofold difference between the top and bottom deciles. CONCLUSION: Emergency medical admission rates are higher among the elderly, males, and deprived populations. This has implications for equitable resource distribution in the National Health Service. Admissions for exclusion of myocardial disease were common; however, myocardial infarction was not the final diagnosis in two-thirds of these patients.

AimThe {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate patient-reported outcomes following implant-supported restorative therapy in a randomly selected patient sample. Material and MethodsFour thousand seven hundred and sixteen patients were randomly selected from the data register of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. A questionnaire containing 10 questions related to implant-supported restorative therapy was mailed to each of the individuals about 6 years after therapy. Associations between questionnaire data, and (i) patient-related, (ii) clinician-related and (iii) therapy-related variables were identified by multivariate analyses. ResultsThree thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven patients (81 %) responded to the questionnaire. It was demonstrated that the overall satisfaction among patients was high. Older patients presented with an overall more positive perception of the results of the therapy than younger patients and <b>males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> satisfied in terms of esthetics than females.

Furthermore, age-related loss of chromosome Y (LOY) is frequent in normal hematopoietic cells, but the phenotypic consequences of LOY have been elusive. From analysis of 1, 153 elderly men, we report that LOY in peripheral blood was associated with risks of all-cause mortality (hazards ratio (HR) = 1. 91, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 17 - 3. 13; 637 events) and non-hematological cancer mortality (HR = 3. 62, 95 % CI = 1. 56 - 8. 41; 132 events).

Pneumococcal serotyping was performed. ResultsThere were 1378 IPD cases, {{with a mean age of}} 61 ± 17 years; 65 % were males. Compared to the general population aged 18 – 64 years, patients with IPD of the same age group were more often current smokers (57 % vs. 35 %, p < 0. 001) and alcohol abusers (21 % vs. 6 %, p < 0. 001). Among patients with IPD, young adults (aged 18 – 49 vs. 50 – 64 vs. ≥ 65 years) were more commonly current smokers (71 % vs. 40 % vs. 14 %, p < 0. 001) and alcohol abusers (23 % vs. 18 % vs. 6 %, p < 0. 001). <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> smokers and alcohol abusers than females. Smokers and alcohol abusers more often had underlying diseases such as HIV infection and chronic liver disease. Pneumonia was more common in smokers and peritonitis in alcohol abusers. Alcohol abuse conferred higher mortality. Certain pneumococcal serotypes, such as serotypes 1, 8, and 23 F, more frequently caused IPD in smokers, and serotypes 4, 11 A, and 19 F in alcohol abusers. ConclusionsSmoking and alcohol abuse are the most preventable risk factors for IPD. Implementing smoking and alcohol abuse cessation programs and a pneumococcal vaccination schedule are essential to diminish the burden of pneumonia and other pneumococcal infections...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} drugs of abuse in urine and blood samples processed at referral laboratory in Pakistan so that information {{on the type of}} drugs used can be identified and used for ready reference for future strategy. Study Design: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Clinical Laboratory of The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from July 2006 to March 2008. Methodology: Retrospective review of records were done for the common drugs that are used for screening at the Clinical Laboratory include alcohol, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine and opiates. Alcohol was tested in blood and others were identified using urine. Percentages of tests screened positive and negative for individual drugs were computed by using SPSS 16. 0. The ratio between male and female users was also established. RESULTS: A total of 17, 714 tests were performed for drugs. The mean age of the patients whose samples were processed was 30 +/- 14. 84 years. Majority used benzodiazepines 520 / 1317 (39. 5 %) among the samples tested for drug of abuse, followed by cannabinoids 423 / 5450 (7. 8 %), alcohol 75 / 1302 (5. 8 %), barbiturates 32 / 1148 (2. 8 %), opiates 137 / 5640 (2. 4 %), cocaine 5 / 1655 (0. 3 %) and amphetamine 3 / 1202 (0. 2 %). In all, males 15411 (87 %) were tested more frequently as compared to females 2303 (13 %). CONCLUSION: <b>Males</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> tested for drug abuse; however, drug abuse is increasingly seen among females. Benzodiazepines are the most frequently used. The same pattern of drugs abuse existed in different gender and age group. There is a need to explore the pattern and type of drug abuse on national scale...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the status of print media coverage of male and female athletes in Nigeria. The study monitored the frequency of occurrence of print media reporting on male and female athletes. Articles and photographs of athletes in print media within the period of a year were analyzed. The results of the study confirmed that <b>male</b> athletes <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> reported in National Daily Newspapers in Nigeria than female athletes. This gives more visibility to male athletes than female athletes...|$|R
40|$|Underemployment is {{generally}} conceived as {{excess labour supply}} associated with employed persons – that is, as a situation where employed persons would like to work more hours at prevailing wage rates. Using information collected by the 2001 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, this study seeks to investigate the extent of underemployment {{and its effects on}} outcomes such as income, welfare dependence and subjective well-being. It is found that over one in six employed persons is underemployed, corresponding to a failure to utilise 5 per cent of hours supplied by employed persons. Underemployment <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> associated with part-time employment for females, but for <b>males</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequently</b> associated with full-time employment. Models estimated of the effects of underemployment on outcomes imply that, while unemployment clearly has greater adverse consequences, underemployment is nonetheless associated with significant detrimental effects on the outcomes examined. Negative effects are found for both part-time employed and full-time employed workers who would prefer to work more hours, but effects are greater for underemployed part-time workers, and are particularly large for part-time workers who would like to work full-time. Indeed, for part-time workers seeking full-time employment, effects attributable to underemployment are, for some outcomes, not far short of those attributable to unemployment. ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{observed}} that when males mated with a non-sibling female, {{the duration of}} their copulation was prolonged, and consequently the <b>males</b> <b>were</b> cannibalized <b>more</b> <b>frequently.</b> When <b>males</b> mated with a sibling female, they copulated briefly, and thus <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to escape cannibalism. By escaping, their chance of mating again with a non-kin female likely would be increased. These observations suggest that males can adaptively adjust their investment based {{on the degree of}} genetic relatedness of the female in order to avoid inbreeding depression.|$|R
