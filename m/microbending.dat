40|$|Pressure induced <b>microbends</b> {{have been}} created in a 50 µm graded index {{multimode}} optical fibre with spatial periodicity Λ = 4. 5 mm, embedded in the sample of araldite. If high pressure is applied directly to optical fibre having <b>microbends,</b> it may break, and if pressure is applied to embedded fibre in a solid structure without <b>microbends,</b> the sensitivity is lower. In this paper, {{a combination of the}} embedded sensor and <b>microbend</b> sensor is presented. It has the advantage of sensing high pressure on a structure with the sensitivity of a <b>microbend</b> sensor without breaking the optical fibre.

The <b>microbend</b> optic fiber sensor works well in a three-point bending experiment.

40|$|A {{new class}} of highly compact {{photonic}} <b>microbend</b> exploiting whispering gallery propagation is analyzed. Critical design dimensions are relaxed by using multimode waveguiding. A small outer sidewall radius enables tight arbitrary angle of rotation for the guided light, and the inner radius is reduced beyond the caustic radius to minimize {{the impact of the}} <b>microbend</b> dimensions on losses. Whispering gallery operation is compared with single-mode <b>microbend</b> operation using a combination of full-vectorial wave-equation models and 2 -D and 3 -D finite-difference time domain models. The dependence of loss on fabricated dimension is shown to be reduced by an order of magnitude. Waveguide width variations of ± 100 nm lead to loss variations of only ± 0. 01 dB in the whispering gallery regime, contrasting favorably with ± 0. 10 dB loss variations for the single-mode regime for a 20 µm radius and for 1. 5 µm input waveguide widths. Smaller radius <b>microbends</b> show comparable trends albeit with higher losses and increased sensitivity to width variations. The sensitivity of <b>microbend</b> loss to small changes in narrow waveguide width is attributed to the excitation of a restricted mode group. Moving the inner sidewall beyond the caustic radius allows relaxed tolerance light propagation in the whispering gallery regime. Losses down to 0. 2 dB/ 180 ° and polarization conversion of down to - 25 dB/ 180 are predicted...|$|R
50|$|While {{the concept}} of {{stamping}} sheet metal components has traditionally focused on the macro level (e.g. vehicle, aircraft, and packaging applications), the continuing trend of miniaturization has driven research into micro- forms of stamping. From the early development of micropunching machines {{in the early to}} mid-2000s to the creation and testing of a <b>microbending</b> machine at Northwestern University in the 2010s, microstamping tools continue to be researched as alternatives to machining and chemical etching. Examples of applications of sheet metal microstamping include electrical connectors, micromeshes, microswitches, microcups for electron guns, wristwatch components, handheld device components, and medical devices. However, key issues such as quality control, high-volume application, and the need for material research into mechanical properties must be addressed before full-scale implementation of the technology is realized.|$|E
40|$|<b>Microbending</b> plays a {{key role}} in the bend loss of optical fibres. To numerically {{investigate}} <b>microbending</b> induced loss, an analytical model for <b>microbending</b> in optical fibres with arbitrary refractive index profiles is presented. In this model, random perturbations of the fibre core along the fibre axis are described by an analytical function whose power spectral density is derived from an exponential autocorrelation function. Using the model together with the beam propagation method, <b>microbending</b> loss is investigated for several different types of optical fibre, which include the traditional single-mode/multimode fibres (SMF/MMF) as used in existing optical networks, and typical few-mode/ring-core fibres (FMF/RCF) with the potential for future ultra high-speed optical networks. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing the <b>microbending</b> loss of a SMF computed using coupled mode theory and our results. Simulation results show that, under the condition of launching only the fundamental mode into the optical fibres, the SMF and RCF supporting only one radial mode have nearly equal <b>microbending</b> loss, whilst the FMF and MMF have relatively low <b>microbending</b> loss. In addition, the <b>microbending</b> loss of the RCF is shown to be dependent on the ring core thickness...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{pseudo-random}} transverse microscopic corrugations on the amplitude attenuation {{of the fundamental}} hybrid mode in curved graded-index monomode fibres is investigated. For {{the first time in}} the literature, a general formulation of <b>microbending</b> loss in local toroidal co-ordinates is presented. The formulation does not, in any way, depend on the existence of a large number of statistically identical and independent monomode fibres of which the given specimen is an ensemble averaged sample. This general formalism is used to derive an expression for the <b>microbending</b> coupling spectrum which encapsulates the essential analytical characteristics of both non-zero polarisation and curvature effects.

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} commercial UV-cured polymeric coatings of optical fibers is evaluated using dynamic mechanic analysis. The {{results indicate that}} relaxation of stresses and/or strains in these coatings occurs by creep deformation. The axial strain-induced viscoelastic stresses in optical fibers are derived from the exact viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric coatings. Compressive radial stress on the glass fiber produces <b>microbending</b> losses, and therefore, <b>microbending</b> losses in double-coated optical fibers that are caused by axial strain-induced creep deformation of polymeric coatings are investigated. These <b>microbending</b> losses can be minimized by suitably selecting the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coatings, as follows. The radius, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the primary coating should be increased, but the Young's modulus and relaxation time of the primary coating should be decreased. The radius, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the secondary coating should be decreased, but the relaxation time of the secondary coating should be increased. When the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coating are chosen to minimize the <b>microbending</b> loss, the thickness and Young's modulus of the secondary coatings should {{be large enough to}} withstand an external mechanical force.

To clarify the effect of heating on springback for ultra-thin metal foils, high precision <b>microbending</b> test was carried out under the different temperature of room temperature (RT), 300 ºC and 600 ºC. As-received rolled and electrochemically polished pure titanium foils with thickness of 0. 1, 0. 05 and 0. 02 mm were used. To evaluate the springback in each thickness, springback angle of pure titanium foils with different thicknesses was measured under the same maximum bending strain. As results, the springback angle was decreased with increasing the process temperature for all materials and thickness conditions. Furthermore, the thinner the foil, the larger the springback angle, irrespective of the temperature conditions. The relationship between the heating temperature and the decreasing ratio of the springback angle was experimentally demonstrated. 1...|$|E
