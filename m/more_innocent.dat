25|$|At most times, Toad {{is portrayed}} as a rather cowardly character, {{but the fact that}} he {{actually}} knows about his cowardice makes him one of the <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> and humbler characters in the series. Despite his fears, Toad is usually {{one of the few people}} who tries his best to support Mario when he is on his adventures, from providing items to actually adventuring alongside the hero on his quest. Despite the fact that Toad is usually seen as a cheerful character, he can get extremely distressed when a major event occurs, such as the kidnapping of the princess.|$|E
500|$|Despite Ghost itself garnering mixed reviews, [...] "Red Lips" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, who complimented its overall production. However, the track failed to impact any national record charts. An accompanying music video for [...] "Red Lips" [...] {{was directed by}} Terry Richardson, and was premiered through Richardson's YouTube channel on June 12, 2012. Critics directed their commentaries towards Ferreira's increasingly risqué public persona, shifting from the <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> image with which she launched her career.|$|E

She dramatizes the jarring dynamic shifts in the clip by appearing as a fanged dominatrix torturing a far <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> version of herself in a neon pink wig and frilly white dress. It's a brilliant visual take on a breathtakingly badass verse, but really, they could've just focused in on her incredible facial expressions and called it a day. She's just that entertaining to watch." ...|$|E

50|$|On New Year's Eve morning, 1999, in Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C., {{a killer}} {{referred}} to as 'the Digger' guns down tens of innocent people at the metro station. A man, Gilbert Havel, sends {{a letter to the}} Mayor Gerald Kennedy demanding twenty million dollars cash to be dropped off at a park near Interstate 66 in bags. The letter goes on to explain that if his demands are not met the Digger will continue to strike at secret locations - at 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and at Midnight. Kennedy decides to deliver the money to the extortionist to ensure no <b>more</b> <b>innocents</b> are harmed and to make sure the town doesn't lose faith in the Mayor as election time is nearing.|$|R

Guillory was pleased to have played a <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> character, saying [...] "I've played floozies, psychopaths, assassins, crackheads... It's nice to do something with a lighter touch." [...] The production did not fare well in the ratings.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in 1921, and was credited to McCay's son Robert, though Canemaker states it is unlikely the elder McCay was not involved. [...] A 1921 New York Times review found the film [...] "interesting because of its excellent workmanship and fantastic character" [...] though it was [...] "not as brightly humorous" [...] as it could be. [...] Film critic Richard Eder contrasted the film's realistic nightmarishness with the <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> qualities {{that came to be}} associated with American cartoons. [...] In 2011, animator Bill Plympton restored the film, using Kickstarter to fund the project. [...] He had the film colorized, and actors Matthew Modine and Patricia Clarkson provided voices.|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by a [...] "concentrated {{multiplatform}} promotional campaign" [...] {{that included}} articles in Nickelodeon's magazine {{and on its}} webpage, an arc of three episodes introduced Burns' replacement Donovan Patton, who played Steve's brother Joe. Patton was subjected to {{the same kind of}} scrutiny to earn the job, and was selected out of 1,500 auditions. Patton had never seen Blue's Clues before he auditioned for the part but, like Burns, was the favorite with preschool test audiences. Burns helped train Patton to perform the role. [...] "We saw Steve Burns' retirement from the show as a chance to put Blue's Clues on a new course," [...] Johnson said. Also, according to Johnson, Joe's character was more like a preschooler and <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> than Steve.|$|E

500|$|Many of The Simpsons writers {{had left}} the show or were absent at the {{beginning}} of season four, which left Al Jean and Mike Reiss to brainstorm plot ideas alone. After brainstorming [...] "Homer the Heretic", they thought of Lisa entering a beauty pageant. They assigned Jeff Martin to write the episode because they assumed he would fill it with songs, like he had done on previous episodes. Martin obliged, and wrote the episode and its music. He also based the episode on some of his own experiences, such as the scene where Lisa has a caricature of herself drawn. According to Jeff Martin, [...] "I'm not sure if we could do this episode today. People had a <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> view of child beauty pageants before JonBenet Ramsey." ...|$|E
500|$|Plankton's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by American actor Doug Lawrence, normally credited as [...] "Mr. Lawrence." [...] The voice originated as an imitation {{of one of his}} deep-voiced high school friends. On television, Lawrence first used this voice for incidental characters on Rocko's Modern Life. Fellow voice actor Tom Kenny found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on SpongeBob. Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> voice for the character and turned him down. Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the [...] "Plankton!" [...] episode.

500|$|Critics {{directed}} their commentaries of {{the music}} video towards Ferreira's increasingly risqué public persona, shifting from the <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> image with which she launched her career. A writer from MuuMuse provided a favorable review, comparing it to the visuals for [...] "Criminal" [...] by Fiona Apple and summarizing that [...] "Sky Ferreira is cooler than anything you and I could ever be." [...] Becky Bain from Idolator stated that the appearance of Toby the Tarantula was [...] "somehow nowhere near as disconcerting as the image of Sky, looking washed out with platinum hair against a white background, crazily painting her face with a tube of red lipstick." [...] Michael Cragg of The Guardian felt that Ferreira's friendship with the controversial Richardson showcased a [...] "shift away from the pop princess {{she felt she was}} being moulded into", and commented that the spider was [...] "not for the faint-hearted".|$|E

500|$|... "Creative evolution", Shaw's {{version of}} the new science of eugenics, became an {{increasing}} theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in The Revolutionist's Handbook (1903), an appendix to Man and Superman, and developed them further during the 1920s in Back to Methuselah. A 1946 Life magazine article observed that Shaw had [...] "always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist". By 1933, {{in the preface to}} On the Rocks, he was writing that [...] "if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it"; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine Liberty in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: [...] "There are many {{people in the world who}} ought to be liquidated". Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, Life magazine concluded, [...] "this silliness can be classed with his <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> bad guesses".|$|E
500|$|According to Traci Paige Johnson, {{one of the}} {{producers}} and creators of Blue's Clues, Patton's character {{was more like a}} preschooler and <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> than Steve. Angela Santomero, another producer and creator, stated that Patton's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve". Patton liked working on Blue's Clues because, as he stated, [...] "I got to go be a kid for twelve hours a day". [...] He called the show's crew [...] "a real fun little family" [...] and a [...] "well-oiled machine" [...] by the time he joined the show. Patton remained on the show until the show's cancellation, and also appeared in its spin-off, Blue's Room, which premiered in 2004. Several years later, Patton said he had not yet grasped the enormity of replacing Burns, even after he became a parent and witnessed the show's effect on his own children. [...] He admitted that he preferred when his two-year-old daughter watched the Steve episodes.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{government}} line hardened, with Communist Party leaders arrested and trade unionists intimidated. On 10 September 1941, Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm were executed {{and many more}} imprisoned following the milk strike in Oslo. Hansteen's execution was later seen as a watershed moment, dividing the occupation into its <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> and more deadly phases. The same year the Statspolitiet ("State Police"), abolished in 1937, was reestablished to assist the Gestapo in Norway, and radio sets were confiscated across the country. Though these were all Terboven's decisions, Quisling agreed with them {{and went on to}} denounce {{the government}}-in-exile as [...] "traitors." [...] As a result of the toughened stance, an informal [...] "ice front" [...] emerged, with Nasjonal Samling supporters ostracised from society. Quisling remained convinced this was an anti-German sentiment that would fade away once Berlin had handed power over to the Nasjonal Samling. However, the only concessions he won in 1941 were having the heads of ministries promoted to official ministers of the government and independence for the party secretariat.|$|E

Realizing Fred has been infected, Gunn brings her {{to the rest of the}} gang in the abandoned ballroom, saying they need to get her to a hospital; Angel stands in the way, determined to keep <b>more</b> <b>innocents</b> from dying. Groosalugg, hearing the slugs under the floor, breaks through the wood with an ax. Below, there is a hidden swimming pool, filled with the glowing slugs. They begin chasing after the gang. Everyone retreats to a kitchen and barricade themselves there, except for Gunn, who slips out to ask Wesley for help. Wesley is very bitter about his exile from the group and refuses until Gunn reveals that Fred has been infected. He tosses Gunn a bottle of alcohol and tells him he'll help this time, but he never wants to see any of his former friends again.|$|R

500|$|According to {{journalist}} Mary von Aue from Vice magazine, Bedtime Stories is the [...] "most important" [...] album {{released by}} Madonna. For {{months leading up}} to its release, the promotion associated cited the record as an apology for the singer's sexually provocative imagery. Critics had also hoped for a return to <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> form of music. However Madonna instead chose to portray herself as unapologetic for her imagery, as well as talking about scrutiny that female musicians faced. Madonna went opposite to what was being portrayed as the theme of the album in the promotional campaigns, and continued addressing her critics and people who had tried to shame her for being provocative. Philadelphia's Patrick DeMarco described that [...] "this was a record that cemented Madonna as the icon we know today". Jamieson Cox from Time called the album as [...] "underrated", while The Plain Dealers Troy Smith explained that it was [...] "overlooked" [...] because was [...] "sandwiched between her most controversial work (Erotica) and, arguably, her best (Ray of Light)". He praised songs like [...] "Take a Bow" [...] which considered as [...] "the best romantic ballad of her career".|$|E
500|$|While critics praised Morgan for his {{performance}} in the role, their reaction to the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of BuddyTV felt that John is a [...] "rather divisive character", with some fans not understanding John's motivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found the character to be [...] "completely fascinating". He chose [...] "In My Time of Dying" [...] as the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's contributions, stating, [...] "Even if you're not {{a huge fan of}} Poppa Winchester, I think it's impossible not to be moved by the final ten minutes of this episode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that he's proud of him, is one hell of a tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park." [...] Williams praised Matt Cohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel episode [...] "In the Beginning", believing that he [...] "did an excellent job at portraying a <b>more</b> <b>innocent</b> John Winchester than we've ever seen before".|$|E
