5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found <b>my</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and <b>my</b> <b>music.</b> I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E

5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to <b>my</b> <b>music.</b> The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
25|$|California {{was also}} the {{location}} for the film's penultimate scene, in which Shankar, looking out over a windswept beach, questions the validity of his attempts to bring Indian culture to America.

25|$|Because in Catholicism {{you are a}} born sinner and you're {{a sinner}} all your life. No matter how {{you try to get}} away from it, the sin is within you all the time.

25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre.

I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

25|$|Having {{achieved}} international fame over 1966–67, Ravi Shankar {{spent the}} early part of 1968 in India filming a documentary of his life, Raga, and writing his first autobiography, <b>My</b> <b>Music,</b> My Life. Both of these projects allowed him to reflect on his status as an ambassador for Indian culture and on the criticism that he received from purists and some fellow musicians in India, who accused him of betraying his roots and commercialising Indian classical music. In a 2007 interview, Shankar continued to refute such criticism, citing his adherence to the guru-shishya tradition, whereby he had nurtured the development of his protégés Harihar Rao, Amiyo Das Gupta, Kartick Kumar and Shamim Ahmed after moving to the United States. He also highlighted the 1968 Festival from India revue as one of many musical ventures where he had brought over other Indian classical performers that were little known in the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded <b>my</b> <b>music,</b> everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free in your face. But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

500|$|Progressive jazz {{is a form}} of {{big band}} that is more complex or experimental. It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and <b>my</b> <b>music</b> 'progressive,' then tried to tell me I played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't nothing in <b>my</b> <b>music</b> that's cold, cold like his." ...|$|E

[...] When asked about how he landed the assignment, the composer replied that [...] "the producers loved my work for Wolfen, and had heard <b>my</b> <b>music</b> for several other projects, and I think, so far as I've been told, they liked my versatility very much.
