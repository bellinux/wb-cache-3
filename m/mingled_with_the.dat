5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|Kahaanis first-look poster was {{launched}} on 2 December 2011, {{and the official}} trailer on 5 January 2012. The poster, portraying a pregnant Vidya Balan and lacking any romantic element, was well received. Critics' expectations were low, owing to the director's previous box-office failures. Vidya appeared in public with a prosthetic belly to promote the film, and <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public in railway stations, bus stands and markets. She often carried a sketch of her on-screen missing husband, and asked people to help in finding him. Social-networking website Ibibo.com developed an online game, The Great Indian Parking Wars, which required players to park Vidya's taxi on a street; it was well-received, reaching 50,000 hits in 10 days.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or {{sat in the front}} seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars to the left and right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure of her eyes to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{sisters were}} born on May 11, 1938 in New York City, United States.

At fifteen they attended a summer camp at which Pete Seeger and other well-known folk singers often performed, and they developed a lifelong attachment to the genre. They quickly discovered the bustling folk music scene in the Greenwich Village section of New York City and <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> people who congregated in Washington Square Park.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the larger}} wave of {{migration}} during the British colonial era, a significant group of South Asians, {{especially from the}} west coast (Sindh, Surat, Konkan and Malabar) travelled regularly to South East Africa, especially Zanzibar. It is believed that they travelled in Arab dhows, Maratha Navy ships (under Kanhoji Angre), and possibly Chinese junks and Portuguese vessels. Some of these people settled in South-East Africa and later spread to places like present day Uganda, and Mozambique. Later they <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> much larger wave of South Asians who came with the British.|$|E
25|$|The word Khazar, as an ethnonym, {{was last}} {{used in the}} 13th century by a people in the North Caucasus {{believed}} to practice Judaism. The nature of a hypothetical Khazar diaspora, Jewish or otherwise, is disputed. Avraham ibn Daud mentions encountering rabbinical students descended from Khazars {{as far away as}} Toledo, Spain in the 1160s. Khazar communities persisted here and there. Many Khazar mercenaries served in the armies of the Islamic Caliphates and other states. Documents from medieval Constantinople attest to a Khazar community <b>mingled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jews of the suburb of Pera. Khazar merchants were active in both Constantinople and Alexandria in the 12th. century.|$|E
