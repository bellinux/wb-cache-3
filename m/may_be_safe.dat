While it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes daylight saving time. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.|$|E

25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75â€“95% of {{colorectal}} cancer occurs {{in people with}} little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of {{colorectal cancer}} and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe.</b> 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that, ironically, {{the song was}} originally sung {{in support of the}} Jacobite cause: the word [...] "send" [...] in the line [...] "Send him victorious" [...] could imply that the king was absent. However, the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples of [...] " [...] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc." [...] meaning [...] "God grant that he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe,</b> etc.". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of King James II and VII.|$|E
2500|$|When Hooker {{received}} the {{report about the}} Confederate movement, he thought that Lee might be starting a retreat, but he also realized that a flanking march might be in progress. He took two actions. First, he sent a message at 9:30a.m. to {{the commander of the}} XI Corps, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard on his right flank: [...] "We have good reason to suppose the enemy is moving to our right. Please advance your pickets for purposes of observation as far as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> in order to obtain timely information of their approach." [...] At 10:50a.m., Howard replied that he was [...] "taking measures to resist an attack from the west." [...] Hooker's second action was to send orders to Sedgwick ("attack the enemy in his front" [...] at Fredericksburg if [...] "an opportunity presents itself with a reasonable expectation of success") and Sickles ("advance cautiously toward the road followed by the enemy, and harass the movement as much as possible"). Sedgwick did not take action from the discretionary orders. Sickles, however, was enthusiastic when he {{received the}} order at noon. He sent Birney's division, flanked by two battalions of Col. Hiram Berdan's U.S. sharpshooters, south from Hazel Grove with orders to pierce the column and gain possession of the road. [...] But the action came too late. Jackson had ordered the 23rd Georgia Infantry to guard the rear of the column and they resisted the advance of Birney and Berdan at Catherine Furnace. The Georgians were driven south and made a stand at the same unfinished railroad bed used by Wright's Brigade the day before. They were overwhelmed by 5 p.m. and most were captured. Two brigades from A.P. Hill's division turned back from the flanking march and prevented any further damage to Jackson's column, which by now had left the area.|$|E
2500|$|... "And {{when these}} men heard that Belisarius {{was coming and}} was not far away, they {{wrote a letter to}} him which ran as follows: [...] "Once more Chosroes, as you {{yourself}} doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> for the emperor, and that you may join us in guarding Hierapolis." [...] Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: [...] "If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits." [...] And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others {{with the rest of the}} army came to Europum." ...|$|E
