25|$|In {{people with}} {{alcoholic}} hepatitis, the {{serum aspartate aminotransferase}} (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1.AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of pyridoxal-6-phosphate, which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic mitochondria results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell macrocytosis (<b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>volume</b> > 100) and elevations of serum γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. Folate level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate {{in the presence of}} alcohol, and increased urinary loss.The magnitude of leukocytosis reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include Mallory bodies, giant mitochondria, hepatocyte necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration at the perivenular area. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury.Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.|$|E

The stability with {{time for a}} certain preserved blood specimen is also highly dependent {{on the principle of}} measurement. In this paper some effects of ageing on red cell populations in commercially available (Ortho) Blood Controls are evaluated. Red blood cell size histograms become narrower while <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>volumes</b> obviously decrease with time when measurements are based on light scattering intensity. In contrast, monodisperse polystyrene spheres of different sizes show perfect stability at storage.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{immigration}} of Southeast Asians to Canada, hemoglobin E {{has become a}} frequent diagnosis. The clinical and hematologic findings in 42 children (mean age 4. 3 years) with hemoglobin E are presented. There were 33 heterozygotes (having hemoglobin E trait), 6 homozygotes (having hemoglobin EE) and 3 double heterozygotes (having hemoglobin E-beta-thalassemia). The heterozygotes had low-normal hemoglobin levels and <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> volumes; coexisting iron deficiency, present in 62 % of these children, resulted in substantially lower hemoglobin levels, very low <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>volumes</b> and lower than expected levels of hemoglobin E on electrophoresis. The children with hemoglobin EE were only slightly anemic, but those with hemoglobin E-beta-thalassemia had severe anemia and required long-term transfusion therapy.

Patients and Methods: In this cross sectional study, we assessed 275 suspected thalassemia carriers.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), {{there are}} approximately 3. 7 billion {{people in the world}} with iron deficiency (WHO, 2000).

Domestic pigs (Sus domesticus) have been utilised as models for humans in many medical and nutritional studies. The first experiment reported here used 20 4 -week-old piglets to compare the bioavailability of iron in diets containing meat (ME), a water-soluble extract of meat (SA), a water-insoluble fraction of meat (SR), and a meat-free control diet (CO). Bioavailability of iron was assessed on the basis of changes in iron-related blood parameters over a 4 -week feeding trial.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) were artificially {{infected}} with erythrocytic necrosis virus (ENV) {{to study the}} physiological and hematolgical consequences of ENV-infection. Infected and control fish were held in pathogen-free seawater and sampled weekly for five weeks. Physiological tests included plasma cortisol, glucose, protein, and osmolality, blood lactic acid, and liver glycogen concentrations. In general, fish {{infected with}} ENV had higher liver glycogen values, and lower plasma glucose and blood lactic acid levels than control fish. Hematological tests included red and white blood cell (RBC and WBC) counts, hematocrits, blood hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte fragility. Infected fish had lower RBC counts, hematocrits, and hemoglobin concentrations, higher WBC counts, and more fragile erythrocytes than control fish. Other blood parameters calculated from the hematology data indicated that the erythrocytes of infected fish had higher <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>volumes,</b> depressed <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> hemoglobin concentrations, and slightly lower <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> hemoglobin. Erythrocytic inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm of RBC of infected fish, and unnucleated cells were observed by week 2. In this experiment, severity of infection progressed steadily through week 4, after which the fish appeared to be recovering. In a second study, fish were infected with ENV, held for three weeks, and recovery from exercise was measured. Plasma glucose and osmolality were higher in infected fish, while plasma cortisol and blood lactate levels were only slightly elevated. These studies indicate that chum salmon were able to withstand the effects of ENVinfection without irreversible physiological consequences. However, when subjected to-exercise, infected fish recovered more slowly than controls and seemed to have increased osmoregulatory difficulties...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Zidovudine is a {{well known}} cause of macrocytosis. However, many HIV-infected {{patients}} develop macrocytosis {{even though they do}} not receive zidovudine. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate other causes of high <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>volumes</b> (MCV) in HIV infected patients. METHODS: Thirty patients with a MCV > or = 100 fl (cases) were compared to 60 randomly selected controls with MCV A< or = 99 fl, none of them receiving zidovudine. RESULTS: Sex ratio, age, mean CD 4, prevalence of alcohol abuse and liver disease were similar in both groups. Vitamin B 12 or folic acid levels were not decreased in patients with macrocytosis. In contrast, there was an association between macrocytosis and use of stavudine alone or in combination with another antiviral drug (28 / 30 cases, 15 / 60 controls, odds ratio 40. 6 (95 % confidence interval 5. 1 - 325. 2), P< 0. 001). The haemoglobin concentration among cases (mean 13. 5 g/dl) was similar to that of controls (mean 13. 0 g/dl). CONCLUSIONS: Stavudine use increase the risk of macrocytosis more than 40 -fold in HIV-infected patients who do not receive zidovudine.

Five ECG tracings were obtained over a 6 -h period-two (20 s each) before, one (continuous tracing) during the infusion, and two (20 s each) afterwards. The heart was auscultated during the infusion.

Doses of 37. 5, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day in the 14 -day study and 40, 80, 160, and 320 mg/kg/day for the 90 -day study were employed.

In male rats an increase of red blood cells (RBCs) and hematocrit (Hct) in both 14 - and 90 -day studies, as well as increased hemoglobin (Hgb) in the 90 -day study was observed at the highest dose level.

Patients received crystalline cyanocobalamin 1000 μg QD PO (capsule) for at least 3 months. Serum cobalamin, folate, iron, and homocysteine concentrations were measured, and a complete blood count was obtained, before (month 0; baseline) and after treatment.
