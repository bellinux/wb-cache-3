5000|$|The Ant used an A-Series engine, {{transverse}} mounted {{and tilted}} slightly backward to allow greater ground clearance and suspension movement. The <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{was placed in}} the engine sump, as on the Mini. A reduction gearbox took power from the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> to the rear axle via a propshaft. The same layout was used 30 years later (with a K-Series engine) on the Rover Group's Land Rover Freelander.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} gearbox {{was also}} available {{with an additional}} intermediate gearbox. The intermediate gearbox simply doubles the amount of gears, resulting in 2 × 6 forward and 2 × 2 reverse gears. Its gear lever has the three positions ″main gearbox″, ″intermediate gearbox″ and neutral. In addition to the additional intermediate gearbox, Daimler-Benz also offered a crawler-gearbox. The crawler-gearbox {{can be used with}} the first and second gear of every group of the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> it has two crawler gears, ″crawler″ and ″super crawler″, a neutral position and a ″main gearbox″ position. When in <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> position, all <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> gears can be used. This results in 2 × 6 + 2 × 4 forward and 2 × 2 + 2 × 2 reverse gears.|$|R

An investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) identified a 360° circumferential crack in the bevel gear vertical shaft in the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> in the vicinity of a manufacturing weld, causing disengagement of the drive to both mechanical oil pumps.|$|R
50|$|The Joint Stock Company Klimov (or JSC Klimov) {{presently}} manufactures internationally certified {{gas turbine}} engines, <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and accessory drive gearboxes for transport category aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The CH-124 has {{undergone}} numerous refits and upgrades, {{especially with regard}} to the electronics, <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and engines, surface-search radar, secure cargo and passenger carrying capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> {{was located}} behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure. Options for the rear power take off and or a winch drive were available. Main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear. The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a power take off to use <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> gearing for variable speed operation. The final drives used Tatra gear differentials with locks, offset drive shafts and planetary hub reductions.|$|R

50|$|The {{device for}} {{achieving}} an overdrive transmission was usually a small separate gearbox, {{attached to the}} rear of the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> and controlled by its own shift lever. These were often optional on some models of the same car.|$|R
2500|$|... 8 September 1997 – LN-OPG, an AS332 L1 {{operated}} by Helikopter Service AS, suffered a catastrophic <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> failure and crashed {{en route from}} Brønnøysund to the Norne oil field, killing all 12 aboard. Eurocopter accepted some {{but not all of}} the AAIB/N recommendations.|$|R
50|$|Airbus Helicopters-built H175s are {{powered by}} two 1,325 kW (1,775 shp) class, Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC)-equipped Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67E {{turboshaft}} engines, which {{provide for a}} 5,000-hour time between overhaul (TBO) and on-condition maintenance. Chinese-produced AC352s are equipped with two modular 1,800 shp class, dual-FADEC Turbomeca Ardiden 3C/WZ16 turboshaft engines, which were specifically developed by a joint partnership between Turbomeca and AVIC Engine for the rotorcraft. The engines drive the rotorcraft's five-blade Spheriflex main rotor and a three-blade tail rotor. The EC175's <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> will incorporate two accessory gearboxes and will be de-clutchable, avoiding the cost and weight of an auxiliary power unit (APU). The gears and the casing of the H175's <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> were developed using CATIA V5, a first for Airbus Helicopters.|$|R
50|$|The Helicycle {{helicopter}} is {{the first}} experimental helicopter kit in mass-production to be powered by a turbine engine, the military surplus Solar T62-T32, capable of producing 150 shaft horsepower. The engine is limited to 95 horsepower due to torque limits on the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> and rotor system.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 April 2009 - G-REDL, a Eurocopter AS332 L2 Super Puma Mk 2, {{returning}} from the Miller oilfield {{went down in the}} North Sea, 40 miles northeast of Aberdeen, killing all sixteen on board. Preliminary cause was attributed to a catastrophic failure in the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1960 - The 20 Series was {{upgraded}} to the now classic 40. Toyota made many production changes by buying new steel presses. Mechanically, the FJ40 {{was given a}} new , 3.9 L F engine and the Land Cruiser finally received low-range gearing, but continued the three speed <b>main</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Night attack variant {{helicopter}} retains most of {{the structural}} design of the original Mi-28. The main difference is the installation of an integrated electronic combat system. Other modifications include: new <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> for transmitting higher power to the rotor; new high-efficiency blades with swept-shaped tips; and an engine fuel injection control.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{power unit}} {{comprises}} two Soloviev D-25VF [...] turbo-shaft engines mounted below <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> which each drive five-bladed [...] diameter rotors and the synchronisation shafts which run from wing-tip to wing-tip. Each paired engine pod has large access panels which open up for maintenance access and also form platforms for servicing crews to operate from.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} safety {{features}} such as flaw tolerance, bird strike capability and engine burst containment have been incorporated into the design. An active vibration system ensures comfortable flight and acoustic levels are well below certification requirements. The Cyclone will feature a modified <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> which has been redesigned since a March 2009 accident.|$|R
50|$|Each {{power unit}} {{comprises}} two Soloviev D-25VF turbo-shaft engines mounted below <b>main</b> <b>gearboxes</b> which each drive five-bladed 35 m diameter rotors and the synchronisation shafts which run from wing-tip to wing-tip. Each paired engine pod has large access panels which open up for maintenance access and also form platforms for servicing crews to operate from.|$|R
50|$|It was {{concluded}} that the fire had occurred in the helicopter's <b>main</b> <b>gearbox,</b> probably resulting {{from the effects of}} a bearing failure in the No. 2 engine. A further factor was the lack of fire detection or suppression capability within the gearbox bay. The cause of the bearing failure could not be definitely established.|$|R
5000|$|Proposed ultra-heavy {{version of}} the Mil V-12, {{intended}} to lift 40000 to 50000 kg. Originally envisaged in a three rotor layout, powered by six Soloviev D-25VF engines, but reverted to a two-rotor system similar to the V-12 powered by two large gas generators supplying a single large low pressure free-turbine driving a <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> each.|$|R
50|$|It was {{withdrawn}} after a serious fire at Manchester. The industrial consortium {{sold it to}} British Railways in 1955 for whom it remained in service until 1958 when it {{was withdrawn}} after sustaining accidental damage to the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox.</b> It was allocated to Derby and it was broken up at BR Derby Works in June 1960.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 September 1997 LN-OPG, an AS332 L1 Super-Puma, {{suffered}} a catastrophic <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> failure while flying from Brønnøysund to the Norne oil field and {{crashed to the}} sea, killing all 12 aboard. Eurocopter accepted some {{but not all of}} the AAIB/N recommendations. Eurocopter's reply can be found in Appendix F to the report (page 265 in the pdf).|$|R

50|$|Further {{problems}} {{arose in}} 2016 with the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> that showed abnormal wear and heat requiring premature servicing. This problem {{led to the}} German Air Force temporarily grounding two of its three A400M aircraft, and also resulted in a Royal Air Force aircraft suffering an inflight engine shutdown. An interim fix for this engine issue was certified in July 2016.|$|R
50|$|On 16 June 2009, the FAA {{released}} an additional Airworthiness Directive, AD 2009-13-01, requiring the Rotorcraft Flight Manual for the S-92A helicopter {{be modified to}} clarify emergency procedures {{in the event of}} a <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> failure due to loss of oil pressure, and in particular to identify the urgency of an immediate landing {{in the event of a}}n oil pressure loss.|$|R
50|$|Pakistan International Airlines Flight 17 was a {{scheduled}} domestic flight from Dacca to Faridpur in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) {{operated by a}} Sikorsky S-61 twin-engined helicopter of Pakistan International Airlines. On 2 February 1966 the helicopter operating the flight crashed near Fardipur after an oil leak developed and the <b>main</b> <b>gearbox</b> failed. Twenty passengers and all three crew were killed; one passenger survived.|$|R
