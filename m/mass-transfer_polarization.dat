40|$|If a molten {{carbonate}} electrolysis cell (MCEC) {{is applied}} for fuel gas production {{it is important}} to know the polarization of the nickel electrode when operated at low concentration of hydrogen. Thus, the electrochemical performance of the Ni electrode was investigated under hydrogen-lean gases containing 1 / 24. 5 / 24. 5 / 50 %, 1 / 49. 5 / 24. 5 / 25 %, 1 / 24. 5 / 49. 5 / 25 % and 1 / 49. 5 / 49. 5 / 0 % H 2 /CO 2 /H 2 O/N 2 in the temperature range of 600 – 650 °C and was then compared to the reference case with 25 / 25 / 25 / 25 % H 2 /CO 2 /H 2 O/N 2. The electrochemical measurements included polarization curve coupled with current interrupt, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Polarization resistances of the Ni electrode obtained by the two different techniques agreed well. For the inlet gases containing low amounts of hydrogen the Ni electrode exhibited higher polarization losses than when using the reference case in the electrolysis cell. The electrochemical impedance measurements showed that both charge-transfer and mass-transfer polarizations were higher for hydrogen-lean gases at all measured temperatures. Except under the condition with 1 / 49. 5 / 49. 5 % H 2 /CO 2 /H 2 O at 650 °C, the Ni electrode exhibited lower <b>mass-transfer</b> <b>polarization</b> when compared to the reference case. Furthermore, the <b>mass-transfer</b> <b>polarization</b> was strongly dependent on temperature under H 2 -lean gases, differing from the reference case when the temperature has almost no effect on <b>mass-transfer</b> <b>polarization.</b> The activation energy for hydrogen production was calculated to be in the range of 69 – 138 kJ·mol- 1 under all measured gases, indicating that the Ni electrode is under kinetic and/or mixed control in the MCEC.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{performance of}} a state-of-the-art molten carbonate cell was investigated in both fuel cell (MCFC) and electrolysis cell (MCEC) modes by using polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that it is feasible to run a reversible molten carbonate fuel cell and that the cell actually exhibits lower polarization in the MCEC mode, {{at least for the}} short-term tests undertaken in this study. The Ni hydrogen electrode and the NiO oxygen electrode were also studied in fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes under different operating conditions, including temperatures and gas compositions. The polarization of the Ni hydrogen electrode turned out to be slightly higher in the electrolysis cell mode than in the fuel cell mode at all operating temperatures and water contents. This was probably due to the slightly larger <b>mass-transfer</b> <b>polarization</b> rather than to charge-transfer polarization according to the impedance results. The CO 2 content has an important effect on the Ni electrode in electrolysis cell mode. Increasing the CO 2 content the Ni electrode exhibits slightly lower polarization in the electrolysis cell mode. The NiO oxygen electrode shows lower polarization loss in the electrolysis cell mode than in the fuel cell mode in the temperature range of 600 - 675 degrees C. The impedance showed that both charge-transfer and <b>mass-transfer</b> <b>polarization</b> of the NiO electrode are lower in the electrolysis cell than in the fuel cell mode.
