5000|$|ASN-206 is a fixed wing UAV in twin boom layout {{with high}} wing {{configuration}} with twin-tail. Propulsion {{is provided by}} a two-blade propeller driven engine <b>mouted</b> at the rear end of the fuselage. ASN-206 was reportedly developed under the assistance of Tadiran Spectralink Ltd, an Israeli company specialising in the airborne communications and electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems, but this cannot be confirmed. Though classified by Chinese as a light weight UAV, ASN-206 actually weighs more than 200 kg, and this was mainly caused by the technological bottleneck and limitation of industrial capability China faced {{back in the early}} 1990s. In 1996, ASN-206 won State Science and Technology Prizes. Specification: ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} {{the mechanisms of}} photoplastic effects (PPE) in alkali halide crystals containing alkali metal colloids {{it is essential to}} clarify and/or to control the relevant defect spectrum relating to PPE phenomenon. In the electric furnace held at a desirable temperature a densely colored KCI crystal plate, obtained from the electrolytic coloration method, was <b>mouted</b> between the two electrodes kept at high d. c. electric field, e. g., 4 kV/cm, as well as was simultaneously illuminated with Xe arc light for 60 min at 90 ℃. It was found that by using this simple method, electro-optical bleaching method, the concentration of the hifher aggregates of the F-centers in the specimens is markedly reduced even at the low annealing temperature of 90 ℃. The results were compared with those in the specimens obtained from conventional long term thermal treatments for 130 h. A brief discussion is given to the properties of the higher aggregates of the F-centers and coexisting potassium metal colloid particles in KCI specimens. カリウム金属コロイド粒子を含むヨウ化カリウム単結晶における光塑性効果（現象）についての特徴的な振舞いをこれまでに前二報で報告した。前報告では，励起光波長を変化させた場合の観測を行った。その結果，運動転位とカリウム金属コロイド粒子とが相互作用することにより，コロイド金属粒子径が変化することを示唆する結果を得た。本研究では，塩化カリウム単結晶中にカリウム金属コロイド粒子を導入する際に同時に導入されるF中心濃度をできるだけ低くして，カリウム金属コロイド粒子を優先的に含む試料の作製・調整を意図して新たな実験方法の開発を行った。試料温度約 630 度で電界着色法により高濃度にF中心を導入し着色した試料を用いて，これに電場（強度：約 4000 V/cm）印加とF帯光（波長： 545 nm）照射とを同時に行える装置を新たに開発した。この装置を用いて試料温度 300 ℃，約 60 分間の熱処理により，従来の熱処理条件（温度： 90 ℃， 130 時間）により処理を行った試料中と比較して， 800 - 1200 nmに吸収をもつ色中心が優先的に除去されることがわかった...|$|E
40|$|A {{shipboard}} ocean optical profiling system(SOOPS) {{has been}} developed {{to meet the needs}} of ocean color remote sensing. This system is an integrated one that provide measurements of optical properies of seawater. Specifications of SOOPS are described. Shading errors are modeled by Monte Carlo simulation, the field experimental data and some optical properties derived from these data are described and analyzed. Also presented in this paper is an optical buoy system underdeveloped, which can provide time series observations of both inherent optical properties and apparent optical properties of sea water. This system consistents of two buoys, master buoy and slave bouy. Several optical instruments are <b>mouted</b> on the buoys or on the mooring cable of the buoys to provide optical measurements at depths up to 70 m. Self shading of the buoy has been simulated via Monte Carlo method. Effective anti-biofouling techniques are used for protecting biofouling on the optical window. Bluetooth radio is used for the conmunication between the master buoy and the slave buoy. An Inmarsat satellite telemetry system is used to transmit data daily. These optical systems are useful for both verification of ocean color satellite data and understanding the time changes of physical, biological and optical parameters...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} {{systems are}} important to Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain (<b>MOUT)</b> simulations for generating realistic tactical behaviours for the non-player characters (or bots). In this paper, we describe our work on Quartz, an autonomous navigation system for <b>MOUT</b> simulations. Novel features of Quartz include qualitative spatial representation and hierarchical spatial reasoning which enables fast situation analysis and human-like path planning in a dynamic environment. To assess the effectiveness of Quartz, we have integrated it into Twilight City, a virtual environment for <b>MOUT</b> simulations. Experimental results show that Quartz is very effective for quick tactical path generation in dynamic <b>MOUT</b> environments. Copyright # 2007 John Wiley &...|$|R

40|$|Military Operations in Urban Terrain (<b>MOUT)</b> {{require the}} {{capability}} to perceive and to analyse the situation around a patrol in order to recognize potential threats. As in <b>MOUT</b> scenarios threats usually arise from humans one important task is the robust detection of humans. Detection of humans in <b>MOUT</b> by image processing systems can be very challenging, e. g., due to complex outdoor scenes where humans have a weak contrast against the background or are partially occluded. Porikli et al. introduced covariance descriptors and showed their usefulness for human detection in complex scenes. However, these descriptors do not lie on a vector space and so well-known machine learning techniques need to be adapted to train covariance descriptor classifiers. We present a novel approach based on manifold learning that simplifies the classification of covariance descriptors. In this paper, we apply this approach for detecting humans. We describe our human detection method and evaluate the detector on benchmark data sets generated from real-world image sequences captured during <b>MOUT</b> exercises...|$|R

40|$|The Urban Combat Advanced Training Technology (UCATT) was {{established}} within the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) in 2003 as MSG 032. UCATT was tasked to exchange and assess information on Military Operations in Urban Terrain (<b>MOUT)</b> facilities and training/simulation systems {{with a view}} toward establishing best practice. In addition it was required to identify a suitable architecture and a standard set of interfaces that would enable interoperability of <b>MOUT</b> training components that did not inhibit future enhancements and identify limitations and constraints on <b>MOUT</b> development so that areas for future research could be identified. The end product to be a comprehensive report detailing an architectural framework to enable interoperability and future research requirements for <b>MOUT</b> training facilities. The report will be delivered in August 2006. What is unique about the group is that it draws in members from both government and industry. Its industrial partners are particularly important as they ultimately will need to deliver solutions that are interoperable within NATO and Partners for Peace (PfP) countries.

40|$|An {{evolving}} body of doctrine, Military Operations in Urbanized Terrain (<b>MOUT),</b> {{has developed}} {{over the last several}} decades on the assumption that extensive military presence in cities in both warfare and less than war conditions will be necessary in the twenty-first century to deal with the aggression of 'rouge' nations, terrorism and civilian disorders. The examination of <b>MOUT</b> doctrine undertaken here, most basically, contributes to a recognition that urban warfare and military operations are relevant, if not normal, urban phenomena. <b>MOUT</b> doctrine also facilitates identifying trends in the prevention, repression and control of mass citizen political mobilizations within and among cities. Finally, this perspective situates the 'War on Terrorism' as a factor that is broadening and deepening, rather than causing, the increasing militarization of urban space.
