50|$|Lepage became Vice-President of the MoDem on 15 June 2008. In February 2009, Bayrou <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> of the Modem {{list for}} the Northwest {{district}} for the 2009 European elections. She was elected as an MEP with 8.67% of the vote.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's lovely. Suppose {{it had to}} be cut {{off when}} she had the fever. Wish I could get rid of my mop, it's such a bother;" [...] and Becky was seen tying a clean towel over the great knot that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> look very like a copper kettle.|$|R
6000|$|... '"To be sure," [...] she says. [...] "'Tis just a apple," [...] and {{she went}} ashore with her hand to <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> It always <b>hurted</b> <b>her</b> to show her gifts.|$|R
6000|$|... "She needs it," [...] {{answered}} Mary, [...] "but she cannot speak {{through the}} trumpet; she tried it, and it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache. She is here on deck, and I {{am going to}} help her stand up {{as soon as we}} get nearer. Perhaps she may be able to speak to you." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{then moved}} on to directing, working as an {{assistant}} director on a number of films during the 1980s, namely Matewan (1987) and Far North (1988). In 1988, Karrell <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> directorial debut with the short film Cadillac Dreams, for which the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Film.|$|R
5000|$|Nadezhda Grigoryevna Grekova (Надзея Рыгораўна Грэкава; September 17, 1910 - January 6, 2001), was a Soviet Belarusian politician. She was Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR 1938-1947. Her {{office as}} Chairman of the Supreme Soviet {{nominally}} <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>Head</b> of the Republic. At some point {{she was known}} as the [...] "Iron Lady".|$|R
50|$|She <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> directorial {{debut on}} the FX series The Shield. Some {{of her other}} {{television}} directing credits include The Riches, Bionic Woman, My Own Worst Enemy, Fringe, Battlestar Galactica, Criminal Minds, The Unit, Cold Case, Numb3rs, Blue Bloods, Sons of Anarchy, The Walking Dead, The Killing, NYC 22, Once Upon a Time, Hawaii Five-0 and Feud: Bette and Joan.|$|R
60|$|This {{woman did}} not tell <b>her</b> that she <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache, but, on the contrary, she hugged her, and laughed, and cried, till her sanity was a thing to be doubted of; and when {{released}} from her, Eva flew from one to another, shaking hands and kissing, {{in a way that}} Miss Ophelia afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach.|$|R
60|$|Poor Polly was {{so taken}} by surprise, {{that she had}} not a word to say. None were needed; her {{telltale}} face answered for her, as well as the impulse which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> hide <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the sofa cushion, like a foolish ostrich when the hunters are after it.|$|R
60|$|Terrified at {{the sudden}} {{seriousness}} of the man's voice, she managed to gasp out, however, that, after her usual habit, she had not opened the official letters, but had sent them to her more experienced colleague for advice and information; that she never could understand them herself,--they <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache, and interfered with her other duties,--but HE understood them, and sent her word what to do. Remembering also his usual style of indorsement, she grew red again.|$|R
60|$|But {{the wine}} {{which she had}} drunk had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> heavy. She {{would have liked to}} go to the Duke, but the room seemed to be {{whirling}} unpleasantly around her. Ere she had time to utter another word the young foreigner had roughly seized her wrist and dragged her away. She was too weak to resist him, and was reluctantly compelled to follow his lead. The next moment he had closed the door on her, and she knew nothing more.|$|R
50|$|The box set {{was created}} {{to look like a}} {{medicine}} case. As the set was composed of 8cm singles, Sheena thought back to the 1980s, the era of 8cm singles and thought of idol Hiroko Mita, who had appeared on many posters for medical products, acting as if <b>her</b> stomach or <b>head</b> <b>hurt.</b> So for the promotional posters, Sheena stood with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> or stomach in pain, with the Ze-Chyou Syuu case advertised on top, as if it were medicine.|$|R
60|$|Marcia put off her {{sack and}} gloves, and hastily {{repaired}} {{the ravages of}} travel as best she could. She {{would have liked to}} go to her room just long enough to brush her hair a little, and the fur cap <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> hot; but she was suddenly afraid of doing something that would seem countrified in Bartley's eyes, and she promptly obeyed: they had come from Portland in a parlor car, and she had been able to make a traveller's toilet before they reached Boston.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I've never {{till now}} {{guaranteed}} anything {{but my own}} disposition to worry. I've never till now," [...] Fanny went on gravely from her chair, [...] "had such {{a chance to see}} and to judge. I had it at that place--if I had, in my infatuation and my folly," [...] she added with expression, [...] "nothing else. So I did see--I HAVE seen. And now I know." [...] Her emphasis, as she repeated the word, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> in <b>her</b> seat of infallibility, rise higher. [...] "I know." ...|$|R
40|$|Dinkie is {{suffering}} from neuralgia in <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Birdie had a cough and she visited Abe and Bettie and her parents. She also visited Mrs. Summers and Miss Mal. She has fourteen chicks and a hen that won't set eggs. Henry hasn't planted corn yet {{because it has been}} raining so much. She wishes Birdie and Linnet could be together. Ike Jones is working for them. She has irish potatoes and peas. Alice Donnell came to visit and mentioned that Old Bill had gone to Texas. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> <b>hurts</b> so she ask that they write back soon and send a picture of Linnet. Willie mentions that everyone is doing well. Polk Elliot is sick and he made him a wagon. He mentions his mother's chicks and his Uncle Abe wants him to drop corn for him. He used the file that his Uncle Charlie gave him, but had to get it replaced. His Uncle Tobe's wheat is knee high. His Aunt Florence's brother died when she got home. He made a latch and gate for the wood file and he asks that they write soon. Alice writes that she received two calico aprons from her grandmother. She wants to see Linnet and her and Birdie go hunting for eggs...|$|R
6000|$|But tonight Anne did {{not feel}} this so keenly. Ruby was strangely quiet. She said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and [...] "fellows." [...] She lay in the hammock, with her {{untouched}} work beside her, and a white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders. Her long yellow braids of hair--how Anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldays!--lay {{on either side of}} her. She had taken the pins out--they <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache, she said. The hectic flush was gone for the time, leaving her pale and childlike.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{like men}} who do things,' she had confided {{to a man in}} the Educational Department, who was {{teaching}} the sons of cloth merchants and dyers the beauty of Wordsworth's 'Excursion' in annotated cram-books; and when he grew poetical, William explained that she 'didn't understand poetry very much; it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache,' and another broken heart took refuge at the Club. But it was all William's fault. She delighted in hearing men talk of their own work, and that is the most fatal way of bringing a man to your feet.|$|R
5000|$|Wallach {{opened the}} {{hospital}} with two trained nurses, Schwester (Nurse) Stybel and Schwester Van Gelder. Van Gelder returned to her native Holland early on, being dissatisfied with the [...] "primitive conditions" [...] that existed at Shaare Zedek. Stybel fled to Germany with the outbreak of World War I; when she returned, she organized a strike against the conditions at the hospital. Wallach {{did not respond to}} her demands, and when she was unable to find other work and asked for her job back, he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> of the laundry. [...] "A true nurse never abandons her patients", he told her.|$|R

60|$|Presently, a man, in evening dress, with {{overcoat}} thrown open, gazed pointblank {{into her}} face, and, raising his hat, ranged up beside her. She walked straight on, still with that half-smile, knowing him puzzled and fearfully attracted. Then an insensate wish to stab {{him to the}} heart <b>made</b> <b>her</b> turn <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and look at him. At {{the expression on her}} face, he wilted away from her, and again she felt that wicked glee at having hurt him.|$|R
6000|$|Josie {{decided that}} Annie Boyle {{had not been}} {{admitted}} to the inner confidences of the conspirators, and that Tom Linnet was their tool and had been richly paid for whatever services he had performed. She was now gathering [...] "clues" [...] so fast that it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> swim. [...] "That chance meeting with Kauffman, at Kasker's," [...] she told herself, [...] "led me directly into the nest of traitors. I'm in luck. Not that I'm especially clever, but because they're so astonishingly reckless. That's usually the way with criminals; they close every loop-hole but the easiest one to peep through--and then imagine they're safe from discovery!" ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{something}} began squeaking on {{the table}} behind Alice, and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> turn <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{just in time to}} see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.|$|R
50|$|During {{her early}} acting career she worked {{mostly in the}} stage in Germany, {{including}} theaters in Hamburg and Berlin. She appeared in her first movie in 1951 which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> career <b>heading</b> into a different direction. She was side-tracked into films and became a popular face of German comedy movies.|$|R
6000|$|She went up with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> whirling, a dry {{sensation}} in her throat, a fluttered, frightened feeling in her breast. Never {{in her life}} as yet had she suffered from even momentary fear {{that she would not}} get what she had set her heart on. The sensations of the afternoon had been full, and poignant, and this gruesome discovery coming on the top of them had really <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache. No wonder her father had hidden that photograph so secretly behind her own--ashamed of having kept it! But could he hate Jon's mother and yet keep her photograph? She pressed her hands over her forehead, trying to see things clearly. Had they told Jon--had her visit to Robin Hill forced them to tell him? Everything now turned on that! She knew, they all knew, except--perhaps--Jon! ...|$|R
5000|$|Grekova {{started to}} work in a textile factory in Minsk in 1922, at the age of twelve. In 1932, she {{became a member of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union, was {{appointed}} chairperson of the local workers union in 1933, and became secretary of the party in 1938-40; she graduated from the party school in 1941. From 1938 until 1947, she held the post of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR, one of the first women to hold such a position.. This position nominally <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>Head</b> of the Republic The post was created after a re-organization of the system and she was the first person appointed to it. During the Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany, she was evacuated to Kazan.|$|R
60|$|Chebron was silent. His whole affection {{had been}} given to his father, for his mother he had {{comparatively}} little. As a child he had seldom been allowed to come into the room where she was. She declared that his noise was too much for her, that his talk <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ache, and that his fidgeting about was too much to be borne. Nor since that time had he been much more with her. It was his father who had seen to his welfare and that of Mysa, who would put aside his grave studies to walk and talk with them, who was always indulgent, always anxious to give them pleasure. He therefore thoroughly entered into Mysa's feelings, but saw no possible alternative for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would take}} a {{policeman}} to do that, Trix, or a little man in a tall hat," [...] said Fanny, slyly, which caused a general laugh, and <b>made</b> Beatrice toss <b>her</b> <b>head</b> coquettishly.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he began}} to falter and to get self-conscious. And {{when he came to}} the verse, [...] "A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow because her hour is come", he missed it out. Miriam had felt him growing uncomfortable. She shrank when the {{well-known}} words did not follow. He went on reading, but she did not hear. A grief and shame <b>made</b> <b>her</b> bend <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Six months ago he would have read it simply. Now there was a scotch in his running with her. Now she felt there was really something hostile between them, something of which they were ashamed.|$|R
5000|$|She is {{mentioned}} the 13th-century Scandinavian Ribe Martyrology, which gives 21 January as her feast-day. [...] According to {{a description of}} Coventry's relics <b>made</b> in 1539, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was enclosed with copper and gold.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, Marie-Joséphe {{received}} a scholarship {{from the national}} government to attended a home economics training course in Paris, which was worth 30,000 francs. She initially worked as a schoolteacher {{when she returned to}} the CAR, but in October 1961 joined the civil service as an assistant social worker. In October 1962, President David Dacko appointed Marie-Joséphe to his Social and Economic Council, where she served until January 1966. In February 1964, he also <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> of the Service for the Advancement of Women, a new government agency dedicated to improving the status of women in Central African society. Marie-Joséphe was further promoted in October 1965, becoming Director of Social Affairs. In March 1967, she was appointed to the inaugural national committee of the Central African Red Cross Society.|$|R
6000|$|A {{sense of}} remembered {{grievance}} trembled in his voice, and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> drop <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on his arm, in pity and derision of him. [...] "Poor Bartley!" [...] she cried. [...] "And {{you came up}} here for a little petting from me, didn't you? I've noticed that in you! Well, you didn't get it, did you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|When [...] "World War III" [...] begins, Storm Shadow tracks Destro and the Baroness to Japan where Destro {{agrees to}} help G.I. Joe fight Cobra Commander. Appalled {{that her husband}} would help [...] "the enemy," [...] Destro turns to her and tells her {{that it is only}} a matter of time before Cobra Commander betrays and comes after them. He is right as Cobra Commander has freed Dela Eden from prison and orders her to kill the steel-faced arms dealer and his wife. Storm Shadow then takes the couple to visit the G.I. Joe team in hiding where Destro informs Colonel Colton that he will need a piece of MARS {{technology}} to help G.I. Joe defeat it. In an uncomfortable moment, the Baroness turns to Scarlett and asks the red-head if <b>her</b> <b>head</b> still <b>hurts.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A {{discharge}} of firearms near by <b>made</b> <b>her</b> throw <b>her</b> <b>head</b> back and close her eyes. Old Giorgio set his teeth hard under his white moustache, {{and his eyes}} began to roll fiercely. Several bullets struck {{the end of the}} wall together; pieces of plaster could be heard falling outside; a voice screamed [...] "Here they come!" [...] and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush of running feet along the front.|$|R
6000|$|... "We do not {{see those}} things in the same light," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I thought, as you know, that the duty was more {{incumbent}} when the child was left an orphan--a burthen on relatives who could ill afford {{to be charged with}} her. Perhaps, Barbara, if you had noticed her THEN, instead of waiting till circumstances <b>made</b> <b>her</b> the <b>head</b> of our family, you {{might have been able to}} give her that which has been wanting in your otherwise conscientious training--affection." ...|$|R
60|$|Soon {{her back}} and {{shoulders}} were aching violently, and the rope across her chest was tugging like some evil-tempered thing. But she did not dare to rest. The snow was now falling thick and fast, the flakes traced white spirals and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> spin, so that she was constantly falling away to the south-westward and then correcting herself by the compass. She tried to think how this zig-zagging might affect her course, but the snow whirls confused her mind and a growing anxiety would not let her pause to think. She felt blinded; {{it seemed to be}} snowing inside her eyes so that she wanted to rub them. Soon the ground must rise to the ridge, she told herself; it must surely rise. Then the sledge came bumping at her heels and she perceived she was going down hill. She consulted the compass, and she found she was facing south. She turned sharply to the right again. The snowfall became a noiseless, pitiless torture to sight and mind.|$|R
