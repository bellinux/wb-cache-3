40|$|We study {{universality}} {{classes and}} crossover behaviors in non-Abelian directed sandpile models, {{in terms of}} the <b>metastable</b> pattern <b>analysis.</b> The non-Abelian property induces spatially correlated metastable patterns, characterized by the algebraic decay of the grain density along the propagation direction of an avalanche. Crossover scaling behaviors are observed in the grain density due to the interplay between the toppling randomness and the parity of the threshold value. In the presence of such crossovers, we show that the broadness of the grain distribution plays a crucial role in resolving the ambiguity of the universality class. Finally, we claim that the <b>metastable</b> pattern <b>analysis</b> is important as much as the conventional analysis of avalanche dynamics.

Their fragmentation routes under electron impact were established and confirmed by <b>metastable</b> ion <b>analysis</b> and accurate mass measurements. The results demonstrated that the relative amounts of exo/endo isomeric molecular ions are {{in close agreement with}} the isomeric ratios observed in solutions by the NMR, although the mass spectra of the tetracyano derivatives indicated a small fraction of molecular ions existing in the endo form, which could not be detected in solution by the NMR methods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSix cyclohexene-fused 2 -N-phenyliminoperhydro- 3, 1 -oxazines {{and four}} related thiazines were {{prepared}} and their mass spectrometric behavior was studied {{by means of}} <b>metastable</b> ion <b>analysis</b> and exact mass measurement. In most of the fragmentations, extensive rearrangements took place. The decompositions through the retro-Diels-Alder reaction initiated by the double bond dominated {{in the case of}} the unsubstituted compounds. The effect of the double bond, however, was greatly outweighed by the effect of the substituent on the ring nitrogen atom. In comparison with the unsubstituted compounds, both electron-releasing (methyl) and electron-withdrawing (benzyl) substituents increased the contribution of the ring cleavage reactions in the heterocyclic part of the molecule; {{in the case of the}} benzyl group the loss of the substituent also became important. For isomeric compounds, the relative peak intensities were so different that such compounds were easy to differentiate...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} under electron {{impact of}} six 1, 1 -bis(benzenesulphonyl) cyclioalkanes and of 1 -phenyl- 1 -(benzensesulphaonyl) cyclopropane {{has been studied}} in detail {{with the aid of}} exact mass measurements, linked scans for <b>metastable</b> ion <b>analysis,</b> collisional spectroscopy and kinetic energy release measurements. The molecular ions of these compounds undergo a sulphone-sulphinate rearrangement with alkyl group migration on oxygen, in analogy with what is found for simple monosulphones and, in general, their fragmentation resembles that of mono-sulphonyl compounds. Loss of SO 2 from the molecular ion is observed for all substrates, but only in the case of 1, 1 -bis(benzenesulphonyl) cyclopropane is this followed by loss of the second SO 2 unit; the first loss of SO 2 is probably accompanied by rearrangement since the fragmentation pattern of [M − SO 2]+˙ ions from this compound is different than that of the isobaric molecular ions of 1 -phenyl- 1 -(benzenesulphonyl) cyclopropane...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} AA 7150 and AA 7079 were studied as {{examples}} of 7 xxx aluminum alloys with a high and low Cu content. The alloys were carefully examined to determine the evolution (incl. density and size) of precipitates during heat-treatment using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Such characterization {{made it possible to}} relate the evolution of microstructure to specific properties such as electrochemical response (including <b>metastable</b> pitting <b>analysis),</b> hardness and crack growth rate (from SCC testing). The results revealed several important findings, indicating that there is a critical precipitate size above which a transition in electrochemical response occurs; in addition it is seen that Cu has an important role in both metastable pitting and crack propagation. The corrosion initiation and propagation phases are distinct in their mechanisms, and this {{is a function of the}} nature and state of the precipitates. Increased aging times increased the metastable pitting rate and SCC velocity in the Cu-lean alloy, whereas increased aging times decreased the metastable pitting rate the Cu-rich alloy. A correlation between metastable pitting rate and stable pitting is also presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{ionosphere}} {{offers an}} excellent laboratory {{for the study}} of atomic and molecular processes. Densities are low, permitting highly reactive species to accumulate in measurable quantities. Temporal and spatial scales are large, and the solar energy source causes substantial departures from thermodynamic equilibrium. This laboratory has been exploited by the Atmosphere Explorer Program of NASA. Simultaneous measurements {{of a large number of}} interrelated atmospheric parameters to altitudes as low as 150 km have provided data that can be analyzed in a quantitative manner to derive precise rates, as functions of temperature, for many important chemical reactions, including the reactions of electronically or vibrationally excited <b>metastable</b> species. <b>Analysis</b> of AE results has provided new information on the photochemical role of N in the thermosphere; the rate coefficients for dissociative recombination of NO+, O 2 + and N 2 +; reactions of O+ with N 2, N 2 + with O, and O 2 + with O; and reactions of metastable ions, atoms, and molecules.

The thermodynamic phase diagram from Ni-rich to Pt-rich conditions with oxygen coverages up to one monolayer was constructed from their 560 possible surface structures. With {{an increase in the}} oxygen chemical potential, there were only two types of thermodynamically stable structures, which were a clean Pt-skin surface and a Ni-skin surface with chemisorbed oxygen, regardless of the underlying Pt-rich or Ni-rich conditions. Bimetallic surfaces with chemisorbed oxygen were only <b>metastable.</b> The detail <b>analysis</b> revealed that the structural evolution is determined by the factors of segregation cost, difference between oxygen-metal (Pt and Ni) bonding strength, and oxygen chemical potential.

40|$|Hypervariable {{loops of}} HIV- 1 Env protein gp 120 are speculated to play {{roles in the}} {{conformational}} transition of Env to the receptor binding-induced <b>metastable</b> state. Structural <b>analysis</b> of full-length Env-based immunogens, containing the entire V 2 loop, displayed tighter association between gp 120 subunits, resulting in a smaller trimeric diameter than constructs lacking V 2. A prominent basal quaternary location of V 2 and V 39 that challenges previous reports would facilitate gp 41 -independent gp 120 -gp 120 interactions and suggests a quaternary mechanism of epitope occlusion facilitated by hypervariable loops. Deletion of V 2 resulted in dramatic exposure of basal, membrane-proximal gp 41 epitopes, consistent with its predicted basal location. The structural features of HIV- 1 Env characterized here provide grounds for a paradigm shift in loop exposure and epitope occlusion, while providing substantive rationale for epitope display required for elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies, as well as substantiating previous pertinent literature disregarded in recent reports...|$|R
40|$|Two {{polymorphic}} forms of (Z) - 3 -Bromopropenoic acid are reported. Form I (monoclinic, P 21 /c) with Z' = 1 is {{obtained from a}} range of solvents while Form II (monoclinic, P 21 /n) with Z' = 4 can be prepared only from either benzene or toluene. Both forms are isolated at room temperature. The molecules in both polymorphs interact with one another through similar dominant hydrogen bonding motifs; however, the packing arrangement differs in the prevalence of weaker hydrogen bonds in the <b>metastable</b> Form II. <b>Analysis</b> of this high and low Z′ polymorphic pair using differential scanning calorimetry, grinding and slurry experiments, coupled with lattice energy calculations suggests that the low Z′ form I is the most stable under ambient conditions. 2 D fingerprint plots derived from Hirshfeld surfaces highlight the more extensive hydrogen bonding in Form II while Form I is more densely packed. This polymorphic pair mat be a candidate for the role of solution pre-aggregation in the formation of high Z′ forms...|$|R

40|$|Several camphor and pinane {{derivatives}} {{have been}} synthesised and evaluated {{for use as}} chiral auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Various blocking groups have been attached to the camphor skeleton in attempts to improve stereofacial selectivity; these include a-methoxybenzyl and xylyl groups, and novel stereoisomeric ketal moieties derived from meso- and (R,R) -(-) - 2, 3 -butanediol. Benzylation reactions carried out on the lithium enolates of ester derivatives of the camphorderived chiral auxiliaries afforded a-benzylated products in 5 - 60 % diastereomeric excess. Stereochemical aspects have been explored using high resolution NMR, X-ray crystallographic and computer modelling techniques, and hydrolysis of selected a-benzylated products has permitted the diastereoselective bias to be confirmed. Opposite configurations at the new stereogenic centre are clearly favoured by the xylyl and ketal blocking groups - an observation rationalised {{in terms of the}} presence or absence of chelating potential in the blocking group. Baylis-Hillman reactions carried out on a series of specially prepared camphor-derived acrylic esters containing the ketal blocking group exhibited both low diastereoselectivities (0 - 30 % d. e.) and very long reaction times. Chiral silyl enol ethers, synthesised using both pinane and camphor derivatives as chiral auxiliaries, showed up to 20 % diastereomeric excess in MCPBA oxidation, alkylation and Mukaiyama reactions. Attempts to bring the prochiral centre in the silyl enol ether substrates closer to the chiral auxiliary, and thus improve the stereofacial selectivity, proved unsuccessful. The silyl enol ether derivatives, however, display interesting fragmentation patterns in their electron impact mass spectra, which were investigated using a combination of high resolution MS, comparative low resolution MS and <b>metastable</b> peak <b>analysis.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{metastable}} {{systems can}} nucleate to multiple competing stable or intermediate metastable states. In this work, a Potts model, subject to external fields, {{is used to}} study the competitive nucleation of two phases attempting to grow on a microscopic impurity. Monte Carlo simulations are {{used to calculate the}} free energy surfaces for the system under different conditions, where the relative stability of the phases is adjusted by changing the interaction parameters, and the nucleation rates obtained using multicomponent transition state theory are compared with the rates measured using the survival probability method. We find that the two methods predict similar nucleation rates when the free energy barrier used in the transition state theory is defined as the work required to form a critical embryo from the <b>metastable</b> phase. An <b>analysis</b> of the free energy surfaces also reveals that the competition between the nucleating phases leads to an effective drying of the impurity which slows down the nucleation rate compared to the single phase case.

40|$|The thermotropic phase {{behavior}} of binary mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine with dimyristoyl glycerol (DMPC-DMG) {{has been studied}} in aqueous dispersion by using differential scanning calorimetry and spin label electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Phase identifications {{have been made by}} means of 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. The binary phase diagram of DMPC-DMG mixtures displays three regions corresponding to the existence of compounds (C 1 and C 2, respectively) with approximately 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 mol/mol DMPC:DMG stoichiometries. The first region displays immiscibility between DMPC and C 1 in the low temperature lamellar phase and miscibility of the components in the fluid phase that is lamellar. The second region displays immiscibility between C 1 and C 2 in the low temperature phase that is lamellar, whereas the fluid phase is of the inverted hexagonal type (HII). The third region displays immiscibility between C 2 and DMG in the low temperature phase that is lamellar, whereas the fluid phase is isotropic. The presence of immiscible DMG in the low temperature phase of the third region is indicated by hysteresis in the temperature scans corresponding to conversion between the stable and <b>metastable</b> crystalline polymorphs. <b>Analysis</b> of the first region of the phase diagram using regular solution theory further demonstrates the existence of a DMPC:DMG complex with approximately 1 : 1 stoichiometry and provides parameters for the nonideality of mixing in the fluid phase...|$|R
40|$|The folding of heat-denatured ovalbumin, a non-inhibitory serpin with a {{molecular}} size of 45 kDa, was examined. Ovalbumin was heat-denatured at 80 degrees C under nonreducing conditions at pH 7. 5 and then cooled either slowly or rapidly. Slow cooling allowed the heat-denatured ovalbumin to refold to its native structure with subsequent resistance to digestion by trypsin. Upon rapid cooling, by contrast, the heat-denatured molecules assumed the metastable non-native conformations that were susceptible to trypsin. The non-native species were marginally stable {{for several days}} at a low temperature, but the molecules were transformed slowly into the native conformation. Considering data from size-exclusion chromatography and from analyses of CD, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and adsorption of the dye 1 -anilinonaphthalene- 8 -sulfonate, we postulated that the non-native species that accumulated upon rapid cooling were compact but structureless globules with disordered side chains collectively as a folding intermediate. Temperature-jumped CD experiments revealed biphasic kinetics for the refolding process of heat-denatured ovalbumin, with the features of increasing and subsequently decreasing amplitude of the rapid and the slow phases, respectively, with the decrease in folding temperature. The temperature dependence of the refolding kinetics indicated that the yield of renaturation was maximal at about 55 degrees C. These findings suggested the kinetic partitioning of heat-denatured ovalbumin between alternative fates, slow renaturation to the native state and rapid collapse to the <b>metastable</b> intermediate state. <b>Analysis</b> of disulfide pairing revealed {{the formation of a}} scrambled form with non-native disulfide interactions in both the heat-denatured state and the intermediate state that accumulated upon rapid cooling, suggesting that non-native disulfide pairing is responsible for the kinetic barriers that retard the correct folding of ovalbumin...|$|R
