5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and {{makes me want to}} hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Warwick {{signed with}} Concord Records after a fifteen-year tenure at Arista, which had ended in 1994. Her {{first and only}} release for the label was <b>My</b> <b>Friends</b> and Me, a duets album {{containing}} reworkings of her old hits, very similar to her 1998 CD Dionne Sings Dionne. Among her singing partners were Gloria Estefan, Olivia Newton-John, Wynonna Judd and Reba McEntire. The album peaked at #66 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was produced by her son, Damon Elliott. A follow-up album featuring Warwick's old hits as duets with male vocalists was planned, but the project was cancelled. The relationship with Concord concluded {{with the release of}} <b>My</b> <b>Friends</b> and Me. A compilation CD of her greatest hits and love songs, The Love Collection, entered the UK pop charts at number 27 on February 16, 2008.|$|E

25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true.

25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican {{with a picture}} of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour.

However, his solo piano recitals, as well as his solo piano recordings were rare, until he chose to make a series of solo albums titled Exclusively for <b>My</b> <b>Friends.</b> These solo piano sessions, made for the Musik Produktion Schwarzwald (MPS) label, were Peterson's response to the emergence of such stars as Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner.|$|E
