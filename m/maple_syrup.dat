5|$|As long as <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> {{does not}} have an {{off-flavour}} and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International <b>Maple</b> <b>Syrup</b> Institute (IMSI) and many <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of <b>maple</b> <b>syrup,</b> now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of <b>maple</b> <b>syrup</b> production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.|$|E
5|$|<b>Maple</b> <b>syrup</b> and {{its various}} {{artificial}} imitations {{are widely used}} as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America.

It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. <b>Maple</b> <b>syrup</b> can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).|$|E
5|$|<b>Maple</b> <b>syrup</b> {{and maple}} sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves.

40|$|ABSTRACT Basic and {{selected}} functional properties of sim-ple sugars, sugar alcohols, corn and <b>maple</b> <b>syrups,</b> honey, and high-fructose corn syrups are discussed. Properties {{that relate to}} sweetness and properties that play roles in component interaction {{as a basis for}} product formulation are described. The implications of such functionality are illustrated for the development of low-energy foods and for the microwave heating of foods. Among the properties discussed are solubility, hygroscopicity, crystallinity, and viscosity. Interrelations among water mobility, water activity, and hydration of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates are described in the context of food formulation. Application of polymer chem-istry principles to explain functional properties of amorphous mole-cules is reviewed. Am J C/in Nutr 1995; 62 (suppl) : 170 S- 7 S.

5|$|<b>Maple</b> <b>syrup</b> {{was first}} {{collected}} {{and used by}} the indigenous peoples of North America, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods.

5|$|<b>Maple</b> <b>syrup</b> {{has been}} {{produced}} {{on a small}} scale in some other countries, notably Japan and South Korea. However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called gorosoe, instead of processing it into syrup.|$|E

500|$|Maple {{sugaring}} parties typically {{began to}} operate {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of <b>maples.</b> <b>Syrup</b> makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained [...] "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical {{engineering}} as {{a discipline}} that was developed out of those practising [...] "industrial chemistry" [...] in the late 19th century. Before the Industrial Revolution (18th century), industrial chemicals and other consumer products such as soap were mainly produced through batch processing. Batch processing is labour-intensive and individuals mix predetermined amounts of ingredients in a vessel, heat, cool or pressurize the mixture for a predetermined length of time. The product may then be isolated, purified and tested to achieve a saleable product. Batch processes are still performed today on higher value products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, speciality and formulated products such as perfumes and paints, or in food manufacture such as pure <b>maple</b> <b>syrups,</b> where a profit can still be made despite batch methods being slower and inefficient in terms of labour and equipment usage. Due to the application of Chemical Engineering techniques during manufacturing process development, larger volume chemicals are now produced through a continuous [...] "assembly line" [...] chemical processes. The Industrial Revolution was when a shift from batch to more continuous processing began to occur. Today commodity chemicals and petrochemicals are predominantly made using continuous manufacturing processes whereas speciality chemicals, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals are made using batch processes.|$|R

The sap and processed syrup are rich in abscisic acid (ABA) and its oxidation metabolites phaseic acid and dihydrophaseic acid depicting a strong oxidative inactivation of ABA prior to bud break. Actually, phaseic acid and dihydrophaseic acid account for almost 90 % of this class of molecules, while ABA account for less to 10 % of this sesquiterpenoid in the sap and syrup.
