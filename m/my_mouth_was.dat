60|$|I {{became aware}} of the ticking of a great clock in the corner. <b>My</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> dry.|$|E
60|$|I {{could think}} of nothing to say, to any purpose, and <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> very dry. The wind and the wires took up the story with a long lamenting wail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine," [...] he answered. [...] "Most {{remarkable}} fine, Jesse, {{now that}} I can chew again. <b>My</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> that dry that I couldn't chew from sun-up {{to when you}} brung the water." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All {{of which}} means that you're entirely {{satisfied}} with everything this night?" [...] I said, with a laugh, for the capture of the Tories had pleased me so thoroughly that <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> stretched in a grin nearly all the time.|$|E
60|$|But not to sleep. My {{mind was}} in a whirl, and I could not think clearly. <b>My</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> parched, and my tongue so thick that when I tried to utter some words in reverie I could not, a thing that frightened me still more.|$|E
60|$|Men {{leapt from}} their chairs in their enthusiasm, and crowded round {{the table on}} which I was perched, whilst, when {{presently}} I sprang down, one noble woman {{kissed me on the}} lips before them all, saying that <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> indeed a mouth of gold.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> full of saliva, it {{runs out}} like a river and I cannot speak.|$|R
5000|$|Watch <b>My</b> <b>Mouth</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} album by rapper Cazwell. Watch <b>My</b> <b>Mouth</b> <b>is</b> his first {{full-length}} album, with eight bonus tracks. Cazwell described {{the music of}} the album as [...] "dance more than anything else. There are some hip hop elements, but I wouldn’t call it a hip hop album. All the songs are different because I worked with different producers. Ultimately it’s a lighthearted dance rap album." ...|$|R
6000|$|Objection. But I cannot pray, says one, {{therefore}} {{how should}} I persevere? When I go to prayer, instead of praying, <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> stopped. What {{would you have}} me do? ...|$|R
60|$|In those hours, {{brother and}} friend of my heart's heart, {{the moon and the}} stars were as blood above me, and in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> the taste of dry earth. Also, I broke no bread, and my drink was the rain of the Valley of Ghor upon my face.|$|E
6000|$|... --I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a {{cold day}} and to keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sure I couldn't say a word in any case because <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> full of tobacco juice.|$|E
60|$|Now I understood, and a {{cold sweat}} broke out all over me. My companions were to be murdered, every one! Oh! gladly would I have given my life to warn them. But alas! I could not, for the cloth upon <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> so thick that no sound could pass it.|$|E
50|$|Im Talking With <b>My</b> <b>Mouth</b> <b>is</b> an EP by indie folk band Hem. It {{consists}} of five cover songs and was sometimes included with pressings of their debut album, Rabbit Songs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care a straw about Mr. Fothergill; and now <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> closed {{against your}} uncle. But it's quite frightful {{to think that}} a Duke of Omnium must die like anybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|And <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>is</b> full of dust [...] Till I cannot {{speak and}} curse-- [...] Speak and damn him ... "Blame's unjust"? [...] Sin blots out the universe, [...] All {{because she would}} and must? ...|$|R
60|$|We {{no longer}} had any food with us, {{and there was not}} a drop of water nearer than the river. Already it seemed as if <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> parched to the point of swelling, and because it was beyond my reach, I longed most {{intensely}} for something to quench thirst.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I sat {{beneath a}} tree, and I don't know how often I smoked my pipe out, but <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> parched at sunrise, {{and there was}} a new purpose growing into shape at the bottom of my mind. You see, I {{realized}} that I must fall into line and toil like the rest if I wanted you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could no}} longer hold myself back, but ran to the seaside and out, from one rock to another, as far as I could go. It is a marvel I was not drowned; for when I was brought to a stand at last, my legs shook under me, and <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> so dry, I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout.|$|E

5000|$|The Priest entreats Baphomet—"O Lion and O Serpent"—to be [...] "mighty among us." [...] He then {{declares}} the Law of Thelema to the People—"Do what thou wilt {{shall be}} {{the whole of the}} Law"—who respond with [...] "Love is the law, love under will." [...] He finally partakes of the Eucharist with the words, [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>be</b> the essence {{of the life of the}} Sun" [...] (with the Host) and [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>be</b> the essence of the joy of the earth" [...] (with the Wine).

50|$|Hypersalivation , a {{prominent}} autonomic manifestation, is {{often associated with}} hemifacial seizures, oro-pharyngo-laryngeal symptoms and speech arrest.

60|$|It {{would have}} been better for me if he had refrained from {{speaking}} of food, because the mere words made me hungry, and on the instant I realized, or fancied I did, that <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> parched with thirst. The knowledge that I could minister to neither one desire nor the other, until we were come to Cambridge, only served to make them all the more intense.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well Caleb, {{you have}} not asked me to take you up, and {{tell you a story}} so, for a long time. This is the way I used to do when you were quite a little boy; only then you used to kneel in my lap, and lay your head upon my shoulder, so that <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> close to your ear. But you are too big now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her husband! I had {{pictured in}} my mind that she was a young widow. This brown-faced brute with his [...] "go to blazes" [...] was the husband of this tender dove of a woman. Oh, if she would but allow me to free her from so odious an encumbrance! There is no divorce so quick and certain as that which I could give her. But a promise is a promise, and I kept it to the letter. <b>My</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> sealed.|$|E

She pointed to the {{photograph}} on the mantelpiece. It {{was the first time}} since the night when they had met that she had made any allusion to it. By silent agreement the subject had been ruled out between them. 'By the way, you never told me her name.' ...|$|E
60|$|Snatching my cap {{from beneath}} the desk where I had {{concealed}} it at recess, I hurried out and away over the sand-lot on the shortest way home. No stopping now for burrs!--I ran like one pursued. I shall never forget as long as I live, the pain, the panic, the frenzy of that race against time. The hot sand burned my feet, my side ached, <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> dry, and yet I ran {{on and on and}} on, looking back from moment to moment, seeing pursuers in every moving object.|$|E
60|$|When {{it came to}} this, I gave Alan up. But {{he looked}} so {{innocent}} all the time, and was in such clear good faith in what he said, and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty, that <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> closed. Mr. Henderland's words came back to me: that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild Highlanders. Well, here I had taken mine. Alan's morals were all tail-first; but {{he was ready to}} give his life for them, such as they were.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My lord,' he said, 'you {{have touched}} upon a string that I had hoped {{might have been}} spared me.
