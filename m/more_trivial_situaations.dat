Concerns regarding the impact of frequent or poorly-controlled use were expressed in the 1950s, leading to new guidelines, regulations and ultimately the practise's end by the early 1960s.|$|R

Only important applications such as health care, bodily safety, food safety, nondestructive testing, and scientific research meet the risk-benefit threshold for use.|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} {{focussed}} upon {{the media coverage}} of the disappearance of schoolgirl Lindsay Rimer in November 1994, whose body was recovered shortly after the episode was broadcast. This first episode also covered <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> stories, such as the launch of a new cheese, and a live interview with Coronation Street actress Lynne Perrie, who was promoting her autobiography.|$|R
5000|$|Jan Eggum (born 8 December 1951) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter who {{has been}} active since 1975. He is often characterised as a [...] "face for the melancholy", and the themes in his songs are often broken hearts, {{loneliness}} and sorrow. Sometimes his lyrics include social criticism, but he also shows <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> and funny sides of himself.|$|R
50|$|At his uncle's {{newspaper}} where Larry Elliot (Jack Haley) {{works as}} a reporter specializing in chess, he is known {{to miss out on}} bigger stories to cover <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> events of minor interest.

50|$|The same month, investigative duties {{started to}} be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command. The 4602nd AISS was tasked with {{investigating}} only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book {{to deal with the}} <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> reports.|$|R

[...] In fact some of the wiki's most viewed pages are these non-traditional reference pages that work well in the wiki format such as music lists and timelines.|$|R

And to her mortification she found herself actually in fear of this girl {{who might have been}} her daughter. So in Virginia's presence she became <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> and petty than ever. It was her one defence.|$|R

(For instance, in [...] "Sibling Ribaldry," [...] she manages to completely clarify a couple's romantic emotional issues in thirty seconds but does so only to bring them around so she can then film them discussing <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> sexual issues that are more shocking.) ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> {{approach}} is to write a program {{that will make a}} copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated. This {{approach is}} common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler as it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself.|$|R
50|$|But {{since the}} methods used for neurophysiological {{research}} are still fairly complex and understanding of relevant processes is incomplete, <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> methods are also used. Especially useful is observation of behavioural responses to acoustic signals. One such response is phonotaxis - directional movement towards the signal source. By observing response to well defined signals in a controlled environment, we can gain insight into signal function, sensitivity of the hearing apparatus, noise filtering capability, etc.|$|R
40|$|Aiming at {{improving}} the pedagogic encounter, I look into {{some aspects of}} the philosophy of language mainly in Martin Heidegger. I try to go beyond some of the <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> views in the pedagogic theory, like stating that we should draw on students previews experiences and concepts, when introducing new ones. Specially underlined two Heideggerian insights: though the word is not the thing, nevertheless that same word is the house of being...|$|R

The format of the iron itself was almost always round and considerably larger than those used for communion.|$|R

The show has no bias, and Green never gives her personal opinion, except on <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> subjects which are fitted in around the main subject. Despite being a talk show, several songs are played each hour, usually following news and traffic announcements.|$|R
40|$|The lack {{of focus}} {{that is a}} {{characteristic}} of unsupervised pattern mining in sequential data {{represents one of the}} major limitations of this approach. This lack of focus is due to the inherently large number of rules that is likely to be discovered in any but the <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> sets of sequences. Several authors have promoted the use of constraints to reduce that number, but those constraints approximate the mining task to a hypothesis test task. In this pape...|$|R

5000|$|The Descriptio’s {{objectivity}} in its {{presentation of}} the Welsh {{has been the subject}} of much scholarly disagreement. Its [...] "extreme impartiality" [...] was asserted by H. E. Butler, and denied by Meic Stephens; Brynley F. Roberts thought that Gerald's Welsh sympathies are unmistakable, while Michael Faletra saw the book as slanted against the Welsh, attributing to them virtues <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> than their vices and giving them military advice much less practical than the advice he gave to the Anglo-Normans.|$|R
5000|$|Mark Schorer {{notes in}} his 1961 {{biography}} of Lewis that reception of The Man Who Knew Coolidge was mixed. It suffered both unfavorable reviews, including critic Heywood Broun calling it [...] "the dullest writing ever {{to come from a}} first-class writing man", and favorable notices, among the latter being a front page appearance on the New York Times Book Review section. Schorer himself appeared unimpressed, calling The Man Who Knew Coolidge [...] "a <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> project".|$|R

There was an interesting finding with the ICS groups: the analytic-verbaliser group had a significantly higher average on cognitive performance with the T 1 than T 2. A medium effect size was observed (d[*]=[*] 0.62) (Cohen 1977); for the wholist-imagers, there was a negligible effect size observed (d[*]=[*] 0.12). An even <b>more</b> <b>trivial</b> effect size was computed for the wholist-verbalisers and analytic-imagers (d[*]=[*] 0.02 and d[*]=[*] 0.01 respectively).|$|R
