In densely populated areas, a courtyard in a home can provide privacy for a family, a break from the frantic pace of everyday life, and a safe place for children to play. With space at a premium, architects are experimenting with courtyards as a way to provide outdoor space for small communities of people at a time. A courtyard surrounded by 12 houses, for example, would provide a shared park-like space for those families, who could take pride in ownership of the space. Though this <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a modern-day solution to an inner city problem, the grouping of houses around a shared courtyard was common practice among the Incas as far back as the 13th century.|$|E

[...] "Once in a Lifetime" [...] {{pays homage to}} early rap techniques and the music of art rock band The Velvet Underground.

[...] Haigh from Attitude believed that [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] should have been released as the lead single from MDNA. He felt that the track [...] "screams" [...] early 1990s Madonna's work, and complimented it for being a [...] "basic, balls-to-the-wall night out anthem", adding [...] "why does that have to be something that's considered 'below' Madonna?" [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the [...] "pop stomper" [...] track, writing: [...] "The production <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> she's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna, but who's counting. Madonna brings her own authority, creating the kind of anthemic party song that she does best, the kind where everyone from your three-year-old niece to your 60-year-old mother gets up on the dancefloor."

[...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan.

500|$|Rebel Heart {{opens with}} the song [...] "Living for Love".

Although a breakup song, [...] "Living for Love" [...] talks about being triumphant and hopeful. According to Dean Piper of The Daily Telegraph, the song has [...] "some classic Madonna traits: religious references, a gospel choir, 90s piano beats and a whirling bass". It was compared to her 1989 singles, [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] and [...] "Express Yourself" [...] by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard. The second track, [...] "Devil Pray", was inspired by how one could be enticed to partake of narcotics to achieve {{a higher level of}} consciousness and connect to God. Lyrically it asks for salvation from a variety of drug abuses, making allusions to Saint Mary and Lucifer, as well as the pain of healing from drug abuse. Produced by Madonna with Falk, Avicii, DJ Dahi, and Blood Diamonds, [...] "Devil Pray" [...] starts with gentle guitar sounds which build up to an electropop production, accompanied by a house beat. [...] "Ghosttown" [...] talks about civilizations ending and the world encountering an armageddon, but humans seeing hope amid the destruction. Written with Jason Evigan, Evan Bogart, and Sean Douglas, it is a power ballad song, which Madonna sings in [...] "piercing" [...] and [...] "warm" [...] vocals like those of Karen Carpenter's, and the production is comparable to her 1986 single, [...] "Live to Tell". According to Douglas, [...] "Ghosttown" [...] was written in three days, after Madonna personally requested studio time with him and the other songwriters. The fourth track, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch", has reggae, dancehall, and dubstep influences, and is a ska song where Madonna speaks negatively about a break-up and her lover, in lyrics such as: [...] "It <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> I'm an Unapologetic Bitch but sometimes you have to call it like it is". Madonna explained that the song is about having fun irrespective of the situation one is in.|$|E

Spin ranked it number 123 on their list of the 300 best albums of the past 30 years (1985–2014), calling it [...] "a genius cross-pollination of seemingly divergent styles". The magazine also positioned the album at number eight on the list of the 50 best hip hop debut albums since Reasonable Doubt. Stylus Magazine ranked the album number 13 on their list of the top 50 albums of 2000–2005, praising Madlib's production, based on [...] "an endless supply of funk, soul, and jazz samples", and stating that the album was [...] "displaying the future of hip-hop".|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's all I really need to hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an American Idol, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign.

So I think people writing online <b>might</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E

2500|$|Properly speaking, Georgian {{does not}} {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives; rather, it distinguishes modifiers from modified by relative {{position in the}} nominal clause.

Peluso was a typical rock guitarist and did not read music, so Richard wrote out a chord chart for him to follow. Having been instructed to play the first five bars of the melody and then improvise, he recorded the solo in two takes. Bettis later described [...] "Goodbye to Love" [...] as his favorite single he has worked on in his career. The single reached No.7 in the Billboard Hot 100, and Peluso accepted an offer to tour with the Carpenters full time.

Yet there are three reasons for looking at Le comte Ory as an authentic French opera. Firstly, in the newly composed parts of the work, Rossini avoided the traditional features of the closed numbers typical of the Italian tradition by inserting recitatives inside the numbers and by merging closed numbers and subsequent recitatives, especially {{at the end of}} Act II. Secondly, the French lines written by Scribe to fit the already composed music follow poetic patterns from the Middle Ages, of which the prosodic features were closer to Italian than Classical French. Last, the very choice of the legend of Ory is typical of the troubadour style that had been fashionable in Paris since the last decades of the 18 th century, {{and it turns out that}} this particular legend was extremely popular back then, as witnessed by the variety of local variants that were published in the 19 th century...|$|R
50|$|Fans {{and book}} authors have {{created their own}} albums that could {{represent}} {{what they had been}} working on. An example of this is the mock-album Days Between (The Final Album That Never Was), put together by Tony Sclafani, author of the 2013 book The Grateful Dead FAQ: All That's Left To Know About the Greatest Jam Band in History. This would-be album is sketched out in Chapter 35 of his book; he also put together a video on YouTube, made up of studio and live recordings, so fans could hear what the album <b>might</b> have <b>sounded</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because medieval {{music theory}} was {{dominated}} by ecclesiastics, {{it is often difficult}} to determine from the existing manuscripts just how the secular medieval music sounded. Corvus Corax draws on a number of sources to try to make their music as authentic as possible: they have used documents that [...] "condemn profane music" [...] as an indicator of what the music <b>might</b> have <b>sounded</b> <b>like,</b> and drawn on nineteenth century scholarly treatises for information. In many cases these treatises are unreliable, as they impart more nineteenth century interpretations of medieval music than factual information on what the music was like.|$|R
