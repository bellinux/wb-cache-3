While leaving the scene, the criminals were spotted by a minister who recognized the men and reported them to the police. The two men were arrested the next day. Singleton pleaded not guilty, but after Dillinger's father (the local Mooresville Church deacon) discussed the matter with Morgan County prosecutor Omar O'Harrow, his father convinced Dillinger to confess to the crime and plead guilty without retaining a defense attorney. Dillinger was convicted of assault and battery with intent to rob, and conspiracy to commit a felony. He expected a lenient probation sentence {{as a result of his}} father's discussion with O'Harrow, but instead was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison for his crimes. His father told reporters he regretted his advice and was appalled by the sentence. He pleaded with the judge to shorten the sentence, but with no success. (During the robbery, Dillinger had struck a victim on the head with a <b>machine</b> <b>bolt</b> wrapped in a cloth and had also carried a gun which, although it discharged, hit no one). En route to Mooresville to testify against Singleton, Dillinger briefly escaped his captors, but was apprehended within a few minutes. Singleton had a change of venue and was sentenced to a jail term of 2 to 14 years. He was killed on August 31, 1937, by a train when he passed out, drunk, on a railroad track.|$|E

40|$|Among {{underground}} coal miners, {{hearing loss}} {{remains one of}} the most common occupational illnesses. In response, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts research to reduce the noise emission of various underground coal mining equipment, an example of which is a roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> (RBM). After the removal of coal or rock, the remaining strata may be subject to fall, either from overhead (the roof) or from the side (the rib). One method used in underground coal-mines to prevent failures requires the installation of roof bolts. The roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator trams the machine to the required location, drills a hole into the strata, and then installs a roof bolt, supporting the roof or the rib, as the case may be. Field studies support the premise that, on average, drilling noise is the loudest noise that a roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator would be exposed to and contributes significantly to the operators 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 noise exposure. NIOSH has determined that the drill steel radiates a significant amount of noise during drilling. NIOSH is developing bit and chuck isolators to reduce vibration, and thus noise radiation of the drill steel, with the longer-term goal of reducing roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operator noise exposure. Laboratory testing has shown that operator ear sound pressure levels may be reduced by 3 to 7 dB(A), depending upon the test configuration and drilling media...|$|R

The need for a CAC on the continuous miner was eliminated when the cab was removed from the machine design. However, CAC development progressed to include CAC designs for a roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> to protect roof bolters from respirable coal mine dust (Goodman and Organiscak 2002; Listak and Beck 2012; Reed et al. 2017).

40|$|New <b>bolt</b> <b>machines</b> of {{the make}} and model Atlas Copco Boltec-LC has been {{acquired}} in Kristineberg mine, which also meant that a new bolting method started {{to be used in}} the mine. The old bolting method was based on a drilling rig that predrilled holes and then have another machine comes after to put the bolt in the holes. The new acquired Boltec can perform the drill-ing and put a bolt in that hole itself without a repositioning of the boom. The thesis work primary goal was to investigate if the new <b>bolt</b> <b>machines</b> can make the productiongoals of the mine by collecting and studying the data from the control center. The secondary goal in the thesis, is about studying the differences among operators and see how their approach can affect the bolt quality. The result in the issue of capacity shows that it takes two Boltec to have the same capacity as one of the old <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> from the old method. However, there are several factors that influenced these numbers, especially how the operators reports their work in the mine. The secondary goal of the thesis was set up after that several bolts have shown that they were not properly embedded in the rock. Therefor the quality was questioned in Kristineberg. Devia-tion in the operator's approach has not been noted, however, a theory have been created and probably the answer to why the quality of the bolts varies.

In response to this, the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has initiated a project to develop engineering noise controls for roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machines.</b> Key to this research is {{an evaluation of the}} duty cycle of a typical roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> operation and this paper presents the results of such an exercise for data collected at two cooperating coalmines. The evaluation entails a time motion study of an operators' shift, logging each activity for time (e. g., tramming the machine, drilling holes, installing the roof bolt, etc.) and the noise levels associated with each task with a Larson Davis Spark 705 + dosimeter. NIOSH post processed the data to determine which tasks the operator devotes the most time to and the noise dosage accumulated during those tasks. These results provide insight into which portion of the operators' duty cycle is the most prominent contributor to noise exposure and thus, where research activities for the development of engineering noise controls should be focused. It was determined that the task of drilling holes is the most significant source of the operators' noise exposure and project research has focused on engineering noise controls to reduce the noise emissions generated during the drilling portion of the machine duty cycle...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, {{underground}} {{coal mines}} in the United States reported 3, 405 injuries to the U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Of these, 17 percent {{were associated with}} the use of <b>bolting</b> <b>machines,</b> 8 percent with continuous miners, and 4 percent each with scoop/load-haul-dump (LHD), shuttle cars and personnel transport. Analysis of the injury narratives identified five hazards that required attention. They are rock falling from supported roof inadvertent or incorrect operation of <b>bolting</b> <b>machine</b> controls, handling continuous miner cable, collisions while driving underground vehicles and driving or traveling in underground vehicles on rough roadways. The rate of lost-time injuries has steadily decreased during the past 10 years (from more than 10 per 100 FTE in 1995, to six in 2004). However, underground coal mining remains a hazardous industry. One of the contributors to this elevated injury risk is working with or near underground coal mining equipment. Roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machines</b> and continuous miners have been consistently identified as high risk equipment. They account for approximately 24 percent of all injuries to underground coal miners (Sanders and Shaw, 1989). LHD's, shuttle cars and personnel transports are also associated with injuries in underground coal mines (Burgess-Limerick, 2005).

Such analyses are worthwhile and may be helpful in tracking broad trends over time. Further information is available in the narrative text field completed for each injury reported.

40|$|Many {{injuries}} are caused {{each year by}} rock falls in coal mines. Most of these {{injuries are}} not caused by major roof collapses, but from falls of smaller rocks from the immediate top or roof skin. Various surface controls are used in mines to control this surface rock. One that {{has been found to}} be very effective is roof screening. Depending on the size of the screen, roof coverage approaching 100 %can be achieved. Many mines are reluctant to use screen for primary skin control because of additional costs of time and materials, but others are having great success at both controlling costs and surface rock. Data is presented from two mines that show a dramatic reduction in roof skin injuries when screening is used. Much of this success is due to innovations in roof <b>bolting</b> <b>machines.</b> Four case studies of roof screen experience are presented along with associated costs of materials, impact on bolting advance rates, and potential ergonomic risks. The effects of roof screening on skin control and safety are also included.
