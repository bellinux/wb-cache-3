In 1916, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bailey</b> decided to find a more {{populated}} location and, with the Governor’s permission, built a station at Muie. In 1918, J. Jakeman and Andrew McGill relieved <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bailey</b> and established a number of outposts among the Mbunda and Luchazi people. In the ensuing years, four more stations were established: Cunjamba, N'inda, Casuango and Catota all in the fallen Mbundaland.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Burns' character, appearance, and mannerisms {{are based}} on several {{different}} people. The show's creator Matt Groening principally based Mr. Burns on his high school teacher <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bailey.</b> Drawing further inspiration from oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, Groening made Mr. Burns the [...] "embodiment of corporate greed". Animator David Silverman parodied Mr. Burns' appearance on Fox founder Barry Diller, and modeled his body on a praying mantis. The idea of Mr. Burns reading employee names off cards in [...] "There's No Disgrace Like Home" [...] came from an article about Ronald Reagan that writer Al Jean had read. In some episodes, parallels have been drawn between Mr. Burns and moguls such as Howard Hughes and, more frequently, fictional character Charles Foster Kane from Citizen Kane. Writer George Meyer lifted Mr. Burns' [...] "Excellent!" [...] hand gesture from his former Saturday Night Live colleague Jim Downey. While perhaps not intentional, Mr. Burns' physical characteristics and mannerisms are cited as a modern example of the Commedia dell'arte character Pantalone.|$|E
