5000|$|Species of Tylobolus are {{medium to}} large millipedes ranging from 36 - 92 mm long and 5 to 10 mm wide, with females {{attaining}} larger sizes than males.

40|$|WO 2008011996 A 2 UPAB: 20080519 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} moistening of a <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> (1) iterative by {{the fluid}} material at a given, constant temperature. The fluid material partly discharges {{for a given}} discharge time, which is so measured that the <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> obtains a constant weight. The yield point is determined by a remaining residual quantity at the <b>measuring</b> <b>body.</b> The <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> is immersed in the fluid material and is flushed by the fluid material. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a measuring device for periodic measuring of the yield point by fluid materials (2) use of the measuring device for continuous monitoring of fluid materials in a production line. USE - Temperature grade determining method of chocolate masses (Claimed). Can also be used in measuring, yield point of fluid materials in fluid material flow. ADVANTAGE - The <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> is moistened iterative by the fluid material at a given, constant temperature, and the yield point is determined by a remaining residual quantity at the <b>measuring</b> <b>body,</b> and hence ensures a quasi-continuous regulation of a flow limit of dispersions in an easy and reproducible manner, and further covers {{a wide spectrum of}} materials, which are capable of flowing through the measuring system...|$|R

40|$|The {{members of}} the order Callipodida are best {{recognized}} by their putative apomorphies: a divided hypoproct, divided anal valves, long extrusible tubular vulvae, and, as in all other helminthomorph milli-pede orders, a characteristic conformation of the male gonopods. As in Polydesmida, only the first leg pair of the 7 th <b>body</b> <b>ring</b> is transformed into gonopods, which are retracted inside the <b>body.</b> <b>Body</b> <b>rings</b> are open ventrally and are not fused with the sternites, leaving the coxae of the legs free. Legs in the anterior half of the body carry coxal pouches. The small collum does not overlap the head. Callipodida are of uniformly cylindrical external appearance. The number of <b>body</b> <b>rings</b> is only sometimes fixed in species and usually exceeds 40. There are nine antennomeres, as the 2 nd antennomere of other Diplopoda is subdivided (= antennomere 2 and 3 in Callipodida). The general struc-ture of the gnathochilarium is shared with the Chordeumatida and Polydesmida. Callipodida {{are said to be}} characterised by longitudinal crests, which gives the order the common name “crested millipedes”. Although crest are present in most species, some genera (e. g. Schizopetalum) lack a crest, while some Spirostreptida (e. g. in Cambalopsidae, ‘Trachystreptini’) and some Julida (e. g. Cheloiulus) have similar structures.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the purification of the Escherichia coli outer membrane (lipopolysaccharide or L membrane) with flagella still attached. The resulting lipopolysaccharide membrane {{was in the}} form of vesicles that had a trilaminar structure in thin section and contained about 55 % lipopolysaccharide and 45 % protein. T 2 or T 4 phage preadsorbed to E. coli were found attached to the purified lipopolysaccharide membrane. Flagella were bound to the purified lipopolysaccharide membrane specifically at the basal <b>body</b> <b>ring</b> closest to the hook (the L ring). The cytoplasmic membrane in preparations from osmotically lysed E. coli spheroplasts or Bacillus subtilis protoplasts was specifically attached to flagella at the basal <b>body</b> <b>ring</b> farthest from the hook (the M ring). In the E. coli preparation, lipopolysaccharide membrane was also present and was attached to the L ring.

50|$|Another {{technique}} for <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> composition {{has been developed}} for <b>measuring</b> <b>body</b> volume using a different method than underwater weighing. The technique uses air as opposed to water and is known as air displacement plethysmography (ADP). Subjects enter a sealed chamber that <b>measures</b> their <b>body</b> volume through the displacement of air in the chamber. Body volume is combined with body weight (mass) {{in order to determine}} body density. The technique then estimates the percentage of body fat and lean body mass (LBM) through empirically derived equations similar to those used with underwater weighing (for the density of fat and fat free mass).|$|R

40|$|Percentage of {{body fat}} is {{strongly}} associated with the risk of several chronic diseases but its accurate measurement is difficult. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a relatively simple, quick and non-invasive technique, to <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> composition. It <b>measures</b> <b>body</b> fat accurately in controlled clinical conditions but its performance {{in the field is}} inconsistent. In large epidemiologic studies simpler surrogate techniques such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio are frequently used instead of BIA to <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> fatness. We reviewed the rationale, theory, and technique of recently developed systems such as foot (or hand) -to-foot BIA measurement, and the elements that could influence its results in large epidemiologic studies. BIA results are influenced by factors such as the environment, ethnicity, phase of menstrual cycle, and underlying medical conditions. We concluded that BIA measurements validated for specific ethnic groups, populations and conditions can accurately <b>measure</b> <b>body</b> fat in those populations, but not others and suggest that for large epdiemiological studies with diverse populations BIA may not be the appropriate choice for body composition measurement unless specific calibration equations are developed for different groups participating in the study...|$|R
