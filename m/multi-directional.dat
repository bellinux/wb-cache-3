5|$|Desert Strike is a shoot 'em up game {{in which}} the player pilots an AH-64 Apache helicopter. The game is less frantic than typical shoot 'em ups, with the {{addition}} of greater strategic elements. The action takes place on open, <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling levels viewed from an isometric perspective. The player views the action from outside the helicopter, rather than from within the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Robotron is a 2D <b>multi-directional</b> shooter game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the on-screen protagonist from a top-down perspective. The game {{is set in the}} year 2084 in a fictional world where robots ("Robotrons") have taken control of the world and eradicated most of the human race. The main protagonist is a nameless superhuman attempting to save the last human family.|$|E
5|$|Other remakes were in development, {{but never}} released. Previously {{unreleased}} Atarisoft prototypes of Joust for the ColecoVision surfaced in 2001 at the Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas. An adaptation with three-dimensional (3D) graphics (and a port {{of the original}} Joust as a bonus) was in development for the Atari Jaguar CD. Titled Dactyl Joust, it was eventually canceled. Newcomer pitched {{an updated version of}} the arcade game for the Game Boy Advance to Midway Games. The company, however, did not sanction it. The prototype featured <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling, more detailed graphics based on 3D renders, and new gameplay mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's levels are slower and oriented towards <b>multi-directional</b> shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's levels are open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} ported to the PC by Tim Ansell of Creative Assembly, and to Atari ST by Jones' friend Wayne Smithson, while Dailly began porting {{the game to}} the Commodore 64 {{following}} the Personal Computer World Show in September 1989. Dailly used the code from the Talisman demo, and wrote a new sprite system. He also re-worked the <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling, and wrote his own tape loading routines, wanting one that allowed players to play a simple game while Blood Money loaded. Smith designed the graphics for the port, and became confused by {{the limitations of the}} hardware: he had to draw double pixels in Deluxe Paint, and was limited to sixteen colours. Dailly finished developing the Commodore 64 version of Blood Money on 12 March 1990.|$|E
25|$|Carlson Stadium: 5,000 seats; {{football}} field; eight-lane, 400-meter polyurethane {{track with}} two-directional approaches for pole vault and all jumping events; two shot put circles; discus/hammer cage; and <b>multi-directional</b> javelin-throwing areas.|$|E
25|$|Strike is {{a series}} of video games created by Mike Posehn, John Patrick Manley and Tony Barnes {{released}} between 1991 and 1997 by Electronic Arts for a number of video game systems. The games are <b>multi-directional</b> shooters shown mostly from an isometric perspective.|$|E
25|$|While color {{monitors}} {{had been}} used by several racing video games before (such as Indy 800 and Speed Race Twin), {{it was during this}} period that RGB color graphics became widespread, following the release of Galaxian in 1979. Namco's Rally-X in 1980 featured <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling, and introduced a radar tracking the player position. Sega's Space Tactics that year was a space combat game allowing <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling from a first-person perspective. The following year, Namco's Bosconian allowed the player's ship to freely move across open space that scrolls in all directions. By the early 1980s, scrolling had become popular among arcade video games and would make its way to third-generation consoles, where it would prove nearly as pivotal as the move to 3D graphics on later fifth-generation consoles.|$|E
25|$|Gifted {{education}} is a broad term for special practices, procedures and theories used {{in the education of}} children who have been identified as gifted or talented. Various schools across Saskatchewan have aimed to fulfill this mandate such as Walter Murray Collegiate Advanced Program, and Mount Royal Collegiate Institute <b>Multi-Directional</b> Approach to Education (MDA) MDA program to name a few.|$|E
25|$|After {{the growth}} period, when the meristems are dormant, {{the leaves are}} sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing seed-bearing organs (such as fruit) are always sinks. Because of this <b>multi-directional</b> flow, coupled {{with the fact that}} sap cannot move with ease between {{adjacent}} sieve-tubes, {{it is not unusual for}} sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The run and gun {{platformer}} genre was {{popularized by}} Konami's classic Contra. Gunstar Heroes and Metal Slug are {{also among the}} most popular examples of this style. Side-scrolling run and gun games are an attempt to marry platform games with shoot 'em ups, characterized by a minimal focus on precise platform jumping and a major emphasis on <b>multi-directional</b> shooting. These games are sometimes called platform shooters. This genre has strong arcade roots, and as such, these games are generally known for being very difficult, and having very linear, one-way game progression.|$|E
25|$|In November 2008, Metrolinx, the Ontario {{government}} agency for Greater Toronto and Hamilton transportation, released its Regional Transportation Plan titled The Big Move, outlining how an airport rail link {{was part of}} a strategy to establish <b>multi-directional</b> high-order transit connectivity to the Pearson Airport district, in addition to the Mississauga Transitway, rapid transit corridors along Highways 427 and 407, and light rail transit lines along Eglinton and Finch Avenues. In December 2008, Metrolinx became the proponent of new EA that would simultaneously assess a combination of both the UP Express and GO Transit's Georgetown South expansion. The final Environmental Project Report was released on July 30, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Light {{emitting}} diode (LED) lamps {{are used}} for both general and special-purpose lighting. Compared to fluorescent bulbs, their advantages are that they contain no mercury, they turn on instantly at any temperature, their extremely long lifetime is unaffected by cycling on and off, they have no glass to break, and they don't emit UV rays that fade colored materials. LED lamps radiate almost no heat, and can be either <b>multi-directional</b> or unidirectional, {{eliminating the need for}} a mirrored reflector in the bulb or fixture. LED lamps can emit saturated colored light. Disadvantages include spectrum limitations due to discrete emission colors, and higher up-front cost than incandescent bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Also {{featured}} during ground-based {{levels is}} a feature known as Survival Mode. This mode is activated when a lion takes too much damage. The player character is {{ejected from the}} cockpit and must survive for 10 seconds while the lion repairs itself. During these sequences the character {{is equipped with a}} blaster and must survive on foot, using the same <b>multi-directional</b> gameplay mechanics as when piloting the lion. Once the 10 seconds have elapsed the player character can re-enter the lion's cockpit and resume normal gameplay. Players can also find collectible items throughout the level which can provide their character with an extra life or additional, temporary features such as enhanced firepower.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave theory, {{when using}} a low {{order of the}} {{perturbation}} expansion (e.g. up to second, third or fifth order), is valid for non-linear waves on intermediate and deep water, that is for wavelengths (λ) not large {{as compared with the}} mean depth (h). In shallow water, the low-order Stokes expansion breaks down (gives unrealistic results) for appreciable wave amplitude (as compared to the depth). Then, Boussinesq approximations are more appropriate. Further approximations on Boussinesq-type (<b>multi-directional)</b> wave equations lead – for one-way wave propagation – to the Korteweg–de Vries equation or the Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation. Like (near) exact Stokes-wave solutions, these two equations have solitary wave (soliton) solutions, besides periodic-wave solutions known as cnoidal waves.|$|E
25|$|Voltron: Defender of the Universe {{is played}} {{primarily}} as a twin stick shooter. During most levels players control one of five Voltron lions. The lions are equipped with <b>multi-directional</b> cannons, controlled with the right thumbstick, while the left thumbstick coordinates movement. Each lion is equipped with pounce and melee attacks. Each lion features a unique special attack and individual strengths and weaknesses. These levels consist of both ground and space-based levels, with only secondary controls changing between the two environments. The game features cooperative gameplay with up to five players. Up to two players can play on a local machine, and the game supports any combination of local and online players up to five. The game features leaderboards and a downloadable challenge mode in which players must combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells are}} {{commonly}} encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin {{to protect the}} delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from polyvinyl acetate or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces, diffractive elements, prism arrays, air prisms, v-grooves, diffuse elements, as well as <b>multi-directional</b> waveguide arrays. Prism arrays show an overall 5% increase in the total solar energy conversion. Active coatings that convert infrared light into visible light have shown a 30% increase.|$|E
25|$|Pinot gris is a Pinot color sport (and {{can arise}} by {{mutation}} of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a somatic mutation {{in either the}} VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control grape berry color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutation–reversion path is <b>multi-directional</b> therefore. The general DNA profiles of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir; and other Pinots, Pinot moure and Pinot teinturier, are also genetically similarly close. It should be noted therefore that almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other Pinot As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this 'core' around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, moure, etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as 'Samtrot' (effectively 'Pinot red velvet').|$|E
500|$|During {{development}} of the game the combat system {{was one of the}} key focuses. Mike Skupa, the Design Director, said that the combat was refined using feedback from Square Enix, with references drawn from Tony Jaa's The Protector. The system was designed to emphasize <b>multi-directional</b> combat, strike-based gameplay and environmental interaction. It started as [...] "one big violent sandbox" [...] and progressed to a playable demo. Skupa was pleased with how well the game kept the qualities of the original demo.|$|E
500|$|Vertical {{scrolling}} shooters emerged {{around the}} same time. Namco's Xevious, released in 1982, is frequently cited as the first vertical scrolling shooter and, although {{it was in fact}} preceded by several other games of that type, it {{is considered one of the}} most influential. Xevious is also the first to convincingly portray realistic landscapes as opposed to purely science fiction settings. While Asteroids (1979) allowed the player to rotate the game's spacecraft, 1982's highly acclaimed [...] was most influential on subsequent <b>multi-directional</b> shooters.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Newcomer {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the game's design, specifically the monitor's orientation. He commented that the gameplay works best with a horizontal orientation or with <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling. The vertical orientation {{proved to be a}} hindrance for home conversion. While Joust was widely ported to home systems, Joust 2 was only made available as part of emulated collections. In 1997, it was released as part of Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2. Joust 2 was also included in the 2003 and 2012 multi-platform compilations Midway Arcade Treasures and Midway Arcade Origins, respectively. It also appeared in 2016's Lego Dimensions.|$|E
500|$|Sonic Adventure 2 is a 2001 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sonic Team USA {{and published by}} Sega. The sequel to Sonic Adventure (1998), it was the final Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Dreamcast after Sega discontinued the console. It features two good-vs-evil stories: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles [...] "Tails" [...] Prower and Knuckles the Echidna attempt to save the world, while Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat attempt to conquer it. The stories are divided into three gameplay styles: fast-paced platforming for Sonic and Shadow, <b>multi-directional</b> shooting for Tails and Eggman, and action-exploration for Knuckles and Rouge.|$|E
500|$|The player-character, {{a robotic}} maid named Marina, {{journeys}} {{to save her}} kidnapped creator. The story takes place on Planet Clancer, a world {{on the cusp of}} civil war due to the actions of its Emperor and his Imperial forces. The Emperor brainwashes Clancers to kidnap the visiting robotics genius Professor Theo. Theo's creation, the player-character Ultra-InterGalactic-Cybot G Marina Liteyears, pursues the professor and grabs, throws, and shakes the obstacles in her way, such as enemies, floating [...] "Clanball" [...] platforms, warp stars, and missiles. Indeed, almost all game objects can be grabbed, which lends towards the shake-based combat system. Marina can shake [...] "grabbed" [...] objects to throw them as projectiles or to find loot. Objects sometimes change functions when shaken, such as items that become homing missiles and guns with <b>multi-directional</b> shots. Some drop red, blue, and green gems, which restore player health. The health gauge {{in the corner of the}} screen shows the amount of damage Marina can take. The player can store up to two additional stock lives. Yellow gems hidden in each level extend the final cutscene's length. Marina can run, jump, and boost (via jetpack) in the eight cardinal and ordinal directions. She can also slide, hover, and roll.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{recognized}} that the album eschewed contemporary R {{in favor of more}} experimental compositions. Pitchfork writer Carrie Battan wrote that Beyoncé was [...] "exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music" [...] and rejecting [...] "traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere". Spins Anupa Mistry felt it was [...] "more textured than its predecessors in both sound and content", and applauded the singer's transition to a maturer sound of [...] "big-hook message pop, <b>multi-directional,</b> mood-shifting suites and delicately resonant R ballads". Noting the lack of [...] "guaranteed hits", NME believed that the [...] "low-key, moody production throws the spotlight on the words and the images brought to play" [...] and described it as her most experimental work to date. Rolling Stones pop critic Rob Sheffield found Beyoncés boldness among its best attributes, believing the album is at its [...] "strongest when it goes for full-grown electro soul with an artsy boho edge". Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times highlighted a desire to push creative boundaries among the tracks and admired [...] "how the music similarly blends the intimate and the extravagant", while Entertainment Weekly writer Nick Catucci concluded that the album was characterized by [...] "clashing impulses—between strength and escape, megapop and fresh sounds, big messages and resonant lyrics".|$|E
500|$|Shoot 'em ups such as SNK's Ikari Warriors (1986) {{featuring}} {{characters on}} foot, rather than spacecraft, became {{popular in the}} mid-1980s {{in the wake of}} action movies such as [...] The origins of this type go back to Sheriff by Nintendo, released in 1979. Taito's Front Line (1982) established the upwards-scrolling formula later popularized by Commando, in 1985. Commando also drew comparisons to Rambo and indeed contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot 'em up, as opposed to an action-adventure game. In 1986, Arsys Software released WiBArm, a shooter that switched between a 2D side-scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses were fought in an arena-style 2D battle, with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment. In 1987, Square's 3-D WorldRunner was an early stereoscopic 3-D shooter played from a third-person perspective, followed later that year by its sequel JJ, and the following year by Space Harrier 3-D which used the SegaScope 3-D shutter glasses. That same year, Sega's Thunder Blade switched between both a top-down view and a third-person view, and introduced the use of force feedback, where the joystick vibrates. Also in 1987, Konami created Contra as an coin-op arcade game that was particularly acclaimed for its <b>multi-directional</b> aiming and two player cooperative gameplay. However, by the early 1990s and the popularity of 16-bit consoles, the scrolling shooter genre was overcrowded, with developers struggling to make their games stand out (one exception being the inventive Gunstar Heroes, by Treasure).|$|E
2500|$|Skating skills (SS) reward use of {{edges and}} turns, flow over the ice surface, speed and acceleration, ice coverage, clean and {{controlled}} curves, <b>multi-directional</b> skating, and mastery of one-foot skating (no overuse of skating on two feet).|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that compared to a manual brush, the <b>multi-directional</b> power brush does the better job in reducing gingivitis and plaque. These brushes {{tend to be more}} costly. An electric toothbrush performs rotations of its bristles and cleans hard to reach places. Most studies report performances equivalent to those of manual brushings, although the electric version can be more comfortable. An additional timer and pressure sensors can encourage a more efficient cleaning process.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{enormous}} {{success of the}} early games, dozens of developers jumped into the development and manufacturing of video arcade games. Some simply copied the [...] "invading alien hordes" [...] idea of Space Invaders and turned out successful imitators like Namco's Galaxian, Galaga, and Gaplus, though they took the shoot 'em up genre further with new gameplay mechanics, more complex enemy patterns, and richer graphics. Galaxian introduced a [...] "risk-reward" [...] concept, while Galaga {{was one of the}} first games with a bonus stage. Sega's 1980 release Space Tactics was an early first-person space combat game with <b>multi-directional</b> scrolling as the player moved the cross-hairs on the screen.|$|E
