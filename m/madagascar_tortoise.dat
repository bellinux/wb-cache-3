25|$|The {{angonoka}} tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora) is {{a critically}} endangered species of tortoise endemic to Madagascar. It {{is also known}} as the angonoka, ploughshare tortoise, <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tortoise,</b> or Madagascar angulated tortoise.|$|E
50|$|McKeown {{worked as}} a supervising herpetologist at the Honolulu Zoo during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this time, he {{developed}} a number of breeding programs for some lizard and tortoise species. For his commitment to captive breeding the <b>Madagascar</b> angulated <b>tortoise</b> (Geochelone yniphora), McKeown received the AAZPA conservation award. McKeown received zoo awards for being the first to breed <b>Madagascar</b> ploughshare <b>tortoises.</b> He also administered the first long-term breeding program for the Madagascar ground boas.|$|R
50|$|The LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles), {{which opened}} in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and {{terrestrial}} arthropods. Guests first pass through the Oak Woodland Pond, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the 6000 sq ft main building where the Damp Forest houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, Betty's Bite and Squeeze Room, named after GLAZA co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the Behind the Glass room. The Care and Conservation Room showcases Gray's monitor and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is Arroyo Lagarto, a set of outdoor exhibits for <b>Madagascar</b> radiated <b>tortoise,</b> <b>Madagascar</b> spider <b>tortoise,</b> desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A 2000 sq ft secondary building, the Desert LAIR, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with Crocodile Swamp, an outdoor exhibit home to false gharials.|$|R
40|$|C. Supporting {{statement}} The <b>Madagascar</b> spider <b>tortoise</b> (Pyxis arachnoides) is {{endemic to}} south-western Madagascar. Its populations {{have recently been}} heavily damaged from excessive harvesting. As a result, a workshop on the Conservation Assessment Management Plan (CAMP) organized by IUCN in May 2001 recommended including the spider tortoise in CITES Appendix I and changing the listing of the species from Endangered to Critically Endangered (IUCN/CBSG, 2002). During its meeting of 2...|$|R
50|$|The Temperate Zone {{features}} {{animals from}} temperate zones around the world. The zoo's nine-banded armadillos Kirby and Penny. The zoo's rare three black-footed cats and cape hyrax {{can also be}} found in the Temperate Zone. The zoo's Siamese crocodiles Hillary and Bill live in the Temperate Zone during the winter. Other reptiles found in the temperate Hall include a Madagascar tree boa, crested geckos, and <b>Madagascar</b> flat-tailed <b>tortoises.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Menabe {{region of}} Madagascar, a {{biodiversity}} hotspot of great importance, the Trust {{is working with}} a cluster of endangered species, including the Malagasy giant rat, flat-tailed <b>tortoise,</b> <b>Madagascar</b> big-headed turtle, narrow-striped mongoose and Madagascar teal.|$|R
50|$|Giant {{tortoises}} {{are characteristic}} reptiles {{that are currently}} found on two groups of tropical islands: the Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (a population at the Mascarene Islands was exterminated by the 1900s). These tortoises can weigh as much as 417 kg and can grow to be 1.3 m long. Giant tortoises originally {{made their way to}} islands from the mainland; for example, Aldabra Atoll and Mascarenes giant tortoises are related to <b>Madagascar</b> <b>tortoises</b> while Galapagos giant tortoises are related to Ecuador mainland tortoises. This phenomenon of excessive growth is known as island gigantism or insular gigantism. It occurs when the size of the animals that are isolated on an islands increases dramatically in comparison to their mainland relatives. This is due to several factors such as relaxed predation pressure, competitive release, or as an adaptation to increased environmental fluctuations on islands. However, giant tortoises are no longer considered to have been examples of island gigantism, as they originally evolved their massive sizes on the mainland. Giant tortoises were once common across the Cenozoic faunas of Eurasia, Africa and the Americas.|$|R
50|$|On 20 March 2016, the Custom {{officials}} at Mumbai airport seized 146 tortoises from a mishandled baggage of a Nepal citizen. This bag {{was said to}} belong to a transit passenger, who arrived from Madagascar and flew to Kathmandu leaving this bag behind. Out of the 146 tortoises, 139 were Radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) and seven were angonoka tortoises (Astrochelys yniphora), both critically endangered <b>tortoise</b> species of <b>Madagascar.</b> Two radiated <b>tortoises</b> were found dead with broken shell.|$|R
50|$|Giant {{tortoises}} {{are among}} the world's longest-living animals, with an average lifespan of 100 years or more. The <b>Madagascar</b> radiated <b>tortoise</b> Tu'i Malila was 188 at death in Tonga in 1965. Harriet (initially thought {{to be one of}} the three Galápagos tortoises brought back to England from Charles Darwin's Beagle voyage but later shown to be from an island not even visited by Darwin) was reported by the Australia Zoo to be 176 years old when she died in 2006. Also, on 23 March 2006, an Aldabra giant tortoise named Adwaita died at Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata. He was brought to the zoo in the 1870s from the estate of Lord Clive and is thought to have been around 255 years old when he died. Around the time of its discovery, they were caught for food in such large quantities that they became virtually extinct by 1900. Giant tortoises are now under strict conservation laws and are categorised as threatened species.|$|R
40|$|The IUCN Red List for Threaten Species {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the authority for assessing a particular species conservation risk. However, this process has come under some criticism for designating species as high conservation risk on a precautionary principle, using limited data, grey literature or anecdotal information. The <b>Madagascar</b> spider <b>tortoise</b> (Pyxis arachnoides) is one such species, up-listed from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered status, based on data of limited spatial resolution and anecdotal information, suggesting risk from poaching and habitat loss, resulting in significant reduction in population size, thus allowing the criteria of Critically Endangered to be met (A 4 cd; E). This study assesses these risks to the species at a range wide level, using presence/absence surveying and incorporating data into a geographical information system to describe distribution contraction within differing areas of land use. This was coupled with a line transect distance sampling procedure to assess real time population size within the current area of occupancy. A Mark-Capture-Recapture, Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and a stage class, projection matrix was developed to model mean annual survival, finite growth rate and population survival. Finally, remotely sensed habitat loss was monitored within the core of the species range. These data suggest that the species has suffered a reduction of 70. 8 % from suspected historical extent of occurrence to the current area of occupancy, now inhabiting a total area of 2, 463. 8 km', with 73. 5 % of the current distribution occurring within existing or proposed protected areas. Range wide population density equals 226. 9 (95 % Cl 168. 1 - 306. 3) tortoises km", with a total global population estimate of 664, 980 (95 % Cl. 492, 680 - 897, 550). Adult mean annual survival is 0. 82 (SE± 0. 15), however juvenile survival cannot be modelled due to low recapture. There is an actual mean population decline of 1 0. 8 %, coupled with mean forest loss of 1. 2 % yr" (2003 - 2011), within the core of the range. The projection matrix model reveals finite population growth to be A=O. 983, indicative of a c. 1. 4 % decline annually, with adult survival the most sensitive parmeter to population survival. 'Projection modelling suggests the species will probably become ecologically non-viable in approximately 170 years. Results confirm the species IUCN Critically Endangered status. Development programs 'and tighter protected area management are required to address the poverty induced drivers threatening this species. This assessment provides an ideal model for similar dry forest tortoise species suffering status data deficiency. The author proposes a temporary five year condition to be placed on the designation of species considered to be of high conservation concern, similar to this species, up-listed on the Red List using anecdotal information or grey literature, whilst funds are secured and empirical peer reviewed data is obtained to confirm the status in the wild.
