5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 {{people working in}} the <b>mining</b> <b>sector,</b> 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing {{is owned by the}} various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; {{there are only a few}} privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution.|$|E

As per the 2006–2007 census by SIDBI, there are 1,468,104 micro, small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3,031,272 people. The KSIDC has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala, creating employment for 72,500 people. A <b>mining</b> <b>sector</b> of 0.3% of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite, kaolin, bauxite, silica, quartz, rutile, zircon, and sillimanite.

5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese and yogurt through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the <b>mining</b> <b>sector,</b> as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 18th century, the {{inhabitants}} of Chadderton raised domestic farm animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the domestic system. Primitive coal mining was established by the 17th century, and the factory system adopted in the late-18th century. During the Victorian era, Chadderton's economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industries, especially the spinning of cotton, but also the weaving of silk and production of hats. By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 cotton mills. Industries ancillary to these sectors, including coal mining, brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were present. Chadderton developed an extensive coal <b>mining</b> <b>sector</b> auxiliary to Chadderton's cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry; Chadderton's last coal mine closed in 1920.|$|E
5|$|On {{the back}} of the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{developed}} an extensive coal <b>mining</b> <b>sector,</b> correlated to supporting the local cotton industry and the town's inhabitants, though there is evidence of small scale coal mining in the area as early as the 16th century. The Oldham Coalfield stretched from Royton in the north to Bardsley in the south and in addition to Oldham, included the towns of Middleton and Chadderton to the west. The Oldham Coalfield was the site of over 150 collieries during its recorded history. Although some contemporary sources suggest there was coal mining in Oldham at a commercial scale by 1738, older sources attribute the commercial expansion of coal mining with the arrival in the town of two Welsh labourers, John Evans and William Jones, around 1770. Foreseeing the growth in demand for coal as a source of motive and steam power, they acquired colliery rights for Oldham, which by 1771 had 14 colliers. The mines were largely to the southwest of the town around Hollinwood and Werneth and provided enough coal to accelerate Oldham's rapid development at the centre of the cotton boom. At its height in the mid-19th century, when it was dominated by the Lees and Jones families, Oldham coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades, although two of the four largest collieries survived to nationalisation. In 1851, collieries employed more than 2,000 men in Oldham, although the amount of coal in the town was somewhat overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry. Today, the only visible remnants of the mines are disused shafts and boreholes.|$|E

Personal service sectors (e.g., medical service and health care, accommodations, and restaurants) and final products manufacturing sectors (e.g., machinery, and electric and electrical equipment) are located at the top positions. The products of these sectors are mostly purchased by the final demand sector. Business service sectors (e.g., transportation, research, commerce, and finance and insurance), <b>mining</b> <b>sectors,</b> utility sectors (electricity), and basic products manufacturing sectors (e.g., petroleum refinery and petrochemical basic products, coal products, and metal products) are located at the bottom positions. The products of these <b>sectors</b> except for <b>mining</b> <b>sectors</b> are purchased by most industry sectors, while the products of <b>mining</b> <b>sectors</b> are mostly purchased by the basic products manufacturing sectors. The sectors located in the middle positions are parts manufacturing sectors (e.g., motor vehicle parts, electrical devices and parts, and semiconductor devices), light industry sectors (e.g., textile products, wooden products, and paper products), and agriculture, forestry, and fishery sectors.|$|R

25|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, Malaysia was the world's {{foremost}} producer of tin, supplying roughly 40% of the non-communist world's tin. Nevertheless, tin reserves were declining; mining's {{contribution to the}} GDP was projected to fall 13% {{over the course of}} the Second Malaysia Plan, due to the exhaustion of tin and iron reserves. However, bauxite and copper continued to contribute to the <b>mining</b> <b>sector</b> in the early 1970s. Malay participation in the <b>mining</b> <b>sector</b> was minimal, and as much as 70% of the industry remained under foreign control. This was a legacy of the British colonial era; many British firms, which had arrived in the 19th century to exploit Malaysian mineral resources, had not departed yet. Malay participation in the mining sector—especially in tin—was further hampered by the British tendency in the 19th century to bring in cheap Chinese labour; most of those employed in mining were still Chinese as late as 1970.|$|E

25|$|New {{regulations}} and {{a process of}} legislative reforms aim to improve the harmonization and stability of the <b>mining</b> <b>sector</b> in mineral-rich countries. New legislation for mining industry in African countries still {{appears to be an}} issue, but {{has the potential to be}} solved, when a consensus is reached on the best approach. By the beginning of the 21st century the booming and increasingly complex <b>mining</b> <b>sector</b> in mineral-rich countries was providing only slight benefits to local communities, especially in given the sustainability issues. Increasing debate and influence by NGOs and local communities called for a new approahes which would also include disadvantaged communities, and work towards sustainable development even after mine closure (including transparency and revenue management). By the early 2000s, community development issues and resettlements became mainstream concerns in World Bank mining projects. Mining-industry expansion after mineral prices increased in 2003 and also potential fiscal revenues in those countries created an omission in the other economic sectors in terms of finances and development. Furthermore, this highlighted regional and local demand for mining revenues and an inability of sub-national governments to effectively use the revenues. The Fraser Institute (a Canadian think tank) has highlighted the environmental protection laws in developing countries, as well as voluntary efforts by mining companies to improve their environmental impact.|$|E
