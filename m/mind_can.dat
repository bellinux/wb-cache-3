25|$|According to dualism, {{the mind}} is non-physical (or, at the very least, has non-physical properties) and, therefore, cannot be {{explained}} in purely physical terms.

25|$|A central {{feature of}} Buddhist {{psychology}} is its methodology, {{which is based}} on personal experience through introspection and phenomenological self observation. According to the Buddha while initially unreliable, one's <b>mind</b> <b>can</b> be trained, calmed and cultivated so as to make introspection a refined and reliable method. This methodology is the foundation for the personal insight into the nature of the mind the Buddha is said to have achieved. While introspection is a key aspect of the Buddhist method, observation of a person's behavior is also important.|$|E
25|$|During the night, many {{external}} stimuli may bombard the senses, but {{the brain}} often interprets the stimulus {{and makes it}} {{a part of a}} dream to ensure continued sleep. Dream incorporation is a phenomenon whereby an actual sensation, such as environmental sounds, is incorporated into dreams, such as hearing a phone ringing in a dream while it is ringing in reality or dreaming of urination while wetting the bed. The <b>mind</b> <b>can,</b> however, awaken an individual if they are in danger or if trained to respond to certain sounds, such as a baby crying.|$|E

25|$|Part of Aristotle's psychology, {{the study}} of the soul, is his account of the ability of humans to reason and the ability of animals to perceive. In both cases, perfect copies of forms are acquired, either by direct {{impression}} of environmental forms, in the case of perception, or else by virtue of contemplation, understanding and recollection. He believed the <b>mind</b> <b>can</b> literally assume any form being contemplated or experienced, and it was unique in its ability to become a blank slate, having no essential form. As thoughts of earth are not heavy, any more than thoughts of fire are causally efficient, they provide an immaterial complement for the formless mind.|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the <b>mind)</b> <b>can</b> exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the basic problem of causal interaction.|$|E
25|$|One open {{question}} regarding {{the nature of}} the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system. Pre-scientific viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which considered the mind somehow non-physical. Modern views center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity. Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds. For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether <b>mind</b> <b>can</b> also be a property of some types of human-made machines.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} high school, Hull went on {{to study}} at Alma Academy. He continued to excel in mathematics, particularly geometry. His interest in geometry inspired him to begin thinking about how the <b>mind</b> <b>can</b> create new connections based on what is already known. It was during his time at Alma Academy that he read the works of Baruch Spinoza, who he admired, though ultimately disagreed with. As {{he was about to}} graduate from the academy, he attended a banquet where the food was contaminated, and contracted a near deadly case of typhoid, which delayed his return to college. Many died during that time and Clark himself almost died. He was left with permanent amnesia and a general bad memory for names which affected him throughout the rest of his life. As Clark's health improved, he returned to Alma College, where he studied math, physics, and chemistry, intending to become an engineer. His intent was to qualify for a mining engineering program at another institution.|$|E

In 2008, Suriya began the Agaram Foundation, working to help children who {{drop out of school}} early in Tamil Nadu. Suriya revealed that he was inspired to begin the movement {{as a result of his}} father's own organisation, Sivakumar Educational Trust, which had been operating similar benefits on a smaller scale since the 1980s. With the Ministry of Education in Tamil Nadu, he created a short commercial video outlining child poverty, labour and lack of education, titled Herova? Zerova?. The film was written and produced by Sivakumar and also starred Vijay, Madhavan and Jyothika. Agaram sponsored 159 underprevileged students in 2010 for their higher education in various disciplines, and has continued to provide free seats and accommodation for pupils. With the firm belief that the educated <b>mind</b> <b>can</b> not only eliminate social evils but also aid in the socio-economic upbringing of society, Agaram Foundation works towards providing appropriate learning opportunities to the rural populace who do not otherwise have access to quality education. Through the foundation, he has also set up a platform for students to participate in workshops and improve communication skills, teamwork, goal setting and leadership.|$|E
