First, the evolution of the <b>funding</b> <b>structure</b> of UK universities in the period 1989 - 93 is studied. Then, in order to assess the influence of the <b>funding</b> <b>structure</b> on the research output, the characteristics of 47 multi-disciplinary universities are examined at the start {{and at the end of}} the period considered. The analysis developed offers some evidence to support the hypothesis that policies oriented towards a decreasing state financing of university research aimed at a larger university funding from industry may be to the detriment of the scientific research output of these institutions as measured by publications per researcher. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>structures</b> {{matter for}} {{financial}} stability. In particular, overreliance by some banks on {{certain types of}} wholesale funding—especially by U. S. and European banks—contributed to the global financial crisis. Most banks have recently made their <b>funding</b> <b>structures</b> more resilient by raising their capital adequacy ratios and reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale funding. However, some distressed banks remain vulnerable because their equity capital levels are inadequate and they are highly dependent on central bank funds. This chapter examines how bank <b>funding</b> <b>structures</b> have changed over time—especially {{in the run-up to}} the crisis—and how these structures affect financial stability. The analysis considers banks in a number of advanced and emerging market economies and includes systemically important banks. The analysis shows that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt (especially short-term debt) and have more diversified <b>funding</b> <b>structures</b> with lower loan-to-deposit ratios. Adequate capital buffers reduce a bank’s probability of default and support financial stability. Therefore, Basel III capital regulations that aim to raise the quantity and quality of capital should con-tinue to be a mainstay of the reform efforts. Basel III liquidity regulations will also play a role by reducing banks’ overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, which has proven detrimental to financial stability. Current reform efforts are aimed at reducing financial instability, but there can be tension among some key regulatory reforms that affect bank <b>funding</b> <b>structures.</b> As this chapter shows, such tension can arise, on the one hand, from pressures to use more secured funding (thereby raising levels of asset encumbrance) as well as deposits and, on the other hand, from bank-resolution initiatives (including the introduction of bail-in powers and th...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine and analyze the influence of the structure of assets, profitability, and dividend policy on the <b>funding</b> <b>structure</b> of the banking industry are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The study was conducted on 22 samples of banking companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange using time series data from 2008 to 2012 and cross section called the pooling of data.
