5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or <b>metal</b> <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding, although in the welding arc, it reacts to oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as argon or helium. When used for MIG welding, [...] use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for <b>Metal</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Gas,</b> as CO2 can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates {{some issues}} in {{physical}} modeling of <b>metal</b> inert gas/metal <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> (MIG/MAG) welding {{process in the}} short arc mode. In this mode, a metal supply is molten in the arc state and then transferred to the weld pool during the short-circuit state. A hybrid model having two distinct continuous states whose switchings are controlled by two guard conditions is proposed. Due {{to the complexity of}} the physical phenomena involved in the welding process, simplifications are used to obtain a model accounting for the main physical contributions but simple enough to yield an efficient, fast and numerically tractable simulator which can be used intensively for evaluating different control strategies. In an attempt to validate the proposed model, different measurements have been made including supply voltage and current sampled synchronously with high speed digital video. In order to extract some relevant quantities representative of the metal transfer from image sequences, an active contour algorithm is developed and tested. The effectiveness of the proposed model in the prediction of major tendencies of a welding process, especially in the arc state, is shown using experimental data. Some limitations of the model during the metal transfer are also stressed and possible remedies are then proposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new {{welding method}} named double {{shielded}} TIG welding {{has been investigated}} and is described in this paper. It is applicable to the TIG process and can improve the weld depth/width ratio and protect the electrode from oxidation during the welding process. A two pipeline structure is designed in the torch. Pure inert gas passes though the inner pipeline which keeps the arc stable and protects the tungsten electrode. A mixed <b>gas</b> containing an <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> passes through the outer pipeline. The active element which is decomposed from the <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> dissolves in the weld pool so as to change the Marangoni convection from an outward to an inward direction, and, as a result, the weld pool shape becomes deep and narrow. The double shielded TIG welding method increases the weld depth by about 2 ~ 3 times over the conventional TIG welding. The effects of the <b>active</b> <b>gas</b> (oxygen) in the outer pipeline on the weld pool shapes are discussed.
