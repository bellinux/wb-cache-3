The [...] space included two dedicated exhibition galleries, a reading room, a large reserve for the archival collections, and several offices for staff and volunteers. The society regularly used one of the galleries for presentation of history talks and panel discussions, many of which were videotaped for posting on the Web. In November 2010, in anticipation of the opening of its new GLBT History Museum, the society closed its galleries and program space at 657 <b>Mission</b> <b>St.,</b> while maintaining its archives, reading room and administrative offices at that location.|$|E

2500|$|Darger's landlords, Nathan and Kiyoko Lerner, {{came across}} his work {{shortly before his}} death, a day after his birthday, on April 13, 1973. Nathan Lerner, an {{accomplished}} photographer whose long career the New York Times wrote [...] "was inextricably bound up {{in the history of}} visual culture in Chicago," [...] immediately recognized the artistic merit of Darger's work. By this time Darger was in the Catholic <b>mission</b> <b>St.</b> Augustine's, operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor, where his father had died.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Holy Trinity Polish <b>Mission,</b> <b>St.</b> Stanislaus Kostka was {{the center}} of Chicago's Polish Downtown giving rise to one of the neighborhood's former {{nickname}} of [...] "Kostkaville". Much of this was due to Saint Stanislaus Kostka's first pastor, Reverend Vincent Michael Barzynski, who is described [...] as “one of the greatest organizers of Polish immigrants in Chicago and America”. Barzynski was responsible, in one way or another, for founding 23 Polish parishes in Chicago, along with six elementary schools, two high schools, a college, orphanages, newspapers, and St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital, as well as the national headquarters of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America.|$|E
2500|$|The Jesuits {{moved their}} {{mission to the}} Sun River, about [...] upriver from Fort Shaw, near what is now Simms, Montana. They {{immediately}} began to build cabins, but abandoned the site in August when agriculture in the area proved too difficult. Father Imoda returned in 1861, accompanied by Brother Francis DeKock. They spent the year ministering in Fort Benton, and in 1862 were joined by Father Joseph Menetrey and Brother Lucian Agostino. They moved the mission [...] downstream, naming this <b>mission</b> <b>St.</b> Peter's, after the Apostle Peter. They built seven log cabins and some corrals. Imoda, Menetrey, Agostino, and DeKock settled at the new mission, joined by Father Joseph Giorda. But this location also proved difficult for agriculture, and the local Piegan Blackfeet were hostile. Three men {{were killed by the}} Piegans in early 1866. When a local herder, John Fitzgerald, was killed by the Blackfeet within sight of the mission on April 6, the Jesuits decided to move again. Joined by Father L. B. Palladino, J. H. Vail from the Sun River Agency (an Indian agency located near the present town of Sun River, Montana), and a Blackfeet guide, Fathers Imoda and Giorda began scouting a new site.|$|E

[...] The situation far exceeded VMC's aerial capability. <b>Mission</b> <b>St.</b> Joseph's Health System in Asheville sent one helicopter for two days, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center sent one helicopter and two teams for six days and Rocky Mountain Air, the company that owned the EastCare helicopters at the time, sent one helicopter for two days. [...] Many military helicopters from the North Carolina Air National Guard were used to help rescue survivors and bring them to the hospital. [...] At the height of the aftermath there were as many as thirty helicopter missions each day, more than ten times the rate normally. [...] A few days after the storm hit, the staff was fatigued and was replaced. [...] It became Vidant EastCare's job to fly and pick up staff who work at the hospital. [...] Vidant EastCare also transported patients and supplies to and from the hospital.|$|E
