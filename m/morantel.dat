The EC 50 for activation by <b>morantel</b> of both α 7 and α 7 - 5 HT 3 A receptors is 7 -fold lower than that determined for ACh. The minimum <b>morantel</b> concentration required to activate α 7 - 5 HT 3 A channels is 6 -fold {{lower than that of}} ACh, and activation episodes are more prolonged than in the presence of ACh. By contrast, oxantel is a weak agonist of α 7 and α 7 - 5 HT 3 A, and both drugs are very low efficacy agonists of muscle AChRs. The replacement of Gln 57 in α 7 by glycine, which is found in the equivalent position of the muscle AChR, decreases the efficacy for activation and turns <b>morantel</b> into a partial agonist. The reverse mutation in the muscle AChR (ϵG 57 Q) increases 7 -fold the efficacy of <b>morantel.</b> The mutations do not affect activation by ACh or oxantel, indicating that this position is selective for <b>morantel.</b> In silico studies show that the tetrahydropyrimidinyl group, common to both drugs, is close to Trp 149 of the principal face of the binding site, whereas the other cyclic group is proximal to Gln 57 of the complementary face in <b>morantel</b> but not in oxantel. Thus, position 57 at the complementary face is a key determinant of the high selectivity of <b>morantel</b> for α 7. These results provide new information for further progress in drug design...|$|E

One field strain (TAS) was isolated from a dairy goat herd which had experienced severe helminthiasis despite intensive anthelmintic usage. The other (BCK) was isolated from sheep which had been treated solely with levamisole over a 6 -year period. The BCK strain had very high levels of both levamisole and <b>morantel</b> resistance.

Although the TAS strain was exposed to levamisole prior to isolation, examination of the drug's pharmacokinetics in goats indicated that it exerted little if any anthelmintic effect, and therefore selection pressure, on the parasite population. This study suggests that the mechanism of levamisole resistance covers a wide spectrum, and embraces that for <b>morantel.</b> It also suggests that in order to conserve the effectiveness of the levamisole/morantel group of broad spectrum anthelmintics, <b>morantel</b> should be used to the exclusion of levamisole until resistance is detected, at which time levamisole may be introduced to re-establish high levels of control...|$|E

The experimentally determined liposome-waterdistribution ratio at pH 7 (D^sub lipw^ (pH 7)) of the positively charged <b>morantel</b> was 100 L/kg lipid. The D^sub lipw^ (pH 7) of albendazole was 3, 000 L/kg lipid. The membrane permeability determined with the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay was consistent with predictions from a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for <b>morantel</b> but 14 -fold lower than predicted for albendazole which can be rationalized because neutral albendazole is, in fact, zwitterionic and the large dipole moment hinders permeation through hydrophobic membranes. An unusually large molecule, ivermectin was suspected to show decreased bioaccumulation because of its bulkiness, but experimental determination of solubility showed that it was 40 -fold less soluble than expected from a QSAR between solubility and the octanol-water partition coefficient. In contrast, its membrane permeability appeared to be typical for a compound of the given hydrophobicity, {{but it was not}} possible to determine the membrane-water partition coefficient because of its low solubility and high affinity to the dialysis membrane of the experimental device.

All ewes had fewer gastrointestinal nematode eggs per gram of feces (epg) after 2 treatments, compared with pretreatment epg counts. Ewes administered ivermectin {{continued to have}} a low mean epg (0 to 3) throughout the study. The mean epg counts of ewes treated with levamisole increased from 3 to 483 during the study.

These data indicate that the gastrointestinal nematodes (including Haemonchus contortus) may have developed more resistance to levamisole and <b>morantel</b> than to fenbendazole. On the basis of the epg counts, resistance to ivermectin did not develop during the 4. 5 -month treatment period. The percentage of ewes shedding eggs after 2, 4, and 6 anthelmintic treatments was lowest for ewes treated with ivermectin (20 %) and was similar (40 %) for ewes treated with 1 of the other 3 anthelmintics.

However, the indiscriminate use of anthelmintic drugs has inevitably {{led to the}} selection of resistant parasites. In this respect there is currently an urgent need to increase {{our knowledge of the}} mode of action of available anthelmintics as well as to identify novel targets for the development of next generation anthelmintic compounds. In the present study we report the functional and pharmacological characterization of a novel subtype of nematode acetylcholine-gated ion channel in two distantly related parasitic nematode species: Haemonchus contortus and Parascaris equorum. Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte as an expression system, we showed that these receptors are composed of subunits encoded by two closely related genes, acr- 26 and acr- 27 that are widely distributed in parasitic nematodes infecting humans and animals. We further demonstrate that these receptors represent a molecular target for the anthelmintics <b>morantel</b> and pyrantel.

Title of diploma thesis: Drug-resistance in {{parasitic}} helminths The {{development of}} drug resistance in parasitic helminths poses a large threat to productivity in livestock {{and the control}} of human helminths in future. Currently there are three broad spectrum classes of anthelmintics: the benzimidazoles, the imidazothiazoles (levamisole) and the tetrahydropyrimidines (pyrantel, <b>morantel),</b> the macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycins).

Resistance to levamisol or pyrantel, drugs which act as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, is probably caused by amount reduction or by loss of affinity in these receptors. Macrocyclic lactones mode of action is not fully understood, but there appears to be relation with modulating glutamate-gated chloride channels present on muscle membranes of the parasites.

An AMM was developed to study the effect of ewe deworming with <b>morantel</b> on lamb preweaning growth in a field experiment involving 182 lambs in 45 herds 10 villages in Kolda, Senegal. Growth was described as a quadratic polynomial of age. Other covariates were sex, litter-size and treatment. The choice of fixed and random effects relied on three graphs: (1) a trellis display of mean live-weight vs. age, to select main effects and interactions (fixed effects) : (2) a trellis display of individual growth curves, to decide which growth-curve terms should be included as random effects and (3) a scatter plot of parmaeters of lamb-specific regressions (live-weight vs. quadratic polynomial of age) to choose the random-effects covariance structure. Age, litter-size, age x litter-size, litter-size x treatment and age x litter-size x treatment were selected graphically as fixed effects and were significant (p< 0. 05) in subsequent statistical models. The selection of random-effect structures was guided by graphical assessment and comparison of the Akaike's information criterion for different models. The final random-effects selected included no random effect at the village level but intercept, age and squared-age at the herd and lamb levels. The structure of the random-effects variance-covariance matrices were blocked-diagonal at the herd level and unstructured at the lamb level.

Methanol extract of the stem bark of P. americana (avocado) and the n-hexane layer obtained from the methanol extract by solvent partitioning caused 100 % mortality of PWN at low concentrations of 125 and 63 μg ml− 1, respectively.

The environmental impact of antiparasitic chemotherapy depends on the deleterious effect which the agent or its metabolites have on organisms in the locus of the excreta. the amount of active agent excreted, the temporal nature of the excretion and the stability of the ecotoxic residues.

The greatest ecotoxicological risk is associated with sustained release delivery devices, delivering endectocides with potent activity against dipteran flies and coleopteran beetles. The relatively large proportion of most cattle herds excreting faeces with no endectocidal contamination is likely to reduce the impact that such treatment or prophylactic strategies have on non-target organisms.

We have postulated that the anthelmintic <b>morantel</b> (Mor) positively modulates (po-tentiates) rat 32 receptors through a site located at the () /() interface that is homologous to the canonical agonist site (J Neurosci 29 : 8734 – 8742, 2009). On this basis, we aimed to determine the site specificity by studying differences in mod-ulation between 32 and 42 receptors. We also compared modulation by Mor with that of the related compound oxantel (Oxa). Whereas Mor and Oxa each potentiated 32 receptors 2 -fold at saturating acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations, Mor had no effect on 42 receptors, and Oxa inhibited ACh-evoked responses. The inhibition was noncompetitive, but not due to open channel block. Furthermore, {{the nature and extent of}} modulation did not depend on subunit stoichiometry. We studied six positions at the () interface that differ between 3 and 4. Two positions (3 Ile 57 and 3 Thr 115) help mediate the effects of the modulators but do not seem to contribute to specificity. Mutations in two others (3 Leu 107 and 3 Ile 117) yielded receptors with appreciable 4 -character; that is, Mor potentiation was reduced compared with wild-type 32 con-trol and Oxa inhibition was evident. A fifth position (3 Glu 113) was unique in that it discriminated between the two com-pounds, showing no change in Mor potentiation from control but substantial Oxa inhibition. Our work has implications for rational drug design for nicotinic receptors and sheds light on mechanisms of allosteric modulation in nAChRs, especially the subtle differences between potentiation and inhibition...|$|E
40|$|A major {{hindrance}} to evaluating nematode populations for anthelmintic resistance, {{as well as}} {{for screening}} existing drugs, new compounds, or bioactive plant extracts for anthelmintic properties, is the lack of an efficient, objective, and reproducible in vitro assay that is adaptable to multiple life stages and parasite genera. To address this need we have developed the “Worminator” system, which objectively and quantitatively measures the motility of microscopic stages of parasitic nematodes. The system is built around the computer application “WormAssay”, developed at the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. WormAssay was designed to assess motility of macroscopic parasites for the purpose of high throughput screening of potential anthelmintic compounds, utilizing high definition video as an input to assess motion of adult stage (macroscopic) parasites (e. g. Brugia malayi). We adapted this assay for use with microscopic parasites by modifying the software to support a full frame analysis mode that applies the motion algorithm to the entire video frame. Thus, the motility of all parasites in a given well are recorded and measured simultaneously. Assays performed on third-stage larvae (L 3) of the bovine intestinal nematode Cooperia spp., as well as microfilariae (mf) of the filarioid nematodes B. malayi and Dirofilaria immitis, yielded reproducible dose responses using the macrocyclic lactones ivermectin, doramectin, and moxidectin, as well as the nicotinic agonists, pyrantel, oxantel, <b>morantel,</b> and tribendimidine. This new computer based-assay is simple to use, requires minimal new investment in equipment, is robust across nematode genera and developmental stage, and does not require subjective scoring of motility by an observer. Thus, the “Worminator” provides a relatively low-cost platform for developing genera- and stage-specific assays with high efficiency and reproducibility, low labor input, and yields objective motility data that is not subject to scorer bias...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Kolda (southern Senegal) from July 1986 to July 1988. Its goals were to: (1) describe the patterns of mortality of female Guinean goats by age, season and year; (2) assess preventive measures against respiratory diseases and gastrointestinal parasitism in reducing mortality; and (3) estimate the overall impact of these measures on survival to 1 year of age. Preventive measures for respiratory disease included vaccination against peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and pneumonic pasteurellosis (Pasteurella multocida types A and D). Control of gastrointestinal parasites was by deworming does with <b>morantel</b> (7. 5 mg kg- 1, three times during the rainy season). The effects of vaccines and deworming were tested in a randomised factorial {{field experiment}} with villages being the experimental units. A total of 19 villages, 113 goat herds and 1458 goats were included in the study. Generalised linear models of survival for five cohorts of goats (defined by five different birth seasons) used a binomial assumption for the response distribution and a complementary logâ€“log link. Explanatory variables included age, season, year, vaccination, deworming and their interactions. A complex a priori model was built on the basis of previous epidemiological knowledge; a purposively selected set of simpler models was compared to this full model by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and derived statistics. Inference on 1 -year survival and treatment effects accounted for model-selection uncertainty. It was carried out with a bootstrap procedure and used information from the whole set of selected models. Large variations in mortality by year and season were observed but no regular seasonal pattern was apparent. Mortality probabilities of kids in dewormed groups decreased quickly after birth, but remained elevated up to 9 months of age in the non-dewormed groups. Deworming lowered the risk of mortality. Vaccination alone was not protective (except during an observed outbreak of PPR) ...|$|E

40|$|Muscle tension {{recordings}} {{were made}} from earthworm body wall muscle and the action of acetylcholine, cholinomimtics and cholinolytics examined. The effect of cholinergic agents on muscle twitches induced following field stimulation was also investigated. Carbachol was 8 times more active than acetylcholine {{in the presence of}} physostigmine. ?-Bungarotoxin, d-tubocurarine, gallamine, atropine, mecamylamine and hexamethonium reduced both electrical stimulation of the muscle and the acetylcholine response while ?-bungarotoxin reduced the electrically induced twitch but enhanced the acetylcholine contraction. 0. 4 wM Hemicholinium abolished the electrically induced twitch while having no effect on the acetylcholine response, but at 4. 0 uiM, did reduce the acetylcholine response. These results provide further evidence for cholinergic excitatory innervation of earthworm body wall muscle. Intracellular recordings {{were made from}} identifiable central neurones of Helix aspersa and the action of anthelmintic compounds investigated. The anthelmintics pyrantel, <b>morantel</b> and deacylated amidantel mimicked acetylcholine induced excitation"D" and inhibition"H" had the same ionic mechanism and were blocked by d-tubocurarine. This suggests these compounds interact with acetylcholine receptors on Helix neurones. Levamisole only inhibited the activity. A series of glutamate analogues was tested on Helix neurones which were either excited or inhibited by Lglutamate. The only analogue with clear glutamate- 1 ike activity was thio-glutamic acid. In normal saline Lglutamate hyperpolarises the membrane potential of cell F- 1. This event is chloride mediated and is reversed to a depolarisation followed by hyperpolarisation in low external chloride. This afterhyperpolarisation is reduced in sodium or potassium free saline or following application of strophanthidin, l. O-lOOyM. The local anaesthetics procaine and tetracaine mimicked the "H" and "D" effects of acetylcholine on certain neurones. Tetracaine, O. OlyM, gradually and reversibly reduced both "H" and "D" responses of acetylcholine and the "H" response to dopamine. This provides evidence that local anaesthetics can interact with responses linked to chloride, sodium and potassium ion channels...|$|E
40|$|The present {{trial was}} aimed to compare {{efficiency}} of prevention of moniaziasis (Treatment Programme 1, TP 1) versus prevention of gastro-intestinal strongylosis (Treatment Programme 2, TP 2) in suckling lambs as assessed by clinical appearance and growing performance. Clinical observations and fecal egg counts {{were conducted on}} 397 three-month-old lambs born {{in the middle of}} the lambing season. Clinical signs suggestive of gastro-intestinal parasitism were found in 59 lambs (14. 9 percent) and 150 out of 213 analysed fecal samples (70. 4 percent) contained eggs of Moniezia. The twelve farms involved in the trial were paired following similarities in husbandry conditions. Ninety lambs from the farms under TP 1 were compared with 90 lambs from the farms under TP 2, following similarities of weight and sex. In the farms under TP 1, the lambs received a single dose of niclosamide, 80 mg/kg bodyweight (drug active against Moniezia only). In the farms under TP 2, the lambs received a single dose of <b>morantel</b> tartrate, 8 mg/kg bodyweight (drug active against gastro-intestinal nematodes only). Clinical symptoms, as assessed during two control visits carried out one and two month after the treatment, disappeared in farms under TP 1 and increased in the farms under TP 2. Eggs of Moniezia were no longer found in fecal samples of the flocks under TP 1 whereas the percentage of animals with eggs of Moniezia stabilized in the flocks under TP 2. Mean daily gains in the month following the treatment were 301 g in the flocks under TP 1 and 128 g in the flocks under TP 2. Mean daily gains in the next month were 178 g and 112 g in both groups, respectively. These results suggest that, in the conditions under study where gastro-intestinal strongylosis is controlled in the adult sheep, prevention of monieziasis must be regarded as the basis of the Herd Health Programme in the growing lambs...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} pose {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} health and economic welfare of communities worldwide, both directly through human disease and indirectly through infection of livestock and crop. At present, anthelmintic drugs such as the nicotinic agonists, which target nematode nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), offer a facile and cost-effective method of controlling both human and animal infection. Unfortunately, the continued heavy reliance on such compounds has led to the inevitable emergence of resistance in many different Nematoda species, thus making the subject of nematode nicotinic receptors of great importance. Using various levamisole-resistant, nAChR subunit mutants of the soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (viz. unc- 29, unc- 38 and unc- 63) and well-established resistance-monitoring assays, the responses of the different strains to the nicotinic agonists levamisole, <b>morantel,</b> oxantel and pyrantel have begun to be characterized. Wild-type adult C. elegans are relatively unaffected by 1 mM oxantel, contrasting with a developmental retardation of larvae. Also, unc- 38 mutants appear to be less refractory to the anthelmintics than the unc- 29 and unc- 63 animals. In preparation for the use of C. elegans as an ectopic transformation system for parasitic receptor DNA, preliminary biolistic transformation experiments were performed using microparticle bombardment. It was found that transformation of unc- 38 animals with myo- 3 ::gfp construct has no significant effect on their ability to thrash in suspension. The mutant characterization data may possibly reflect differential expression of nAChRs at various stages of development. The transformation data suggest that microparticle bombardment has little or no effect on C. elegans, which is essential for future transgenic experiments. In summary, important baseline data on C. elegans nicotinic receptors have been generated and a fundamental transgenic control line in unc- 38;myo- 3 ::gfp has been established. This will allow for exciting rescue experiments using parasitic nematode nAChR DNA. Copyright The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The {{efficacy}} of the <b>morantel</b> sustained release bolus (MSRB) in reducing gastrointestinal parasitism in first season grazing calves was evaluated during the summer-fall grazing seasons of 1982 and 1983 in western Oregon. Thirty-eight calves (1982) and 40 calves (1983) {{were randomly assigned to}} a control and treatment group each season. All animals in the treatment groups received the MSRB on the day of turnout onto pasture. To monitor burden of infective larvae, worm-free tracer calves (16 total in 1982 and 18 total in 1983) were introduced onto the pastures every four weeks. Mean worm burdens from tracer calves grazed with treated animals in 1982 and 1983 showed overall reductions of 86. 4 % (not significantly different) and 84. 3 % (P < 0. 01) respectively. Ostertagia ostertagi, Cooperia oncophora, and Nematodirus helvetianus were the primary nematodes recovered at necropsy. Twelve full-season tracer animals (six treated and six control) necropsied at trial termination (1982) indicated an 88. 1 % (P < 0. 05) overall reduction in mean worm burdens. Mean fecal worm egg counts of eggs per gram (EPG) of feces of treated animals reflected a reduction of 69 % (P < 0. 05) in 1982 and 90 % (P < 0. 05) in 1983. Based on the EPG's (1982, 1983) and the immature larvae recovered at necropsy from the final set of tracer calves (1982), infection levels were higher in the fall season. Between October 26 and December 7, 1982, the largest increase in worm counts was due to inhibited L₄ (pre-Type II) ostertagiasis. In 1982, there was a 7. 9 kg weight gain advantage of control animals compared to treated animals at day 160; however, on day 202 the treated animals showed a 4. 6 kg weight gain advantage over the controls. In 1983, the treated animals gained an average of 13. 5 kg (P < 0. 05) more than the control animals. All animals remained clinically healthy during the trials and no boluses were lost from treated animals. These trials demonstrated that the MSRB was an effective anthelmintic for reducing gastrointestinal parasitism in first season grazing calves and in decreasing pasture larval contamination...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to extend {{existing}} knowledge both {{with respect to the}} mode of action of anthelmintics and the biochemical and physiological mechanisms which may be disrupted by drug action. The helminth species examined include nematodes, Ascaris suum, Ascaridia galli and Trichuris ovis and cestodes, Moniezia, T. hydatigena, T. taeniæformis and Echinoccocus granulosus; the anthelmintics studied were methyridine, diethylcarbamazine, pyrantel, <b>morantel,</b> tetramisole, levamisole, dichlorvos, vincofos, cambendazole and mebendazole. The helminth characteristics selected for most intensive study are (a) the occurrence and properties of helminth cholinesterase and (b) the uptake of glucose. The breadth of the study was limited by the availability of fresh material and not all combinations of helminth and drug were investigated. The histochemical localisation of cholinesterase activity in whole mounts and sections of tapeworms using thiocholine esters revealed a complex network of tegumental receptors feeding a nervous system with efferents to suckers, rostellum and hook muscles. It is suggested that tapeworms have reflex arcsinvolving these structures allowing them to maintain their position in the host intestine in spite of peristaltic action. These arcs are susceptible to anticholinesterase anthelmintics. Other cholinesterase activity is associated with the scolex, cirrus, genital pore and sometimes the tegument. High cholinesterase specific activities against acetylthiocholine were measured in Echinococcus scoleces and tapeworms, but lower levels in nematodes. Differential centrifugation of homogenates was used to study their occurrence in the tissue and facilitate further characterisation. However, the enzyme was widely distributed in these species although somewhat higher in the particulate fractions. Activity was increased little, if any, by attempts to solubilise it with the detergent, Triton X- 100. Cholinesterase in some fractions particularly from T. ovis, had a high temperature optimum around 60 C, but never showed the phenomenon of autoinhibition by substrate at concentrations up to 10 - 2 M. Cholinesterase in species of worm with high levels of enzyme was more sensitive to eserine inhibition than those with lower levels. In studies of glucose uptake from the medium by Ascaris and two tapeworms, it was confirmed that transport into Ascaris was strongly inhibited by certain benzimidazole anthelmintics. Transport into Ascaris, but not the cestodes, was also discovered to be sensitive to local anaesthetics such as procaine or lignocaine. Uptake into tapeworms was inhibited by the absence of sodium ions, phlorizin, iodoacetate and dinitrophenol. It was less inhibited by benzimidazoles and not at all by organophosphate anthelmintics, but was sensitive to phenolic drugs such as hexachlorophene and nitroxynil. In the dog and sheep, a number of anthelmintic drugs administered intravenously showed predominantly nicotinic effects on blood pressure and respiration supporting the cholinergic action of these drugs. Although sheep red-cell cholinesterase is more sensitive to inhibition than that of all helminths tested, the oral route of administration of anthelmintics remains safe for the host and effective against intestinal parasitic worms...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} anthelmintic resistance in nematodes of sheep is causing concern among animal scientists and farmers. In Australia anthelmintic resistance has become widespread {{since the first}} case was reported in 1968, and in some districts up to 68 % of farms are affected. Benzimidazole resistance is most common, but levamisole and <b>morantel</b> resistance also occurs, and some farms have nematodes resistant to both major anthelmintic groups. Strains of the following species have shown resistance: Haemonchus contortus. Ostertagia circumcincta. Trichostrongylus spp. and, least commonly, Nematodirus spp. In New Zealand, anthelmintic resistance was first reported in 1980, and subsequent surveys found that its prevalence was generally low except on farms with above average anthelmintic usage. The same anthelmintics and nematodes as in Australia were implicated, although resistant Nematodirus spp. were reported more frequently in New Zealand. The most common test used to identify anthelmintic resistance - the faecal egg count reduction (or depression) test - {{was used in the}} survey of 15 Manawatu sheep farms which {{is the subject of this}} report. On each farm the anthelmintics oxfendazole, ivermectin and levamisole were given by mouth to groups of 12 young sheep, at dose rates of 5. 0, 0. 2 and 8. 0 mg/kg, respectively. Twelve additional sheep were designated as untreated controls. Faecal samples for egg counting were taken from all sheep on the day of treatment and 7 days later. Composite faecal samples from each farm were cultured for identification of larvae present before treatment and, when anthelmintic treatments were deemed unsatisfactory, post-treatment faeces were also cultured for larval identification. Using the simplest method of calculation of faecal egg count reduction, and a cut-off point of 90 % or below, there were (respectively) 4, 2 and 0 farms with oxfendazole, ivermectin and levamisole resistant strongylate nematodes (excluding Nematodirus spp.). However, supporting evidence for the existence of ivermectin resistant nematodes was weak, and no claim is made that true ivermectin resistance has been detected. On the 4 farms with oxfendazole resistant nematodes, resistant Trichostrongylus spp. were the most common (4 farms), followed by H. contortus (3 farms), 0. circumcincta (2 farms) and Oesophagostomum spp. (2 farms). Oxfendazole resistant Nematodirus spp. were very common, but it was not possible to reach any conclusion about the susceptibility of the Nematodirus spp. present on each farm because of the low numbers of sheep passing Nematodirus spp. eggs and the small numbers of those eggs. Resistant Nematodirus spp. have probably been overlooked in the past and methods to reduce the likelihood of this are suggested. The faecal egg count reduction test is a useful field screening test, but it is difficult to interpret when only a slight degree of anthelmintic resistance is encountered. This is partly due to uncertainty in where the cut-off point should be, and partly to variation in calculation methods. The acceptance of recently formulated standard test protocols for Australia and New Zealand should reduce this problem, but supplementary tests will still be needed in many cases of anthelmintic resistance testing...|$|E
