40|$|Includes bibliographyThis annual publication, one of {{the most}} {{important}} of ECLAC, includes official country figures up to November 30 th, and an analysis of developments in the region's economy in 2005 and projections for 2006. The Latin American and Caribbean economy grew by 4. 3 % in 2005, which represents the third consecutive year of growth in the region. Per capita GDP is estimated to have risen by about 3 %. Unemployment rate fell from 10. 3 % in 2004 to 9. 3 % in 2005 and poverty indices decreased from 44 % in 2002 to 40. 6 % in 2005. The performance of the domestic demand and the expansion of 3. 3 % of the world economy in 2005, contributed to these results. For 2006, GDP growth for Latin America and the Caribbean is projected to come in at about 4. 1 %; this rate would be high enough to bring about an annual average growth rate above 4 % during 2003 - 2006 and an accumulated growth of 11 % in per capita GDP. However auspicious, it can not be ignored the fact that the region is growing at lower rates than developing countries as a whole, whose GDP is increasing at an average rate of 5. 7 %, for the period 2003 - 2006. Latin American and Caribbean sub-regions show distinctive behaviours, being Southern Cone and the Andean Community countries those who register higher growth. Venezuela (9 %, Argentina (8. 6 %), Uruguay (6 %), Chile (6 %), Peru (6 %) and Panama (6 %) posted the highest growth rates in the region. ECLAC highlights as a distinctive characteristic of this period of growth the increasing surplus in the current account balance of the balance of payments, fact without precedents in the economic history of the region in the last half century. In 2005, the balance of the current account will be positive and equivalent to 1. 3 % of GDP (0. 9 % in 2004 and 0. 5 % in 2003), presenting, however, differences among sub-regions. The improvement in the terms of trade and the <b>migrants</b> <b>transfers</b> help to explain the evolution of the current account. The world economic growth and the increasing participation of China, India and other Asian economies, improved the terms of trade of South American countries (31 % increase between 2005 and the 1990 decade), and, to a lesser extent Mexico (22 % increase in the same period). Although in regional terms investment increased in 2005, its levels are still below the ones recorded in 1998. Growing at higher rates, an indispensable requisite to faster reduce the unemployment rate, demands an important increase in the investment rate. The governments of the region are taking advantage of the favourable conjuncture to improve fiscal accounts. As fiscal revenues increase, the surplus is being used to reduce public debt, which is seen by ECLAC as a positive sign. Although the public debt/ GDP ratio is still high in many countries, its decrease leads to a lower external vulnerability of the region, with the exception of some Caribbean countries. Sustained growth in the past three years starts to impact positively in the labour markets, contributing, however in a very recent manner, to alleviate the difficult social situation of Latin America and the Caribbean. The rise in employment combined with a lower dynamism in the supply of labour force, allows for the reduction of the unemployment rate in a context of an increase of formal employment in the region. The Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean is an annual ECLAC publication prepared by the Economic Development Division in cooperation with the Statistics and Economic Projections Division, the Commission's sub-regional headquarters in Mexico City and Port of Spain and the ECLAC offices in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. The report also reflects the valuable input received from the central banks and national statistical offices of the countries of the region, which provide the statistical information that serves as a basis for its preparation...|$|E

They can be transferred to the origin country through modern communication methods such as telephone, internet and mail, through migrants’ temporary return visits to their origin country or through permanent return. <b>Migrants</b> <b>transfer</b> their know-how and skills to family members or friends living in the origin country, and this knowledge can then be utilized by individuals or households in the home country.|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out {{concerning}} the diverse impacts of <b>migrants</b> <b>transferred</b> funds.

World Bank (2006) indicated that there are certainly economic benefits to the recipient countries that can be derived from remittances, and in total account for a significant portion of economic growth. Other research has indicated that migrants through remitted funds have been found to contribute to raising living standards of those left behind (Adams and Page 2005; Acosta et al. 2007) as well as increase return to human capital investments (Mountford 1997; Stark and Wang 2002).|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} twenty years the ever-growing levels of migrants' {{remittances}} made state agencies, international organizations, scholars and practitioners to increasingly consider remittances as one of the main engines to promote globalization and growth in the developing world. By transferring home large amounts of money, information, ideas and practices, migrants and migrant organizations are often seen as able to produce significant changes in countries and localities of origin. Focusing on cases from former socialist countries and around the world, this paper discusses the main debates surrounding the effects and uses of migrant remittances. Furthermore, using different case studies from Europe and Asia, the paper addresses the notion of social remittances, namely the transfers of ideas, practices and norms between societies of origin and destination.

40|$|The growing pace of globalization, {{accompanied}} by major transformations in {{countries of origin}} and significant economic changes in the industrialized countries, has resulted in ever-growing migratory dynamics around the world. Migration is a global phenomenon which touches {{every country in the}} world as sending, transit or receiving countries. Remittances represent one of the most consistent outcomes of migration. Through remittances, <b>migrants</b> <b>transfer</b> funds, information, ideas and practices. Remittances link societies of origin and destination by multiple processes of mobility and exchange. <b>Migrant</b> remittances are <b>transfers</b> that are conducted by migrants between countries of origin and destination, consisting of monetary and non-monetary transfers. Monetary transfers are primarily financial in nature, although they can include in-kind transfers; non-monetary flows are primarily social remittances which include ideas, values and modes of action. Whereas capital flows are transfers of money within corporations for the purpose of investment and research and development, remittances are flows of money between a migrant and their family or community in the origin country. Migrant remittances represent migrants’ continuous involvements in their places and communities of origin. Different from capital flows and foreign direct investment (FDI), which are usually sent formally, financial remittances may be transferred by using both formal and informal channels. In some cases, informal transfers account for a large part of financial remittances...|$|R

30|$|In general, the {{existing}} empirical literature supports {{the argument that}} remittances reduce the supply of child labor. In a cross-country study of 82 countries, Ebeke (2010) finds significant evidence that an increase in remittances {{as a share of}} GDP is associated with a reduction of the share of the 10 – 14 -year-old population actively engaged in work. His study also finds that remittances have a stronger effect on the reduction of child labor in countries where credit constraints are higher and GDP growth more volatile, indicating that remittances help insure against negative income shocks that can contribute to the need for children to help supplement household income. Several country-level studies also find evidence that remittances can reduce the need for child labor. Acosta (2011) finds that remittance receipt significantly reduces the likelihood that children will engage in paid labor in El Salvador. Alcaraz et al. (2012) find {{a significant increase in the}} prevalence of child labor in Mexico following the decline in remittances resulting from the 2008 US financial crisis. Dimova et al. (2015) find evidence that <b>migrant</b> <b>transfers</b> reduce the supply of child labor in Tanzania. The underlying assumption in all of these studies is that remittances help reduce liquidity constraints and increase household income sufficiently to reduce the need for child labor.|$|R

40|$|A {{boost in}} the scale and {{complexity}} of international migration flows {{have occurred in the}} last decades. Movements of large numbers of people may produce welfare gains to families and communities left behind. This thesis analyses the implications of migration on well-being of sending societies, adopting a household-level perspective and addressing two specific issues: the impact of remittances on health consumption decisions of relatives left behind, and the role of migration as risk management strategy in response to natural shock exposure. The effect of international remittances on household healthcare consumption is tested using data from the “Peruvian National Survey of Households”. Remittances positively impact on healthcare consumption shares and this propensity is independent of the occurrence of a health shock, confirming the importance of <b>migrant</b> <b>transfers</b> for human capital accumulation. In the second part, I identify whether and under which circumstances migration represents a coping strategy to deal with sudden onset climatic shocks, examining the case of Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua. The findings obtained show that shock severity does not act as push factor for international migration as a whole. Only individuals belonging to agricultural households experiencing high exposure to the natural disaster increase their later likelihood to move abroad. Remittances turn out to be an efficient insurance tool to recover after natural shocks. Income flows from international migrants support household welfare preservation over the two years following the disaster, reducing the risk of being trapped into poverty. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a small open economy that allows for international labor mobility, thereby endogenizing <b>migrant</b> <b>transfers</b> or remittances. The resulting model is calibrated to the Philippine economy, of which labor migration and remittance inflows are key forces that drive the economy’s growth. The model’s impulse response functions illustrate that the presence of these features generates a different set of dynamics from the standard small open economy model (without labor mobility). Depending on the source of the shock, labor mobility and remittances can either exacerbate or cushion the impact of the shock on the economy. A temporary and unanticipated rise in the world interest rate leads to a drop in aggregate output in the environment with labor mobility compared to one without. In contrast, an adverse terms-of-trade shock of the same nature affects output less severely in the case with labor mobility. Finally, a welfare cost comparison of different monetary regimes reveals that policies fostering flexible exchange rates bring about welfare gains relative to a baseline policy of inflation targeting that places a small weight on fixing the nominal exchange rate (otherwise known as hybrid flexible inflation targeting). In particular, pegging the monetary base proves to be welfare-superior to six other simple rules, namely: non-traded price inflation, price-level, strict inflation, hybrid flexible inflation, exchange-rate, and export-price targeting (of which the ranking follows the order of enumeration). The ranking is preserved when labor mobility and remittances are absent in the model...|$|R

40|$|The {{circulation}} of managers, entrepreneurs and professionals between {{developed and developing}} nations is an important trend engendered by globalization. To date, the common view in the literature is that this “brain circulation ” contributes to international development because high-skilled <b>migrants</b> <b>transfer</b> skills and social resources from firms in a mature industry cluster to firms in an emerging industry cluster. However, the difference between organizational environments in mature and emerging clusters raises a possibility that the transfer of skills and social resources between two clusters is costly or even potentially harmful for the receiving organization. In this paper I test this idea by empirically investigating the effect of high-skilled migrants on the organizational performance of firms in the emerging semiconductor design cluster in China. I show that because some skills and social resources from a mature industry cluster are inappropriate in an emerging industry cluster, high-skilled migrants need to create locally appropriate skills and resources. The realization of skills and social resources also depends on the availability in the emerging cluster of complementary skills and social resources. 2 The growing {{circulation of}} managers, entrepreneurs and professionals between developed and developing nations is {{an important aspect of}} globalization with far reaching consequences for the global economy and society (for in depth treatments, see Aneesh 2006; Chang 2006; Saxenian 2006; Xiang 2006). In the past, the unidirectional “brain drain ” carried high-skilled labor from developing to developed economies. Nowadays, some developing countries have encouraged the return of native-born high-skilled migrants. Other developing countries succeeded in attracting foreign-born high-skilled migrants.

40|$|Introduction: {{the article}} {{deals with the}} main {{strategies}} used by foreign authorities and leading universities in order to foster the material base of the research and educational process. The article also addresses the role of international organisations and programmes in promoting education development. It is important to allocate funds of the diaspora transfers in a targeted manner to education, engaging highly skilled migrants to the joint research projects and otherwise helping to ensure that “brain drain” {{can be turned into}} a sharing of knowledge, skills and technology. Materials and Methods: the study is based on the statistic materials, allowing us to make a preliminary assessment of the scope of <b>migrant</b> <b>transfers</b> in the field of higher education, as well as to supply empirical evidence about the so-called “knowledge networks” that demonstrates their quantitative and geographical distribution. The methodological basis of the research is composed of the following methods: a comparative analysis of structural and system analysis and SWOT-analysis. Results: the study confirms the importance of such organisational forms of scientific cooperation as a major inter-university research groups and consortia. Current trends in international migration lead to the strengthening of foreign diasporas both in quantitative and qualitative terms (with regards to education or welfare). At the same time, universities are facing a set of problems related to funding, the complexity of the production of knowledge and innovation, resource-taking upgrades of educational programmes. In this situation, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the migrants of the first and succeeding generations will be able to offset some of the costs, given that there will be a certain stim ulus.

40|$|Does {{international}} migration {{act as a}} driver {{of political and social}} change? Do migrants catalyze the diffusion of new values? This Thesis explores the migration-induced transfer of political and social norms and its linkages with development outcomes. In particular, it examines whether international migrants contribute to a change in preferences and behaviours by channelling modern political and social norms from destination to origin countries. It also investigates the role of destinations in the adoption of different values, since newly-incorporated norms vary according to the level of democracy and equality in host countries. Focusing on Jordan, the first chapter exploits unique data on female empowerment to understand whether return <b>migrants</b> <b>transfer</b> gender norms. The second chapter, instead, studies the impact of both return and current migration on the transfer of political norms. It looks at the interesting case of Morocco, a North- African country that has become a major emigration hub to Europe and where therehave been insistent calls for political change over the last few years. Overall, findings suggest that {{international migration}} can be a driver of political and social change. However, the impact of host countries matters, as newly acquired norms and attitudes are not always "superior" to the norms at origin. The last chapter is distinct and studies whether documented and undocumented immigrants have been affected differently by the Great Recession. Adopting a difference-in-differences strategy on 2001 - 2013 data for Italy, the study shows that before the crisis wages moved in parallel (with a 15 percent premium for documented immigrants). During the recession, however, formal wages did not adjust down while wages of undocumented migrants fell so that by 2013 the gap had grown to 32 percent. Findings are consistent with the view that labour market regulation prevents downward wage adjustment during recession...|$|R

This largely conceptual review is informed by three main premises: the value of adopting a knowledge as opposed to a skills perspective on migration; the importance of examining the cycle of migration rather than static snapshots at particular stages, and the need to consider inter-firm and extra-firm migration, as well as intra-firm mobility. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. /London School of Economics 2007...|$|R

This rate, 40. 2 per 1, 000, is substantially higher than the rate found for upstate New York children (5. 5). Maltreatment rates also varied by migrant status and household composition...|$|R
