5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E

25|$|In 1903-4, Munch {{exhibited}} in Paris where the coming Fauvists, {{famous for their}} boldly false colors, likely saw his works and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs. After studying the sculpture of Rodin, Munch may have experimented with plasticine {{as an aid to}} design, but he produced little sculpture. During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition. In 1906, he painted the screen for an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's Deutsches Theater, in which the Frieze of Life was hung. The theatre's director Max Reinhardt later sold it; it is now in the Berlin Nationalgalerie. After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.|$|E

25|$|On 17 December 2007, Daimler {{announced}} that they were selling their entire complex of 19 buildings at Potsdamer Platz to SEB Asset Management, a Frankfurt-based subsidiary of the Swedish banking group SEB. On 28 February 2008, Sony made a similar announcement, of impending sale to a consortium led by American investment banking giant (now bank holding company) Morgan Stanley. Both deals were finalised {{by the end of}} March 2008. Whilst the amounts involved have not been publicly disclosed, it is believed that neither Daimler nor Sony recouped all of their original investments (what Daimler managed to get was reportedly well short). The long-term benefits (or otherwise) of these sales, remain to be seen, but whilst they may have baffled many people at the time, they may turn out to have been a shrewd move, as Daimler and Sony have avoided being saddled with something they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> much harder to sell at a later date, just when they needed the cash the most.|$|E
25|$|A {{field marshal}} {{in the service}} of Portugal, Beresford had {{available}} the 2nd Division, the 4th Division, Major General John Hamilton's Portuguese Division, and General Robert Ballard Long's cavalry. If he could have invested Badajoz at the end of March, Beresford <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the defenses of the fortress in poor shape. However, problems arose to delay the operation until the French effected repairs. First, the 4th Division was immobilized by a lack of shoes and had to wait for a new shipment from Lisbon. Next, ample bridging material was supposed to be available at the Portuguese fortress of Elvas, but the number of pontoons proved inadequate to span the Guadiana River. The military engineers improvised a bridge, but it was immediately washed out by a flood on 4 April. A battalion was ferried across on the 5th, and starting on 6 April, the Allied corps began slowly filing across the Guadiana on a rickety structure. Luckily, for the Allies, the French did not contest the crossing. Mortier had been recalled and his replacement Latour-Maubourg lacked his strategic insight.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. In her 2006 work Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide, Nikki Stafford called it [...] "an excellent episode, with a beautiful, mournful musical score." [...] Robert Dougherty, {{author of the}} 2008 book Lost Episode Guide for Others: An Unofficial Anthology, deemed the [...] "smaller, character driven" [...] episode a [...] "must see".

500|$|A {{number of}} islands {{have been named}} after the bird. The island of Lundy in the United Kingdom is reputed to derive {{its name from the}} Norse lund-ey or [...] "puffin island". An {{alternative}} explanation has been suggested connected with another meaning of the word lund referring to a copse or wooded area. The Vikings <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the island a useful refuge and restocking point after their depredations on the mainland [...] The island issued its own coins and, in 1929, its own stamps with denominations in [...] "puffins". Other countries and dependencies which have depicted Atlantic puffins on their stamps include Alderney, Canada, the Faroe Islands, France, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Iceland, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, St Pierre et Miquelon and the United Kingdom. The LPO, a French biodiversity charity focussing on the protection of birds, uses a pair of Atlantic puffins as its emblem.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the name of the town are not known.

500|$|As {{a result}} of his firm support of the war, Kropotkin's {{popularity}} dwindled, and many former friends cut ties with him. Two exceptions included Rudolf Rocker and Alexander Schapiro, but both were serving prison sentences at the time. As a result, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated during his final years in London prior to his return to Russia. In Peter Kropotkin: His Federalist Ideas (1922), an overview of Kropotkin's writings by Camillo Berneri, the author interjected criticism of the former's militarism. Berneri wrote, [...] "with his pro-war attitude Kropotkin separated himself from anarchism," [...] and asserted that the Manifesto of the Sixteen [...] "marks the culmination of incoherence in the pro-war anarchists; [...] also supported Kerensky in Russia on the question of prosecuting the war." [...] Anarchist scholar Vernon Richards speculates that {{were it not for the}} desire of Freedom editor Thomas Keell (himself staunchly anti-war) to give the supporters of the war a fair hearing from the start, they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> themselves politically isolated far earlier.|$|E
500|$|The {{negative}} {{initial reaction}} to Connotations {{has also been}} {{claimed to have been}} due to Bernstein's conducting. Bernstein was especially antipathetic toward works that were atonal or rhythmically disjunctive and [...] "could not overcome a deep-seated antipathy, an almost gut reaction" [...] against them.Of the contemporary composers with whom he could relate, he had been [...] "generous and enthusiastic" [...] in his support of Copland. His frequent programming of Copland's works during his tenure with the New York Philharmonic might, Adams suggests, have been partly in reaction against works of the twelve-tone school. Now he was confronted with what American composer John Adams terms a [...] "stridently dissonant, piss-n-vinegar" [...] work [...] "written in an idiom so alien to his own sensibilities," [...] the first performance of which he would not only conduct but would also be televised to a national audience. Pollack claims Bernstein <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> Connotations [...] "boring" [...] and kept it on the program solely out of duty to his old friend.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{writer for}} The Star-Ledger, said Michael acted so [...] "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" [...] {{that it made}} the episode unpleasant to watch: [...] "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael {{could also be a}} monster." [...] However, Sepinwall said he did think the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: [...] "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been for this story, I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." [...] Dan Hopper of VH1's Best Week Ever strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: [...] "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' {{in the sense that the}} characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really frustrating to watch? ...|$|E
50|$|A local legend, {{found in}} the breviaries of the 15th century, makes St. Exuperius to be an {{immediate}} disciple of St. Clement (Pope from 88 to 99), and thus the first Bishop of Bayeux. His see would therefore be a foundation of the 1st century. St. Regnobertus, the same legend tells us, was the successor of St. Exuperius. But the Bollandists, Jules Lair, and Louis Duchesne found no ground for this legend; it was only {{towards the end of}} the 4th century or beginning of the 5th century that Exuperius <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> the See of Bayeux.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{speakers}} of Totonacan languages settled near the Gulf Coast around 800 CE. Although their original homeland is unknown, some have proposed that Totonacs <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>founded</b> Teotihuacan and moved to their present location after its collapse. Misantla Totonac coexisted with Spanish for many years. However, in 1974, a paved road connecting Xalapa and Misantla brought the relatively isolated Totonac-speaking region into contact with mainstream Mexican culture. As a result, Misantla Totonac is quickly being lost. Now, Totonac is mainly used with older family members and friends, {{and it is no}} longer acquired as a first language by children.|$|R

500|$|Simon Leng {{dismisses the}} Ronnie Spector album project as [...] "self-indulgence" [...] {{on the part}} of the two {{producers}} and views the inclusion of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on Material World as having [...] "achieved nothing, except to prove that Spector's Wall of Sound was an anachronism" [...] by 1973. Leng writes of Harrison's [...] "straining" [...] vocal on the track and [...] "banks of trilling 'Long and Winding Road' mandolins" [...] that are at odds with the more subtle mood found elsewhere on the album. Ian Inglis describes Harrison's singing as one of his [...] "least impressive performances" [...] and writes of the composition generally: [...] "It may be a love song or a hymn of salvation but, unlike songs where this duality strengthens their impact (such as 'Isn't It a Pity'), here it sits uneasily between the two." [...] With a different musical arrangement and the [...] "melodramatic delivery" [...] of a singer like Shirley Bassey, Inglis suggests, [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> some success.|$|E
500|$|Bader {{was bored}} and {{frustrated}} at {{being left out}} of the major actions in the south. To Bader, it did not make sense for 12 Group to apparently sit idle while 11 Group suffered heavy losses and fought at a numerical disadvantage. Bader advocated scrambling 12 Group fighters as soon as German aircraft were detected forming up over France or Belgium. He asserted 12 Group was quick enough to reach [...] over the Thames Estuary before the enemy reached the area. He planned to use large forces, three to five squadrons to engage the enemy. Should this succeed, 11 Group, following up attacks, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> broken enemy formations whose crews had lost the determination to press on to their targets. Bader implied that this may reduce the losses of fighter pilots in 11 Group. After the war, Bader insisted that both he and Leigh-Mallory wanted the Big Wing tactic enacted in 12 Group only. They both believed, according to Bader, that it was impractical to use 11 Group as the command was located too close to the enemy and would not have enough time to assemble.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky's {{relationship}} with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue Leopold Auer rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught {{it to his}} students, who included Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein. Wilhelm Fitzenhagen [...] "intervened considerably in shaping what he considered 'his' piece," [...] the Variations on a Rococo Theme, according to music critic Michael Steinberg. Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen's license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist's amendments. His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in Marius Petipa, {{who worked with him}} on the last two, he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> an advocate. When The Sleeping Beauty was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them to put in the extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score.|$|E

Greg Bone and Anderson played the guitars, while Anderson played the drums and keyboards. Produced by Brothers in Rhythm and Minogue, [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a pop rock song. Michael Dwyer from Western Australia magazine commented on Minogue's departure from dance music and bubblegum pop and her maturity since {{her work with}} Stock, Aitken and Waterman, stating [...] "Some Kind Of Bliss and Did It Again have already proved our Kylie has more tricks up her sleeve this time than Stock, Aitken and Waterman ever dreamed of and her sixth album harbours more strings to her carefully-cultivated bow." [...] British writer Sean Smith, author of Kylie (2014), commented that [...] "Did It Again" [...] was another track, along with [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", from Impossible Princess that [...] "didn't really sound like Kylie".

500|$|Following the members' poll, Yorkshire sent a {{telegram}} to Sutcliffe in South Africa, {{asking him to}} withdraw his acceptance of the captaincy. Sutcliffe replied that he had now considered the offer and was appreciative but had to decline it. When news reached the Yorkshire committee on 18 December, they appointed William Worsley, who had refused the leadership in 1924 due to farming commitments. In the words of Wisden, [...] "Happily the trouble was eventually settled {{to the satisfaction of}} all concerned. Sutcliffe declined the honour and, an invitation being extended to Captain Worsley, that gentleman stepped into the breach." [...] Lord Hawke sent a message which thanked Sutcliffe for [...] "your loyalty to the club". The Yorkshire Post also paid tribute to Sutcliffe and the way he handled himself, noting that while a conflict of opinion had been inevitable, it was [...] "carried to unreasonable lengths". Commenting on the affair, The Times expressed regret that Sutcliffe had felt obliged to turn down the leadership; it noted that amateur captains were preferable in reminding people that cricket was only a game, but that there was nothing in principle to prevent a professional from performing the role. Of Sutcliffe, it said, [...] "One would have liked to see him lead the side, and his general popularity, combined with his skill as a batsman, makes it probable that {{he would have been a}} success. However, half the value of a captain is gone if, before he takes up his duties, people begin to question whether he is the right man for the position, and Sutcliffe has been well-advised to recognise this fact." [...] The newspaper also pointed out that it might have been difficult to choose a skipper from a group of professionals who considered themselves eligible for the role; it added that Rhodes <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it hard to captain the side as bowlers had historically struggled to be good leaders.|$|E
