40|$|Plant breeders disrupt Hardy–Weinberg {{equilibrium}} through selection, non-random mating, drift, {{migration and}} <b>mutation.</b> Sustainable <b>plant</b> <b>breeding</b> {{can be defined}} as productive and competitive breeding that is achieved without loss of genetic diversity in the elite breeding popula-tion during the professional career of the breeder. Breeding is often productive but not sustainable. From 1974 to 2000, the animal breeding programme Meatlinc in the United Kingdom had effective population size of 95, population inbreeding of 0. 19 % per year and generation interval of 2. 15 years. Genetic progress in Meatlinc tripled in the 8 years following introduction of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) selection (based on the information from relatives) in 1992. Canola breeding in Australia from 1970 to 2000 had longer generation interval (6 years), smaller effective population size ( 0. 7 % per year). BLUP selection in canola wa...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the {{biosynthesis}} or signaling pathways of gibberellin (GA) {{can cause}} dwarfing phenotypes in plants, {{and the use}} of such <b>mutations</b> in <b>plant</b> <b>breeding</b> was {{a major factor in the}} success of the Green Revolution. DELLA proteins are GA signaling repressors whose functions are conserved in different plant species. Recent studies show that GA promotes stem growth by causing degradation of DELLA proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The most widely utilized dwarfing alleles in wheat (Triticum aestivum; e. g. Rht-B 1 b and Rht-D 1 b) encode GA-resistant forms of a DELLA protein that function as dominant and constitutively active repressors of stem growth. All of the previously identified dominant DELLA repressors from several plant species contain N-terminal mutations. Here we report on a novel dwarf mutant from Brassica rapa (Brrga 1 -d) that is caused by substitution of a conserved amino acid in the C-terminal domain of a DELLA protein. Brrga 1 -d, like N-terminal DELLA mutants, retains its repressor function and accumulates to high levels, even in the presence of GA. However, unlike wild-type and N-terminal DELLA mutants, Brrga 1 -d does not interact with a protein component required for degradation, suggesting that the mutated amino acid causes dwarfism by preventing an interaction needed for its degradation. This novel mutation confers nondeleterious dwarf phenotypes when transferred to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus), indicating its potential usefulness in other crop species...|$|R
