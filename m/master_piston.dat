50|$|This {{force can}} be further {{increased}} by inserting a lever connected between the <b>master</b> <b>piston,</b> a pedal, and a pivot point. If {{the distance from the}} pedal to the pivot is three times the distance from the pivot to the connected piston, then it multiplies the pedal force by a factor of 3, when pushing down on the pedal, so that 10 N becomes 30 N on the <b>master</b> <b>piston</b> and 120 N on the brake pad. Conversely, the pedal must move three times as far as the <b>master</b> <b>piston.</b> If we push the pedal 120 mm down, the <b>master</b> <b>piston</b> will move 40 mm and the slave piston will move the brake pad by 10 mm.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic brakes {{transfer}} {{energy to}} stop an object, normally a rotating axle. In {{a very simple}} brake system, with just two cylinders and a disc brake, the cylinders could be connected via tubes, with a piston inside the cylinders. The cylinders and tubes are filled with incompressible oil. The two cylinders have the same volume, but different diameters, and thus different cross-section areas. The cylinder that the operator uses is called the master cylinder. The spinning disc brake will be adjacent to the piston with the larger cross-section. Suppose {{the diameter of the}} master cylinder is half the diameter of the slave cylinder, so the master cylinder has a cross-section four times smaller. Now, if the piston in the master cylinder is pushed down 40 mm, the slave piston will move 10 mm. If 10 newtons (N) of force are applied to the <b>master</b> <b>piston,</b> the slave piston will press with a force of 40 N.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of varying amount of MgFeSi inoculant on properties of cast 6061 Al alloy for brake <b>master</b> <b>piston</b> application {{has been studied}} and reported in this paper. Cast samples were produced at three pouring temperatures (700, 750, and 800 °C) with MgFeSi varied from 1 to 3 %. Wear resistance tests were performed on cast alloy in brake oil. Wear resistance tests results were validated by nondestructive examinations using photomicroscopy, SEM, EDX, and XRD data. The addition of MgFeSi influenced both the mechanical (hardness, strength, and wear resistance) and metallurgical properties (microstructures) of the cast alloy. Al grains were more refined and yielded good strength properties. Inoculating the melt with MgFeSi forms insoluble compound particles and is responsible for grain refinement. The increased amount of MgFeSi from 1 to 3 % improved the wear resistance of the cast piston under lubricating condition using brake oil...|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{release of}} the brake pedal/lever allows the spring(s) in the master {{cylinder}} assembly to return the <b>master</b> <b>piston(s)</b> back into position. This action first relieves the hydraulic pressure on the caliper, then applies suction to the brake piston in the caliper assembly, moving it back into its housing and allowing the brake pads to release the rotor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vacuum booster}} or vacuum servo {{is used in}} most modern {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The vacuum booster is attached between the master cylinder and the brake pedal and multiplies the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the low-pressure portion of the throttle body or intake manifold of the engine, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied. When the brake pedal is applied, the movement opens an air valve which lets in atmospheric pressure air to one chamber of the booster. Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber, the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the <b>master</b> cylinder <b>piston.</b> A relatively small diameter booster unit is required; for a very conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (200n) is produced by a 20 cm diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square meters. The diaphragm will stop moving when the forces {{on both sides of the}} chamber reach equilibrium. This can be caused by either the air valve closing (due to the pedal apply stopping) or if [...] "run out" [...] is reached. Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure. After the run out point is reached, only the driver's foot force can be used to further apply the <b>master</b> cylinder <b>piston.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{the brake}} pedal is applied, the {{movement}} pushes against a small spring which pushes against an air valve thus opening it to allow atmospheric pressure air to {{flow into the}} [...] "supply" [...] chamber of the booster. Once the pedal stops advancing forward, the air valve closes again and can open further to allow more air in for continued boosted braking. Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber (or [...] "supply" [...] chamber), the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber (or [...] "vacuum" [...] chamber) with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the <b>master</b> cylinder <b>piston.</b> When the pedal is allowed to return to rest, the air from the supply chamber escapes to the vacuum chamber and can then flow towards the source of vacuum.|$|R
2500|$|For {{disc brakes}} with a {{hydraulic}} system, high-performance calipers usually use {{two or three}} pistons per side; lower-cost and lower-performance calipers often have only one per side. Using more pistons allows a larger piston area and thus increased leverage with a given <b>master</b> cylinder. Also, <b>pistons</b> may be of several sizes so pad force can be controlled {{across the face of}} the pad, especially when the pad is long and narrow. [...] A long narrow pad may be desired to increase pad area and thus reduce the frequency of pad changes. [...] In contrast, a single large piston may be heavier.|$|R
5000|$|A {{relatively}} small diameter booster unit is required; {{for a very}} conservative 50% manifold vacuum, an assisting force of about 1500 N (150 kgf) is produced by a 20 cm radius diaphragm with an area of 0.03 square meters. The diaphragm will stop moving when the forces {{on both sides of}} the chamber reach equilibrium. This can be caused by either the air valve closing (due to the pedal apply stopping) or if [...] "run out" [...] is reached. Run out occurs when the pressure in one chamber reaches atmospheric pressure and no additional force can be generated by the now stagnant differential pressure. After the run out point is reached, only the driver's foot force can be used to further apply the <b>master</b> cylinder <b>piston.</b> In some new models, in addition to providing functionality for ABS, Traction Control, and dynamic stability control, brake hydraulics are being used to augment braking when little or no vacuum is detected in the booster, or booster run-out is reached, or pre-applying the brakes if certain panic braking or wet driving conditions are detected.|$|R
40|$|This work {{examined}} {{effects of}} hard surface polishing grits and activation on electroless-nickel (EN) plating on cast aluminium alloy substrates in sodium hypophosphite baths. As-received aluminium alloy sample sourced from automobile hydraulic brake <b>master</b> cylinder <b>piston</b> was melted in electric furnace and sand cast into rod. The cast samples were polished using different grits (60 [*]μm– 1200 [*]μm) before plating. The effects on adhesion, appearance, {{and quantity of}} EN deposits on substrates were studied. Observation shows that the quantity of EN deposit is partly dependent on the alloy type and roughness of {{the surface of the}} substrates, whereas the adhesion and brightness are not solely controlled by the degree of surface polishing. The best yield in terms of adhesion and appearance was obtained from the activation in zincate and palladium chloride solutions. Higher plating rates (g/mm 2 /min) of 3. 01 E- 05, 2. 41 E- 05, and 2. 90 E- 05 were obtained from chromate, zincate, and chloride than 8. 49 E- 06, 8. 86 E- 06, and 1. 69 E- 05 as obtained from HCl etched, NaOH, and H 2 O activated surfaces, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each <b>piston</b> in a <b>master</b> cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the <b>master</b> cylinder's secondary <b>piston</b> both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist piston travel except the secondary piston spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|R
