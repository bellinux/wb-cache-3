40|$|Make-or-Buy {{decision}} {{is a choice}} between <b>making</b> <b>or</b> <b>manufacturing</b> in-house or outsourcing activities or product to ensure a smooth operation of any factory or company. There are several factors involved in making such decision. The factors are financial and non-financial factors. Most companies use financial factor as their main reason {{to decide whether to}} make-or buy. However non-financial factors also sometimes are used in making make-or buy decision. Therefore the objective of this research is to determine the most significant non-financial factor influencing make-or-buy decision in Malaysian SME. In order to achieve the objective, a quantitative approach using survey method is employed to determine which non-financial factors play the dominant role in making a decision to make-or-buy in manufacturing operations. The finding shows that capacity factor is the major non-financial factor for SME to decide whether to make-or buy. It is also discovered that process control is the most significant factor if the manufacturers decided to manufacture or making in-house while capacity is the most significant factor if the manufacturer decided to buy or outsource. This research provides an understanding of SME make-or-buy decision concept where it can be concluded that manufacturing capacity play a major role for SME in deciding whether to manufacturer in house or to buy or outsource externally...|$|E
30|$|Thirdly, China’s {{industrial}} biogas sector ranks {{the third}} largest biogas contributor. China’s industry-based biogas project started in Henan province in the 1960 s, dealing with the wastewater of an alcohol factory (Zhang et al. 2008). There are increasing numbers of industry-based biogas projects in China that tackle rising industrial liquid and solid waste in paper <b>making,</b> food <b>or</b> liquor <b>manufacturing,</b> printing and dyeing, among other challenges. With regard to core regeneration technology of biogas production, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) technology is used {{in more than half}} of all biogas plants, followed by CSTR and USR (HWEEC 2011). In addition, municipal sewage-cleaning biogas projects, landfill gas projects, and other biogas plants are small but non-neglected parts of the biogas industry in China, and part of biogas they produce is often reported together with the industry-based engineering projects (NEA 2012).|$|R
