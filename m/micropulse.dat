A large fraction of the cavity modes is suppressed in this way, and the remaining lines have a relative width on the order of 1 : 10 (6). The stability is in the same range. The gain and saturated power of the laser are almost unaffected. A single mode can in principle be selected from the output beam. This makes the resulting radiation useful for high-resolution spectroscopy applications.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} concept of pulsed plasma {{thruster}} (PPT) <b>micropulsing.</b> <b>Micropulsing</b> was a premise behind a power processing unit (PPU) and an energy storage unit (ESU) design that for certain mission profiles, it was advantageous to operate a PPT at lower energy but higher frequency rather than at a higher energy but lower frequency. This premise allows for reductions in the ESU volume and mass without paying a penalty in thrust. To complete the evaluation, an independent spark plug initiation unit, a {{high voltage power supply}} and a variety of mica foil capacitors at 2. 6, 5, 10, and 20 capacitance were used to conduct a series of tests on a single PPT to map performance levels of thrust, impulse bit, efficiency and specific impulse over a comparable power range. Testing at NASA Glenn Research Center was conducted with breadboard PPT hardware. The test results showed that operating in the lower energy ESU <b>micropulsing</b> mode produced similar thrust levels to a higher energy ESU operating at high power level. Further testing however showed a reduction in specific impulse and efficiency when the smaller capacitances were used at the highest power levels. This would require more fuel mass for a mission that was predominately high power, potentially negating the ESU mass savings. Therefore, <b>micropulsing</b> is advantageous where most of a mission profile occurs at low power, but retains the ability to conduct high thrust maneuvers when necessary...|$|R

40|$|Laser pulse {{duration}} {{is a very}} important parameter to determine the threshold between thermal and nonthermal effects in laser surgery of biomedical tissue. Free Electron Laser (FEL) at Osaka University, Japan, has a pulse structure in which a macropulse (pulse width: 15 µs) consists of equally separated micropulses, whose width and interval are approximately 5 ps and 44. 8 ns, respectively. A precisely controlled of <b>micropulse</b> train may establish fast optic processes because thermal relaxation time in tissue is about 1 µs.

40|$|Giant pulses {{and giant}} <b>micropulses</b> from pulsars are {{distinguished}} from normal pulsed emission by their large fluxes, rarity, approximately power-law distribution of fluxes and, typically, occurrence in restricted phase windows. Here existing observations of flux distributions are manipulated into a common format and interpreted {{in terms of}} theories for wave growth in inhomogeneous media, {{with the aim of}} constraining the emission mechanism and source physics for giant pulses and <b>micropulses.</b> Giant <b>micropulses</b> near 2 GHz (PSRs B 8033 - 45 and B 1706 - 44) and 0. 4 GHz (PSR B 0950 + 08) have indices α = 6. 5 ± 0. 7 for the probability distribution P(E) of the electric field E, with P(E) ∝ E −α. Giant pulses (PSRs B 0531 + 24, B 1937 + 214, and B 1821 - 24) have α ranging from 4. 6 ± 0. 2 to 9 ± 2, possibly increasing with frequency. These are similar enough to regard giant <b>micropulses</b> and pulses as a single phenomenon with a common physical explanation. The power-law functional form and values of α observed are consistent with predictions for nonlinear wave collapse, but inconsistent with known self-organized critical systems, nonlinear decay processes, and elementary burst theory. While relativistic beaming may be important, its statistics are yet to be predicted theoretically and collapse is currently the favored interpretation. Other possibilities remain, including stochastic growth theory (consistent with normal pulse emission) and, less plausibly, refractive lensing. Unresolved issues remain for all four interpretations and suggestions for further work are given. The differences between normal and giant pulse emission suggest they have distinct source regions and emission processes.

RESULTS: At baseline, the mean logMAR BCVA was 0. 39 ± 0. 18 and the mean CRT was 361. 8 ± 70. 95.

We observe that interstellar scattering does not broaden the μs time-scale pulsar microstructure, and find structure of a time-scale much shorter than the interstellar scatter broadening. In addition to the previously known structure with time-scale τ μ of tens of μs, we have detected structures with characteristic time-scale of a few μs, nearly equal to the reciprocal of the analysis bandwidth. This suggests that even shorter <b>micropulses</b> may exist. <b>Micropulses</b> usually cluster in groups, each of duration tens to hundreds of μs, which may be identified as microstructure observed previously with smaller time resolution.

40|$|The {{variability}} of the Vela pulsar (PSR B 0833 - 45) corresponds to well-defined field statistics that vary with pulsar phase, ranging from Gaussian intensity statistics off-pulse to approximately power-law statistics in a transition region and then lognormal statistics on-pulse, excluding giant <b>micropulses.</b> These data are analyzed here {{in terms of}} two superposed wave populations, using a new calculation for the amplitude statistics of two vectorially-combined transverse fields. Detailed analyses show that the approximately power-law and lognormal distributions observed are fitted well at essentially all on-pulse phases by Gaussian-lognormal and double-lognormal combinations, respectively. These good fits, plus the smooth but significant variations in fit parameters across the source, provide strong evidence that the approximately power-law statistics observed in the transition region are not intrinsic. Instead, the data are consistent with normal pulsar emission having lognormal statistics at all phases. This is consistent with generation in an inhomogeneous source obeying stochastic growth theory (SGT) and with the emission mechanism being purely linear (either direct or indirect). A nonlinear mechanism is viable only if it produces lognormal statistics when suitably ensemble-averaged. Variations in the SGT fit parameters with phase imply that the radiation is relatively more variable near the pulse edges than near the center, as found in earlier work. In contrast, Vela's giant <b>micropulses</b> come from a very restricted phase range and have power-law statistics with indices (6. 7 ± 0. 6) not inconsistent with nonlinear wave collapse.
