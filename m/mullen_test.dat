500|$|<b>Mullen</b> <b>tested</b> {{free agency}} {{prior to the}} 1992–93 season, but {{ultimately}} chose to remain with the Penguins. He missed {{the first month of}} the season while recovering from his knee surgery, but finished the season with 33 goals and 70 points in 72 games. [...] He added 6 points in 12 playoff games, but the Penguins' attempt at a third consecutive championship ended with a second-round loss to the New York Islanders. A 38-goal season in 1993–94 led to Mullen's third All-Star Game appearance. The game was a homecoming of sorts for Mullen, as it was played in Madison Square Garden.|$|R
50|$|During a {{pre-season}} {{training session}} in November 2016, <b>Mullen</b> was <b>tested,</b> with the A-sample {{testing positive for}} an anabolic steroid and he was provisionally suspended on 17 January 2017 by the NRL. Mullen's B-sample tested positive to the steroid Drostanolone, confirmed by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency on 7 March 2017 and he was handed a Notice of Alleged Anti-Doping Rule Violations. Mullen is opting to challenge the matter with the anti-doping tribunal.|$|R
40|$|Background Subdural {{haemorrhage}} (SDH) is {{a common}} problem in infants under 6 months of age {{and it has a}} risk to develop into developmental delay. Objective To evaluate adverse effects of SDH on the development of term infants. Methods It was a prospective cohort study carried out on infants below six months of age admitted to Sanglah Hospital due to SDH. Control was healthy term infants born in Sanglah Hospital. <b>Mullen</b> Scales <b>test</b> was performed at the age of 6 and 12 months. Multivariate analysis was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} several independent variabels and developmental outcome. Results Sixty six infants were enrolled in this study (33 infants with SDH and 33 infants without SDH), 52 (79 %) were male and 14 (21 %) were female. Mean age was 1. 53 (SD 0. 75) months vs 1. 70 (SD 0. 73) months. The result of <b>Mullen</b> Scales <b>test</b> at the age of 6 and 12 months showed that very low category was higher in infants with the history of SDH than that in control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only SDH correlated with Gross Motor and Cognitive Scale delay at the age of 6 months and 12 months (Gross motor 6 months: P= 0. 01; OR 13. 07; 95 %CI 2. 04; 83. 84; Gross motor 12 months: P= 0. 00; OR 23. 58; 95 %CI 2. 87; 193. 84); (Cognitive 6 months: P= 0. 00; OR 12. 11; 95 %CI 2. 44; 59. 90; Cognitive 12 months: P= 0. 00; OR 26. 67; 95 %CI 3. 25; 218. 86). Conclusion Term infants with history of subdural haemorrhage are associated with increased Gross Motor and Cognitive Scale delay at the age of 6 and 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Background Breast milk is {{the best}} {{nutrition}} for babies' growth and development. There are many reasons for discontinuation of exclusive breastfeeding (BF). Objective To evaluate the impact of exclusive breastfeeding on babies' cognitive development. Methods A cohort study was conducted for full term newborn babies. They were evaluated for cognitive development using <b>Mullen</b> scale <b>test</b> at of 6 and 9 months; t {{test was used to}} obtain mean difference of cognitive values. Logistic regression analysis was performed to distinguish factors associated with the cognitive development. Results One hundred and forty babies were enrolled to this study (70 babies with exclusive BF and 70 babies with non-exclusive BF). There were 34 boys (49 %) in exclusive and 37 boys (53 %) in non-exclusive BF group. Mean cognitive score at age six months was 1. 41 points higher for exclusive BF group, mean rate 174. 31 (SO 4. 89) and 172. 90 (SO 4. 19) for exclusive and non-exclusive BF, respectively. Mean cognitive score at nine months was 1. 49 point higher in exclusive BF group with mean rate 175. 28 (SO 4. 39) and 173. 82 (SO 3. 80) for exclusive and non-exclusive BF respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that exclusively breastfed babies had higher mean Mullen cognitive score of 4. 761 (95 % CI 1. 341; 16. 907) and 4. 431 (95 % CI 1. 313; 14. 949) times at sixth and ninth month respectively than non-exclusive BE Conclusion Exclusively breastfed babies may have higher mean score of Mullen cognitive score at sixth and ninth months when compared with those who are non exclusively breastfed...|$|R
40|$|Background Indirect {{hyperbilirubinemia}} is {{a common}} problem dur- ing the neonatal period and may cause long-term abnormality or developmental delay. Objective To evaluate the adverse effects of hyperbilirubinemia {{on the development of}} healthy term infants. Methods This was a prospective cohort study on healthy term infants born in Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar. <b>Mullen</b> Scale <b>Tests</b> were performed at the ages of 3 and 6 months to assess subjects’ development. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} several dependent variables and developmental outcomes. Results One hundred and twelve infants were enrolled in this study [56 with hyperbilirubinemia, 56 without hyperbilirubinemia; 58 (52 %) male, 54 (48 %) female]. Mean birth weight was 318. 3 grams (SD 342. 26) vs 3162. 5 grams (SD 338. 61). At the age of 3 months, below average category according to Mullen Scale Test was higher in infants with history of hyperbilirubinemia compared to those with- out hyperbilirubinemia, which was statistically significant for fine motor scale (17. 9 % vs 5. 4 %; respectively; P= 0. 039; RR 1. 66; 95 % CI 1. 15; 2. 39). At 6 months of age, it was higher in infants with history of hyperbilirubinemia compared to those without hyperbi- lirubinemia and this was statistically significant for gross motor scale (19. 6 % vs 3. 6 %, respectively; RR 1. 86; 95 %CI 1. 36; 2. 56; P= 0. 008) and fine motor scale (17. 9 % vs 5. 4 %, respectively; RR 1. 66; 95 %CI 1. 15; 2. 39; P= 0. 039). Multivariate logistic regression test showed that only hyperbilirubinemia was correlated with gross motor scale delay at the age of 6 months (P= 0. 027; OR 5. 97; 95 %CI 1. 22; 29. 12). Conclusion Healthy term infants with history of hiperbilirubinemia were associated with increased gross motor scale delay at the age of 6 month...|$|R
40|$|High-resistance {{paper was}} {{manufactured}} by laccase-grafting of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and chitosan (CPX) on Kraft pulp fiber. The reaction was mediated {{in the presence}} of laccase by one of the following polyphenols {{in the presence of}} air: gallic acid (GA), vanillic acid (VA) and catechol (1, 2 –DHB). Enzyme was added at constant loading (24 kg ton− 1), 1 % pulp consistency, 0. 005 % CMC, pH = 6. 3 ± 0. 5 and 2 mM of mediator. CPX content was assessed at two levels (0 % and 0. 005 %). Treated pulps were analyzed by different mechanical <b>tests</b> (ring crush, <b>mullen,</b> corrugating medium <b>test</b> (CMT) flat crush of corrugating medium test and tension). An improvement in these parameters was obtained by biopolymer coupling and selected mediator. When using GA, three parameters increased more than 40 %, while ring crush increased 120 %. For the case of VA, properties were enhanced from 74 % to 88 % when CPX was added. For 1, 2 –DHB, there was not found a statistically significant difference between the results in the presence of CPX. Scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, FTIR and 13 C NMR were used in all papers in order to evaluate grafting. Hence, it was possible to correlate polymerization with an improvement of paper’s mechanical properties...|$|R
