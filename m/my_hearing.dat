500|$|According to Landa, his bandmate Geoffrey Kelley's other band, Spirit of the West, {{is a major}} {{influence}} on himself and The Paperboys. Landa said, [...] "Even when playing with (Geoffrey), and him being in the same room, I will still say they were a very big influence on me. I'd almost dare to say that had it not been <b>my</b> <b>hearing</b> their records, I would never have been into Celtic music to begin with -- so the band may not even exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Montaigne died of quinsy {{at the age}} of 59, in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. The {{disease in}} his case [...] "brought about {{paralysis}} of the tongue", and he had once said [...] "the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than <b>my</b> <b>hearing</b> and voice." [...] Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested mass, and died during the celebration of that mass.|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Meditations on First Philosophy, René Descartes postulates three classifications for {{our ideas}} when he says, [...] "Among my ideas, some {{appear to be}} innate, some to be adventitious, and others to have been invented by me. My {{understanding}} of what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But <b>my</b> <b>hearing</b> a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, or so I have hitherto judged. Lastly, sirens, hippogriffs and the like are my own invention." ...|$|E

2500|$|I had polio, and I {{was totally}} paralyzed, and the {{inflammation}} {{was so great}} that I had a sensory paralysis too. I could move my eyes and <b>my</b> <b>hearing</b> was undisturbed. I got very lonesome lying in bed, unable to move anything except my eyeballs. I was quarantined on the farm with seven sisters, one brother, two parents, and a practical nurse. And how could I entertain myself? I started watching people and my environment. I soon learned that my sisters could say [...] "no" [...] when they meant [...] "yes." [...] And they could say [...] "yes" [...] and mean [...] "no" [...] at the same time. They could offer another sister an apple and hold it back. And I began studying nonverbal language and body language.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Townshend {{gave the}} initial funding {{to allow the}} {{formation}} of the non-profit hearing advocacy group H.E.A.R. (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers). After the Who performed at half-time at the Super Bowl XLIV, Townshend stated that he is concerned that his tinnitus has grown to such a point that he might be forced to discontinue performing with the band altogether. He told Rolling Stone, [...] "If <b>my</b> <b>hearing</b> {{is going to be a}} problem, we're not delaying shows. We're finished. I can't really see any way around the issue." [...] Neil Young introduced him to an audiologist who suggested he use an in-ear monitor, and although they cancelled their spring 2010 touring schedule, Townshend used the device at their one remaining London concert on 30 March 2010, to ascertain the feasibility of Townshend continuing to perform with the Who.|$|E
2500|$|A {{promising}} {{and intelligent}} youth, Morgan contracted meningitis in August 1929. The disease {{left him with}} a total loss of hearing. Emily Morgan kept him home from school for an entire year, hoping that some hearing would return. Deafness cut off his ability to relate to people around him. The once popular, social, and athletic boy became socially introverted, devoting much of his time to reading and study. Morgan recalled that he had not yet reconciled himself to his deafness by the time he returned to school. In 1951, in a letter to Marguerite Sinclair Reusser, he wrote that a minor family crisis in March 1931 led to a hysterical outburst. During this emotional time, Morgan finally confided in his mother the difficulties and fears he had faced over the loss of his hearing. [...] "I began to face the future instead of wasting myself in bitter regret over a past that was beyond my reach. That was the beginning of my adjustment to the fact that <b>my</b> <b>hearing</b> was gone and would probably never return." [...] At this time, he began a lifelong pattern of writing, producing thousands of careful transcriptions, personal letters, and books in his field.|$|E
