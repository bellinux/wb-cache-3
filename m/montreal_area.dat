There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form: Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica, Bonsecours Market, and the 19th‑century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on St. James Street (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Montreal's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction.|$|E

5|$|The Greater <b>Montreal</b> <b>Area</b> is {{predominantly}} Roman Catholic; however, weekly attendance in Quebec {{is among the}} lowest in Canada. Historically Montreal has been a centre of Catholicism in North America with its numerous seminaries and churches, including the Notre-Dame Basilica, the Cathédrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. Some 65.8% {{of the total population}} is Christian, largely Roman Catholic (52.8%), primarily because of descendants of original French settlers, and others of Italian and Irish origins. Protestants which include Anglican Church in Canada, United Church of Canada, Lutheran, owing to British and German immigration, and other denominations number 5.90%, with a further 3.7% consisting mostly of Orthodox Christians, fuelled by a large Greek population. There is also a number of Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox parishes. Islam is the largest non-Christian religious group, with 154,540 members, the second-largest concentration of Muslims in Canada at 9.6%. The Jewish community in Montreal has a population of 90,780. In cities such as Côte Saint-Luc and Hampstead, Jewish people constitute the majority, or a substantial part of the population. As recently as 1971 the Jewish community in Greater Montreal was as high as 109,480. Political and economic uncertainties led many to leave Montreal and the province of Quebec.|$|E

40|$|Most recent {{research}} reveals that social inequalities in premature mortality are widening. Such findings mainly apply to countries as a whole. In this study, we model {{recent changes in}} the association between premature mortality and a deprivation index (a small area-based index) in four geographic settings in Québec, namely the <b>Montréal</b> metropolitan <b>area,</b> other Québec metropolitan areas, mid-size cities, and small towns and rural areas. Deaths from all-cause and specific causes of mortality among people under age 75 are considered for the periods 1989 - 1993 and 1999 - 2003. Mortality rates are modeled using negative binomial regressions. Models are fitted for the overall population and for men and women, separately, in every geographic setting. Three measures of inequalities are used: mortality rates for different population groups, rate ratios and rate differences. Results show that social inequalities in premature mortality increase everywhere in Québec except in the <b>Montréal</b> metropolitan <b>area.</b> Presently, the highest mortality rates among deprived groups are found in mid-size cities, small towns and rural areas; the highest rate ratios in the <b>Montréal</b> metropolitan <b>area</b> and other metropolitan areas of Québec; and the highest rate differences in the <b>Montréal</b> metropolitan <b>area,</b> other metropolitan areas of Québec and mid-size cities. These results are discussed with reference to possible explanatory factors, namely relative deprivation, smoking, immigration and internal migration. Indications on future research and policy implications are provided. Geography Social disparities Deprivation Premature mortality Time trends Quebec Canada...|$|R
