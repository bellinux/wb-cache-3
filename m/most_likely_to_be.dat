5|$|Ctenophores {{are found}} in most marine environments: from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths. The best-understood are the genera Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis, as these planktonic coastal forms are among the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{collected}} near shore.

Snakes species include bullsnakes {{and rubber}} boas, {{as well as}} western rattlesnakes, which are <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found at lower elevations and in the Minidoka District.

5|$|This {{model was}} able to explain {{observations}} of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen.

5|$|Collybia cirrhata is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments are <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E

UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.

5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch are the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to {{the decline in the}} number of whitebark pines.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cookei is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, {{both of which are}} outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obese.
