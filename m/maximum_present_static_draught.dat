In order {{to define the}} lenders' optimal rescheduling strategy, I calculate the <b>maximum</b> <b>present</b> discounted value of the repayment they could obtain. This upper bound occurs when the borrower gives up sovereignty over all decisions except to default. To secure the maximum, however, the lenders do not simply extract a payment equal {{to the cost of}} default, but allows the country to invest more. The <b>maximum</b> <b>present</b> discounted value return coincides with the equilibrium market value of the debt. Rather than a debt write-off, the key to an efficient rescheduling process is a clear commitment from the lenders that the flow of resources they will ask the debtor to transfer will reflect the secondary market discou.
