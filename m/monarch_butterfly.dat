5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way accurately without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|Only {{insects that}} live in nests or colonies {{demonstrate}} any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as philopatry, insects that hibernate have shown the ability to recall a specific location {{up to a year}} after last viewing the area of interest. A few insects seasonally migrate large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly).</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} Lepidoptera {{sequester}} or manufacture toxins which {{are stored in}} their body tissue, rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies are {{distributed}} worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 {{are distributed}} across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{is native to}} the Americas, but {{in the nineteenth century}} or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was a necessity for their successful establishment.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly.</b> They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|The World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) are {{non-profit}} {{organizations that}} provide funding and other support to off site and on site conservation efforts. The wise use of crop genetic diversity in plant breeding and genetic modification can also {{contribute significantly to}} protecting the biodiversity in crops. Crop varieties can be genetically modified to resist specific pests and diseases. For example, a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces a natural insecticide toxin. Genes from Bt can be inserted into crop plants to make them capable of producing an insecticidal toxin and therefore a resistance to certain pests. Bt corn (maize) can however adversely affect non-target insects {{closely related to the}} target pest, as with the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> is not {{currently}} listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) or protected specifically under U.S. domestic laws. On 14 August 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Food Safety filed a legal petition requesting Endangered Species Act {{protection for the}} monarch and its habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a status review of the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> under the Endangered Species Act with a due date for information submission of 3 March 2015.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} mode (Johnson's third), {{migration}} takes place {{to a place}} of hibernation or aestivation where they undergo diapause and the same generation survives to return. The classic example is that of the nymphalid <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Danuas plexippus).|$|E
25|$|The use of GMO {{crop plants}} {{engineered}} for herbicide resistance can also indirectly {{increase the amount}} of agricultural pollution associated with herbicide use. For example, the increased use of herbicide in herbicide-resistant corn fields in the mid-western United States is decreasing the amount of milkweeds available for <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> larvae.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} that non-target organisms, such as pollinators and natural enemies, could be poisoned by accidental ingestion of Bt-producing plants. A recent study testing {{the effects of}} Bt corn pollen dusting nearby milkweed plants on larval feeding of the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> found that the threat to populations of the monarch was low.|$|E

25|$|A {{study in}} 2016 {{claimed that the}} {{long-term}} trend {{in the size of}} the overwintering sites is cause for concern. After a ten-fold drop in the overwintering numbers of the eastern <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> population over the last decade, this study claimed there was a 11%–57% probability that this population will go quasi-extinct over the next 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the western and eastern populations of the <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> expands and {{contracts}} depending upon the season. The range differs between breeding areas, migration routes, and winter roosts. However, no genetic differences between the western and eastern monarch populations exist; reproductive isolation has not led to subspeciation of these populations, as it has elsewhere within the species' range.|$|E
25|$|The {{state has}} 49 {{environmentally}} protected areas, {{with the most}} important being the Nevado de Toluca National Park.

25|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} origin of the name. It has been translated as “entrance to the cave,” “very high thing” and “inside the forest.” The municipality has its own coat of arms divided into three sections. One has symbols referring to mining, the second with a representation of a <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> and the third with mountains and the sun representing the terrain.|$|E
25|$|While {{residents}} {{in and around}} the town still extract some lead and silver from the hillsides, the town is best known for being in middle of much of the <b>Monarch</b> <b>Butterfly</b> Biosphere Reserve, with two sanctuaries open to the public nearby: Sierra Chincua and El Rosario. The town’s association with the butterflies came when magazines such as National Geographic and México Desconocido began promoting it, along with neighboring Ocampo. The town hosts an annual <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> festival each year in February to bid goodbye as the insects head north again. The festival consists of artistic and cultural events as well as those related to the region’s traditions and customs. Another annual cultural event is the Day of the Miner on 11 July, which is held to honor {{a way of life that}} many in the town do not wish to lose. The rest of the municipality’s annual festivals are religious including the feasts of Santa Cruz on May 3, San Simon on October 28 and the Immaculate Conception on December 8.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{glyphosate}} {{to clear}} milkweed along roads and fields {{may have contributed}} to a decline in <b>monarch</b> <b>butterfly</b> populations in the Midwestern United States. Along with deforestation and adverse weather conditions, the decrease in milkweed contributed to an 81% decline in monarchs. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a suit in 2015 against the EPA, in which it is argued that the agency ignored warnings about the dangers of glyphosate usage for monarchs.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Cynanchum louiseae crowds out {{a species}} of {{milkweed}} that <b>monarch</b> <b>butterflies</b> use as their larval food plant. Thus, the spread of this plant threatens populations of <b>monarch</b> <b>butterflies.</b> Overall, Cynanchum louiseae reproduces very prolifically, and can easily take over various habitats in a short time. Most of the possible implications of Cynanchum louiseaes changing the structure of various ecosystems {{have not yet been}} studied.|$|R
