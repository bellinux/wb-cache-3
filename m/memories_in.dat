40|$|AbstractEpisodic memory {{relies on}} a {{distributed}} network of brain regions, with the hippocampus playing a critical and irreplaceable role. Few studies have examined how changes in this network contribute to episodic <b>memory</b> development early <b>in</b> life. The present addressed this gap by examining relations between hippocampal functional connectivity and episodic <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> 4 - and 6 -year-old children (n= 40). Results revealed similar hippocampal functional connectivity between age groups, which included lateral temporal regions, precuneus, and multiple parietal and prefrontal regions, and functional specialization along the longitudinal axis. Despite these similarities, developmental differences were also observed. Specifically, 3 (of 4) regions within the hippocampal memory network were positively associated with episodic <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> 6 -year-old children, but negatively associated with episodic <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> 4 -year-old children. In contrast, all 3 regions outside the hippocampal memory network were negatively associated with episodic <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> older children, but positively associated with episodic <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> younger children. These interactions are interpreted within an interactive specialization framework and suggest the hippocampus becomes functionally integrated with cortical regions {{that are part of}} the hippocampal <b>memory</b> network <b>in</b> adults and functionally segregated from regions unrelated to <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> adults, both of which are associated with age-related improvements <b>in</b> episodic <b>memory</b> ability...|$|R

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial <b>memories</b> <b>in</b> living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of <b>memories</b> <b>in</b> vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Phase, events play in vaguely {{the same}} fashion, {{but there are}} minor variations: Lorica forms an {{alliance}} with Milites rather than being conquered, and while Concordia offers an alliance, Imperial sympathizers within Concordia orchestrate the Queen's death and ally with Concordia. After overcoming Lorica and Concordia, the Rubrum forces storm the Militesi capital and Cid is killed. Before dying, he warns the Cadet and his comrades of the Crystals' role in Orience's cycle. When Tempus Finis arrives, Ace goes alone to find the one mentioned by Cid. He is himself marked as a l'Cie and transformed into Judge Ace. As with the previous cycle, he is defeated, but Tempus Finis arrives and the cycle continues. In a final side story episode, various additional stories revolving around the main cast are revealed. Among the events presented are a talk between Myuria and Arecia as to whether to continue the experiment, and then Lean and Tono are chosen by Arecia to exist outside the cycle and retain their <b>memories.</b> <b>In</b> this new form, the two agree to gather the memories of Orience's people {{and find a way}} of liberating the world from its cycle.

5|$|In {{the year}} Grann 757, barbarians from {{the kingdom of}} Issach siege Darna Castle, and Prince Kurth of Grannvale and his friend Lord Byron of Chalpy {{set out on a}} punitive expedition. When the southwestern kingdom of Verdane takes {{advantage}} of Grannvale's weakened state to invade, Byron's son Sigurd repels them and launches a counter-invasion. During the campaign, Sigurd meets a mysterious girl named Deirdre. She is revealed to be of Naga blood, a long-lost member of the Grannvalian royal family, and the descendant of the crusader with the power to defeat the evil dragon Loptyr. Sigurd and Deirdre fall in love and marry, and their son Seliph is born in Agustria. At this point, an alliance of Grannvale dukes stage an attempt to seize the throne, murder Kurth, and frame Sigurd and his father for the crime. Sigurd is forced into exile, while the archbishop Manfroy of the Loptyr Sect kidnaps Deirdre and erases her <b>memories</b> <b>in</b> order to use her to resurrect Loptyr. His plan is to wed her to Lord Arvis of Velthomer - the two are, unbeknownst to them, half siblings, and their union will produce a human vessel capable of hosting the consciousness of Loptyr. During their exile, Sigurd and his allies are forced to hide Seliph and the rest of their children from the forces of Arvis and the Loptyr cult. After a year in exile, Sigurd begins making his way back through Jugdral, killing the Dukes responsible for the false accusation. Apparently exonerated, Sigurd returns to Grannvale, only to learn that Arvis has married Deirdre to become Grannvale's king. Arvis orders Sigurd's allies to be executed and personally murders Sigurd.|$|E

Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences.

The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{memory of}} {{convective}} precipitation is estimated via {{the analysis of}} the convective parameters convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN). The variability of mixed layer (ML) CAPE and CIN in present-day climate is presented in terms of a linear decay time scale for short-term memory and the Hurst exponent for long-term memory (determined by detrended fluctuation analysis). Regional and global <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> CAPE and CIN is compared between observations (ECMWF re-analysis, in 1979 – 2001) and simulated data (ECHAM 5 /MPIOM, 20 C simulation, in 1900 – 2001). Both datasets agree on the <b>memory</b> pattern <b>in</b> CAPE and CIN with highest values of the Hurst exponent along the equatorial Pacific which decrease towards higher latitudes; however, longest memory up to decades is found in CAPE south-east of Greenland. The <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> CIN is weaker than in CAPE regarding strength and spatial extent. To determine the origin of <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> CAPE and CIN, ML temperature and specific humidity, enthalpy, and latent heat equivalent of precipitable water (LPW) are analysed.
