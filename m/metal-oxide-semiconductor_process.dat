Because of the critically small dimension and vertically aligned nature of VSNEA, the current density of Au-coated VSNEA was dramatically higher than that of Au film electrodes. Au-coated VSNEA further showed a large current difference with and without peptides that was nine times more than that of Au film electrodes. These results indicate that Au-coated VSENA is highly effective device to detect peptides compared to conventional thin-film electrodes.

A scheme employing ones-counters is proposed to encode the sampled ring oscillator code into a binary representation, which is resilient to a class of sampling induced errors modeled by the temporal reordering of the transitions in the ring. In addition to correcting errors caused by deterministic reordering, proposed encoding suppresses conversion errors {{in the presence of}} arbitrary reordering patterns that may result from automatic place-and-route in wire-delay dominated processes.
