40|$|Abstract. The {{interoperability}} {{among different}} data formats over the Internet has drawn increasing interest recently due to {{more and more}} heterogeneous data models are used in different Web services. In order to ease the manipulation of data models for heterogeneous data, generic model management has been intensively researched and also implemented in a prototype since its first introduction. Access control specifications attached to each individual data model require significant amount of efforts to manually specify. Based on a general security model for access control specifications on heterogeneous data models and its visual representation, we present secure model <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> for managing access control specifications. The secure model <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> disccussed in the paper include a secure match operator and a secure merge operator. We introduce a novel graphical schema matching algorithm and extend the algorithm to make a secure match operator. The paper also discusses secure merge principles for the integration of data models. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and eBusiness (UN/CEFACT) standardizes {{business}} {{documents for}} electronic data interchange. Their approaches towards UN/EDIFACT and XML have later {{been followed by}} a conceptual modeling approach called Core Components (CC). Having used this approach for four years in practice, it became evident that the support for managing business document models {{is a prerequisite for}} successfully utilizing CC. This includes handling variants of business document models on the one hand, and managing the evolution of business document models on the other hand. In this paper we propose an approach to face these challenges by the means of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) in combination with dedicated model <b>management</b> <b>operators.</b> The contribution of the approach is twofold. First, SPLE is successfully applied in a new field enabling us to manage variants of business document models. Second, the model <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> support the evolution of business document model variants, whereas the operators defined, contribute to the evolution of product lines as well. ...|$|R

This exposes the dumpster divers to potential health risks, and, especially if the dumpster diver does not return the non-usable items to their previous location, may leave trash scattered around.

40|$|The goal of Model Management is the {{development}} of new technologies and mechanisms to support the integration, evolution and matching of models. Such tasks are to be performed by means of a set of model <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> which work on models and their elements, without being restricted to a particular metamodel (e. g. the relational or UML metamodel). We propose that generic model management should employ a generic metamodel (GMM) which serves as an abstraction of the features of particular metamodels while preserving the semantics of its different elements. A naive generalization of the elements of concrete metamodels in generic metaclasses would loose some of the specific features of the metamodels, or yield a prohibitive number of metaclasses in the GMM. To avoid these problems, we propose the Generic Role Based Metamodel GeRoMe in which each model element is decorated with a set of role objects that represent specific properties of the model element. Roles may be added to or removed from elements at any time, which enables a very flexible and dynamic yet accurate definition of models. Roles constitute to operators different views on the same model element. Thus, operators concentrate on features which affect their functionality but may remain agnostic about other features. Consequently, these operators can use polymorphism and have to be implemented only once using GeRoMe, and not for each specific metamodel. We verified our results by implementing GeRoMe and a selection of model <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> using our metadata system ConceptBase...|$|R

The dictionary manages schemas and, at a metalevel, {{a description of the}} models of interest. It describes all models in terms of a limited set of metaconstructs. It describes all the schemas in a unifying model, called the supermodel, which generalizes all the others. The dictionary is composed of four parts, based on the combination of two features: schema level or model level, and model specific or model generic. We also show how such a dictionary can be the basis for a model independent approach to reporting, that provides a detailed textual and XML description of schemas. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Model Management (MM) {{is a way}} {{of raising}} the level of {{abstraction}} in metadata intensive application areas. The key idea behind Model Management is to develop a set of generic algorithmic operators that can be applied {{to a wide range of}} database management problems. Solutions to problems can then be specified at a high level of abstraction, by combining these operators into a concise script. The operators work on schemas and mappings between schemas, rather than individual schema elements.

30|$|Commitment and {{behavioral}} intention Previously, {{some studies have}} emphasized on affective and continuance commitment rather than normative commitment; however, this study finds that such a stress in a prejudiced way may be a conservative bias. From the empirical results, it is proven that service quality has positive impact on affective, continuance, and normative commitment simultaneously. This information implies that <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> of online shopping business can establish customers’ commitment through good service quality. Different types of commitments have distinct consequences over consumers’ loyalty behavior. Based on this study, six key points are identified. (a) Affective commitment has positive effect on loyalty intention and advocacy intention, but negative effect on WTPM. (b) Continuance commitment has positive impact on loyalty intention and WTPM, but negative effect on advocacy intention. (c) Normative commitment has positive effect on loyalty intention, advocacy intention, and WTPM. (d) Interestingly and importantly, there exist differences when this study compared with the prior studies. Regarding the past studies, scholars believed that affective commitment is the key element to maintain the relationship with consumers, and <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> are thus recommended to maintain a long-term relationship with customers via affective commitment. However, this study finds that normative commitment has a greater impact degree on loyalty behaviors than affective commitment. (e) Particularly, this finding has further proven the viewpoint of Meyer and Allen [40]: They believed that social links and obligations are the emphasis in culturally collectivist countries where collective goals and interests take precedence over individual ones. Every person should consider other’s benefit; thus, normative commitment highlights greater effect on the consumers’ loyalty behavior than affective commitment. The study results echo with Meyer and Allen’s point of view [40], particularly in terms of prices. (f) Affective commitment has no significant effect on WTPM, while normative commitment has a positive relationship with WTPM: The stronger the normative commitment, the greater the willingness to accept an increased price. Thus, this study recommends <b>management</b> <b>operators</b> of the shopping website to develop a strategy of good normative commitment for the consumers. This recommendation can positively increase {{the willingness of the}} consumers to visit and purchase in their website, to recommend to friends and acquaintances, and to have a high willing to accepting the increased price. In this strength, a long-term mutual-beneficial relationship with consumers is established, and the goal of sustainable operation for the shopping website is accordingly achieved.|$|R
