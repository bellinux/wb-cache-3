5000|$|The {{operating}} {{rules for the}} current system are agreed with all the participants and define {{the circumstances in which}} flow will be precisely managed. The key <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> is at Manley Hall, a gauging station near Chirk. This location was chosen as it was on a section of the river where flow could be readily measured and above the very flat stretch that meanders into Cheshire. The current rules state that when flow exceeds 10 m³/s no intervention is required. In practice some adjustment of Bala sluices may take place to increase storage in Llyn Celyn and conversely some releases may be made from Llyn Celyn for recreational or power generation purposes. When the flow at Manley Hall approaches 10 m³/s, additional flow is released from Llyn Tegid. If that is insufficient, flow from Llyn Celyn is used to maintain 10 m³/s at Manley Hall. In extreme situations where the flow from Llyn Celyn is insufficient to maintain the flow, releases of water from Llyn Brenig are made [...] Circumstances can arise where even this is insufficient to maintain flows and in such cases drought provisions are agreed which progressively reduce the maintained flow at Manley Hall. The overall effect of this regulation has a marked impact on the hydrograph of the River Dee. In dry years the hydrograph flat-lines at 10 m³/s whilst dry weather continues such as in 1990 ...|$|E
30|$|The maximum air {{velocity}} at <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 4 occurs {{from the center}} to the left bottom corner, and the lowest {{air velocity}} is at the right upper corner. At <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 17, the air velocity decreases from the lower right corner to the upper left corner. The maximum air velocities are observed near the entry floors for measuring locations A 26 and A 27. A sensor location correction factor is determined by comparing the air velocity and the measured average air velocity. The velocity distribution at a plane {{does not affect the}} average velocity significantly, but it does affect the sensor readings. Apparently, a sensor mounted in a high-velocity zone will yield a smaller correction factor than one mounted in a low-velocity zone. Using <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 17 as an example, a larger correction factor will be obtained if the sensor is at the left side than that at the right side, as the air velocity exhibits an increasing trend from left to right.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the characteristics of indoor thermal environment on the sixth floor of Taiwan Building Technology Center (T. B. T. C.) building. Experimental measurements were conducted in a test chamber with the UnderFloor Air Distribution (UFAD) system. This research investigates supply air flow velocity and flow rate, and the vertical temperature distribution in the indoor environment. The experimental results of supply air flow velocity and flow rate show that the supply air flow rate for a single supply vent is 0. 022 m 3 /s for the Q 1 option, 0. 024 m 3 /s for the Q 2 option and 0. 033 m 3 /s for the Q 3 option. The results also show that the indoor vertical temperature distribution is influenced by the distance between the <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> and the supply vent position. When the <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> is close to the supply vent, the vertical temperature profile is influenced by the supply conditioned airflow. When the distance from the supply vent is larger than 150 cm, the vertical temperature distribution becomes quite consistent. The vertical temperature profile is not influenced significantly by the return vent location. The supply air flow rate can change the vertical temperature distribution...|$|E
30|$|In this study, no two {{velocity}} distributions are {{the same}} among the total 21 velocity contour maps. With careful observation and analysis, {{it is found that}} the velocity distribution at a measuring plane is mainly determined by the measuring locations. For example, the <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 2 is located in the main intake about 30  m to the mouth of the portal, which is not sufficiently long to allow the airstream to become a fully developed flow. As can be seen in Fig.  8, the air velocity at the bottom section is greater than that at upper section. The air passing through A 4 is split into two streams, with one stream flowing straightly forward and the other portion of air taking a route on the left to the working section. Therefore, the airflow at the <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 4 “shifts” to the left side, with the consequence that {{the left side of the}} section has a slightly higher air velocity than the right side. For the air velocity distributions at A 26 and A 27, which are located in the main return, the large air leakage from the main intake through the bottom of the door merges into the main air stream, which causes the maximum air velocity to occur near the bottom of the floors.|$|E

The relative displacement in space of the beams and the corresponding velocity component inclinations are also calculated. The beam equations are solved, without any small-angle approximations, for an arrangement corresponding to a 3 D laser Doppler anemometer. The proposed method has been validated by comparison with experimental results. The correction procedure has been applied to a typical configuration of a turbomachinery passage and representative beam displacement calculations are presented. Possibilities offered by the method in designing experiments as well as correcting obtained results are discussed...|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the wider range of air velocities at these measuring locations might have contributed to the large deviation of the measured average velocities from the two methods. To investigate the correlation between the air velocity distribution and the deviation of the two air velocity measuring methods, the standard deviation at each measuring station was calculated using the nine measured fixed-point velocities. As can be seen in Fig.  5, the larger the standard deviation at a <b>measuring</b> <b>location,</b> the greater the differences between the air velocities using the two measuring methods. With the current data, it is difficult to say which method produced more accurate measurements. To minimize the error in the calculation of the correction factors, the air velocities from the two methods at each measuring station were averaged and used for the correction factors analysis.|$|E
