40|$|Abstracts: The {{research}} investigates {{two kinds}} basic problems during the precision processing about turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor using 5 -axis machining center. The {{one is to}} study the geometric and dimensional precision of turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor. The other one is to study the accuracy evaluative factors of 5 -axis turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor machining center. For improving the processing precision to ensure the dynamic symmetry and geometric symmetry of the turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor, it focus on analyzing the allowable deviations from the turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor’s nominal geometry and dimensions specified during the design stage by defining tolerances on the part’s features using geometric dimensioning tolerancing standards and homogeneous transformation matrix. The geometric and dimensional errors deviation model of this feature can be represented by a HTM Hq.

50|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> sweep out {{a larger}} area than {{mechanical}} pumps, {{and do so}} more frequently, making them capable of much higher pumping speeds. They do this {{at the expense of}} the seal between the vacuum and their exhaust. Since there is no seal, a small pressure at the exhaust can easily cause backstreaming through the pump; this is called stall. In high vacuum, however, pressure gradients have little effect on fluid flows, and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> can attain their full potential.|$|R

50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps use {{a mechanism to}} repeatedly expand a cavity, allow gases to flow in from the chamber, seal off the cavity, and exhaust it to the atmosphere. Momentum transfer <b>pumps,</b> also called <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps,</b> use high speed jets of dense fluid or high speed rotating blades to knock gas molecules out of the chamber. Entrapment pumps capture gases in a solid or adsorbed state. This includes cryopumps, getters, and ion pumps.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of modern {{industry}} the molecular vacuum pumps (MVP) are widely used. The analyzed current market of vacuum technology enables drawing a conclusion that this equipment holds {{one of the leading}} positions among the high-vacuum facilities of pumping due to their advantages such as insensitivity to the atmosphere breakthrough, ability to pump out heavy gases quickly, rapid start-up time, and oil-free pumping. The earlier developed authors’ mathematical model and calculation program are used to assess the influence efficiency of the key geometrical parameters of flowing part of the cylindrical <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> on its main characteristics. The obtained dependences allow us to solve a relevant, but not completely resolved as yet problem of optimizing the high-vacuum pumping facilities in case of their operation {{in a wide range of}} pressures on the suction side.

We have identified a set of simple functionalized phenyl and biaryl groups that present activation energy barriers between 16. 7 and 26. 6 kcal mol(- 1) to threading the dumbbells. These barriers will be employed as 'steric speed bumps' to modulate kinetics in artificial <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> that operate based upon a delicate balance of noncovalent bonding interactions...|$|R
50|$|The {{impact of}} {{molecular}} size must be considered. Smaller molecules can leak in more easily {{and are more}} easily absorbed by certain materials, and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> are less effective at pumping gases with lower molecular weights. A system {{may be able to}} evacuate nitrogen (the main component of air) to the desired vacuum, but the chamber could still be full of residual atmospheric hydrogen and helium. Vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as palladium (which is a high-capacity hydrogen sponge) create special outgassing problems.|$|R
40|$|Periodic {{driving is}} used to operate {{machines}} that go from standard macroscopic engines to small non-equilibrium micro-sized systems. Two classes of such systems are small heat engines driven by periodic temperature variations and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> driven by external stimuli. Well known results that are valid for nonequilibrium steady states of systems driven by fixed thermodynamic forces, instead of an external periodic driving, have been generalized to periodically driven heat engines only recently. These results include a general expression for entropy production in terms of currents and affinities and symmetry relations for the Onsager coefficients from linear response theory. For nonequilibrium steady states, the Onsager reciprocity relations {{can be obtained from}} the more general fluctuation theorem for the currents. We prove a fluctuation theorem for the currents for periodically driven systems. We show that this fluctuation theorem implies a fluctuation dissipation relation, symmetry relations for Onsager coefficients and further relations for nonlinear response coefficients. The setup in this paper is more general than previous studies, i. e., our results are valid for both heat engines and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps.</b> The external protocol is assumed to be stochastic in our framework, which leads to a particularly convenient way to treat periodically driven systems.

30|$|The {{deposition}} chamber is {{a stainless}} steel vacuum vessel with 30  cm (diameter) by 30  cm (height). The ultimate pressure inside the chamber is 10 − 5  Torr, done by a vacuum system composed of a mechanical pump and a turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump.</b> Inside the chamber there are a magnetron, a grounded grid, a sample holder for 6 samples and an electric heater (controlled by a PID). The temperature is monitored with a thermocouple inserted in the substrate holder and its temperature is maintained at 300 °C. The working pressure is measured by a capacitive gauge Adixen ASD 2004 and the base pressure is measured with a Penning gauge Edwards CP 25 EK. The gases flowing into the chamber are controlled by two mass flow meters of 200 sccm.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> are the {{diffusion}} pump and the turbomolecular pump. Both types of pumps blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the pump by imparting momentum {{to the gas}} molecules. Diffusion pumps blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular pumps use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these pumps will stall and fail to pump if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical pump.|$|R
50|$|The {{turbomolecular pump}} {{was invented in}} 1958 by W. Becker, based on the older <b>molecular</b> drag <b>pumps</b> {{developed}} by Wolfgang Gaede in 1913, Fernand Holweck in 1923 and Manne Siegbahn in 1944.|$|R

Among the most fascinating transporters are those that act as <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps,</b> translocating their substrates across membranes against a concentration gradient; this thermodynamically unfavorable process is powered by coupling to a second, energetically favorable process such as ATP hydrolysis or the movement of a second solute down a transmembrane concentration gradient...|$|R
30|$|The source chamber, {{shown on}} the very left in Fig.  3, is a single squared chamber made from {{stainless}} steel in our local workshop. It contains two compartments, separated by a vertical wall, that each houses one supersonic expansion. A single turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> (1600 l/s) is installed {{on top of the}} chamber and generates vacuum in both compartments. Cross-talk between the two half-chambers is minimised by closing off the chambers {{all the way up to}} the pump. Base pressures in this chamber are in the range of 10 − 7 mbar and rise to 10 − 5 mbar during operation. Pressure gauges monitoring the pressure in each compartment demonstrate that the separation wall does lead to a pressure differential, but that nevertheless operating one source also leads to a noticeable pressure increase in the second compartment.|$|E
30|$|We {{prepared}} InN films/nanorods on c-plane sapphire substrate with GaN template using MOMBE {{system with}} an RF source {{to activate the}} nitrogen. The 4 -μm-thick GaN template grown by MOCVD was commercially available. A turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> evacuated the growth chamber, reaching a base pressure of 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 9 Torr. The group III precursors, i.e., trimethylindium (TMIn) and trimethylaluminum, were delivered to the growth chamber by heating the metalorganic sources without carrier gases. The active nitrogen radicals were supplied by a radio-frequency plasma source. Also, the V/III flow rate was controlled by mass flow controller. During the InN growth, N 2 flow rate were fixed at 0.6 sccm (sccm denotes cubic centimeter per minute at STP) for film and 1 sccm for rods, respectively. In our experiments, the V/III ratio was changed by adjusting the TMIn flow rate from 0.8 sccm (sample 1) to 0.4 sccm (sample 2).|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} {{are commonly}} used in turbo-molecular pumps because of their suitability for high speed and contamination free operations. A five-axis turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> with two radial and one axial magnetic bearing is considered in this paper. The effect of the bias current on the energy consumption for both unidirectional and differential control current strategies is studied. It is shown that optimising the bias current according to operational conditions is beneficial. A differential current control gives better efficiency compared with a unidirectional approach when the bias current is variable. The optimum bias current {{is a function of}} the desired bearing stiffness and the rotor vibration amplitudes. The desired bearing stiffness is a function of rotor vibration levels or transmitted forces. A fuzzy logic controller is set up to resolve the conflicting control requirements. A simulation involving a non-linear magnetic bearing model is used to verify the suggested control and optimisation techniques...|$|E

40|$|The {{simplified}} 2 D {{method of}} angular coefficients {{is applied to}} calculate the <b>molecular</b> <b>pumping</b> properties of complicate vacuum systems. An optimisation of the cold LHC beam vacuum chamber geometry with electron shields is performed. An additional interesting application of the angular coefficients method is the estimation of an effective secondary electron emission from surface with artificial roughness. This method allows {{to take into account}} re-reflection of the electrons using experimental data of the secondary electron energy distributions and the surface reflectivity. The suppression affectivity of the secondary electron emission from Cu as a function of roughness parameter is presented.

30|$|The a-Si layers {{have been}} {{sputtered}} {{at a rate}} of 6.3 nm/min from a high-purity crystalline silicon target in a high-vacuum sputtering apparatus (Leybold Z 400, Fergutec, Valkenswaard, The Netherlands) reaching a base pressure better than 5 × 10 − 5 Pa by a turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump.</b> The target was coupled to a RF generator (13.56 MHz) via a network for impedance matching between the generator and its load. The substrate was polished (100) silicon wafer and at a distance of 50 mm away from the target. The layer thickness was approximately 400 nm. Sputtering has been done with a mixture of high-purity argon and hydrogen gases. Both gases have been introduced continuously into the chamber by means of electronically adjustable flow controls. A 1, 500 -V dc wall potential has been applied to sputter the targets under a plasma pressure of 2 Pa. The samples were annealed in high-purity (99.999 %) argon at 350 °C for 1 and 4 h.|$|E
40|$|A {{compositional}} separation by {{thermal diffusion}} phenomena (Soret effect) in a locally heated rectangular flow channel under 1 G and microgravity condition was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Parabolic flight experiments on thermal diffusion were conducted using binary gas mixture systems of He-SF_ 6 and Ne-SF_ 6.

Gas flow, heat and mass transfer in a rectangular flow channel under 1 G and ・G were also predicted numerically using a steady state three-dimensional simulation code.

30|$|ZnO {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} by RF magnetron sputtering system using a ZnO target (99.99 %) with {{a diameter of}} 2 in. and a thickness of 3 mm. The substrate comprised p-type silicon (100) with a SiO 2 layer and a Au/Ti seed layer. The thickness of the SiO 2 layer and the Au/Ti seed layer were 1 μm and 300 nm/ 50 nm, respectively. The chamber was down to 5 × 10 - 6 Torr using a <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> before introducing mixed Ar and O 2 gases. In the deposition of the ZnO thin film, the RF power was 70 W, the working pressure was 0.8 Pa, the O 2 /(Ar + O 2) gas ratio was 0.25, and the substrate temperature was at room temperature. The above deposition condition was from our previous optimization result. The corresponding deposition rate of the ZnO film was about 0.28 μm/h, and the deposition time was 4.5 h.|$|E
50|$|In a {{momentum}} transfer pump, gas molecules are accelerated from the vacuum {{side to the}} exhaust side (which is usually maintained at a reduced pressure by a positive displacement pump). Momentum transfer pumping is only possible below pressures of about 0.1 kPa. Matter flows differently at different pressures based on the laws of fluid dynamics. At atmospheric pressure and mild vacuums, molecules {{interact with each other}} and push on their neighboring molecules in what is known as viscous flow. When the distance between the molecules increases, the molecules interact with the walls of the chamber more often than with the other molecules, and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumping</b> becomes more effective than positive displacement pumping. This regime is generally called high vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Outgassing {{can also}} be reduced simply by {{desiccation}} prior to vacuum pumping.High vacuum systems generally require metal chambers with metal gasket seals such as Klein flanges or ISO flanges, rather than the rubber gaskets more common in low vacuum chamber seals. The system must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small vapour pressure, and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. As a result, many materials that work well in low vacuums, such as epoxy, will {{become a source of}} outgassing at higher vacuums.With these standard precautions, vacuums of 1 mPa are easily achieved with an assortment of <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps.</b> With careful design and operation, 1 µPa is possible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Non-equilibrium {{fluctuations}} {{can drive}} vectorial transport along an anisotropic structure in an isothermal medium by biasing {{the effect of}} thermal noise (k BT). Mechanisms based on this principle are often called Brownian ratchets and have been invoked as a {{possible explanation for the}} operation of biomolecular motors and pumps. We discuss the thermodynamics and kinetics for the operation of microscopic ratchet motors under conditions relevant to biology, showing how energy provided by external fluctuations or a non-equilibrium chemical reaction can cause unidirectional motion or uphill pumping of a substance.
