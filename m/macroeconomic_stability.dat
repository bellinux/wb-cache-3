It is absolutely vital that Kazakhstan evaluate its oil-income for going out from transition and developing itself {{in accordance with the}} conditions of market economy. After the suggestion of the IMF, Kazakh Government constituted an oil fund in order to prevent its economy from volatility of oil-revenue and price-chocks in the oil market.

25|$|The IMF {{was content}} with Peru's measures, and {{guaranteed}} loan funding for Peru. Inflation rapidly {{began to fall}} and foreign investment capital flooded in. The privatization campaign involved selling off of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, and replacing the country's troubled currency, the inti, with the Nuevo Sol. The Fujishock restored <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stability</b> {{to the economy and}} triggered a considerable long-term economic upturn in the mid-1990s. In 1994, the Peruvian economy grew at a rate of 13%, faster than any other economy in the world.|$|E
25|$|According to the IMF itself, {{it works}} to foster global growth and {{economic}} stability by providing policy, advice and financing the members, {{by working with}} developing nations to help them achieve <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stability</b> and reduce poverty. The rationale {{for this is that}} private international capital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to financial markets. Such market imperfections, together with balance-of-payments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without which many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances through measures with adverse economic consequences. The IMF provides alternate sources of financing.|$|E

By contrast, the economy without adjustment costs for capital investment always displays saddle-path stability and equilibrium uniqueness, regardless of the degree of increasing returns in aggregate production...|$|R

25|$|Moroccan {{economic}} policies brought <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stability</b> {{to the country}} in the early 1990s but did not spur growth sufficient to reduce unemployment despite Moroccan Government's ongoing efforts to diversify the economy. Drought conditions depressed activity in the key agricultural sector, and contributed to an economic slowdown in 1999. Favourable rainfalls have led Morocco to a growth of 6% for 2000. Formidable long-term challenges included: servicing the external debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the EU; and improving education and attracting foreign investment to improve living standards and job prospects for Morocco's youthful population.|$|E
25|$|<b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>stability</b> {{coupled with}} {{relatively}} slow economic growth characterized the Moroccan economy {{over the period}} 2000–2005. The government introduced {{a number of important}} economic reforms in that period. The economy, however, remained overly dependent on the agricultural sector. Morocco's primary economic challenge was to accelerate growth in order to reduce high levels of unemployment. The government continued liberalizing the telecommunications sector in 2002, as well as the rules for oil and gas exploration. This process started with the sale of a second GSM license in 1999. The government in 2003 was using revenue from privatizations to finance increased spending. Although Morocco's economy grew in the early 2000s, it was not enough to significantly reduce poverty.|$|E

This paper starts by reviewing the international evidence on fiscal policies and outcomes in resource-rich economies at large and Arab oil-exporting countries in particular, which suggests that strong fiscal (and political) institutions can turn the resource curse into a blessing. Then the paper provides comparative reviews of Chile’s and Norway’s decade-long experience in setting up new fiscal institutions and rules to manage their resource rents, aiming at and, in fact, attaining more <b>macroeconomic</b> and financial <b>stability,</b> higher growth, and improved equity. Specific reform lessons to strengthen fiscal institutions and policies are drawn for resource-rich economies and Arab oil exporters...|$|R

During Fox's administrations several FTAs were signed with Latin American and European countries, Japan and Israel, and both strove to maintain <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stability.</b> Thus, Mexico {{became one of the most}} open countries in the world to trade, and the economy base shifted accordingly. Total trade with the United States and Canada tripled, and total exports and imports almost quadrupled between 1991 and 2003. The nature of foreign investment also changed with a greater share of foreign-direct investment (FDI) over portfolio investment.|$|E
25|$|After 1989 {{the country}} {{experienced}} {{a decade of}} economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base {{and a lack of}} structural reform. From 2000 onward, however, the Romanian economy was transformed into one of relative <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stability,</b> characterized by high growth, low unemployment and declining inflation. In 2006, according to the Romanian Statistics Office, GDP growth in real terms was recorded at 7.7%, one of the highest rates in Europe. However, a recession following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 forced the government to borrow externally, including an IMF €20bn bailout program. GDP has been growing by over 2% each year since. According to The World Bank, the GDP per capita purchasing power parity grew from $13,442 in 2007 to an estimated $22,124 in 2015. Romania still has one of the lowest net average monthly wage in the EU of €540 in 2016, and an inflation of −1.1% in 2016. Unemployment in Romania is at 5.4% in 2017, which is very low compared to other EU countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of economy}} {{was intended to}} end the government subsidiaries and to reduce {{the role of the}} government in national economy. Successful attempts were carried out by Sharif to expand the role of the private sector, and to redress the imbalances in social services. From 1990 to 1993, the private and foreign investments were greatly relaxed. This was followed by the liberalisation of the foreign exchange which was readily free, and at the same time, the interest rates were substantially liberalised, credit subsidies were cut, and energy prices were moved much closer to costs. The economic liberalisation and structural reform measures were necessary and had been overdue at that time. However, instead of being pursued with even greater vigor and effectiveness, the liberalisation programme could not substitute for adequate stabilization efforts and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>stability.</b> By the end of 1993 which was the year of ousting the government of Nawaz Sharif, the benefits from economic liberalisation were seriously limited in the absence of reduction of effective macroeconomic policies. As it grappled with the ongoing foreign exchange crisis in early 1993–97, Pakistan’s most urgent economic need was to raise both national savings and exports.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} {{examines the}} interrelations between a progressive income tax schedule and <b>macroeconomic</b> (in) <b>stability</b> {{in an otherwise}} standard one-sector real business model with productive government spending. We analytically show that the economy exhibits indeterminacy and sunspots only if the equilibrium wage-hours locus is positively sloped and steeper than the households labor supply curve. Unlike in the framework with useless public expenditures, a less progressive tax policy may operate like an automatic stabilizer that mitigates belief-driven cyclical uctuations. Our quantitative analysis shows that this result is able to provide a theoretically plausible explanation for the discernible reduction in U.
