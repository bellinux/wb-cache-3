5|$|During {{the course}} of his second solo series, Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man, Miles {{encounters}} a very much alive Peter Parker, who cannot explain his reappearance, and who does not intend to return to his former life. Together, the two Spider-Men defeat Norman Osborn, who is also revealed to be alive, but who is killed during {{the course of}} the story. After witnessing Miles courageously battle Osborn, Peter acknowledges <b>Miles</b> <b>a</b> worthy successor, and decides to retire from superheroics for a life with his family and Mary Jane.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July 1965, the {{specification}} for the AFVG {{feasibility study}} was issued; according to Wood, the specification greatly resembled that {{which had been}} earlier issued for the cancelled TSR-2. The AFVG {{was to have a}} maximum speed of 800 knots at sea level and Mach 2.5 at altitude. It was required to possess a minimum combat radium of 500 nautical <b>miles,</b> <b>a</b> ferry range of 3,500 nautical miles, and the nose-mounted airborne interception radar was to have a minimum range of 60 nautical miles. Armanment was to include a pair of 30 mm cannons and a 2,500lb tactical nuclear bomb. However, the specification would be repeatedly re-drafted, the issuing of a definitive specification by Whitehall was delayed until April 1966.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructing a {{timetable}} for {{the day of the}} battle is tentative due to ambiguous statements in Ammianus (which may have been caused by manuscript copying-errors). It appears that Julian's army set forth at dawn, and apparently arrived within sight of the barbarian entrenchments (vallum) outside Strasbourg at around midday, after a march of 21 Roman <b>miles.</b> (<b>A</b> contradictory statement in Julian's speech implies that the army was still far off its destination and faced a night march to reach it. But this is incompatible with all the other available data and should thus probably be disregarded). The starting-point was probably Saverne, since this is the last stated location of Julian's army, and it lay a consistent distance from Strasbourg on the Roman highway.|$|E
5|$|When Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{learns that}} several women have {{reportedly}} been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, {{she begins to}} question her own pregnancy. John Doggett (Robert Patrick) introduces Scully to Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) deceased body suddenly appears in a forest at night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is threatened by Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy <b>Miles,</b> <b>a</b> multiple abductee who disappeared {{on the same night}} as Mulder, is returned deceased but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders to do so, but soon gets fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity.|$|E
50|$|This {{race was}} {{run at the}} {{distance}} of <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> and <b>an</b> eighth from 1985 to 1995, then at <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> and <b>a</b> sixteenth in 1996 and 1997. In 1998, the distance was changed back to <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> and <b>an</b> eighth.|$|R

The maximum speed {{attained}} with a passengers only train was thirty <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> hour (48 km/h), and the carriages ran as smoothly as those of a standard-gauge railway. There was no perceptible oscillation of the structure, and the vibration {{was no more than}} it was usual with contemporary iron and timber railway bridges.|$|R
5|$|Middleton {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of raid and harrying. Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption, it soon began to prove counter-productive, as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment. With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch, Monck began a campaign against the rising, making forced marches of between 12 and 20 <b>miles</b> <b>a</b> day in difficult terrain. On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton's army at Dalnaspidal. In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands. The end of the Dutch War meant there was no possibility of foreign aid and government reinforcements were now available to combat the rising. As a result, the Royalist military effort petered out. Eventually, Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 <b>miles,</b> <b>a</b> convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{continued}} its fast pace of advance, with Hill continuing to ride pillion on his motorcycle, and by 23 April it {{had reached the}} River Elbe, having advanced 103 miles in fourteen days; the division had captured more than 19,000 prisoners during this period. After crossing the Elbe, the division once again came {{under the command of}} U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, with General Ridgway informing Major General Bols that it was vital the division reach the port of Wismar before the approaching Russian Army did, to ensure that Denmark was not occupied by the Soviet Union. Although the 5th Parachute Brigade was ordered to lead the division's advance, Hill was determined to reach Wismar first; after an extremely rapid advance he succeeded, with troops from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion being the first to enter Wismar, beating an advancing Russian tank column by only a few <b>miles.</b> <b>A</b> few days later, on 7 May 1945, Germany surrendered and the war in Europe came to an end. Hill was awarded a second Bar to his DSO for his command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade during its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, as well as the American Silver Star.|$|E
