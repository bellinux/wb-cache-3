40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} {{the elaboration of}} a process solution concerning the production of injection <b>moulding</b> <b>products</b> in which glass fibres are substituted by natural fibres. This elaboration includes the agricultural production of raw materials (cultivation, harvest, roasting, primary processing), granulation (compounding) and injection <b>moulding.</b> Using model <b>products,</b> this process solution shall be assessed economically and ecologically. Fibres with different sort of flax, olein and hemp {{are used in the}} production of raw materials. According to the selection of fibre sorts, roasting and steps of preparing, the fibres have different physical properties. The length distribution and the amount of pectin, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin are estimated. The technical production of natural fibre reinforced granular material is based on supplying of ready-made natural fibres. By concentration of the technical development on hemp fibres, a granular material of hemp fibres -polypropylene being able for injection molding is developed under the trademark FORPOLEN "r"e"g"i"s"t"e"r"e"d HF. This material has an increased tensile strength and a reduced impact behavior. With respect to the injection moulding process of natural fibre reinforced granular materials, the tools and processing parameters have to be adapted individually. Furthermore, the thermal load of the fibre compound has to be reduced by use of low residence time. Because of the ability to sorb water, natural fibres require drying processes in all processing steps. The ecological advantages of injection <b>moulding</b> <b>products</b> of hemp fibre-polypropylene are based on photosynthetic advance and on their low mass. Hemp fibre products are more low-priced than glass fibre products.

40|$|Rotational {{moulding}} is {{a process}} {{with a range of}} unique benefits, currently experiencing significant growth within industry. A primary limitation of the process, however, is the restricted range of suitable materials and the subsequent limitations placed upon the mechanical performance of rotationally <b>moulded</b> <b>products.</b> The aim of this research project was to develop a rotational moulding material which possessed substantially improved mechanical properties over conventional, rotationally moulded polyethylene grades. This was attempted through the development of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composite which was amenable to the rotational moulding process. Although the development of rotationally moulded composites has been previously reported in literature, these materials have largely proven to be unsatisfactory in terms of mechanical performance. The composite material developed here is distinct from those previously reported in that it utilises melt-compounded composite granules of a significantly larger size than are normally considered suitable for rotational moulding. These granules are intended to be moulded as an inner layer within a rotationally <b>moulded</b> <b>product,</b> with the outer moulded layer formed from conventional, unfilled polymer powder. In this way, the average length of the fibres within the moulded article is maximised while retaining the benefits of the melt-compounding process and giving an excellent external moulded finish. In order to achieve a sufficient degree of composite granule flow and coalescence during rotational moulding, it was found necessary to base the composite granules on high melt-flow, injection moulding grades of polypropylene and polyethylene. The most successful of the resultant composite materials was shown to be superior to the previously utilised rotational moulding grade of unfilled, high-density polyethylene by approximately 65 % in offset yield strength (0. 5 % offset) and over 95 % in tensile modulus...|$|R

In 1945, he deduced the correct structure for stipitatic acid, a <b>mould</b> <b>product</b> whose structure had baffled the leading chemists of the day. It involved a new kind of aromatic structure with a seven-membered ring for which Dewar coined the term tropolone. The discovery of the tropolone structure launched the field of non-benzenoid aromaticity, which witnessed feverish activity for several decades and greatly expanded the chemists' understanding of cyclic Ï-electron systems. Also in 1945, Dewar devised the then novel notion of a Ï complex, which he proposed as an intermediate in the benzidine rearrangement. This offered the first correct rationalisation of the electronic structure of complexes of transition metals with alkenes, later known as the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model.|$|R
