5|$|International {{emergency}} <b>medicine</b> <b>is</b> a subspecialty {{of emergency}} medicine that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency <b>medicine</b> <b>is</b> better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency <b>medicine</b> <b>is</b> {{to provide additional}} training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
40|$|Substandard <b>medicines</b> <b>are</b> <b>medicines</b> {{which have}} failed to pass the quality {{measurements}} and standards set for them. 1 They should be distinguished from counterfeit (falsified) <b>medicines</b> which <b>are</b> deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled.

The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

40|$|<b>Medicines</b> <b>are</b> {{licensed}} for use {{in humans}} by regulatory authorities. The concept of licensing is that it helps ensure that <b>medicines</b> <b>are</b> safe, effective and of an adequate quality for regular use. 1 Licensing was introduced due to concerns about safety not to ensure that <b>medicines</b> <b>are</b> effective. It {{was a response to}} specific examples of drug toxicity, notably the grey baby syndrome in neonates following the use of the antibiotic chloramphenicol and phocomelia in the developing fetus following ingestion of thalidomide by pregnant women. 2 Within the UK, the <b>Medicines</b> Act <b>was</b> passed in 1968. The licensing of <b>medicines</b> <b>is</b> both a control on products of public interest as well as an authorisation to sell for pharmaceutical companies.

40|$|Background and objective: Unused {{medicines}} represent possible avoidable healthcare {{expenditures and}} threaten the environment. Decreasing medication waste is warranted and the redispensing of unused <b>medicines</b> might <b>be</b> {{an option to}} reduce this waste. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the proportion of returned <b>medicines</b> that <b>is</b> considered as medication waste, and the proportion of <b>medicines</b> that <b>is</b> eligible for redispensing. Setting and method: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 41 Dutch community pharmacies. Individuals returning medicines during five consecutive working days were asked to complete a questionnaire on characteristics of the medicine and reasons for returning. <b>Medicines</b> <b>were</b> considered as unnecessary waste if the leftover <b>medicines</b> could have <b>been</b> prevented. <b>Medicines</b> <b>were</b> defined as potentially eligible for redispensing if the package was unopened, undamaged and the expiry date was at least 6 months after the moment of returning. The economic value was calculated using Dutch medicine prices. Descriptive statistics were used. Main outcome measures: The proportion of returned <b>medicines</b> that <b>is</b> considered as medication waste and the proportion that met the criteria for redispensing. Results: Data from 279 persons returning 759 medicines to the community pharmacies was collected. On average, an individually returned medicine had a median value of € 1. 75. The tree most expensive <b>medicines</b> <b>were</b> methylphenidate 54 mg, € 180. 00, ketensin 20 mg, € 196. 56 and ondansetron 16 mg, € 482. 80. 300 (39. 5 %) returned <b>medicines</b> <b>were</b> considered as unnecessary waste. 145 medicines of all returned <b>medicines</b> could potentially <b>be</b> redispensed (19. 1 %), with a median value of € 4. 56 per individual returned medicine. Within the group of <b>medicines</b> that <b>were</b> eligible for redispensing, the main reason for returning the <b>medicine</b> <b>was</b> the decease of the patient (30. 3 %). Conclusion: A substantial proportion of medication waste in the community pharmacy could have <b>been</b> prevented. Unused <b>medicines</b> in the community pharmacy are generally of low economic value, making it unlikely that the costs that pharmacies will make with the redispensing of unused <b>medicines</b> will <b>be</b> covered. Therefore, other actions to decrease medication waste in the community pharmacy, such as preventing that too much <b>medicines</b> <b>are</b> dispensed, should be considered...|$|R
