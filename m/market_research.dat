40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the present state of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> in a developing nation, namely Malaysia, which has been exposed to <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> for more than three decades. A survey was conducted to elicit from the current users, information pertaining to the departmental organisations, <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> budgets, types of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> commissioned, and users' perception of the standard of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> in the country. The results have enabled a comparison between <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> practices in the subsidiaries of multinational corporations and locally-owned companies. The findings support the view that multinationals played a crucial role in the introduction of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> to Malaysia. The subsidiaries of MNCs still spend a significantly larger amount on <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> than the locally-owned companies. Overall, the Malaysian management is still learning to assimilate <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> even though a <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> industry has been established in the country for more than three decades. The Malaysian <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> users are somewhat uncertain of the services they are receiving; local users perceived the Malaysian <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> industry to be inferior in several important aspects than its counterpart in a developed nation...|$|R
