50|$|Buying and <b>merchandising</b> <b>team</b> {{structure}} {{will differ}} by the type, history, {{and size of}} the organization. The traditional structure of a team assigns a buying team and <b>merchandising</b> <b>team</b> to a specific product area, and there are controllers tasked with directing teams across various areas. Buying teams are further divided based on the product area (e.g., athletic wear, leather goods, etc.), organization division (e.g., men's wear).|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the visual}} <b>merchandising</b> <b>team</b> {{calculate}} that 20% of business-winning trade {{is from the}} windows. When Alannah Weston became Creative Director after the purchase by her family in 2003, she approached artist Alison Jackson to put her trademark Tony Blair and David Beckham lookalikes in the windows. The resultant display brought traffic to a standstill, with the Metropolitan Police finally insisting they stop the project because it was clogging up Oxford Street.|$|E
50|$|There is {{substantial}} {{confusion about the}} role of merchandisers, and much of this {{can be attributed to the}} loose manner in which the term is used by various industries. Merchandising in football refers to the range of goods sold to supporters by football clubs. Store managers at Zara will commonly refer to department layout reorganization as “re-merchandising.” In fashion retailing, the visual <b>merchandising</b> <b>team</b> has the responsibility of managing the aesthetics of store and window displays. It is a completely separate function from merchandising, and the two must not be confused.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{investigate}} the managerial challenges arising from the deployment of cross-company boundary-spanning teams to improve on-shelf availability. Design/methodology/approach - The study focuses on two supplier-employed <b>teams,</b> each <b>merchandising</b> their employers' timber-products within the stores of two leading, UK DIY retail groups. Non-participant observation and self-administered questionnaires were used {{to investigate}}, first, the association between reported merchandiser job satisfaction and various theoretical predictors (role ambiguity, role conflict, perceived organisational support and recognition) and, second, differences in role perceptions between the two teams and their (retail store) customer representatives. Findings - The study reveals differentiated perceptions of merchandising management practice within the UK DIY retail sector. Whilst perceived organisational recognition {{was found to be}} positively associated with merchandiser job satisfaction, {{there was a significant difference}} in the perception of organisational support reported by members of the two <b>merchandising</b> <b>teams.</b> Research limitations/implications - The small number of merchandisers within each team limits more complex statistical analyses and the identification of potential interaction effects of other variables: notably retail store size and format. Practical implications - The findings from these cases suggest that practitioners need to attend to the behavioural aspects of boundary-spanning, inter-organisational supply chain activities, such as the deployment of supplier-employed, in-store <b>merchandising</b> <b>teams,</b> if these practices are to be effective. Originality/value - The behavioural aspects of inter-organisational supply chain practice have received little research attention to date, despite their acknowledge importance. This paper starts to redress this imbalance...|$|R

50|$|In {{the world}} of sports, mascots are also used for <b>merchandising.</b> <b>Team</b> mascots are often {{confused}} with team nicknames. While the two can be interchangeable, they are not always the same. For example, the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide, while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al. Team mascots may {{take the form of}} a logo, person, live animal, inanimate object, or a costumed character, and often appear at team matches and other related events, sports mascots are often used as marketing tools for their teams to children. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies' mascot, the Phillie Phanatic.|$|E
50|$|Dollar Giant was {{incorporated}} in 2001 in Vancouver. On October, 11th, 2010, Dollar Tree announced its acquisition of Dollar Giant for $52 million. At {{the time of}} the acquisition, Dollar Giant had about 85 retail outlets in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. Approximately 30 of its retail locations are located in British Columbia, making it the largest dollar store chain in that province. It was Canada's fourth largest operator of dollar stores. Dollar Tree has since rebranded all of its Dollar Giant stores to Dollar Tree; these were the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree. The company now operates 227 stores across Canada, concentrated in Western Canada and Ontario. Its Canadian <b>merchandising</b> <b>team</b> is located at 205 Courtney Park Dr. West (Unit 105), Mississauga, ON, L52 0A5 while the corporate offices remain in Burnaby BC.|$|E

30|$|Certainly, {{effective}} postponement {{strategies are}} not made by one person. Not all processes and distribution activities can be postponed at any time or all the time. A tradeoff between the cost and benefit of postponement must be made. Some postponement may require extra storage facilities to keep unfinished products safe and clean. Some postponement may disrupt workload flows that may arise from shorter response times between demand forecasting and actual production/distribution activities. During this tradeoff analysis, discussion amongst the <b>merchandising</b> <b>team,</b> sourcing team, logistics team, and foreign suppliers must take place {{to arrive at the}} most efficient yet flexible supply chain to take advantage of fast-changing consumer demands.|$|E

5000|$|Winterland Ballroom (often {{referred}} to as Winterland Arena or simply Winterland) was an ice skating rink and music venue in San Francisco, California.

2500|$|Following {{the uniform}} change in 1997, the Buccaneers did not wear the old uniform, even during popular league-sponsored [...] "throwback" [...] weekends.

In 2008, the team {{revealed}} {{that they would be}} wearing orange throwback uniforms for at least one game in the 2009 season.

50|$|As part {{of their}} {{commitment}} to the Black Widows, each team member on the roster is expected to participate in fundraisers throughout the season.

The IWFL mandates that all players furnish their own league-approved uniforms and safety equipment. Players and coaches alike report that being personally invested in the welfare of the team enhances their experience by building camaraderie and fostering strong team bonds.|$|R
