The best preserved of these is the village of Borġ in-Nadur, close to the modern town of Birżebbuġa. Around 1450 BC, the inhabitants of the village built a 4.5m high D-shaped bastion to bar access to their village. The wall was built facing inland, showing that the people living in the village were <b>more</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> attacks from the land than from the sea.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was <b>more</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or laugh at macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell because they are <b>more</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume {{to join him in}} the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

500|$|Extraordinary {{events had}} {{recently}} transpired in England, with King Charles I executed, {{power in the}} hands of a commoner, and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans. The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright, the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, with whom Wheelwright had gone to college. Henry Vane, who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy, had also reached high positions in government. These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty, but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s. Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England. Wheelwright was well received by Cromwell, who once described his classmate this way: [...] "I remember the time when I was <b>more</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> meeting Wheelwright at football than I have been since of meeting an army in the field, for I was infallibly sure of being tripped up by him".

When the dignity and quality of her ailing mother's life was at stake, this book's unfolding tale became inevitable." [...] Even though Helen played a role in having her daughter committed to the University of Minnesota's Mayo wing, Kate had her mother removed from the nursing home and returned to her apartment, where attendants managed her care. During this period, Millett could also [...] "bully" [...] her mother for her lack of cultural sophistication and the amount of television she watched and could be harsh with caregivers.|$|E

[...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time.

500|$|The Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 {{provided}} for a 5:5:3 ratio of capital ships of the British, United States and Japanese navies. Throughout the 1920s, the Royal Navy remained the world's largest navy, with a comfortable margin of superiority over Japan, which {{was regarded as}} the most likely adversary. The Washington Naval Treaty also prohibited the fortification of islands in the Pacific, but Singapore was specifically excluded. The provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, however, restricted naval construction, resulting in a serious decline in the British shipbuilding industry. Germany's willingness to limit {{the size of its}} navy led to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935. This was seen as signalling a sincere desire to avoid conflict with Britain. In 1934, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield, began [...] to press for a new naval build-up sufficient to fight both Japan and the strongest European power. He intended to accelerate construction to the maximum capacity of the shipyards, but the Treasury soon became alarmed at the potential cost of the program, which was costed at between £88 and £104 million. By 1938, the Treasury was losing its fight to stop rearmament; politicians and the public were <b>more</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> being caught unprepared for war with Germany and Japan than of a major financial crisis in the more distant future.|$|E
500|$|Wise {{says that}} his {{contract}} with MGM specified that the picture could only be shot in black-and-white, which Wise preferred for this genre of film. He attempted to make Ettington Park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings, but this failed. Wise and Boulton then hit {{on the idea of}} using infrared film for establishing shots of the house. Infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to the location shoot from Belgium. The new film worked. Wise felt the infrared film brought out the [...] "striations of the stone" [...] and made the mansion look like [...] "more of a monster house". Wise very much wanted to make The Haunting a tribute to Val Lewton, the producer and writer under whom Wise had directed his first film (the supernatural horror picture Curse of the Cat People). Wise says that Lewton's theory of horror was that people were <b>more</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the unknown than things they could see. The decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in the picture's pre-production. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton also wanted to make distances in the film (such as hallways) look longer and darker than the audience would anticipate. Wise approached the Panavision company, and wanted an anamorphic, wide-angle lens. The only lens Panavision had was a 40mm. Wise learned that the company was working on a 30mm lens, but it contained distortions and was not ready. Wise kept pressing, and eventually Panavision turned over the 30mm lens on the condition that Wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect. Wise and Boulton also planned shots that kept the camera moving, utilised low-angle shots, and incorporated unusual pans and tracking shots. This led {{to some of the most}} active camera movements in Wise's film career. To accentuate the feeling that the house was alive, exterior shots were filmed so that the windows appeared to be eyes.|$|E

40|$|Background. Around 25 million Caucasian {{women are}} {{carriers}} of the FV Leiden mutation that causes activated protein C (APC) resistance. This is a heritable condition with a lifelong {{increased risk of}} venous thromboembolism. We performed this study to investigate women's reactions to their awareness of being APC-resistant {{and the consequences of}} this awareness. Methods. All APC-resistant women (n = 270) included in a prior study on APC resistance and pregnancy (n = 2480) were invited by written questionnaire to describe their reactions to having APC resistance, how this had changed their lives, and how they experienced our information. Answers were obtained from 215 of the 270 women (80 %). Results. More than 94 % of the APC-resistant women were satisfied with knowing themselves to be APC-resistant and pleased that they had enrolled in the study. Of the women on combined oral contraceptives (COC), 84 % changed their method of contraception, but 16 % continued on COC. One-third of the women reported becoming <b>more</b> worried or <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> getting pregnant again {{as a result of their}} awareness of being APC-resistant. The proportion of women who sought legal abortions during a 2 -year period after receiving this information was similar in both subgroups: 4. 4 % (12 / 270) vs. 4. 3 % (94 / 2210), p = 0. 9. Conclusions. We conclude that most APC-resistant women were pleased to learn of their APC resistance status, that there was not an increased incidence of legal abortions, but almost one-third reported being <b>more</b> worried or <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> getting pregnant again...|$|R
