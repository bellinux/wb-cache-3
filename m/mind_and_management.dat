While biomedicine inevitably {{plays a role in}} the reduction or control of some symptoms for people living with chronic pain, directed self-management is also increasingly recognized as an important tool. Self-management can address pain associated symptoms of CP and RA and often has broader aims, such as promoting positive well-being. Forty-six interviews with people experiencing CP and 46 interviews with those living with RA associated pain were analysed. Our analysis uncovered three broad strategies adopted by participants: body <b>management,</b> <b>mind</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> mind-body <b>management.</b> The analysis demonstrated that for those living with pain, a sense of well-being is achieved not through pain control alone, but also through various mind/body techniques for managing pain, accepting new limits, and adjusting the way people relate to themselves. These self management strategies are an important adjunct to biomedical care for those experiencing chronic pain...|$|R

Mrs. X, 35 years old, case {{of primary}} infertility, was {{diagnosed}} to have genital tuberculosis {{on the basis}} of PCR positive and hysterolaparoscopy findings and received category I ATT for 6 months. Following ATT completion, her USG revealed no evidence of tuboovarian mass or hydrosalpinx. Since her tubes were patent, she underwent 3 cycles of ovulation induction and 2 cycles of IUI. The women presented with acute PID, five days after IUI, and was conservatively managed. She again presented 24 days after IUI with persistent low grade fever and abdominal pain. Suspecting relapse of genital tuberculosis, she was started on category II ATT. She had acute episodes of high grade fever with chills 2 weeks after starting ATT and MRI revealed bilateral TO masses suggestive of pyosalpinx. Emergency laparotomy was done, pus was drained, and cyst wall was removed and HPE was suggestive of chronic inflammation with few granulation tissues.

By 1917 the SCECo operated 258 country elevators, a marketing company with a seat on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, and a terminal elevator at Port Arthur. Still, the Co-op was not a complete success. The farm movement had looked upon elevator reform as a panacea for handling, marketing, transportation and credit problems. Under the terms of its charter, however, the SCECo operated within the existing marketing system buying and selling grain to supplement its unprofitable storage and handling business. Moreover, the Company's commercially <b>minded</b> <b>and</b> centralised <b>management</b> refused to implement several non-marketing reforms desired by the farm movement.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the barriers to industrial energy efficiency, but few {{have focused on the}} most effective means (drivers) to promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices. In this respect, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have been completely overlooked despite interesting consequences for their overall energy consumption and their concurrent low levels of adoption of energy-efficiency measures. Starting from insights garnered from the extant literature on the drivers of industrial energy efficiency, this paper presents an empirical investigation of 71 Italian manufacturing SMEs through a multiple case-study approach. The research highlights the importance of allowances or public financing for energy efficiency interventions, as well as the importance of external pressures such as increases in energy prices and the introduction or increasing of fees on both resources consumed and on emissions of pollutants. Moreover, enterprises look favourably upon energy-efficient technologies which are able to provide long-term benefits, evidence of their willingness to adopt seemingly radical solutions when these are able to improve their long-term competitiveness. Other drivers considered as strategic for increasing energy efficiency are the presence within the company of people with great ambition <b>and</b> entrepreneurial <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> the <b>management</b> sensitivity to the issue. This paper also provides a preliminary analysis of how factors such as firm size, sector, supply chain complexity, and innovation characteristics are or might be able to significantly affect drivers toward the adoption of energy-efficient technologies...|$|R
