6000|$|When Tommy started impulsively on what {{proved to}} be his only Continental trip he had {{expected}} to join <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> and her stepdaughter at Bad-Platten. They {{had been there for}} a fortnight, and [...] "the place is a dream," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> had said in the letter pressing him to come; but it was at St. Gian that she met the diligence and told him to descend. Bad-Platten, she explained, was a horror.|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, the {{incident}} {{gave him some}} uneasy reflections. Was he, indeed, a monster? was one that he could dodge, as yet; but suppose <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> told his dear Elspeth of what had happened? She had {{said that she would}} not, but a secret in <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry's</b> breast was like her pug in her arms, always kicking to get free. [...] "Elspeth," [...] said Tommy, [...] "what do you say to going north and having a sight of Thrums again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They will {{be calling}} me the round gentleman," [...] Tommy said ruefully {{to her that}} evening, as he strolled with her towards the lake, and indeed he was looking stout. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> did not {{accompany}} them; {{she wanted to be}} seen with her trying stepdaughter as little as possible, and Tommy's had been the happy proposal that he should attend them alternately--"fling away my own figure to save yours," [...] he had said gallantly to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know! Please forgive me! I do {{remember}}, of course, who you are--I remember too well!" [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry,</b> generously.|$|R

60|$|After some {{delay and}} demur, the door grudgingly {{turned on its}} hinges a very little way, and allowed <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jerry</b> Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.|$|R
60|$|But, {{though he}} made the sound of laughter, that terrible face which <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> remembered so well, but could not give a name to, took no part in the revelry; he was as puzzling to her as those irritating authors who print their jokes without a note of exclamation {{at the end of}} them. Poor <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> thought it must be a laugh of horrid bitterness, and that he was {{referring}} to his dead self or something dreadful of that sort, for which she was responsible.|$|R
60|$|The {{place was}} St. Gian, some miles from Bad-Platten; {{but one of}} the {{umbrellas}} she had seen was Tommy's. Others belonged to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> and Lady Pippinworth.|$|R
60|$|It {{confused}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry.</b> They always confused {{her when}} they were fierce, and yet she liked them to be fierce when she re-met them, so few of them were.|$|R
60|$|Yes, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> knew it, and {{had often}} marvelled over {{it in the}} {{seclusion}} of her boudoir; but that another should have found it out was strange and almost terrifying.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say I am {{glad you}} have got over it," [...] murmured <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> again. Has it ever been noticed that the proper remark does not always gain in propriety with repetition? ...|$|R

60|$|They blackballed <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> (she {{was rather}} plump), but her married stepdaughter, Lady Pippinworth (who {{had been a}} Miss Ridge-Fulton), was one of them. Indeed, the Ridge-Fultons are among the {{thinnest}} families in the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you minded so much," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> said, {{a little}} tremulously (she had the softest heart, though her memory was a trifle defective), [...] "you might have {{discovered}} whether I had married him or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just that, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jerry.</b> That ain't {{my idea of}} a free country. I {{can work}} as well as another, but I ain't going to be told that I'm a swindler because I'm making the most of my time." ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry</b> pondered {{while she}} said: [...] "How too entrancing!" [...] What did come out this month? Oh, plays! And whose season was it? The actor's, of course! He {{could not be}} an actor with that beard, but--ah, she remembered now! ...|$|R
60|$|His {{guardian}} angel, however, {{was very}} good to Tommy at this time; or perhaps, like cannibals with their prisoner, the god of sentiment (who has a tail) was fattening him for a future feast; and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jerry's</b> answer was that it could never be.|$|R
