5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} {{by members of the}} Chicago school of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> exceptional circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Constructed between 1870 and 1875 to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> Semarang's growing Catholic population, the red-brick church {{building}} {{was designed by}} the Dutch architect W.

The church grew extensively over the following fifty years, at first dominated by ethnic Europeans and persons of mixed descent but later having a majority indigenous congregation. As the Catholic population grew, the size of the parish diminished as new ones were established.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E

5|$|Tristano is {{regarded}} as one of the first to teach jazz, particularly improvisation, in a structured way. He taught musicians irrespective of their instrument and structured lessons to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> each individual. Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length. He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that would allow them to find and express their own musical feelings, or style.|$|E
5|$|Waveguide filters were {{developed}} during World War II to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian {{applications such as}} use in microwave links. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators.|$|E

5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult {{by the end of the}} 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E
5|$|In May 1966, Imelda {{pushed through}} with campaigning for social welfare. Her {{plan was to}} pool {{together}} all the social welfare efforts of several dozen social welfare groups. Imelda wanted to build welfare villages to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> children with problems, and reorient a personnel to staff the villages. The scheme called for 12 million pesos. In November 1966, the cornerstone for the Reception and Study Center in Quezon City was laid. Until 1968, other villages were built: Marilla Hills in Alabang, the Children's Orphanage in Pasay City, the Molave Village in Tanay, a Home for the Aged in Quezon City, and the Philippine Village at the Manila International Airport.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} 1997 Master Plan for the area, {{plans for the}} Fort Canning Tunnel remained unchanged {{and it was not}} explicitly stated in the report that the National Library building would be demolished.

It was planned to reopen on 1 Oct, with its facilities upgraded, with new computers, and its collection updated with 80,000 volumes added. Actual renovations took nine months and the library was officially reopened on 16 January 1998.|$|E

In order to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge.|$|E

Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Literary Theatre project {{lasted until}} 1901, when it {{collapsed}} owing {{to lack of}} funding. In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, John Millington Synge, Æ, Annie Horniman and William and Frank Fay came together to form the Irish National Theatre Society. The first performances staged by the society {{took place in a}} building called the Molesworth Hall. When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the society.|$|E

The College has steadily expanded since it opened in the 1940s to serve the Somerset coalfields. As a Community College, it has expanded its range of vocational programmes, and has become an established part of the community. The college works with local employers to provide training programmes that <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> both employers and employees. This ranges from short skills workshops, through to NVQs, BTEC, Higher National Diplomas and apprenticeships.|$|E

5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able {{to jump out of}} the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
5|$|Agusta and Westland {{finalised}} {{an agreement}} {{to work on the}} project together, and formed a jointly owned new company, EH Industries Limited (EHI), to pursue the development and marketing of the new helicopter to potential operators. On 12 June 1981, the UK government confirmed its participation in the project, allocated an initial budget of £20 million to develop nine pre-series examples. A major agreement, which secured funding {{for the majority of the}} EH101's development program, was signed by both the British and Italian governments in 1984. At the 1985 Paris Air Show, Agusta showed a mock-up of a utility version of the new helicopter, leading to a more generalised design that could be customised to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> various civilian or military customers. The first prototype flew on 9 October 1987.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the armed forces.|$|E
