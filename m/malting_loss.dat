The physical features of the kernels that were determined included the endosperm texture, endosperm type and kernel size. Also determined were the germination energy and germination capacity. To monitor the malting properties, the <b>malting</b> <b>loss,</b> hot water extract, cold-water extract and diastatic power were determined. The effect of duration of germination on the root and shoot lengths of kernels was also investigated. Two of the cultivars were floury while the other cultivars were corneous. All the cultivars were non-waxy. The mean percentage values of the germination energy and germination capacity were 84. 92 % and 91. 75 % respectively. As the germination period increased, root and shoot lengths of all the twelve cultivars also increased. The greatest change in the root and shoot lengths was observed between the second and third day of the germination period. The <b>malting</b> <b>loss</b> increased with the germination period and ranged between 15. 5 - 33. 0 %.

Results obtained with chemical treatments [diluted alkalines: NaOH 0. 2 % (T 1) and Ca(OH) 2 0. 1 % (T 2) ] were {{compared with those of}} biocontrols [use of Bacillus subtilis S 499 108 cells / mL: supernatant + cells (T 3), cells (T 4) and cells-free supernatant (T 5) ]. Chemical treatments have shown the highest fungal contamination levels, the highest <b>malting</b> <b>loss,</b> but better enzyme activities (α and β-amylases, limit-dextrinase, α-glucosidase and β-glucanase). The inhibition tests showed that the concentration of lipopeptides is correlated with the reduction of moulds growth. Malting trials with starters of Bacillus subtilis S 499 showed that culture dilution affects the growth of moulds during red sorghum malting. The combination of a chemical treatment such as diluted NaOH with a biocontrol could be used to improve sorghum malts quality in terms of different enzymes activities and by reducing the level of fungal contamination.

GwirtzThere is {{a limited}} market of {{gluten-free}} beer for the 1 % of the US population that is diagnosed with an autoimmune response to gluten protein known as celiac disease. Sorghum can be malted and used in the brewing process to replace malted barley, a grain toxic to celiac patients. The objective {{of the study was}} to develop an optimum brewing procedure for a gluten-free ale-style beer. Four different sorghum hybrids (82 G 63, 83 G 66, RN 315, and X 303) were malted and used in brewing gluten-free ale and evaluated for physical and chemical property differences. The four sorghum hybrids were characterized first as grain and then as malt using proximate analysis, single kernel characterization system (SKCS), amylose, α-amylase, and β-amylase contents. Isolated starch from unmalted and malted samples was evaluated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Malt was evaluated throughout the malting process and percent nitrogen, percent moisture, 72 hr germinative energy, steep out moisture, germination-end, and <b>malting</b> <b>loss</b> were measured. Malted sorghum hybrid samples were milled into grist, and employed in a double mash, double decoction brewing process. Following the brewing process the wort was evaluated for specific gravity, Brix, pH, color and free α-amino nitrogen (FAN). Wort was also analyzed using HPLC for ethanol and glucose content. The fermented beer was analyzed for specific gravity, Brix, pH, alcohol by volume, and color. HPLC was also used to measure ethanol and glucose content. Results of analysis found that a significant difference (p= 0. 05) was found for the DSC data onset temperature, which ranged from 61. 75 to 65. 51, illustrating the difference in starch gelatinization temperature compared to other cereals. A significant difference was found in α-amylase content (p= 0. 05) which ranged from 0. 16 to 058 in unmalted sorghum and 71. 63 to 96. 44 in malted sorghum. In addition, α-amylase and β-amylase contents increased during malting. HPLC analysis of wort indicated a significant difference was found in percent maltose which ranged from 1. 27 to 2. 81. FAN content of wort was also significantly different and ranged from 65. 15 to 151. 37. HPLC of beer showed a significant difference in percent ethanol and percent glucose. Percent ethanol in the final beer ranged from 3. 28 to 4. 17 and percent glucose range from 0. 16 to 0. 31.

40|$|Sorghum and maize grain {{hardness}} is a {{very important}} criterion as grain hardness affects milling yield and product quality. There are several techniques that are used to determine grain hardness but the relationship between these techniques for distinguishing hardness in commercial sorghum and maize cultivars is not known. Moreover, the role of sorghum grain hardness with respect to malting performance is not understood, as is the role of phenolics in sorghum and maize hardness. Therefore this study investigated the relationships between sorghum and maize hardness techniques, and the influence of sorghum grain modification during malting and sorghum and maize phenolics on the hardness of these cereals. A study to determine the relationships between techniques used to measure hardness in commercial sorghum and maize cultivars was done in terms of decortication using the Tangential Abrasive Dehulling Device (TADD) (percentage kernel removed), Near Infrared Transmittance (NIT) Milling Index (MI), test weight (TW), thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel size (KS), stress cracking (SC) and susceptibility to breakage (SB). It was found that not all grain quality techniques were related to each other. In non-tannin sorghum, TADD hardness, TW, TKW and kernel size > 3. 35 mm were correlated and can be used to select for hardness. In maize, TADD hardness, NIT Milling Index and TW would be suitable for hardness evaluation. The influence of malting on sorghum hardness was monitored for a period of five days following steeping. The results showed that hardness parameters including pycnometer density, floaters, TADD hardness, TKW, Single Kernel Characterisation System-Hardness Index (SKCS-HI) reduced drastically by Day 2 of malting. TADD hardness was not correlated with Diastatic Power (DP), which could be attributed to inefficient decortication due to the softening of the grain outer layers, reduced dry matter (<b>malting</b> <b>loss),</b> loss of kernel orientation and endosperm collapse during endosperm modification. However, sorghum with high DP corresponded with low values of the measured hardness parameters. Thus, in sorghum with high DP amylases accessed the starchy endosperm faster, hence the decrease in hardness. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that modification was influenced by amylase activity and cultivars with low amylase modified slower than those with high amylase. Hence, amylase activity was more influential in malt hardness than original grain hardness. The phenolic acids in sorghum and maize bran and flour fractions were determined using HPLC-MS/MS. The phenolic acid content of the grain fractions was correlated with the grain hardness values. Maize bran ferulic acid content was more strongly correlated with TADD hardness but with sorghum, the relationship was weaker. Using HPLC-MS/MS, four diferulic acids were identified in sorghum and maize bran namely 8 - 5 ', 5 - 5 ', 8 -O- 4 ' and 8 - 5 '- benzofuran form in quantities at least seven times less than ferulic acid. However, there was no correlation found between diferulic acids and hardness properties of both cereals. This study shows that TADD hardness and TW are an excellent way of estimating both sorghum and maize hardness that can be applied for cultivar evaluation. The study indicates that two days of malting would be sufficient to obtain malt suitable for milling. Ferulic acid of maize and sorghum bran seems to influence grain hardness of these cereals probably through cross-linking to arabinoxylan chains in the pericarp, hence reinforcing cell wall strength.

40|$|In the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso, {{grain sorghum}} [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] {{is the major}} cereal crop used to produce the {{traditional}} beer called dolo. Grain sorghum grain samples collected in 2004 and 2005 from experiments combining five water management techniques and four fertilizer treatments in a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement of treatments were analyzed for the physicochemical properties of raw grain, and quality of malted grain. Water management techniques were allocated to main plots and fertilizer treatments to subplots. The objective {{was to determine the}} best combination of water management technique and fertilizer treatment to optimize grain quality of the red grain sorghum varieties IRAT 9 and ICSV 1001 (Framida) for dolo production. Results showed that the grain physicochemical properties and malt quality of the two varieties were influenced by both water management technique and fertilizer treatment. Pearson correlations indicated that grain yield was rarely correlated with the physicochemical properties of raw grain and malt quality parameters. Diastatic power was positively correlated with protein concentration and <b>malting</b> <b>losses,</b> but negatively with tannin concentration. Based upon results, recommendation for the production of sorghum grain and malt with the needed characteristics for high dolo quality would be the use of water management techniques that sufficiently improve soil water conditions in combination with a microdose + 20 kg P ha- 1 + 30 kg N ha- 1 fertilizer application that provides sufficient nutrients and particularly nitrogen to the crop...|$|R
40|$|Antifungal {{compounds}} {{produced by}} Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) metabolites can be natural and reliable alternative for reducing fungal infections pre- and post-harvest with {{a multitude of}} additional advantages for cereal-base products. Toxigenic and spoilage fungi are responsible for numerous diseases and economic losses. This thesis includes {{an overview of the}} impact fungi have on aspects of the cereal food chain. The applicability of LAB in plant protection and cereal industry is discussed in detail. Specific case studies include Fusarium head blight, and the impact of fungi in the malting and baking industry. The impact of Fusarium culmorum infected raw barley on the final malt quality was part of the investigation. In vitro infected barley grains were fully characterized. The study showed that the germinative energy of infected barley grains decreased by 45 % and grains accumulated 199 μg. kg- 1 of deoxynivalenol (DON). Barley grains were subsequently malted and fully characterized. Fungal biomass increased during all stages of malting. Infected malt accumulated 8 -times its DON concentration during malting. Infected malt grains revealed extreme structural changes due to proteolytic, (hemi) -cellulolytic and starch degrading activity of the fungi, this led to increased friability and fragmentation. Infected grains also had higher protease and β-glucanase activities, lower amylase activity, a greater proportion of free amino and soluble nitrogen, and a lower β-glucan content. <b>Malt</b> <b>loss</b> was over 27 % higher in infected malt when compared to the control. The protein compositional changes and respective enzymatic activity of infected barley and respective malt were characterized using a wide range of methods. F. culmorum infected barley grains showed an increase in proteolytic activity and protein extractability. Several metabolic proteins decreased and increased at different rates during infection and malting, showing a complex F. culmorum infection interdependence. In vitro F. culmorum infected malt was used to produce lager beer to investigate changes caused by the fungi during the brewing processes and their effect on beer quality attributes. It was found, that the wort containing infected malt had a lower pH, a higher FAN, higher β-glucan and a 45 % increase in the purging rate, and led to premature yeast flocculation. The beer produced with infected malt (IB) had also a significantly different amino acid profile. IB flavour characterization revealed a higher concentration of esters, fusel alcohols, fatty acids, ketones, and dimethylsulfide, and in particular, acetaldehyde, when compared to the control. IB had a greater proportion of Strecker aldehydes and Maillard products contributing to an increased beer staling character. IB resulted in a 67 % darker colour with a trend to better foam stability. It was also found that 78 % of the accumulated mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in the malt was transferred into beer. A LAB cell-freesupernatant (cfs), produced in wort-base substrate, was investigated for its ability to inhibit Fusarium growth during malting. Wort was a suitable substrate for LAB exhibiting antifungal activity. Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 inhibited 104 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 120 h of fermentation, while Lactobacillus reuteri R 29 inhibited 105 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 48 h of fermentation. Both LAB cfs had significant different organic acid profiles. Acid-base antifungal compounds were identified and, phenyllactic, hydroxy-phenyllactic, and benzoic acids were present in higher concentrations when compared to the control. A 3 °P wort substrate inoculated With L. reuteri R 29 (cfs) was applied in malting and successfully inhibited Fusarium growth by 23 %, and mycotoxin DON by 80 %. Malt attributes resulted in highly modified grains, lower pH, higher colouration, and higher extract yield. The implementation of selected LAB producing antifungal compounds can be used successfully in the malting process to reduce mould growth and mycotoxin production...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Malting characteristics of sixteen sorghum varieties were investigated using a standard malting procedure. Clean grain was placed in nylon bags, steeped for 20 h, treated with 2 % sodium hypochlorite, and washed. Germination proceeded at 28 'C and 95 % relative humidity (RH) for 5 days. The wet malt was dried at 50 'C for 24 h. Total dry matter loss ranged from 8 - 19 %. Black Tx 430 had the highest losses. Density decreased for all the sorghums after malting; the extent of decrease was cultivar dependent. The (X- and P-amylase activity in sorghum malts produced (x- amylase levels ranging between 25 - 183 U/g. Black Tx 430 (183 U/g) and RTx 435 (178 U/g) had the highest values. Commercial barley malt had an (X-amylase activity of 189 U/g. P-Amylase activity was low for all cultivars, ranging from 11 to 41 U/g, with BTx 2752 and IS 9530 having the highest values. Decrease in RVA viscosity was significantly correlated with the (x-amylase calorimetric assay (r= 0. 97). The RVA is a promising method to measure (X-amylase activity; it is simple, fast, and requires minimum chemicals. Sorghum diastatic power (SDU) was not significantly correlated to (x-amylase activity at SDU values below 30. Above 30 SDU, (x- amylase activity was significantly correlated to diastatic power. Dry matter loss was significantly correlated to (Alpha-amylase activity and SDU. The green malt moisture was significantly positively correlated to dry matter <b>loss.</b> <b>Malts</b> produced from College Station cultivars gave higher (X-amylase levels than those from Lubbock. P-Amylase activities ranged from 28 - 33 U/g in the malts regardless of growth location. A second malting procedure using jars for steeping and germination was applied to 6 cultivars, and resulted in lower dry matter losses and 0 -amylase activity. Although (x-amylase levels were generally higher for the standard method, cultivars responded differently. Each cultivar may need optimum conditions to obtain the highest level of enzyme activity. Malting procedures require further control to obtain desired enzymatic levels with the least possible dry matter loss...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B 12 is an {{essential}} macromolecule in mammal metabolism. However, it can be detected in sufficient amount only in animal-derived foods. This fact exposes vegetarians and vegans to vitamin B 12 deficiency. Therefore {{the need to develop}} plant-based food rich in vitamin B 12 is high. However, {{it is important to know}} the stability of both supplemented vitamin B 12 forms and naturally produced vitamin B 12, during the different food processes. Many attempts have been done during the last decades in order to produce vitamin B 12 - fortified plant-based products, whose main aim was to replace vitamin B 12 supplements, in accordance with the increasing demands of natural and healthy products. This study aimed to investigate the stability of vitamin B 12 during different bread-making processes, Firstly adding standard solutions, and subsequently mixing the natural vitamin B 12 produced by the fermentation of a selected strain of Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii. Firstly, the stability of di_erent forms of vitamin B 12 (methylcobalamin (Me-Cbl), 5 _ -deoxyadenosylcobalamin (Ado-Cbl), cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) and hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl) after different times of exposure to light was investigated. While Me-Cbl and Ado-Cbl stability was tested only in water, CN-Cbl and OH-Cbl tests were performed at different pH conditions (pH 2. 5, 4. 5, 7. 0, water). Furthermore, the stability of CN-Cbl and OH-Cbl was studied during three different bread-making methods: straight-dough, sponge-dough and sourdough. Finally, a malt extract medium fermented by a selected strain of P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii was used in the straight-dough baking. The vitamin B 12 was quantified by a microbiological assay (MBA) and the ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Ado-Cbl and the Me-Cbl were extremely photolable and they converted entirely into OH-Cbl within 30 min, while both CN-Cbl and OH-Cbl showed a greater stability under light depending on the pH conditions: the CN-Cbl was more photo-sensitive at low pHs, while the OH-Cbl was more unstable at higher pHs. In addition, one unidentified peak was observed in the chromatogram originated from OH-Cbl and CN-Cbl due to the exposure to light. The proofing steps had not effect on the loss of supplemented OHCbl and CN-Cbl in straight- and sponge-doughs. Instead, they were lost during the baking in the oven, where the loss of OH-Cbl was higher than CN-Cbl. In straight-dough and sponge-dough processes, the loss of OH-Cbl was 15 % and 32 %, and the loss of CN-Cbl 6 % and 7 %, respectively. The sourdough method caused the highest destruction. During the baking, OH-Cbl and CN-Cbl losses were 57 % and 42 %, respectively. In straight-dough baking with the fermented <b>malt</b> extract, the <b>loss</b> of naturally produced vitamin B 12 was on average 29 ± 12 % obtained with the MBA. By contrast, results analysed with the UHPLC methods showed no loss, and vitamin B 12 content in baked breads was still considerable, on average 106 ng/g dm. This difference between the results may indicate about inactive B 12 forms produced by the selected strain of P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii and also high stability of vitamin B 12 produced by such bacterium. Generally, the supplementation of OH-Cbl and CN-Cbl did not effect on appearance and taste of breads. However, the specific volume of the breads baked with fermented malt extract was slightly lower than control breads. Producing a vitamin B 12 -fortified bread using fermented malt extract, as presented in this study, is possible and may represent a great opportunity for vegetarian and vegan people. However, further studies are needed, e. g., to clarify the effects of the compounds in the fermented media on the yeast growth, as well as the determination and the quantification of the inactive corrinoids produced by such bacteria during the fermentation step...|$|R
