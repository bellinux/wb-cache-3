5|$|The {{station has}} three ticket halls: {{one for the}} Circle and District lines above the {{platforms}} of the sub-surface station, one below ground for the Bakerloo line station and one under the <b>mainline</b> station. The sub-surface station and the deep-level station ticket halls are linked via the ticket hall under the <b>mainline</b> station, but not to each other directly. Entrances are on Praed Street and from within the <b>mainline</b> station. On the tube map the station is shown jointly with the other separate Underground station and passenger usage data for both is combined. Interchange with the other station is through the <b>mainline</b> station concourse without extra charge if the change is made within the permitted time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1936, the US27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The <b>mainline</b> was {{restricted}} to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and <b>mainline</b> US27/M-78 was rerouted {{to use it to}} connect to Larch Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Sixteen major rail {{corridors}} {{consisting of}} eight running north–south, called verticals, eight running east–west, called horizontals, connect 81 major cities. [...] The 16 <b>mainlines</b> were designated in January 2001, when some [...] {{of the lines}} were still unbuilt. [...] At that time, the existing <b>mainlines</b> accounted 43% of the railroads in the country but carried 80% of the passengers.

The plan would be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909.|$|E

Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked and interchange between them is via the concourse of the <b>mainline</b> station.|$|E

This proposal was cancelled on December 1, 2006, after the New Jersey Turnpike Authority decided to use funds to widen the <b>mainline</b> turnpike instead.|$|E

5|$|As {{it existed}} before the {{designation}} was removed, M-114 {{started at the}} corner of BYP US16 (28th Street) and what is now East Beltline Avenue in Paris Township (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the <b>mainline</b> for US16/M-50 at Cascade Road and the <b>mainline</b> for M-21 at Fulton Street near East Grand Rapids in Grand Rapids Township. Further north, the highway split into two. In Plainfield Township, a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3Mile Road through an intersection with US131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the Grand River and the other leg continued north to a terminus with US131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.|$|E

5|$|Eleven of {{the class}} have survived into {{preservation}} thanks to the high workload of Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, which found it easier and more commercially lucrative to scrap railway wagons, keeping the more technical steam locomotives for a downturn in workload. Five of the surviving Merchant Navy's have run in preservation, these being: 35005, 35006, 35018, 35027 & 35028. Three of them have even run on the <b>mainline</b> at some points in preservation: 35005 Canadian Pacific, 35018 British India Line and 35028 Clan Line, Both 35018 and 35028 are currently <b>mainline</b> certified.|$|E

5|$|In November 1899, the BS {{announced}} {{a bill for}} the 1900 session. Again, an extension was proposed from Marylebone to Paddington, this time terminating {{to the east of}} the <b>mainline</b> station at the junction of Bishop's Road (now Bishop's Bridge Road) and Gloucester Terrace. A station was planned under Bishop's Road, linked to the <b>mainline</b> station by a subway under Eastbourne Terrace. From Waterloo, an extension was planned to run under Westminster Bridge Road and St George's Road to terminate at Elephant and Castle. The BS would connect there with the C's station as the NC planned two years earlier. A spur was to be provided to a depot and power station that were to be constructed {{on the site of the}} School for the Indigent Blind south of St George's Circus.|$|E
