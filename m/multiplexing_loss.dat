40|$|Chromosome 18 q allelic loss {{has been}} {{reported}} to have prognostic significance in stage II colorectal carcinoma. We have developed a fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay to analyze five microsatellite markers (D 18 S 55, D 18 S 58, D 18 S 61, D 18 S 64, and D 18 S 69) for allelic loss at the long arm of chromosome 18. Amplicon detection and evaluation was accomplished by capillary electrophoresis using an ABI 310 genetic analyzer. Robustness of the assay when performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections was confirmed by analyzing its repeatability and reproducibility. Allelic loss was assessed in 61 stage II colorectal tumors and was detected in 58 % (31 of 53) of tumors not showing instability. As part of the study, results of 207 previous polymerase chain reaction/polyacrylamide-based assays were re-evaluated by two independent observers to determine the degree of concordance of visual evaluation. In the case of stage II colorectal tumors, when electropherogram results were compared with those obtained from visual evaluation of the same markers after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, discrepancies between observers were detected in 16. 4 % of determinations.

40|$|In a multi-relay system, the {{instantaneous}} channel {{state information}} (CSI) is usually required at relays {{to achieve the}} space diversity. In this paper, we propose a delayed noncoherent relaying scheme to achieve space diversity without requiring knowledge of the instantaneous CSI at the relays. Specifically, each relay will non-coherently amplify and forward its received signals with different delays such that a virtual multipath channel is created between the source and destination. We will first determine {{the most efficient way}} to achieve the optimal diversity gain. We will then show that, with spreading or coding, the proposed non-coherent relaying can provide the same diversity order as its coherent counterpart but with a noncoherent penalty. With the simplest spreading scheme, the noncoherent penalty results in a <b>loss</b> of both <b>multiplexing</b> gain and finite-SNR diversity gain.

For this configuration, an incremental transmission scheme is proposed, and comprehensively analyzed, which uses limited feedback to improve both diversity as well as multiplexing gain. Then, the case without a direct link is considered, for which efficient non-orthogonal DF protocols are produced and analyzed. An interesting feature of the latter methods is unequal error protection capability via a family of embedded diversity-multiplexing (DMT) curves, which can be very useful for practical applications.

40|$|We {{consider}} a simple network {{consisting of a}} source, a half-duplex DF relay with a buffer, and a destination. We assume that the direct source-destination link is not available and all links undergo fading. We propose two new buffer-aided relaying schemes. In the first scheme, neither the source nor the relay have CSIT, and consequently, both nodes are forced to transmit with fixed rates. In contrast, in the second scheme, the source does not have CSIT and transmits with fixed rate but the relay has CSIT and adapts its transmission rate accordingly. In the absence of delay constraints, for both fixed rate and mixed rate transmission, we derive the throughput-optimal buffer-aided relaying protocols which select either the source or the relay for transmission based on the instantaneous SNRs of the source-relay and the relay-destination links. In addition, for the delay constrained case, we develop buffer-aided relaying protocols that achieve a predefined average delay. Compared to conventional relaying protocols, which select the transmitting node according to a predefined schedule independent of the link instantaneous SNRs, the proposed buffer-aided protocols with adaptive link selection achieve large performance gains. In particular, for fixed rate transmission, we show that the proposed protocol achieves a diversity gain of two as long as an average delay of more than three time slots can be afforded. Furthermore, for mixed rate transmission with an average delay of $E{T}$ time slots, a multiplexing gain of $r= 1 - 1 /(2 E{T}) $ is achieved. Hence, for mixed rate transmission, for sufficiently large average delays, buffer-aided half-duplex relaying with and without adaptive link selection does not suffer from a <b>multiplexing</b> gain <b>loss</b> compared to full-duplex relaying.

40|$|Abstract—The van der Waals (vdW) {{dispersion}} forces represent one of {{the fundamental}} long range inter-facial and surface forces in materials. The dispersion forces, for a set of materials in close proximity, arise from the electronic structure of the materials wherein the electrons in interatomic bonds acting as oscillat-ing dipoles exhibit an attractive interaction energy. These vdW dispersion forces, represented by a propor-tionality constant, the full spectral Hamaker constant (A), can be calculated directly from optical property based electronic structure spectra such as the interband transition strength (Jcv) using the Lifshitz theory. Si 3 N 4 exhibits equilibrium intergranular films (IGFs) whose thickness is determined by a force balance where the contribution of the van der Waals dispersion force is dictated by the IGF chemistry. Using spatially resolved-valence electron energy loss (SR-VEEL) spectroscopy in the STEM with a 0. 6 nm probe permits the in situ determination of vdW forces on the IGFs in viscous sintered polycrystalline systems. In addition local variations in IGF chemistry and dispersion forces throughout the microstructure of individ-ual silicon nitride samples can be determined using these methods. From <b>multiplexed</b> zero loss/plasmon <b>loss</b> optimized SR-VEEL spectra across IGFs with subsequent single scattering deconvolution, Kramers Kronig analysis and London dispersion analysis, the index of refraction and Hamaker constants can be determined.

40|$|This thesis studies some {{fundamental}} aspects of wireless systems with partial channel state {{information at the}} transmitter (CSIT), with a special emphasis on the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The first contribution is a study on multi-layer variable-rate communication systems with quantized feedback, where the expected rate is chosen as the performance measure. Iterative algorithms exploiting results {{in the literature of}} parallel broadcast channels are developed to design the system parameters. Necessary and sufficient conditions for single-layer coding to be optimal are derived. In contrast to the ergodic case, it is shown that a few bits of feedback information can improve the expected rate dramatically. The next part of the thesis is devoted to characterizing the tradeoff between diversity and multiplexing gains (D-M tradeoff) over slow fading channels with partial CSIT. In the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case, we introduce the concept of minimum guaranteed multiplexing gain in the forward link and show that it influences the D-M tradeoff significantly. It is demonstrated that power control based on the feedback is instrumental in achieving the D-M tradeoff, and that rate adaptation is important in obtaining a high diversity gain even at high rates. Extending the D-M tradeoff analysis to decode-and-forward relay channels with quantized channel state feedback, we consider several different scenarios. In the relay-to-source feedback case, it is found that using just one bit of feedback to control the source transmit power is sufficient to achieve the multiantenna upper bound in a range of multiplexing gains. In the destination-to-source-and-relay feedback scenario, if the source-relay channel gain is unknown to the feedback quantizer at the destination, the diversity gain only grows linearly in the number of feedback levels, in sharp contrast to an exponential growth for MIMO channels. We also consider the achievable D-M tradeoff of a relay network with the compress-and-forward protocol when the relay is constrained to make use of standard source coding. Under a short-term power constraint at the relay, using source coding without side information results in a significant loss in terms of the D-M tradeoff. For a range of <b>multiplexing</b> gains, this <b>loss</b> can be fully compensated for by using power control at the relay. The final part of the thesis deals with the transmission of an analog Gaussian source over quasi-static fading channels with limited CSIT, taking the SNR exponent of the end-to-end average distortion as performance measure. Building upon results from the D-M tradeoff analysis, we develop novel upper bounds on the distortion exponents achieved with partial CSIT. We show that in order to achieve the optimal scaling, the CSIT feedback resolution must grow logarithmically with the bandwidth ratio for MIMO channels. The achievable distortion exponent of some hybrid schemes with heavily quantized feedback is also derived. As for the half-duplex fading relay channel, combining a simple feedback scheme with separate source and channel coding outperforms the best known no-feedback strategies even with only a few bits of feedback information.

30|$|Another way to {{overcome}} the spectral inefficiency of the HD cooperative schemes is through cooperative FD relaying, which does not suffer from <b>multiplexing</b> <b>loss</b> and can achieve a higher capacity than HD cooperative protocols [16]. Probably the most known FD schemes are multi-hop (FD-MH) and block Markov encoding (FD-BM). The FD-MH scheme is the simplest relaying technique, while FD-BM is the best known performance achieving FD method. However, FD-BM is quite complex to be implemented in practice. Moreover, perfect isolation (ideal) between transmitted and received signals is often not possible. In practice, isolating the transmitted and received signals is not straightforward, once the transmitted power is normally {{much larger than the}} received power [16]. Therefore, practical FD schemes have been proposed in which it is considered that there is a power leakage between transmitted and received signals, also known as loop interference or self-interference [20 – 22]. For instance, Riihonen et al. [20] show that practical FD-MH is feasible even if the relay faces strong self-interference. Moreover, it is also shown that FD-MH relaying enhances capacity when compared to the HD scheme. In addition, similar conclusions were obtained in [21 – 24]. In [25], a practical FD system is proposed and the authors show that the self-interference can be attenuated by more than 39 dBs through transmit and receive antenna separation.|$|E

Taking {{into account the}} practical limitations of UE relays, {{as well as the}} general open-loop relaying operation of these devices, the combination of group-wise STC with directional beamforming was exploited in a cooperative manner. The results showed that beamforming at either stage can strongly enhance the performance of the multi-functional transmission, but a suitable selection of the relays is necessary to guarantee the least possible mismatch between the DOA from BS to relays and the DOA from BS to destination. The combination of beamforming with group-wise STC is especially useful when there is a different number of available antennas at the BS and at the relays. However, including beamforming at the relays is only beneficial when the relays are closer to the BS than to the destination. On the contrary, when the relays approach the destination, the quality of the link between BS and relays is the limiting factor and the extra complexity to carry out beamforming becomes useless. By comparing a scheme only based on group-wise STC with a scheme combining group-wise STC and beamforming, it was shown that beamforming can compensate the <b>multiplexing</b> <b>loss</b> at low transmission rates. However, when the constellation sizes are increased, a multi-functional scheme only based on group-wise STC is more advantageous. Finally, the relayed transmission of a multi-functional scheme based on group-wise STC was compared with the relayed transmission of a QOSTBC jointly designed for the same total number of transmit antennas, where the QOSTBC was considered as the baseline STC setup for four antennas. At high transmission rates, it was observed that group-wise STC is more advantageous than joint STC (i.e. QOSTBC).|$|E

The signal forwarding and interference forwarding relaying paradigms are considered with the direct transmission cellular network taken as the baseline. This investigation serves to understand the dynamics in the performance trade-o. To select a suitable balance point in the trade-o, the economic e ciency metric is proposed whereby the spectral-energy e ciency pair which maximises the economic pro tability is found. Thus, the economic e ciency metric can be utilised as an alternative means to optimise the relay-aided cellular network while taking into account the inherent spectral-energy e ciency trade-o. Finally, the method of mitigating interference in the relay-aided cellular network is demonstrated by means of the proposed relay cooperation scheme. In the proposed scheme, both joint RS decoding and independent RS decoding approaches are considered during the broadcast phase while joint relay transmission is employed in the relay phase. Two user selection schemes requiring global Channel State Information (CSI) are considered. The partial semi-orthogonal user selection method with reduced CSI requirement is then proposed. As the cooperative cost limits the practicality of cooperative schemes, the cost incurred at the cooperative links between the RSs is investigated for varying degrees of RS cooperation. The performance of the relay cooperation scheme with di erent relay frequency reuse patterns is considered as well. In a nutshell, the research presented in this thesis reveals the impact of the receiver on the BS total power consumption in direct transmission cellular networks. The relayaided cellular network is then presented as an alternative architecture for energy e cient transmission. The economic e ciency metric is proposed to maximise the economic pro tability of the relay network while taking into account the existing spectral-energy e ciency trade-o. To mitigate the interference from the RSs, the relay cooperation scheme for advanced relay-aided cellular networks is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{deliverable}} provides comprehensive {{analytical and}} simulation {{results of the}} coding/decoding algorithms used in RESCUE. The algorithms are applied to various frameworks and investigated the applicability in selected cases. We also address the impact of lossy forwarding (LF) relaying in fading channels and specifically consider the evaluation of frame error rates (FERs) in comparison with lossless decode-andforward (DF). Moreover, the deliverable proposes an algorithm for opportunistic relay selection in LF-based networks where the best relay can be found using a machine learning method. Remarkable performance gains are observed in a case where LF concept is applied in multi-antenna scenario, in which relays can transmit and receive {{at the same time}} by using multiple antennas for interference cancelation. Furthermore, we apply joint decoding (JD) into IEEE 802. 11 WiFi standard. In addition, we present an error rate model for RESCUE physical layer to be used when designing higher layer protocols. After analyzing the results presented in this deliverable, we conclude that RESCUE concept is especially suitable for the cases where the retransmissions are not preferable or not even possible. Executive summary The RESCUE project – “Links-on -the-fly Technology for Robust, Efficient, and Smart Communication in Unpredictable environments” – proposes a novel multi-route communication technology for multi-hop networks that are subject to dynamic topology changes. RESCUE is a cooperative communication paradigm consisting of decodeand-forward (DF) relaying that allows intra-link errors, combined with distributed turbo coding (DTC) that brings improved error protection. The relaying nodes decode and re-encode the data, and even with possible decoding errors, there exist correlation between the forwarded packet copies because they originate from the same source. Therefore, destination can improve the reliability of the detection by taking the correlation into account when decoding. The relaying method considered in RESCUE is referred as lossy forwarding (LF) which, in its original form, means that no integrity check is performed at the relay, but the frame is always forwarded. In this deliverable, we provide comprehensive analytical and simulation results of the coding algorithms used in RESCUE. Furthermore, we apply the coding algorithms to various frameworks and investigate its applicability in selected cases. The gains of the forward error correction (FEC) coding and joint decoding (JD) used in RESCUE are evident already from D 2. 1. 1. Therefore, in this deliverable we also address the impact of LF relaying by comparing frame error rate (FER) results with the lossless counterpart that uses the same coding/decoding. Firstly, we investigate a three-node system, referred as toy scenario 1 (TS 1) defined in D 1. 2. 1, by briefly introducing theoretical results considering the outage probabilities of different relaying strategies including a feedbackbased strategy. Furthermore, we deeply investigate the differences between theoretical and practical simulation results, aiming at finding possible directions for improving the coding/decoding scheme. The second investigated case is a system with multiple relays without direct link, referred as toy scenario 2 (TS 2), for which we show the superiority of LF compared with lossless forwarding in specific cases. Opportunistic relaying is an attractive solution in order to reduce system complexity. In opportunistic relaying, the best relay is selected among available relay candidates according to a certain policy. It has been shown that there is no loss in performance in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff if only the best relay participates in cooperation. In this deliverable, we present an opportunistic relay selection strategy for LF system. Furthermore, a statistical learning method is proposed for practical implementations. A successive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) erroneous relaying with iterative maximum a posteriori (MAP) receiver at destination is also proposed in order to allow relays’ transmission and reception at the same time. In other words, one of the relays can transmit and the other receive resulting in the reduced <b>multiplexing</b> <b>loss.</b> The proposed scheme allows relays erroneously forward the decoded symbols, and jointly cancels interference and combines diversity at destination. It has been shown that, without extra cost of time delay and signalling overhead, the proposed scheme can exhibit up to 8 dB gain by comparing with the conventional selective DF (S-DF) based schemes. An intuitive application of RESCUE contributions into current wireless standards is the use of JD in hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to combine the retransmitted erroneous packets at the destination. In this deliverable, we report the results of applying JD into IEEE 802. 11 WiFi standard. We show that with a minor changes, we can achieve performance improvements in terms of FER. In order to efficiently evaluate and test the higher layer protocols, the abstraction in the physical layer (PHY) is needed. Therefore, we present an error rate model for RESCUE PHY, which is capable to accurately predict the link-level performance at low computational complexity and can therefore be utilized for the design and performance evaluation of algorithms and protocols that exploit DTC as well as for system-level simulation. At the end, we find that LF is beneficial at least in the following cases: 1. Communications in rapidly changing network topology where the retransmissions are not possible. 2. Communications with low power devices where the nodes need to share the load with each other. For FEC coding/decoding used in RESCUE, we can conclude that it is very simple but remarkably strong performing close to the theoretical limits. Therefore, it has a great potential to be applied in current wireless standards...|$|E
40|$|Space-time {{transmission}} based colocated {{and distributed}} Multiple-InputMultiple-Output (MIMO) systems are investigated. Generally speaking, {{there are two}} types of fundamental gains, when using multiple antennas in wireless communications systems: the multiplexing gain and the diversity gain. Spatial multiplexing techniques such as the Vertical Bell-labs LAyered Space-Time (V-BLAST) scheme exploit the associated multiplexing gain in terms of an increased bit rate, whereas spatial diversity techniques such as Space-Time Coding (STC) aim for achieving a diversity gain, which results in a reduced error rate. Firstly, we concentrate our attention on a novel space-time transmission scheme, namely on Generalized Multi-Layer Space-Time Codes (GMLST), which may be viewed as a composite of V-BLAST and STC, hence they provide both multiplexing and diversity gains. The basic decoding procedure conceived for our GMLST arrangement is a certain ordered successive decoding scheme, which combines group interference nulling and interference cancellation. We apply a specifically designed power allocation scheme, in order to avoid the overall system performance degradation in the case of equal power allocation. Furthermore, the optimal decoding order is found, in order to enhance the system’s performance with the aid of the channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. However, our decoding scheme relying on power allocation or on the optimal decoding order does not take full advantage of the attainable receive antenna diversity. In order to make the most of this source of diversity, an iterative multistage Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) detected GMLST scheme was proposed, which may achieve the full receive diversity after a number of iterations, while imposing only a fraction of the computational complexity of Maximum Likelihood (ML) -style joint detection. Furthermore, for the sake of taking full advantage of the available colocated MIMO channel capacity, we present a low-complexity iteratively detected space-time transmission architecture based on GMLST codes and IRregular onvolutional Codes (IRCCs). The GMLST arrangement is serially concatenated with a Unity-Rate Code (URC) and an IRCC, which are used to facilitate near-capacity operation with the aid of an EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart based design. Reduced-complexity iterative multistage SIC is employed in the GMLST decoder instead of the significantly more complex ML detection. For the sake of approaching the maximum attainable rate, iterative decoding is invoked to achieve decoding convergence by exchanging extrinsic information across the three serially concatenated component decoders. Finally, it is shown that the iteratively detected IRCC-URC-GMLST scheme using SIC strikes an attractive trade-off between the complexity imposed and the effective throughput attained, while achieving a near-capacity performance. The above-mentioned advances were also exploited in the context of near-capacity communications in distributed MIMO systems. Specifically, we proposed an Irregular Cooperative Space-Time Coding (Ir-CSTC) scheme, which combines the benefits of Distributed Turbo Codes (DTC) and serially concatenated schemes. Firstly, a serial concatenated scheme comprising an IRCC, a recursive URC and a STC was designed for the conventional single-relay-aided network for employment at the source node. The IRCC is optimized with the aid of EXIT charts for the sake of achieving a near-error-free decoding at the relay node at a minimum source transmit power. During the relay’s transmit period, another IRCC is amalgamated with a further STC, where the IRCC employed at the relay is further improved with the aid of a joint source-and-relay mode design procedure for the sake of approaching the relay channel’s capacity. At the destination node, a novel three-stage iterative decoding scheme is constructed in order to achieve decoding convergence to an infinitesimally low Bit Error Ratio (BER) at channel Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) close to the relay channel’s capacity. As a further contribution, an extended Ir-CSTC scheme is studied in the context of a twin-relay aided network, where a successive relaying protocol is employed. As a benefit, the factor two <b>multiplexing</b> <b>loss</b> of the single-relay-aided network - which is imposed by the creation of two-phase cooperation - is recovered by the successive relaying protocol with the aid of an additional relay. This technique is more practical than the creation of a full-duplex system, which is capable of transmitting and receiving at the same time. The eneralized joint sourceand-relay mode design procedure advocated relies on the proposed procedure of finding the optimal cooperative coding scheme, which performs close to the twin-relay-aided network’s capacity. The corresponding simulation results verify that our proposed Ir-CSTC schemes are capable of near-capacity communications in both the single-relay-aided and the twin-relay-aided networks. Having studied diverse noise-limited single-user systems, we finally investigate a multiuser space divisionmultiple access (SDMA) uplink system designed for an unterferencelimited scenario, where the multiple access interference (MAI) significantly degrades the overall system performance. For the sake of supporting rank-deficient overloaded systems, a maximumsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MaxSINR) based SIC multiuser detection (MUD) algorithm is proposed for the multiple-antenna aided multi-user SDMA system, which is capable of striking a trade-off between the interference suppression and noise enhancement. Furthermore, the multiuser SDMA system is combined with channel codes, which assist us in eliminating the typical error floors of rank-deficient systems. Referring to the Ir-CSTC scheme designed for the single-user scenario, relaying techniques are invoked in our channel-coded SDMA systems, which benefit from extra spatial diversity gains. In contrast to the single-user Ir-CSTC schemes, interference suppression is required at both the base station (BS) and the relaying mobile station (MS). Finally, a more practical scenario is considered where the MSs have spatially correlated transmit antennas. In contrast to the conventional views, our simulation results suggest that the spatial correlation experienced at the transmitter is potentially beneficial in multiuser SDMA uplink systems, provided that efficient MUDs are invoked...|$|E
