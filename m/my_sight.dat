While her sister was on trial, Maureen—eight months pregnant—was attacked in the lift of the building in which she and David lived. Their home was vandalised, and hate mail was regularly posted through their letterbox. Maureen feared for her children: [...] "I couldn't let my children out of <b>my</b> <b>sight</b> when they were little. They were too young to tell them why they had to stay in, to explain why they couldn't go out to play like all the other children." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Hildegard of Bingen, {{in her book}} Scivias {{detailing}} her visions which she attributed to God, condemned same-sex intercourse (including lesbianism): [...] "A man who sins with another man as if with a woman sins bitterly against God ... a woman who takes up devilish ways and plays a male role in coupling with another woman is most vile in <b>My</b> <b>sight,</b> and so is she who subjects herself to such a one in this evil deed".|$|E

2500|$|Montaigne died of quinsy {{at the age}} of 59, in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. The {{disease in}} his case [...] "brought about {{paralysis}} of the tongue", and he had once said [...] "the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose <b>my</b> <b>sight</b> than my hearing and voice." [...] Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested mass, and died during the celebration of that mass.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to California, Stewart's optimism for San Francisco was short lived: despite the larger black professional class, {{there was little}} affluence and even more racial segregation than in Portland. [...] His legal partnership with Hudson struggled financially, but the two remained committed to it. [...] Ultimately, Stewart gave in to pressure. On April 14, 1919, unable to read his morning newspaper and fearing {{that he was about}} to go blind, Stewart wrote a note of farewell and shot himself in the head in his office. [...] His body was found the following day by a business associate. His suicide note said: [...] "I am going blind. [...] <b>My</b> <b>sight</b> is gone. [...] I can't see to read. [...] Poor Mac.

2500|$|At age eight, Crosby {{wrote her}} first poem which {{described}} her condition. She later remarked: [...] "It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I {{thank him for}} the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me." [...] She also once said, [...] "when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden <b>my</b> <b>sight</b> will be that of my Savior". According to biographer Annie Willis, [...] "had {{it not been for}} her affliction she might not have so good an education or have so great an influence, and certainly not so fine a memory".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1967 interview, Borges said, [...] "Perón was a humbug, {{and he knew}} it, and {{everybody}} knew it. But Perón could be very cruel. I mean, he had people tortured, killed. And his wife was a common prostitute." [...] When Perón returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged. In a 1975 interview for National Geographic, he said [...] "Damn, the snobs {{are back in the}} saddle. If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I'll be glad I've lost <b>my</b> <b>sight.</b> Well, they can't humiliate me as they did before my books sold well." [...] After being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, [...] "I resented Perón's making Argentina look ridiculous to the world... as in 1951, when he announced control over thermonuclear fusion, which still hasn't happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars. For a time, Argentines hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, 'Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?' A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the diary}} she often talks {{about keeping the}} [...] "boys" [...] and the [...] "baby" [...] (Alfred) safe during the siege and retreat:This was Johnny's fourth birthday, a sad one to us all. We managed to get some toys for Johnny from a {{merchant}} inside. (16 July)Johnny was not well to-day, and I feared he might be sickening for small-pox. (31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of <b>my</b> <b>sight.</b> (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days. The hen laid one every day for him till he died, and then ceased for the rest of the siege; but we would not kill it then. (12 November) I had at first put the two boys into a dhoolie with their ayah, but they got separated from us, and it was fully a quarter of an hour before I found them, so I would not let them go from me again [...] [...] [...] poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it [...] than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. [...] (19 November) ...|$|E

[...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: {{the same is}} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.|$|E
