5|$|U-28s second war patrol {{took place}} from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was {{instructed}} to lay a <b>minefield</b> near {{the port city of}} Swansea. En route to Bristol, U-28 sank two ships; the 5,000ton Dutch tanker MV Sliedrecht and the 5,100ton British freighter SS Royston Grange. U-28 then laid her <b>minefield</b> and returned to port in Germany. While the <b>minefield</b> was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600ton British freighter SS Protesilaus 60 days after it was laid.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 {{a large percentage}} of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier <b>minefield</b> at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war. These losses increasingly became a political issue as support for the war in Australia waned, and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised, both within the military and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the <b>minefield</b> grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the <b>minefield</b> had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the <b>minefield.</b>|$|E
50|$|The extents of <b>minefields</b> {{are often}} marked with warning signs and cloth tape, to prevent {{friendly}} troops and non-combatants from entering them. Of course, sometimes terrain can be denied using dummy <b>minefields.</b> Most forces carefully record {{the location and}} disposition of their own <b>minefields,</b> because warning signs can be destroyed or removed, and <b>minefields</b> should eventually be cleared. <b>Minefields</b> may also have marked or unmarked safe routes to allow friendly movement through them.|$|R

50|$|In the {{northern}} half of Mozambique all known <b>minefields</b> have been cleared: {{a total of}} 552 <b>minefields</b> containing 100,843 mines. HALO concluded 14 years of mineclearance with a survey of every community in order to confirm {{that there are no}} known <b>minefields</b> remaining.|$|R
5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the <b>minefield,</b> they {{came under heavy fire}} from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the <b>minefield</b> on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half hours}} while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the <b>minefield</b> and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The advance {{began at}} night on 23 October, with the {{regiment}} advancing down a track during the artillery barrage. At daybreak, Div Cav stopped at Miteiriya Ridge because the 6th New Zealand Infantry Brigade was unable to clear lanes through the <b>minefield.</b> A gap {{was created in the}} evening and B and C Squadrons advanced, screening the 9th Armoured Brigade. After traversing the <b>minefield,</b> the squadrons were stopped by anti-tank fire. Ten men were killed, and five tanks and four carriers destroyed.|$|E

Cyprus’s landmine contamination is estimated to span nine million square metres and consists of 77 <b>minefields</b> or suspected <b>minefields.</b>|$|R
500|$|Because of the Croatian War of Independence, {{there are}} {{numerous}} leftover <b>minefields</b> in Croatia, largely tracing former front lines. As of 2006, suspected <b>minefields</b> covered [...] As of 2012, 62% of the remaining <b>minefields</b> are situated in forests, 26% of them are found in agricultural land, and 12% are found in other land; {{it is expected that}} mine clearance will be complete by 2019.|$|R
5|$|Tucker {{entered the}} harbor at Espirtu Santo's western entrance, leading the cargo ship SSNira Luckenbach, unaware they had entered a <b>minefield</b> laid earlier by US Navy minelayers. After {{striking}} {{at least one}} mine, the destroyer was almost torn in two at the No.1 stack, killing {{all three of the}} crew in the forward fireroom. The rest of the crew survived but Tucker did not. The destroyer slowly settled in the water and sank. An investigation revealed that Tucker had been given no information about the existence of the <b>minefield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled <b>minefield.</b> Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the <b>minefield.</b> A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the <b>minefield,</b> UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second <b>minefield</b> that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
50|$|In {{the central}} and {{southern}} half of Mozambique a mines problem still exists. In 2007, HALO was asked to conduct a Baseline Assessment of the situation. This was completed in October 2007. The findings show that there are 541 confirmed <b>minefields</b> remaining and large <b>minefields</b> in the Cahora Bassa Dam area and {{on the border with}} Zimbabwe. These <b>minefields</b> are a danger to the lives of ordinary people and inhibit their ability to use the land and develop their livelihoods.|$|R

5|$|The South Africans and Rhodesians {{launched}} a two-pronged {{assault on the}} German positions over the road to Bologna at 22:30 on 15 April 1945. The Cape Town Highlanders' advance up the steep cliffs of Monte Sole was obstructed by a German <b>minefield</b> that guarded the peak. The Rhodesian officer commanding the leading platoon, Second Lieutenant GB Mollett, took a section of men and dashed through the <b>minefield</b> to the summit; for this he later received the Distinguished Service Order. Hand-to-hand fighting on Monte Sole continued until dawn, when the Germans withdrew. The Witwatersrand Rifles meanwhile took Monte Caprara. The Cape Town Highlanders took Monte Abelle late on 16 April, advancing under heavy artillery fire to the summit before clearing it of Germans. The regiment lost 31 killed and 76 wounded during these actions, including three Rhodesians killed and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{flotilla}} laid defensive minefields in the North Sea in August {{and early}} September {{before it was}} transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in mid-September. Now based at Brest the flotilla laid a <b>minefield</b> in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28/29 September. Five ships totalling only 2,026 GRT were sunk by this <b>minefield.</b> Led by Captain (Kapitän zur See) Erich Bey, Steinbrinck and four other destroyers sortied for the Southwest Approaches on 17 October and were intercepted by a British force of two light cruisers and five destroyers. The British opened fire at extreme range and were forced to disengage in the face of long-range torpedo volleys and attacks by Luftwaffe bombers without having hit any of the German ships. Steinbrinck returned home on 7 November for a refit in Stettin.|$|E
5|$|U-28s third sortie {{took place}} from 18 February to 25 March 1940. She was {{instructed}} to lay mines off the British Naval Base at Portsmouth. After U-28 laid the <b>minefield,</b> {{she went on to}} sink two ships for 11,200tons.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, a {{national}} survey of <b>minefields</b> remaining in Georgia found a total of 15 contaminated sites. Of these 15, ten are identified as having a direct humanitarian impact. HALO is currently working on two of these <b>minefields</b> and hope to clear a further seven by the end of 2011.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>minefields</b> are {{specifically}} booby-trapped to make clearing them more dangerous. Mixed anti-personnel and anti-tank <b>minefields,</b> anti-personnel mines under anti-tank mines, and fuses separated from mines {{have all been}} used for this purpose. Often, single mines are backed by a secondary device, designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine.|$|R

5|$|While largely {{forced on}} Graham by the {{inadequate}} forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy, his decision was {{contrary to the}} advice of the senior task force engineer, Major Brian Florence. A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea, including one of Graham's battalion commanders, Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, commanding officer 5 RAR, who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces. Yet unlike many of his colleagues, as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea, and many of the assumptions he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged. For the first six months the barrier <b>minefield</b> had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration, reducing re-supply movement by up to 80 percent. However, recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them, the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it, cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the <b>minefield</b> to restore the flow of supplies, as well as lifting mines for their own use. Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies, the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier <b>minefield</b> ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines, many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF. While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter-insurgency doctrine, Graham's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly, and despite initial success, the <b>minefield</b> became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later {{the decision was made to}} remove it amid growing casualties.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{the time}} constraints, Otway decided he could wait no longer, and the reduced {{battalion}} headed for the battery and joined up with Major Smith's reconnaissance party just outside the village of Gonneville en Auge. The reconnaissance party had cut a way through the barbed wire, and marked four routes through the <b>minefield.</b> Otway divided his men into four assault groups, and settled down to await {{the arrival of the}} three gliders.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Royal Artillery {{military}} fortifications {{were established}} at the beach end of the reserve, including two 6-inch (15.24cm) guns, five buildings, two pillboxes, a <b>minefield,</b> and concrete anti-tank blocks. A spigot mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited closer to the village. One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012.|$|E

On 11–12 September, Seydlitz {{and the rest of}} the I Scouting Group covered a <b>minefield</b> laying operation off Terschelling. On 24 November, the ship ran aground in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, but was quickly refloated. On 4 December, while exiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, Seydlitz became entangled in one of the net barriers. Divers had to remove the tangled nets from the starboard screws.|$|E

50|$|<b>Minefields</b> {{designed}} for psychological effect are usually placed on trade routes {{and are used}} to stop shipping from reaching an enemy nation. They are often spread thinly, to create an impression of <b>minefields</b> existing across large areas. A single mine inserted strategically on a shipping route can stop maritime movements for days while the entire area is swept.|$|R
50|$|In Britain, {{the term}} 'Submarine Mine' was used. Fixed <b>minefields</b> to defend {{harbours}} were {{the responsibility of}} the Royal Engineers (RE), which formed special companies of Submarine Miners to maintain them. Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Clarke, Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882-86, found {{that he did not have}} enough Regular Army engineers to man all the <b>minefields</b> being installed so he decided to utilise the part-time soldiers of the Volunteer Force. After successful trials the system was rolled out to ports around the country, where the Submarine Miners might be drawn from the Regular RE, the Militia, or the Volunteers. The Submarine Miners were also to the fore in developing searchlights to illuminate the <b>minefields.</b> By 1907 the War Office had decided to hand responsibility for the <b>minefields</b> to the Militia, but several Volunteer units were converted to Electrical Engineer Companies employing their lights for coastal artillery control and, eventually, anti-aircraft defences.|$|R
