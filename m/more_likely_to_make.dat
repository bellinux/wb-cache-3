40|$|International audienceMicrofinance {{sector is}} {{generally}} {{associated with high}} repayment rates. However {{it is not clear}} whether such success only results from the use of peer lending or is due to the existence of a long-term relationship between the borrower and her incumbent lender – that also strongly characterizes microcredit reality. Our paper contributes to the existing literature on microcredit market by experimentally examining to what extent long-term lending relationship enables to mitigate moral hazard associated with repayment and project selection in the absence of peer group. Subsequently, the aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent reciprocity and reputation can enhance credit market performance by mitigating moral hazard. The originality of our research lies in the fact that we introduce variability in socio-demographic characteristics by recruiting "real people", including not only students that are typically viewed as the standard subject pool but also bankers both from classical banking and from microcredit institutions. Consistent with previous studies, our findings reveal that the opportunity to engage bilateral long-term relationships strongly improves the market performance by mitigating the repayment problem (ex-post moral hazard) and thus enhancing cooperation between borrowers and lenders. This fact seems to highlight the prominence of reputation as a disciplining devise that conducts selfish borrowers to behave reciprocally. Notwithstanding, our results also seem to indicate that lenders take advantage of their long-term situation by increasing their rates. Credit cost is significantly higher under the partner treatments than under the stranger treatment. As a consequence, the borrowers may be incited to take more risk to reimburse their loan (ex-ante moral hazard). Improving the information disclosure negligibly enhances cooperation and thus market performance but alters the principals' lending behavioral patterns. Finally, we find that social bankers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>makes</b> fair credit offers to borrowers than classical bankers...|$|R

30|$|Using {{the more}} liberal {{accuracy}} classification, that is, both DL and DnL responses for detection, we found that three factors {{had an effect on}} likelihood to respond correctly: response time, general beliefs about the prevalence of photo manipulation, and interest in photography.

Also replicating the finding in Experiment 1, those who believe a greater percentage of photos are digitally manipulated were slightly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> correctly identify manipulated photos than those who believe a lower percentage of photos are digitally manipulated. Additionally, in Experiment 2, those interested in photography were slightly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> identify image manipulations correctly than those who are not interested in photography. For the location task, using {{the more liberal}} accuracy classification, that is, both DL and nDL responses, we found that two factors had an effect on likelihood to respond correctly.

Also those with an interest in photography were slightly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> correctly locate the manipulation within the photo than those without an interest. Next we considered whether any factors affected our more stringent accuracy classification, that is, being correct on both the detection and location tasks (DL).

5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining.
