25|$|When {{allowed to}} cool slowly, the <b>molten</b> <b>polymer</b> forms a more {{crystalline}} material. This material has spherulites containing many small crystallites when crystallized from an amorphous solid, rather than forming one large single crystal. Light tends to scatter as it crosses {{the boundaries between}} crystallites and the amorphous regions between them. This scattering means that crystalline PET is opaque and white in most cases. Fiber drawing is among the few industrial processes that produce a nearly single-crystal product.|$|E

25|$|Carother's work in linear super-polymers {{began as}} an {{unrestricted}} foray into the unknown, with no practical objective in mind. But the research was in a new field in chemistry and Du Pont believed that any new chemical breakthrough would likely be of value to the company. In the course of research Carothers obtained some super-polymers that became viscous solids at high temperatures, and the observation was made that filaments could be made from this material if a rod were dipped in the <b>molten</b> <b>polymer</b> and withdrawn. At this discovery {{the focus of the}} project shifted to these filaments and `Nylon` was the result.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the thermal}} {{conductivity}} and thermal diffusivity of four kinds of polymer melts were measured {{by using the}} transient short-hot-wire method. This method was developed from the hot-wire technique {{and is based on}} two-dimensional numerical solutions of unsteady heat conduction from a wire with the same length-to-diameter ratio and boundary conditions as those in the actual experiments. The present method is particularly suitable for measurements of <b>molten</b> <b>polymers</b> where natural convection effects can be ignored due to their high viscosities. The results have shown that the present method can be used to measure the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of <b>molten</b> <b>polymers</b> within uncertainties of 3 and 6 %, respectively.

25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling <b>molten</b> <b>polymer</b> below Tg glass transition temperature to form an amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin to move again, allowing crystals to nucleate and grow. This procedure is known as solid-state crystallization.|$|E

50|$|In rheology, shear {{thinning}} is the non-Newtonian behavior of fluids whose viscosity decreases under shear strain. It is sometimes considered synonymous for pseudoplastic behaviour, {{and is usually}} defined as excluding time-dependent effects, such as thixotropy. Shear-thinning behaviour is generally not seen in pure liquids with low molecular mass, or ideal solutions of small molecules like sucrose or sodium chloride, but is often seen in <b>polymer</b> solutions and <b>molten</b> <b>polymers,</b> and complex fluids and suspensions like ketchup, whipped cream, blood, paint, and nail polish.|$|R
50|$|Recoiling fluids display {{fading memory}} meaning the longer a fluid is elongated, the less it will recover. Recoil {{is related to}} {{characteristic}} time, {{an estimate of the}} order of magnitude of reaction for the system. Fluids that are described as recoiling generally have characteristic times on the order of a few seconds. Although recoiling fluids usually recover relatively small distances, some <b>molten</b> <b>polymers</b> can recover back to 1/10 of the total elongation. This property of polymers must be accounted for in polymer processing.|$|R

50|$|A non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid {{that does}} not follow Newton's Law of Viscosity. Most commonly, the {{viscosity}} (the measure of a fluid's ability to resist gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of non-Newtonian fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history. Some non-Newtonian fluids with shear-independent viscosity, however, still exhibit normal stress-differences or other non-Newtonian behavior. Many salt solutions and <b>molten</b> <b>polymers</b> are non-Newtonian fluids, as are many commonly found substances such as ketchup, custard, toothpaste, starch suspensions, maizena, paint, blood, and shampoo.|$|R

The FT-Raman spectra of films indicate that full width at half {{height of the}} band centered at 1725 cm(- 1) and relative intensity of bands at 1443 and 1458 cm(- 1) can be use to estimate the crystalline degree in film samples. The similarity between Raman spectra of molten PHB and PHBV and theirs CDCl(3) solutions suggested that <b>molten</b> <b>polymers</b> present similar conformation than polymers in solution. Raman data of these samples showed that bands at 1220, 1402, 1725, 2998 and 3009 cm(- 1) are due to crystalline helical structure and the bands at 1453, 1740, 2881, 2938 and 2990 cm(- 1) are originated from disordered domains.

50|$|Newtonian fluids are the {{simplest}} mathematical models of fluids {{that account for}} viscosity. While no real fluid fits the definition perfectly, many common liquids and gases, such as water and air, can be assumed to be Newtonian for practical calculations under ordinary conditions. However, non-Newtonian fluids are relatively common, and include oobleck (which becomes stiffer when vigorously sheared), or non-drip paint (which becomes thinner when sheared). Other examples include many polymer solutions (which exhibit the Weissenberg effect), <b>molten</b> <b>polymers,</b> many solid suspensions, blood, and most highly viscous fluids.|$|R
50|$|This process starts {{by feeding}} plastic {{material}} (pellets, granules, flakes or powders) from a hopper into {{the barrel of}} the extruder. The material is gradually melted by the mechanical energy generated by turning screws and by heaters arranged along the barrel. The <b>molten</b> <b>polymer</b> is then forced into a die, which shapes the polymer into apipe that hardens during cooling.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the polymer}} being spun must be {{converted}} into a fluid state. If the polymer is a thermoplastic then it can be simply melted, otherwise it is dissolved in a solvent or chemically treated to form soluble or thermoplastic derivatives. The <b>molten</b> <b>polymer</b> is then forced through the spinneret, then it cools to a rubbery state, and then a solidified state. If a polymer solution is used, then the solvent is removed after being forced through the spinneret.|$|E

50|$|Recoil is a {{rheological}} phenomenon observed only in non-Newtonian fluids that {{is characterized}} by a moving fluid’s ability to snap back to a previous position when external forces are removed. Recoil {{is a result of the}} fluid’s elasticity and memory where the speed and acceleration by which the fluid moves depends on the molecular structure and the location to which it returns depends on the conformational entropy. This effect is observed in numerous non-Newtonian liquids to a small degree, but is prominent in some materials such as <b>molten</b> <b>polymers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The local {{configuration}} of polymers {{results from a}} competition between entropy effects and attractive forces which provide a high density.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the viscoelastic properties of <b>molten</b> <b>polymers</b> {{and the ability to}} predict their behavior under deformation is of prime interest to polymer scientists and industry. The discrete linear relaxation spectrum $ lbrack G sb{i}, lambda sb{i} rbrack$ is one of the important viscoelastic properties and it is widely used to characterize <b>molten</b> <b>polymers.</b> This spectrum is obtained from experimental values of the dynamic moduli $ lbrack G sp prime(omega), G sp{ prime prime}(omega) rbrack$. A linear regression method with and without regularization and a nonlinear regression method were compared for inferring a discrete spectrum from experimental data. Since experimental values are used, errors in the data will affect the reliability of the spectrum. Because of the limitations of the experimental apparatus, the moduli can only be determined over a certain frequency range. The values of the relaxation times ($ lambda sb{i}$) and the corresponding elastic moduli ($G sb{i}$) depend on the range of frequencies over which the storage and loss moduli ($G sp prime(omega$) and $G sp{ prime prime}(omega$)) are measured and the method used to calculate them. Also, experimental sources of errors such as uncertainty in the gap measurement, variation {{in the shape of the}} edge, residual stress due to the preparation of the sample, and temperature uncertainty will induce experimental errors in $G sp prime(omega) $ and $G sp{ prime prime}(omega) $. This work investigates the effect of time-scale truncation and experimental errors on the discrete relaxation spectrum...|$|R

The definition of the {{three types of}} heterogeneities, their mutual relation and the theories by which they are predicted are discussed.

Experimental methods, by which heterogeneities can he detected, are critically discussed and the results are reviewed. In the glassy state, the heterogeneities mentioned above also occur.
