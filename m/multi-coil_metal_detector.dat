5000|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>detectors</b> {{are widely}} used in {{archaeology}} with the first recorded use by military historian Don Rickey in 1958 who used one to detect the firing lines at Little Big Horn. However archaeologists oppose the use of <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> by [...] "artifact seekers" [...] or [...] "site looters" [...] whose activities disrupt archaeological sites. The problem with use of <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> in archaeological sites or hobbyist who find objects of archeological interest is that the context that the object was found in is lost and no detailed survey of its surroundings is made. Outside of known sites the significance of objects may not be apparent to a <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> hobbyist.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> to diagnose swallowed radio-opaque metal foreign bodies (MFBs) in children, {{and whether they}} can detect non-radio-opaque MFBs. METHODS: In a prospective study, 231 children, who presented to the {{accident and emergency department}} with a history of swallowing MFBs, were evaluated by the <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> as well as radiography to confirm and locate {{the presence or absence of}} MFBs. RESULTS: A definite history of swallowing a MFB by the child was given by 186 (81 %) parents. The <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> located MFBs in 183 children and radiographs confirmed radio-opaque MFBs in 181. In the remaining 45 (19 %), when swallowing was suspected and not definite, both <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> and radiography confirmed the presence of a MFB in only four. CONCLUSION: A high detection rate of swallowed MFBs was observed in this study, using a <b>metal</b> <b>detector.</b> It is also of value to detect non-radio-opaque MFBs like aluminium. The detection of MFBs is high when the history of swallowing is definite...|$|R

50|$|If the {{meteorite}} is of {{the iron}} or stony iron variety a magnet (usually mounted {{at the end of}} a stick) will pick it up from the soil surface or a <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> will often detect it through many inches of soil.

50|$|A {{series of}} {{aircraft}} hijackings led the United States in 1972 to adopt <b>metal</b> <b>detector</b> technology to screen airline passengers, initially using magnetometers that were originally designed for logging operations to detect spikes in trees. The Finnish company Outokumpu adapted mining <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> in the 1970s, still {{housed in a}} large cylindrical pipe, to make a commercial walk-through security detector. The development of these systems continued in a spin-off company and systems branded as Metor <b>Metal</b> <b>Detectors</b> evolved {{in the form of}} the rectangular gantry now standard in airports. In common with the developments in other uses of <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> both alternating current and pulse systems are used, and the design of the coils and the electronics has moved forward to improve the discrimination of these systems. In 1995 systems such as the Metor 200 appeared with the ability to indicate the approximate height of the metal object above the ground, enabling security personnel to more rapidly locate the source of the signal. Smaller hand held <b>metal</b> <b>detectors</b> are also used to locate a metal object on a person more precisely.|$|R
