5000|$|A compact {{contractible}} Stein 4-manifold C with involution F on its boundary {{is called}} <b>an</b> Akbulut <b>cork,</b> if F extends to a self-homeomorphism but cannot extend to a self-diffeomorphism inside (hence <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> is <b>an</b> exotic copy of itself relative to its boundary). <b>A</b> <b>cork</b> (C,F) is called <b>a</b> <b>cork</b> of <b>a</b> smooth 4-manifold X, if removing C from X and re-gluing it via F changes the smooth structure of X (this operation is called [...] "cork twisting"). Any exotic copy X' of a closed simply connected 4-manifold X differs from X by <b>a</b> single <b>cork</b> twist.|$|R
