5|$|Credits for Write <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> {{adapted from}} liner notes.|$|E
5|$|Write <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> is the {{eleventh}} studio album by American R recording artist R. Kelly, released on June 25, 2012, by RCA Records. It was written and produced primarily by Kelly as the follow-up to his 2010 album Love Letter. He recorded Write <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia. It expands on its predecessor's traditional R aesthetic and incorporates musical influences such as Philadelphia soul and elements of Chicago stepping. Thematically, the album generally deals with love, its redemptive power, and its complications.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL {{turned out to}} be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I {{thought it was going to}} be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set <b>me</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils. He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album in the same vein of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing Write <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the class of 1965, which also included Guy Chamberlain, Paddy Driscoll, Dan Fortmann, Otto Graham, Sid Luckman, and Bob Waterfield. He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring <b>me</b> <b>back</b> every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the album}} debuted at number 80 on the UK Albums Chart {{in the week}} of July 7, 2012. In the United States, Write <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> debuted at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, selling 68,000 copies in its first week. It was Kelly's lowest first-week sales since 12 Play in 1993. The album sold 24,600 copies in its second week on the chart, falling 14 spots to number 19. It {{ultimately}} charted for 17 weeks on the US Billboard 200. As of August 15, 2012, the album has sold 253,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

25|$|Love <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American R singer Jazmine Sullivan, {{released}} on November 29, 2010, by J Records. Sullivan co-wrote the album with producers Missy Elliott, Ne-Yo, No I.D., Los da Mystro, and Salaam Remi, among others.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Wills, {{along with}} the Texas Playboys, co-starred with Tex Ritter in Take <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> To Oklahoma. Other films would follow.

60|$|I {{stopped in}} my tracks. The lion, {{appearing}} huge now, took slow catlike steps toward <b>me,</b> <b>backing</b> Don almost against my knees. He {{was so close}} I smelt him. His wonderful eyes, clear blue fire circled by yellow flame, fascinated me. Hugging the wall with my body I brought the revolver up, short armed, and with clinched teeth, and nerve strained to the breaking point, I aimed between the eyes and pulled the trigger.|$|R
25|$|I can't quite {{root for}} Lieberman {{to lose his}} primary. What's holding <b>me</b> <b>back</b> is that the anti-Lieberman {{campaign}} has come to stand for much more than Lieberman's sins. It's a test of strength for {{the new breed of}} left-wing activists who are flexing their muscles within the party. These are exactly the sorts of fanatics who tore the party apart in the late 1960s and early 1970s. They think in simple slogans and refuse to tolerate any ideological dissent.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 2016, {{after their}} 96–98 {{loss to the}} Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in the game 2 of their semifinals battle, an off-court drama has {{unfolded}} inside the San Miguel locker room after leading Best Import candidate Tyler Wilkerson {{walked out of the}} Beermen’s post game huddle. He was overheard saying, “Take <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to America. I want to go home.” The Beermen management eventually decided to let go of Wilkerson and play an All-Filipino squad in game 3, which they eventually won, 104–98. The staff eventually choose their former import Arizona Reid as a last-minute replacement for Wilkerson.|$|E
25|$|Crevedia {{took his}} final revenge on Rădulescu by having her satirized in the 1936 novel Buruieni de dragoste ("Love Weeds"). Some {{two years after}} the scandal, Crevedia married Maria Mutu, in a {{religious}} ceremony with Crainic as godfather. Maria was a niece of the Gândirea novelist Gib Mihăescu, in whose house she lived before marriage; she worked as a professor of French and Romanian. The couple had two daughters, Ioana and Diana. A flight enthusiast, Crevedia continued to travel throughout Europe, and announced by 1937 that he was planning to publish a travelogue of his trips through the Balkans, a theatrical version of Bacalaureatul lui Puiu, and an anthology of Bulgarian poetry, alongside a new novel, Mămăligă—referencing the folk dish. His play was reportedly finished, and Crevedia failed at convincing Camil Petrescu to include it in the National Theater program. Two other volumes of his poetry appeared around that time: Maria (1938), named after his wife, and Dă-mi înapoi grădinile ("Give <b>Me</b> <b>Back</b> My Gardens", 1939).|$|E

500|$|It takes <b>me</b> <b>back</b> {{to being}} in my car as a teenager. It takes <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to when me and my husband first meet, and he tries to scoop me and he thinks I'm the hottest thing in the world. I kinda had this whole fantasy {{of being in the}} car, and this whole movie played in my head. I didn't have a pen and paper. I got to the mic, I'm like, 'Oh, press Record.' ...|$|E
500|$|... "God Made You Beautiful" [...] is {{featured}} {{as a bonus}} audio song on the concert film and it premiered online on November 22, 2013. It is a slow-tempo ballad, with a staccato beat and a gospel-tinged chorus. Instrumentally, it consists of drums, strings, pianos, runs and hand claps. It opens with an [...] "echoey" [...] a cappella choir and it lyrically talks about Beyoncé and Jay-Z's daughter Blue Ivy as the singer tells that she [...] "brought <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to life/you bring <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to life." ...|$|E
500|$|Mattson's first {{recruiting}} visit came {{immediately after}} consecutive seasons of crop failure in 1867 and 1868, {{and he found}} himself [...] "besieged by people who wished to accompany <b>me</b> <b>back</b> to America." [...] He noted that: ...|$|E

6000|$|As for me, my {{only way}} was {{to cut the}} knot--because it was an untieable knot--and because my fingers {{generally}} are not strong at untieing. What {{do you mean by}} Mr. Kenyon's <b>backing</b> <b>me?</b> Nobody <b>backed</b> <b>me</b> except the north wind which blew us vehemently out of England. Mr. Kenyon knew no more of the affair than you did, though he was very kind afterwards and took my part. And as to money, there was (and is) little enough. It was a case of pure madness (for people of the world), just like table-moving and spirit-rapping and the 'hands'! ...|$|R
