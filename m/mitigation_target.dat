5000|$|Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University {{noted that}} Stern's {{estimates}} of business-as-usual climate damages were given {{in terms of}} per capita consumption equivalents, but Stern's costs of mitigation were given {{in terms of a}} percentage reduction in gross world product. Yohe stated that the two different measures are [...] "not really at all comparable." [...] Yohe commented on how the Review gives the impression that all climate damages can be avoided through the investment of 1% of world GDP in mitigation. This, however, would still lead to global warming (as per the Review's 550 ppm CO2e <b>mitigation</b> <b>target)</b> of around 1.5 to 4.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures. Significant portions of climate damages would therefore still persist with Stern's <b>mitigation</b> <b>target.</b> To measure the benefit of Stern's <b>mitigation</b> <b>target,</b> the residual climate damages from mitigation would need to be subtracted from Stern's business-as-usual climate damages.|$|E

5000|$|The Rudd Government {{sought to}} {{introduce}} an emissions trading scheme to tackle {{climate change in}} Australia and embarked on a thorough policy development process involving the Garnaut Review led by its climate change adviser, Professor Ross Garnaut, followed by a green paper on ETS design issues, Treasury modelling to inform <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> decisions and a final white paper, which would be published in December 2008. The White Paper included a plan to introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2010, known as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and gave a target range for Australia's greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 of between 5% and 15% less than 2000 levels. However, the ultimate legislation was frustrated in the Australian Senate — with the Liberal Party, Nationals and Australian Greens voting against it, the Senate rejected it on 13 August 2009. Rudd and key Labor ministers worked with the Liberals under opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull, who personally supported action on emissions, to achieve compromise on details of the scheme and gain their support. On 1 December 2009, Turnbull was replaced in a leadership spill called over the issue, by ETS opponent Tony Abbott, and the following day, the Senate voted against the revised package of bills. Rudd criticised the Liberals heavily for their refusal to support the legislation ("What absolute political cowardice, what absolute failure of leadership, what absolute failure of logic ...") but in April 2010 announced that the Government would delay implementing an emissions trading scheme until 2011.|$|E

In this paper, we look at both options to reach a 20 C <b>mitigation</b> <b>target.</b> This paper combines the global forest model, GTM, with the IAM WITCH model to study the optimal use of forestland to reach an aggressive global <b>mitigation</b> <b>target.</b> The analysis confirms that using both options is preferable to using either one alone. At first, while carbon prices are low, forest carbon storage dominates. However, when carbon prices pass 235 /tCO 2, wood bioenergy with CCS becomes increasingly important as a mechanism to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. The use of both mechanisms increases global forestland at the expense of marginal cropland. While the storage program dominates, natural forestland expands. But when the wood bioenergy program starts, natural forestland shrinks as more forests become managed for higher yields...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{proposals}} at the UNFCCC {{meeting in}} Bali in December 2007 {{suggest that a}} 2 % levy on the CDM could finance adaptation costs in developing regions. Other proposals include extending {{the scope of the}} levy to emissions trading. This study applies an Integrated Assessment Model to gain insight in the interactions between adaptation costs, residual damages and mitigation costs and to analyse the effectiveness of a 2 % levy on both the CDM and emissions trading from developing countries. We show that adaptation is especially important in lower income regions where damages are higher. The revenues of a 2 % levy strongly depend on both the climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> and the burden sharing regime. A more stringent climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> results in more emissions trade and, in the longer run, less need for adaptation. Both factors increase the share of adaptation costs that can be funded. The burden sharing regime strongly affects the revenues of a 2 % levy as well: relatively more stringent targets for developed countries increase the revenues of a 2 % levy. However, in the next two decades the share of adaptation that can be financed in any case remains well below 10 %. Additional funding mechanisms are therefore necessary to substantially finance adaptation costs in developing countries. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using {{cost-benefit}} analysis to determine an optimal climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> is criticised, especially because i) {{it fails to}} sufficiently take into account low-probability, high-impact events, and ii) results strongly depend on the discount rate used. One of the alternative suggestions to inform policymakers about the right <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> that does take {{the risks associated with}} low-probability, high-impact events explicitly into account is the minimax regret criterion. We apply the minimax regret criterion quantitatively using an integrated assessment model with extreme values for climate sensitivity, damage estimates and mitigation costs. The goal is to analyse whether such a method leads to different results compared to standard {{cost-benefit analysis}} and whether the results are still sensitive to the discount rate used. We find that the minimax regret approach leads to more stringent and robust climate targets for relatively low discount rates and if both a high climate sensitivity and high damage estimates are assumed. If one of these assumptions does not hold, the difference between the minimax regret approach and standard cost-benefit analysis is much smaller. Therefore, we conclude that the discount rate used can still be of vital importance even when applying a minimax regret approach.

40|$|Effective {{responses}} {{to climate change}} may demand a radical shift in human lifestyles away from self-interest for material gain, towards self-restraint for the public good. The challenge then lies in sustaining cooperative mitigation against the temptation to free-ride on others’ contributions, which can undermine public endeavours. When all possible future scenarios entail costs, however, the rationale for contributing to a public good changes from altruistic sacrifice of personal profit to necessary investment in minimizing personal debt. Here we demonstrate analytically how an economic framework of costly {{adaptation to climate change}} can sustain cooperative mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We develop game-theoretic scenarios from existing examples of insurance for adaptation to natural hazards exacerbated by climate-change that bring the debt burden from future climate events into the present. We model the as-yet untried potential for leveraging public contributions to mitigation from personal costs of adaptation insurance, by discounting the insurance premium in proportion to progress towards a <b>mitigation</b> <b>target.</b> We show that collective mitigation targets are feasible for individuals as well as nations, provided that the premium for adaptation insurance in the event of no mitigation is at least four times larger than the <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> per player. This prediction is robust to players having unequal vulnerabilities, wealth, and abilities to pay. We enumerate the effects of these inequalities on payoffs to players under various sub-optimal conditions. We conclude that progress in mitigation is hindered by its current association with a social dilemma, which disappears upon confronting the bleak consequences of inaction...|$|E

40|$|Governmental {{climate change}} <b>mitigation</b> <b>targets</b> are {{typically}} developed {{with the aid}} of forecasts of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. The robustness and credibility of such forecasts depends, among other issues, {{on the extent to which}} forecasting approaches can reflect prevailing uncertainties. We apply a transparent and replicable method to quantify the uncertainty associated with projections of gross domestic product growth rates for Mexico, a key driver of GHG emissions in the country. We use those projections to produce probabilistic forecasts of GHG emissions for Mexico. We contrast our probabilistic forecasts with Mexico’s governmental deterministic forecasts. We show that, because they fail to reflect such key uncertainty, deterministic forecasts are ill-suited for use in target-setting processes. We argue that (i) guidelines should be agreed upon, to ensure that governmental forecasts meet certain minimum transparency and quality standards, and (ii) governments should be held accountable for the appropriateness of the forecasting approach applied to prepare governmental forecasts, especially when those forecasts are used to derive climate change <b>mitigation</b> <b>targets.</b> Hydraulic Structures and Flood Ris...|$|R

40|$|China {{has been}} {{experiencing}} great {{economic development and}} fast urbanisation since its reforms and opening-up policy in 1978. However, these changes are reliant on consumption of primary energy, especially coal, characterised by high pollution and low efficiency. China’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with carbon dioxide (CO 2) being the most significant contributor, have also been increasing rapidly {{in the past three}} decades. Responding to both domestic challenges and international pressure regarding energy, climate change and environment, the Chinese government has made a point of addressing climate change since the early 2000 s. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of China’s CO 2 emissions and policy instruments for mitigating climate change. In the analysis, China’s CO 2 emissions in recent decades were reviewed and the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis examined. Using the mostly frequently studied macroeconomic factors and time-series data for the period of 1980 - 2008, the existence of an EKC relationship between CO 2 per capita and GDP per capita was verified. However, China’s CO 2 emissions will continue to grow over coming decades and the turning point in overall CO 2 emissions will appear in 2078 according to a crude projection. More importantly, CO 2 emissions will not spontaneously decrease if China continues to develop its economy without mitigating climate change. On the other hand, CO 2 emissions could start to decrease if substantial efforts are made. China’s present <b>mitigation</b> <b>target,</b> i. e. to reduce CO 2 emissions per unit of GDP by 40 - 45 % by 2020 compared with the 2005 level, was then evaluated. Three business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios were developed and compared with the level of emissions according to the <b>mitigation</b> <b>target.</b> The calculations indicated that decreasing the CO 2 intensity of GDP by 40 - 45 % by 2020 is a challenging but hopeful target. To study the policy instruments for climate change mitigation in China, domestic measures and parts of international cooperation adopted by the Chinese government were reviewed and analysed. Domestic measures consist of administration, regulatory and economic instruments, while China’s participation in international agreements on mitigating climate change is mainly by supplying certified emission reductions (CERs) to industrialised countries under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The most well-known instruments, i. e. taxes and emissions trading, are both at a critical stage of discussion before final implementation. Given the necessity for hybrid policies, it is important to optimise the combination of different policy instruments used in a given situation. The Durban Climate Change Conference in 2011 made a breakthrough decision that the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol would begin on 1 January 2013 and emissions limitation or reduction objectives for industrialised countries in the second period were quantified. China was also required to make more substantial commitments on limiting its emissions. The Chinese government announced at the Durban Conference that China will focus on the current <b>mitigation</b> <b>target</b> regarding CO 2 intensity of GDP by 2020 and will conditionally accept a world-wide legal agreement on climate change thereafter. However, there will be no easy way ahead for China. QC 20120424 </p...|$|E
