In the 1800s, more people began arriving in the watershed to exploit its natural resources. Anthracite mining was especially prevalent in the watershed in the 19th and 20th centuries, to the point that numerous streams were altered or destroyed and the Laurel Run <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> started.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mine</b> <b>fires</b> {{may begin}} {{as a result}} of an {{industrial}} accident, generally involving a gas explosion. Historically, some <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> were started when bootleg mining was stopped by authorities, usually by blowing the mine up. Many recent <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> have started from people burning trash in a landfill that was in proximity to abandoned coal mines, including the much-publicized Centralia, Pennsylvania, fire, which has been burning since 1962. Of the hundreds of <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> in the United States burning today, most are found in the state of Pennsylvania.|$|R

25|$|PA 61 enters Conyngham Township in Columbia County {{and heads}} {{northeast}} through dense forests as an unnamed four-lane undivided road. Farther northeast, the route narrows to a three lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. PA 61 curves east and becomes two-lane undivided Byrnesville Road, which is designated SR 2002. The former divided highway alignment of PA 61 past this point {{has been closed}} because of the Centralia <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> {{that has made the}} road unsafe to travel on. The closed section of the road is used by pedestrians and bicyclists and is covered in graffiti. PA 61 follows Byrnesville Road northeast through forests before passing through the abandoned community of Byrnesville. The route curves northwest through more woods and rejoins the closed alignment, at which point SR 2002 ends. At this point, PA 61 enters the borough of Centralia, which has largely been abandoned because of the <b>mine</b> <b>fire,</b> as two-lane undivided Locust Avenue. The road runs north through abandoned areas of the borough which have been overgrown with trees. PA 61 turns west onto West Centre Street, with PA 42 continuing north along Locust Avenue. From here, the route heads west through more abandoned sections of Centralia. The road leaves Centralia for Conyngham Township again and becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading through forested areas and passing to the south of a large coal mine.|$|E

25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{long-term}} coal <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> in Centralia, the original branch of Routes 54 and 61, which went from Centralia to Ashland, has been permanently closed because the road has severely opened up and buckled extensively. This branch was repaired in 1983 for $500,000; then in 1992 it was deemed too expensive to repair again. In 1994, the branch was permanently closed, {{and as a result}} of this, graffiti were scattered along the closed portion of the roadway. [...] In 1999, Byrnesville Road (Quadrant Route 2002), located directly south of the closed section of PA 61, was upgraded and now carries PA 61, bypassing the section of PA 61 which was damaged by the underground <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> in Centralia.|$|E
