40|$|Nine Sky Quality Meters (SQMs) {{have been}} intercompared during a night time {{measurement}} campaign {{held in the}} Netherlands in April 2011. Since then the nine SQMs have been distributed across the Netherlands and form the Dutch network for monitoring night sky brightness. The goal of the intercomparison was to infer <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> factors and obtain insight into the variability of the SQMs under different meteorological situations. An ensemble average is built from the individual measurements and used as a reference to infer the <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> factors. Data required additional synchronization prior to the calibration determination, because the effect of moving clouds combined with small misalignments emerges as time jitter in the measurements. Initial scatter of the individual instruments lies between ± 14 %. Individual night time sums range from − 16 % to + 20 %. Intercalibration reduces this to 0. 5 %, and − 7 % to + 9 %, respectively. During the campaign the smallest luminance measured was 0. 657 ± 0. 003 mcd/m 2 on 12 April, and the largest value was 5. 94 ± 0. 03 mcd/m 2 on 2 April.

Two panoramic cameras, residing on different mobile platforms, compose a virtual stereo sensor with a flexible baseline. A novel “mutual calibration ” algorithm is proposed where panoramic cameras on two cooperative moving platforms are dynamically calibrated by looking at each other. A detailed numerical analysis of the error characteristics of the panoramic virtual stereo vision (<b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> error, stereo matching error, and triangulation error) is given to derive rules for optimal view planning.

40|$|With {{the help}} of the {{experimental}} installation aimed at the investigation of high energy cosmic rays (Tien-Shan high mountain laboratory) the signal of Solar and star optical radiation is registered. The signal is well provided statistically and possesses the strictly expressed maximum in the region of EAS sizes Ne 1. 19 106 particles (primary energy Eo 1. 33 1015 eV). This signal is the peak from gamma EAS, generated by gamma quanta from decay of pi zero mesons, photo produced by the Primary Cosmic Radiation (PCR) nuclei on the photons of stars and of PCR sources. The assumption is made, that exactly this process provides the main contribution in the formation of so called knee on the primary spectrum. Due to the universality and distinct maximum of this signal, its usage for independent and reliable calibration of the EAS installations, for the <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> of these installations and, possibly, for the merger of experimental data obtained by means of these installations to increase the statistics, is proposed. It is especially vital to day, when the further essential increase of the energy range under investigation is necessary. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|One {{generally}} has {{the impression that}} one feels one's hand at the same location as one sees it. However, because our brain deals with possibly conflicting visual and proprioceptive information about hand position by combining it into an optimal estimate of the hand's location, <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> {{is not necessary to}} achieve such a coherent percept. Does sensory integration nevertheless entail sensory calibration? We asked subjects to move their hand between visual targets. Blocks of trials without any visual feedback about their hand's position were alternated with blocks with veridical visual feedback. Whenever vision was removed, individual subjects' hands slowly drifted toward the same position to which they had drifted on previous blocks without visual feedback. The time course of the observed drift depended in a predictable manner (assuming optimal sensory combination) on the variable errors in the blocks with and without visual feedback. We conclude that the optimal use of unaligned sensory information, rather than changes within either of the senses or an accumulation of execution errors, is the cause of the frequently observed movement drift. The conclusion that seeing one's hand does not lead to an alignment between vision and proprioception has important consequences for the interpretation of previous work on visuomotor adaptation. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} {{of the results of}} the Venus northern hemisphere radar survey in 1983 - 1984 from the Venera 15 and 16 spacecrafts is presented. In addition, we discuss some peculiarities in the function of the radar equipment that defined the technology of SAR data processing. Among these peculiarities are insufficient calibration of SAR and radar altimeter and erroneous automatic gain control data transmission from the spacecrafts. As a result, the procedure of image synthesis and mosaicking contained multistage image brightness corrections. This led to the fact that the average image brightness in a spot 100 km in diameter was constant everywhere in the mosaics. Twenty-seven radar mosaics in the Lambert-Hauss conic projection with 1 - 2 km spatial resolution covering 25 percent of the surface of Venus have been produced. A Venus surface roughness map was constructed by joint processing of SAR and altimeter data. The <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> of the SAR and altimeter was made in the special radar session when the SAR and altimeter were declined from the local vertical at the same angle.

40|$|The {{switching}} of parasitic organisms to novel hosts, {{in which}} they may cause {{the emergence of new}} diseases, is of great concern to human health and the management of wild and domesticated populations of animals. We used a phylogenetic approach to develop a better statistical assessment of host switching in a large sample of vector-borne malaria parasites of birds (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) over their history of parasite-host relations. Even with sparse sampling, the number of parasite lineages was almost equal to the number of avian hosts. We found that strongly supported sister lineages of parasites, averaging 1. 2 % sequence divergence, exhibited highly significant host and geographical fidelity. Event-based matching of host and parasite phylogenetic trees revealed significant cospeciation. However, the accumulated effects of host switching and long distance dispersal cause these signals to disappear before 4 % sequence divergence is achieved. Mitochondrial DNA nucleotide substitution appears to occur about three times faster in hosts than in parasites, contrary to findings on other parasite-host systems. Using this <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration,</b> the phylogenies of the parasites and their hosts appear to be similar in age, suggesting that avian malaria parasites diversified along with their modern avian hosts. Although host switching has been a prominent feature over the evolutionary history of avian malaria parasites, it is infrequent and unpredictable on time scales germane to public health and wildlife management...|$|R
40|$|The RA 2 radar {{altimeter}} onboard the European Satellite Envisat {{is a double}} band microwave instrument working at Ku- and S-band. The S-band measurements provide appropriate atmospheric corrections for the more precise Ku-band measurements, but are also {{used in conjunction with}} the Ku-band data in order to investigate the underlying surface. In this study we try to identify differences and similarities of the backscatter signal in the two bands. We focus our attention on the condition of specular alike radar returns, which mostly occur on sea-ice regions. An attempt to find situations in which highly correlated radar waveforms in the two bands can be ascribed to simple scattering mechanisms is made in order to find indications on the <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> of the two channels.

However, the differences between these two works and the present work are that (1) the former requires a coupling-free auxiliary vector sensor and design of a reference signal, while the latter does not, (2) the former does not apply the temporally smoothing technique to improve the identifiability limit of a vector sensor, and (3) the former assumes the incoming signals are completely polarized, while the latter considers the incompletely polarized signals.|$|R

40|$|A {{commentary}} on Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, {{and the future}} of cognitive science by Clark, A. (in press). Behav. Brain Sci. Is any unified theory of brain function possible? Following a line of thought dat-ing back to the early cybernetics (see, e. g., Cordeschi, 2002), Clark (in press) has proposed the action-oriented Hierarchical Predictive Coding (HPC) as the account to be pursued in the effort of gain-ing the “Grand Unified Theory of the Mind”—or “painting the big picture,” as Edelman (2012) put it. Such line of thought is indeed appealing, but to be effectively pursued it should be confronted with experimental findings and explana-tory capabilities (Edelman, 2012). The point we are making in this note is that a brain with predictive capa-bilities is certainly necessary to endow the agent situated in the environment with forethought or foresight, a crucial issue to outline the unified account advo-cated by Clark. But the capacity for fore-thought is deeply entangled with the capacity for emotions and when emo-tions are brought into the game, cogni-tive functions become part of a large-scale functional brain network. However, for such complex networks a consistent view of hierarchical organization in large-scale functional networks has yet to emerge (Bressler and Menon, 2010), whilst het-erarchical organization is likely to play a strategic role (Berntson et al., 2012). This raises the necessity of a multilevel approach that embraces causal relations across levels of explanation in either direc-tion (bottom–up or top–down), endors-ing <b>mutual</b> <b>calibration</b> of constructs across levels (Berntson et al., 2012). Which, in turn, calls for a revised perspective on Marr’s levels of analysis framework (Marr, 1982). In the following we highlight some drawbacks of Clark’s proposal in address-ing the above issues...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{algorithm}} is presented for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and array self-calibration {{in the presence}} of unknown mutual coupling. In order to highlight the relationship between the array output and mutual coupling coefficients, we present a novel model of the array output with the unknown mutual coupling coefficients. Based on this model, we use the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm to jointly estimate the DOA parameters and the mutual coupling coefficients. Unlike many existing counterparts, our method requires neither calibration sources nor initial calibration information. At the same time, our proposed method inherits the characteristics of good convergence and high estimation precision of the SAGE algorithm. By numerical experiments we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing method for DOA estimation and <b>mutual</b> coupling <b>calibration...</b>|$|R

30|$|Direction finding using a single-electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) {{has played}} an {{important}} role in applications such as radar, wireless communications and seismic exploration. An EMVS consists of six components, three identical but orthogonally oriented electrically short dipoles, and another three identical but orthogonally oriented magnetically small loops. An EMVS can therefore measure all the six electromagnetic field components induced by any electromagnetic incidence. After Li [1], and Nehorai and Paldi [2] first introduced the EMVS measurement model to the signal processing community, a variety of studies regarding signal processing with a single EMVS [2 – 8] have been extensively carried out. These methods ignore the mutual coupling across the six antenna component, which ultimately destroys the underlying model assumptions needed for their efficient implementations. Consequently, ignoring this mutual coupling effect can seriously degrade the performance the above mentioned algorithms. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop algorithms for simultaneous <b>mutual</b> coupling <b>calibration</b> and parameter estimation.|$|R

40|$|Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a {{promising}} technique to greatly increase the spectral efficiency {{and may be}} adopted by the next generation mobile communication systems. Base stations (BSs) equipped with large-scale antennas can serve multiple users simultaneously by exploiting the downlink precoding in time division duplex (TDD) mode. However, channel state information (CSI) of uplink transmissions cannot be simply used for downlink precoding, because the gain mismatches of the transceiver radio frequency (RF) circuits disable the channel reciprocity. In this paper, we focus on antenna calibration for massive MIMO systems with maximal ratio transmit (MRT) precoding to solve the channel nonreciprocity problem. A new <b>calibration</b> method, called <b>mutual</b> coupling <b>calibration,</b> is proposed by using the effect of mutual coupling between adjacent antennas. By exploiting this method, the BS can perform the calibration without extra hardware circuit and users' involvement. We also build up the model of calibration error and derive the closed-form expressions of the ergodic sum-rates for evaluating the impact of calibration error on system performance. Simulation results verify the high calibration accuracy of the proposed method and show the significant improvement of system performance by performing antenna calibration...|$|R

A neoclassical macroeconomic model is used, in- cluding a financial constraint {{in the form of}} a restriction on external financing.

It is shown, that the combination of the financial constraint and the fi- nancial shock contributes to understanding of the macroeconomic fluctuations, asset price dynamics and their <b>mutual</b> impact. The <b>calibration</b> for the United States demonstrates that the financial shock is an important source of the as- set price volatility. Contrary, when calibrated to the Czech data, the financial shock generates only moderate asset price volatility, as a consequence of a posi- tive correlation with the productivity shock. To address the issue, the model is further extended by a sector of financial intermediaries and a preference shock related to the risk-aversion of economic subjects, and the extension is shown to improve the result...|$|R

The continuum can be either modeled as a power law with a reflection bump or a Comptonisation model with an additional bump which can be modeled as the partial covering with a heavy absorber. To resolve between these two models, we have attempted combined fit to the 2 - 500 keV data obtained from EXOSAT, XMPC and OSSE. We find that two component Comptonisation model adequately represents the data. We explore the possible emission region that is responsible for the observed spectrum.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>mutual</b> coupling based <b>calibration</b> method for time-division-duplex massive MIMO systems, which enables downlink precoding based on uplink channel estimates. The entire calibration procedure {{is carried out}} solely at the base station (BS) side by sounding all BS antenna pairs. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is derived, which processes the measured channels in order to estimate calibration coefficients. The EM algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art narrow-band calibration schemes in a mean squared error (MSE) and sum-rate capacity sense. Like its predecessors, the EM algorithm is general {{in the sense that}} it is not only suitable to calibrate a co-located massive MIMO BS, but also very suitable for calibrating multiple BSs in distributed MIMO systems. The proposed method is validated with experimental evidence obtained from a massive MIMO testbed. In addition, we address the estimated narrow-band calibration coefficients as a stochastic process across frequency, and study the subspace of this process based on measurement data. With the insights of this study, we propose an estimator which exploits the structure of the process in order to reduce the calibration error across frequency. A model for the calibration error is also proposed based on the asymptotic properties of the estimator, and is validated with measurement results.

40|$|The {{relation}} of language to thought and mind {{is an ancient}} topic in linguistic theory. Normally language is related to thought in an individual mind. In this article, I explore the analogy between the dimensions and dynamics of individual perception as formulated by Husserl and the inter-individual perception and conceptualization found in everyday conversations. The notions of horizon, perspective, appresentation, and apperception developed by Husserl for the phenomenology of individual perception are generalized to incorporate the <b>mutual</b> and cooperative <b>calibration</b> of consciousness evidenced in conversational discussions where speakers cooperate to construct an interpretation and evaluation of their experience. This process of local cooperative and mutual co-construction and evaluation of interpretations of experience takes place in what is referred to here as a course of development. An extended excerpt from a conversational discussion is used to demonstrate the interactive dialogic and dialectical work speakers carry out {{in an effort to}} make sense of their experience of the world and their relationship to the world and each other. Ways of talking are analysed as means of constructing restricted folk-theoretic world-views that rely on the dialogic-dialectical work of the speakers. Contributions to an on-going discussion are claimed to constitute folk theories actualized in real time in the talk where Husserl’s notions of horizon, perspective, etc. of individual consciousness are given a distributed or shared interpretation in the establishment and maintenance of inter-individual consciousness in relation to the topics and events under development in the conversation.
