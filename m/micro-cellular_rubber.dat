5000|$|At {{the initial}} {{meeting of the}} Everest team at the {{premises}} of the Royal Geographical Society on 17 November 1952, Noyce was designated as being charge of writing (meaning the dispatches that were to be sent home from the mountain) and [...] "volunteered {{to help with the}} packing" [...] (he aided Stuart Bain with this). [...] On the walk-in to the mountain, Noyce, together with Charles Evans, who had been designated as in charge of stores at the RGS meeting, were designated as the [...] "baggage party", in charge of the clothing and equipment for the approach. Noyce was also in charge of mountaineering equipment on the ascent itself, having been instructed in the repair of high-altitude boots ("I had worked for three days with Robert Lawrie's bootmakers, learning chiefly how to stick on <b>micro-cellular</b> <b>rubber</b> soles and heels"). Noyce's skills in boot repair were in demand on the ascent; according to Charles Wylie, the thin Vibram soles that were used on the boots often peeled off at the toes but Noyce [...] "saved the situation with some really professional repair work".|$|E
