50|$|What about {{concrete}} spacers with {{a plastic}} clip or fixing mechanism? Does the plastic clip or fixing mechanism in the concrete spacer {{have a negative effect}} on <b>material</b> <b>integrity?</b> Does it weaken the corrosion protective cover over the reinforcement? The answer is no! The plastic clip or fixing mechanism is hinged from the top of the spacer and does not come into contact with the soffit of the concrete. The plastic clip or fixing mechanism is embedded only 5 mm into the spacer, which maintains the <b>material</b> <b>integrity</b> at the product’s surface. The plastic in the clip or fixing mechanism is used only for easily attaching to and holding the reinforcement, leaving the concrete part to do the work of the spacer.|$|E

It has proved to be effective in nondestructive inspection of layers in paints and coatings, detecting structural defects in ceramic and composite materials and imaging the physical structure of paintings and manuscripts. The use of THz waves for non-destructive evaluation enables inspection of multi-layered structures and can identify abnormalities from foreign material inclusions, disbond and delamination, mechanical impact damage, heat damage, and water or hydraulic fluid ingression. The company's Chief Scientific Director, Sir Michael Pepper, explains that THz imaging can measure thickness across a substrate precisely and it can also obtain the density of the coating: [...] "The radiation is reflected each time there is a change in material. The time of arrival is measured and then various algorithms complete the picture by developing 3D fine feature images and precise material identifications". Further research by the company and active collaboration with the University of Cambridge is aiming to develop a terahertz sensor that {{can be used}} to measure the quality of paint coatings on cars.|$|E

In Japan, VOM experiments at JRR- 2 for ceramic breeders and experiments at JMTR for ceramic breeders and beryllium as a neutron multiplier have been performed.

5000|$|An {{important}} influence for Winsor {{during this}} time was American dance, choreographer, and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer. Rainer’s work was experimental and its intention was to put the body back into abstraction and use it along with motion to create shape. Her performances were often based on particular actions or tasks, which Winsor felt had a relationship {{to the ways in}} which she herself performed tasks in her own work. Winsor remarked, [...] "What interested me was that these abstractions had a physical presence because they were acted out with bodies ," [...] as opposed to [...] "the hands-off sensibility toward abstraction" [...] typically seen in Minimalist sculpture. Winsor uses very involved, hands-on processes to create her sculptures, including nailing, wrapping, joining, and measuring. Winsor’s work-flow has been described as being slow and obsessive. On average. Winsor produces only three sculptures a year. Winsor describes, “Maintaining integrity toward the perfection you envisioned in the beginning is a constant concern. I spend an enormous amount of time just trying to imagine if an eighth of an inch at some point is going to make a major difference in the completed construction of the piece.” Her work not only examines form and material, but also process, space, surface, weight, and density.

30|$|The rapid {{degradation}} of the optical quality of QDs on CHP upon high-temperature in situ annealing thus cannot result from the {{degradation of}} QDs since the controlled QDs {{subject to the same}} annealing conditions remain optically active despite the longest annealing times as seen in Figure 3 a; it must therefore result from the {{degradation of the}} CHP itself as the PL from the controlled CHP shown in Figure 3 b. The thermal budget for the overlayers on QDs on CHP is thus lower than that those on conventional QDs and must be well below 700 °C. Alternatively, improvement sought from post-growth annealing may be carried out ex situ at a lower temperature and, consequently, with a quantitatively and qualitatively different improvement.

40|$|O presente estudo tem como objetivo analisar os efeitos do uso da marca pelo titular ou por terceiros sob a ótica da integridade. O uso da marca traz consequências negativas ao próprio signo no que tange à sua integridade {{material}}, causando o desgaste da sua distinção entre marcas de concorrentes, o que faz diminuir a distância distintiva entre os sinais de uma mesma atividade econômica ou afins. Além disso, o uso da marca também pode causar a perda completa de sua unicidade, corpo distintivo da marca, chegando, às vezes, à vulgarização da mesma, tornando-se res communis omnium. Do outro lado, a integridade material da marca pode passar por processos positivos que fortalecem o seu corpo distintivo. O uso da marca com sucesso faz aumentar sua fama perante o mercado e consumidores, diferenciando-a das demais e sendo alçada ao posto de marca famosa. A fama através do uso impulsiona marcas ordinárias ao status de marcas notoriamente conhecidas ou marcas de alto renome. Ambas representam degraus superiores de integridade material em relação às marcas que são ordinariamente protegidas dentro de suas atividades comerciais. Além disso, apesar do direito de uso exclusivo oferecido às marcas registradas, tal direito não é absoluto. Ou seja, mesmo ocorrendo usos desautorizados de marcas de terceiros que ocasionem alterações na integridade material das mesmas, há usos considerados permitidos pela legislação e jurisprudência. Dessa forma, pretende-se demonstrar que o uso da marca é o fio condutor desses fenômenos. This paper aims {{to analyze}} {{the effects of the}} use of the trademark by the owner or by third parties {{from the perspective of the}} integrity. The use of the trademark brings negative consequences to the sign itself with respect to its <b>material</b> <b>integrity,</b> causing lack of its distinctiveness among competing marks, which slims the distinctive distance between the signs of the same or related economic field. Furthermore, the use of the trademark can also cause the complete loss of its uniqueness, distinctive body of the mark, reaching sometimes the vulgarization of the same, becoming res communis omnium. On the other hand, the <b>material</b> <b>integrity</b> of the mark can undergo positive processes that enhance its distinctive body. The successful use of the mark increases its fame before the market and consumers, differentiating it from others and being raised to a level of a famous mark. The fame through use elevates the ordinary marks to the status of well-known marks or trademarks of high repute. Both represent upper rungs of <b>material</b> <b>integrity</b> towards marks that are ordinarily protected within their fields of activities. Moreover, despite the right of exclusive use offered to registered marks, such right is not absolute.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method {{developed for the}} discrimination of acoustic emission (AE) events based on the similarity of their parameters. The method should help to locate the sources of AE events which are related to failure of the <b>material’s</b> <b>integrity</b> (the crack propagation). Early detection of crack growth is critical {{for the prevention of}} catastrophic failure, especially for metallic structures or high-pressure tanks. The problem is that during long-term monitoring of construction, many AE events captured by a special monitoring system are disturbances. If standard methods of discrimination are used, a number of clusters of AE events are located. Only some of these clusters are generated by crack propagation; the remainder are disturbances. The developed method uses the specific behavior of AE sources generated by the crack propagation in the material to discriminate between those sources and the disturbances. The discrimination is based on the similarity of AE parameters, such as duration, rise time, counts and maximum amplitude. The proposed method was validated on real data from measurements of two different chemical reactors. The first measurement ran for 6 months {{and at the end of}} this period the reactor was shut down because the <b>integrity</b> of its <b>material</b> was disturbed.
