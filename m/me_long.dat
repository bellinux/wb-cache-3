25|$|The peasants {{are fairly}} well off, as {{the soil is}} rich, the {{abundant}} water-supply free, and the taxation comparatively light. It was always interesting to meet them taking their live stock into market. Flocks of sheep with tiny lambs, black and white, pattered along the dusty road; here a goat followed its master like a dog, trotting behind the diminutive ass which the farmer bestrode; or boys, clad in the whity-brown native cloth, shouted incessantly at donkeys almost invisible under enormous loads of forage, or carried fowls and ducks in bunches head downwards, a sight that always made <b>me</b> <b>long</b> {{to come to the}} rescue of the luckless birds.|$|E
500|$|Shelley Conn plays Danni Prendiville, {{an officer}} with Section 20. Porter started {{an affair with}} her after he was redrafted into service. She signed on for the role because she [...] "thought {{the concept of the}} scripts was very clever and once I heard who was {{involved}} it didn't take <b>me</b> <b>long</b> to sign up." [...] In researching for her role, Conn had somewhat of a military background since her father and uncle both served in the British Army, and had since had a base understanding of military life.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{consistent}} performances, by December 2005 he {{had lost}} his place and there was speculation that he had fallen out with Taylor and wanted to leave; this was strongly denied by the player: [...] "I'm shocked that people are saying I want to go. I'm very happy here. ... It's taken <b>me</b> <b>long</b> enough to get to Hull so I'm not going to walk out after a few months, or whatever." [...] In the following six weeks he made only two brief substitute appearances– in five months with the club he played 18 games in the Championship without scoring – and the strength of Hull's squad was such that he could not be guaranteed regular first-team football.|$|E
500|$|Strindberg wooed Bosse {{by sending}} her books about {{theosophy}} and the occult, {{by attempting to}} mould her mind, and by furthering her career. Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her, he tried to persuade her to act them, and the Dramaten management to cast her in them. [...] Bosse asserts in her edition of the Letters that she tended to hang back, as did the management, being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles. Strindberg, a power in the theatre, nevertheless often prevailed. The role of Eleonora in Easter (1901), which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy, but which she finally undertook to play, {{turned out to be}} Bosse's most successful and beloved role, and a turning-point in Bosse's and Strindberg's relationship. They became engaged in March 1901, during the rehearsals of Easter, in what in Bosse's narrative may be the best-known incident of the Strindberg legend. Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress, but he assured her she would be perfect for it. [...] "Then he placed his hands on my shoulders, looked at <b>me</b> <b>long</b> and ardently, and asked: 'Would you like to have a little child with me, Miss Bosse?' I made a curtsey and answered, as though hypnotized: 'Yes, thank you!'—and we were engaged." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{he never}} planned {{to play for}} Michigan, Daley looked back on the {{opportunity}} as a stroke of luck. [...] "I was a lucky guy. [...] I got to play for two great schools, but playing at Michigan {{was one of the}} greatest thrills I could have had. [...] When I was at Michigan, I was the happiest guy in the world." [...] Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: [...] "It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to <b>me</b> <b>long</b> after I played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames and that is very special." [...] Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. [...] In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12. [...] Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame. [...] Said Daley, [...] "I wanted to beat them so bad, and I played one of the best games of my life, but it wasn't to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give <b>me</b> <b>long,</b> choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Dominici's departure, Dream Theater fought {{successfully}} {{to be released}} from their contract with Mechanic, and set about auditioning singers and writing material for their next album. In their search for a new singer, they auditioned over 200 people, among them former Fates Warning front man John Arch. John ultimately decided that his personal commitments were more important and he opted not to join the band. On June 9, 1990, at a gig at Sundance in Bayshore, New York, Dream Theater introduced Steve Stone as their new singer. Stone had successfully recorded demos with Dream Theater, but he was fired following a single, ill-fated live performance. According to Mike Portnoy, Stone moved around the stage in a rather odd manner, seemingly doing a bad impression of Bruce Dickinson. Additionally, he shouted [...] "Scream for <b>me</b> <b>Long</b> Beach!" [...] several times throughout the show (Dickinson can be heard saying this on Iron Maiden's live album Live After Death), although they were actually performing in Bayshore. It was five months before Dream Theater played another show, this time all-instrumental (under the name YtseJam). Until 1991, the band remained focused in an attempt to hire another singer and writing additional music. It was during this period that they wrote the majority of what would become Images and Words (1992).|$|E
