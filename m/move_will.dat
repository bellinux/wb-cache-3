5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air forces will occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the <b>move</b> <b>will</b> instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E

5000|$|Real games seem to {{turn into}} a battle over whether the number of <b>moves</b> <b>will</b> be k or k+1 (for some k, {{depending}} on the early moves in the game) with other possibilities being quite unlikely. [...] One player tries to create enclosed regions containing survivors (thus reducing the total number of <b>moves</b> that <b>will</b> be played) and the other tries to create pharisees (thus increasing the number of <b>moves</b> that <b>will</b> be played).|$|R

25|$|Many {{games from}} the Indian subcontinent use pussa kanawa laps. These are like {{standard}} multilaps, {{but instead of}} continuing the movement with {{the contents of the}} last hole filled, a player continues with the next hole. A pussakanawa lap <b>move</b> <b>will</b> then end when a lap ends just prior to an empty hole.|$|E

25|$|As from 2017, {{the start}} of the race is in Antwerp, Flanders' largest city. The <b>move</b> <b>will</b> mark the first time the race passes through the {{province}} of Antwerp, as well as the first start outside the historical County of Flanders. The change was considered revolutionary, and the decision caused great division among Flemish cycling fans.|$|E

GE ranks eighth on the Fortune 500 and will become the largest publicly traded company based in Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|On September 2010, in an {{interview}} with CNBC, Dato' Seri Najib Tun Razak, who is the Prime Minister of Malaysia and also the Finance Minister said that the government is open to open up the ringgit to off shore trading if the <b>move</b> <b>will</b> help the economy. He further added that before such a move to be made, it will ensure that rules and regulation will be in place so the currency will not be abused.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hook}} has been removed, return the trout into the water. Support the trout until it stabilizes. This {{includes}} holding {{the fish in}} water deep enough to submerge its gills. After long fights, {{it may be necessary}} to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding the trout in moving water with its head facing upstream, or, in calm water, moving the trout backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, the trout will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, the trout, not having enough energy to <b>move,</b> <b>will</b> sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate. Take however long is necessary to revive a trout.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{currency}} peg, the ringgit appreciated to as high as 3.16 to the US dollar in April 2008. The ringgit had also enjoyed a period of appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) (from 0.49 to 0.44 to the MYR) and the renminbi (CNY) (0.46 to 0.45 to the MYR) as recently as May 2008. The initial stability of the ringgit in the late-2000s had led to considerations to reintroduce {{the currency}} to foreign trading. In a CNBC interview in September 2010, Najib Tun Razak, the then Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia, was quoted in stating that the government was planning the reentry of the ringgit into off-shore trading if the <b>move</b> <b>will</b> help the economy, with the condition that rules and regulations were put in place to prevent abuses.|$|E
50|$|Each move removes {{two free}} ends and {{introduces}} two more. With n initial crosses, {{the number of}} <b>moves</b> <b>will</b> be 5n&minus;2, so a game starting with an odd number of crosses will be a first player win, while a game starting with an even number will be a second player win regardless of the moves.|$|R

25|$|On June 25, manager Mike Matheny told closer Trevor Rosenthal {{he would}} {{be used in a}} {{different}} role. The <b>move</b> <b>will</b> bump Rosenthal out of a closer's job that has been his since late in 2013. He had a frightful 14.14 ERA in June and 5.63 for the season, and blew a save opportunity on June 24, when he gave up in succession a double, a walk, and then a game-winning three-run home run when leading 3-1 against the Seattle Mariners. He averaged 7.9 walks per 9 inn. His percentage of first-pitch strikes was only 61%. Matheny has not named a replacement closer, but said he will instead consider Seung Hwan Oh, Kevin Siegrist, and Jonathan Broxton as options for future save situations. Oh compiled 357 career saves pitching in Korea and Japan, and currently ranks among the top eight National League relievers in ERA (1.66), strikeouts (51), Holds (14) and WHIP (0.79). Broxton was an All-Star closer for the Dodgers in 2009 and 2010. He has compiled 118 career saves, though none since 2014. Siegrist is the only Cardinals reliever besides Rosenthal to close a game (May 12) this season. He has tallied seven career saves and entered Saturday with a season ERA of 2.79.|$|E
500|$|Plans to {{move the}} National Museum of Fine Arts from Admiralty House to Auberge d'Italie began in 2013. In September 2014, it was {{announced}} that the <b>move</b> <b>will</b> occur and the new museum would be called MUŻA (from the Maltese acronym Mużew Nazzjonali tal-Arti). It is one of the projects for Valletta's title of European Capital of Culture in 2018. The Malta Tourism Authority was set {{to move out of the}} auberge to premises in Smart City during November 2016 but the move was delayed until February 2017. [...] The auberge's façade was restored between late 2015 and July 2016. Various artistic features from the centrepiece were revealed during this time, and Carafa's bust was also restored. The building's interior is also being restored. Another considered but refuted plan was to reopen the probable original entrance, that would have had an added front staircase on Piazza De Valette.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} {{has been}} supported by the main British political parties {{at the national level}} since its inception, and there has also been support from councillors from each of the main parties at the local authority level. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the scheme in 2014, refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded, particularly in light of the Syrian refugee crisis. In early 2014, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council campaigned for the government to offer resettlement or humanitarian protection to Syrian refugees above and beyond the Gateway quota of 750 per year, [...] "to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees {{from the rest of the}} world". The anniversary of the programme was also the occasion of further criticism of the 750 quota, with some commentators arguing that this is mean-spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with the refugee resettlement programmes of states including the United States, Canada and Australia. Others, such as academic Jonathan Darling, have been more skeptical about expanding the scheme, for fear that any such <b>move</b> <b>will</b> be accompanied by greater restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum in the UK. He argues that [...] "we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota-based scheme at the expense of a more progressive asylum system". Furthermore, he argues that the [...] "hospitality" [...] of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of [...] "compassionate repression", with the UNHCR, the Home Office and local authorities all involved in [...] "sorting, decision, and consideration over which individuals are the 'exceptional cases'", to the exclusion of others.|$|E
