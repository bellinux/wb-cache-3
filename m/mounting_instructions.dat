40|$|Description {{of how to}} make PV modules so {{that they}} are less likely to turn into safety hazards. Making modules {{inherently}} safer with minimum additional cost is the preferred approach for PV. Safety starts with module design to ensure redundancy within the electrical circuitry to minimize open circuits and proper <b>mounting</b> <b>instructions</b> to prevent installation related ground faults. Module manufacturers must control the raw materials and processes to ensure that that every module is built like those qualified through the safety tests. This is the reason behind the QA task force effort to develop a 'Guideline for PV Module Manufacturing QA'. Periodic accelerated stress testing of production products is critical to validate the safety of the product. Combining safer PV modules with better systems designs is the ultimate goal. This should be especially true for PV arrays on buildings. Use of lower voltage dc circuits - AC modules, DC-DC converters. Use of arc detectors and interrupters to detect arcs and open the circuits to extinguish the arcs...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of a portable 6 -degree of freedom static thrust stand for RC-scale jet engines is reported. The stand includes three axial and three lateral load cells measuring static thrust with six degrees of freedom. A pitot probe with single axis position control placed perpendicular to exhaust flow measures stagnation pressure along the nozzle centerline. A pitot probe open {{to the inside of}} the engine nozzle normal to the exhaust flow and near the outlet measures static pressure. A digital scale measures fuel consumption. The engine is mounted with exhaust gases exiting upward avoiding ground effects and thrust acting downward. The test stand instrumentation is interfaced with a laptop computer running National Instruments® LabView 9. 0. The report includes descriptions for test stand structure, hardware, <b>mounting</b> <b>instructions,</b> instrumentation specifications, references to download instrumentation software, complete wiring diagrams, and the test procedures used for testing an RC jet engine. Some testing results are included for a JF- 170 Rhino RC-scale jet engine including graphs for static thrust, fuel consumption, and exit plume pressure profiles. A momentum defect is found in the exit plume of the JF- 170 engine...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Zettel on mounted fencing, several treatises in the Liechtenauer tradition include a group of twenty-six [...] "figures"—single line abbreviations of select couplets and quatrains that seem to summarize them. A parallel set of teachings was recorded by Andre Paurñfeyndt in 1516 called the [...] "Twelve Teachings for the Beginning Fencer"., These teachings are also generally abbreviations of longer passages from the long sword Zettel, and are similarly repeated in many treatises throughout the 16th century.

40|$|Object of {{research}} is the sacred colour unit – blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen – on the priests’s vestments and the curtains in the Holy of Holies in Tabernacle built by Moses under the <b>Mount</b> Sinai’s <b>instructions</b> of God. Holy of Holies is a sacred ritual space that connects the One God and the man. A short review of the methods and achievements of semiotics of colour is launched, including linguistic analisys of Hebrew and Indo-European Colour Terms. The author’s understanding of semiotics of colour is stated – what are the limits and objects of the semiotics of colours. The difference between daily and ritual use of colour is specified. Unlike the everyday use of colours, the ritual colours are treated as a sign system. Hypotheses about colour meanings in the Holy of Holies are presented. They are based on language semantics (lexical, sentence and textual) and cultural unit of colour that serves the function of sacred space – to conduct relations ‘man – God’, ‘God – man’...|$|R
50|$|On February 19, 1951, Mount Sinai Hospital finally {{opened its}} doors under Chief of Staff Dr. Moses Barron. The seven-story, 197 bed {{facility}} was the most modern hospital in the community at the time. Its creation served two purposes: Jewish physicians who had been denied admitting privileges at other city hospitals could now practice medicine, and the founders garnered enormous civic prestige. It was the first private non-sectarian hospital in the community to accept members of minority races on its medical staff. After time, the University of Minnesota Medical School and the Minneapolis General Hospital came to <b>Mount</b> Sinai for <b>instruction,</b> and <b>Mount</b> Sinai established a formal residency teaching program, becoming only one of three privately supported medical institutions {{in the state of}} Minnesota to provide graduate level medical education.|$|R
5000|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism, distinguished service, {{and devotion}} {{above and beyond}} the call of duty. During the first attack by Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, he promptly secured and manned a [...]50 caliber machine gun <b>mounted</b> on an <b>instruction</b> stand in a completely exposed section of the parking ramp, which was under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire. Although painfully wounded many times, he continued to man this gun and to return the enemy's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety. It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention. Following first-aid treatment, although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty, he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes. His extraordinary heroism and conduct in this action are considered to be in keeping with the highest traditions of the Naval Service.|$|R
500|$|The final {{objective}} of the XX Corps, {{as described in the}} [...] "XX Corps Instructions", was to destroy the opposition units at Beersheba, in cooperation with the Desert <b>Mounted</b> Corps. The <b>instructions</b> continued, [...] "The {{objective of the}} attack by the XX Corps on Z day is the capture of the line of works between the Khelasa–Beersheba road and the Wadi esh Sabe, the capture of the enemy guns between Beersheba and the trenches west of the town, and in co-operation with the cavalry to drive the enemy from the remainder of his defences at Beersheba". However, it is claimed, [...] "West of Beersheba the XX Corps had all its objectives and could without doubt have captured Beersheba itself before the mounted troops." [...] The objective of the infantry divisions was not to capture Beersheba, but to keep the main garrison occupied while the Desert Mounted Corps captured the town. The official British historian stated, [...] "The capture of Beersheba itself was the task of the Desert Mounted Corps, which required the water in the town for its horses". [...] "XX Corps Instructions" [...] stated: [...] "outposts will be placed approximately on the 'Blue Line' (Tracing [...] "A") to cover the consolidation of the position and reorganization of the attacking troops." [...] No units were to go beyond the 'Blue Line' without orders or to capture guns.|$|R
40|$|Stab attacks {{generate}} high loads, 1 and {{to defeat}} them, armour {{needs to be}} of a certain thickness and stiffness. 2, 3 Slash attacks produce much lower loads and armour designed to defeat them can be far lighter and more flexible. Methods and subjects: Phase 1 : Human performance in slash attacks: 87 randomly selected students at the Royal Military College of Science were asked to make one slash attack with an instrumented blade on a vertically <b>mounted</b> target. No <b>instructions</b> on how to slash the target were given. The direction, contact forces and velocity of each attack were recorded. Phase 2 : Clinical experience with edged weapon attacks: The location and severity of all penetrating injuries in patients attending the Glasgow Royal Infirmary between 1993 and 1996 were charted on anatomical figures. Results Phase 1 : Two types of human slash behaviour were evident: a ‘chop and drag’ blow and a ‘sweep motion’ type of attack. ‘Chop and drag’ attacks had higher peak forces and velocities than sweep attacks. Shoulder to waist blows (diagonal) accounted for 82 % of attacks, 71 % of attackers used a long diagonal slash with an average cut length of 34 cm and 11 % used short diagonal attacks with an average cut length of 25 cm. Only 18 % of attackers slashed across the body (short horizontal); the average measured cut length of this type was 28 cm. The maximum peak force for the total sample population was 212 N; the maximum velocity was 14. 88 m s− 1. The 95 percentile force for the total sample population was 181 N and the velocity was 9. 89 m s− 1. Phase 2 : 431 of the 500 patients had been wounded with edged weapons. The average number of wounds sustained by victims in knife assaults was 2. 4. The distribution of wounds by frequency and severity are presented. Conclusions Anti-slash protection {{is required for the}} arms, neck, shoulders, and thighs. The clinical experience of knife-attack victims provides information on the relative vulnerabilities of different regions of the body. It is anticipated that designing a tunic-type of Police uniform that is inherently stab and slash resistant will eventually replace the current obvious and often bulky extra protective vest. Attempts at making a combined garment will need to be guided by ergonomic considerations and field testing. A similar anatomical regional risk model might also be appropriate in the design of anti-ballistic armour and combined anti-ballistic and knife-resistant armour...|$|R
