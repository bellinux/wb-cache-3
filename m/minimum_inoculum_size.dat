40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{determinants of}} successful antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis are not precisely known. Differences in half-lives of antibiotics between {{animals and humans}} preclude extrapolation of animal results to human situations. To overcome this limitation, we have mimicked in rats the amoxicillin kinetics in humans following a 3 -g oral dose (as often used for prophylaxis of endocarditis) by delivering the drug through a computerized pump. Rats with catheter-induced vegetations were challenged with either of two strains of antibiotic-tolerant viridans group streptococci. Antibiotics were given either through the pump (to simulate the whole kinetic profile during prophylaxis in humans) or as an intravenous bolus which imitated only the peak level of amoxicillin (18 mg/liter) in human serum. Prophylaxis by intravenous bolus was inoculum dependent and afforded a limited protection only in rats challenged with the <b>minimum</b> <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> infecting > or = 90 % of untreated controls. In contrast, simulation of kinetics in humans significantly protected animals challenged with 10 to 100 times the inoculum of either of the test organisms infecting > or = 90 % of untreated controls. Thus, simulation of the profiles of amoxicillin prophylaxis in human serum was more efficacious than mere imitation of the transient peak level in rats. This confirms previous studies suggesting that the duration for which the serum amoxicillin level remained detectable (not only {{the magnitude of the}} peak) was an important parameter in successful prophylaxis of endocarditis. The results also suggest that single-dose prophylaxis with 3 g of amoxicillin in humans might be more effective than predicted by conventional animal models in which only peak levels of antibiotic in human serum were stimulated...|$|E
40|$|Since Staphylococcus aureus expresses {{multiple}} pathogenic factors, studying {{their individual}} roles in single-gene-knockout mutants is difficult. To circumvent this problem, S. aureus clumping factor A (clfA) and fibronectin-binding protein A (fnbA) genes were constitutively expressed in poorly pathogenic Lactococcus lactis using the recently described pOri 23 vector. The recombinant organisms {{were tested in}} vitro for their adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and fibronectin and in vivo {{for their ability to}} infect rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations. In vitro, both clfA and fnbA increased the adherence of lactococci to their specific ligands to a similar extent as the S. aureus gene donor. In vivo, the <b>minimum</b> <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> producing endocarditis in > or = 80 % of the rats (80 % infective dose [ID 80]) with the parent lactococcus was > or = 10 (7) CFU. In contrast, clfA-expressing and fnbA-expressing lactococci required only 10 (5) CFU to infect the majority of the animals (P < 0. 00005). This was comparable to the infectivities of classical endocarditis pathogens such as S. aureus and streptococci (ID 80 = 10 (4) to 10 (5) CFU) in this model. The results confirmed the role of clfA in endovascular infection, but with a much higher degree of confidence than with single-gene-inactivated staphylococci. Moreover, they identified fnbA as a critical virulence factor of equivalent importance. This was in contrast to previous studies that produced controversial results regarding this very determinant. Taken together, the present observations suggest that if antiadhesin therapy were to be developed, at least both of the clfA and fnbA products should be blocked for the therapy to be effective...|$|E

In order to investigate the influence of different <b>inoculum</b> <b>sizes</b> on MICs of amphotericin B, 5 -fluorocytosine, itraconazole, and miconazole, 32 clinical isolates (8 Aspergillus fumigatus, 8 Aspergillus flavus, 5 Rhizopus arrhizus, 8 Pseudallescheria boydii, and 3 Fusarium solani isolates) were studied by the broth microdilution method. Four <b>inoculum</b> <b>sizes</b> were studied: 1 x 10 (2) to 5 x 10 (2), 1 x 10 (3) to 5 x 10 (3), 1 x 10 (4) to 5 x 10 (4), and 1 x 10 (5) to 5 x 10 (5) CFU/ml. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference method for antifungal susceptibility testing in yeasts was modified and applied to filamentous fungi. The inoculum was spectrophotometrically adjusted, and all tests were performed in buffered medium (RPMI 1640) at pH 7. 0 with incubation at 35 degrees C for 72 h. MICs were read at 24, 48, and 72 h. Amphotericin B showed a <b>minimum</b> effect of <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> on MICs for all species {{with the exception of}} P. boydii (P < 0. 05). A significant effect of <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> on MICs was observed with 5 -fluorocytosine, for which there was an increase of more than 10 -fold in MICs against all Aspergillus spp. between inoculum concentrations of 10 (2) and 10 (4) CFU/ml (P < 0. 001). For itraconazole, the results showed a more species-dependent increase of MICs, most strikingly for R. arrhizus and P. boydii.

30|$|The <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> is an {{important}} parameter that influences both the specific growth rate and fermentation time. Generally, a small <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> requires {{a longer period of}} time to achieve fermentation, whereas large <b>inoculum</b> <b>sizes</b> lead to a rapid increase in biomass and thereby decrease fermentation time. However, extremely large <b>inoculum</b> <b>sizes</b> can also decrease the production yield, potentially due to the overuse of substrate for growth and maintenance at high cell concentrations. Our study confirmed this finding, with caproic acid production decreasing if the initial combined <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> was greater than 10 %. In this study, there was a significant difference in caproic acid production between a 10 % inoculum containing a mix of C. kluyveri H 588 /Methanogen 166 at a ratio of 2 : 1 and all other tested sizes and ratios (Table  1).

We compared the MICs determined spectrophotometrically with those determined by the standard broth macrodilution method (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards approved guideline M 27 -A). The agreement between the results of the spectrophotometric and standard methods for amphotericin B testing was 100 %; this agreement was independent of the <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> and incubation time. On the other hand, the agreement for the results for fluconazole testing and itraconazole testing was dependent on the <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> and incubation time. With large <b>inoculum</b> <b>size,</b> excellent agreement can be achieved at 24 h. With standard <b>inoculum</b> <b>size,</b> acceptable agreement can be achieved only at 48 h.

A central composite design (CCD) combined with {{response surface}} methodology (RSM) were employed to {{study the effects of}} three independent variables: <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> (%), agitation rate (rpm) and temperature (°C) on the biodegradation processes and production of biosolids enriched with fungal biomass protein. The results achieved using A. niger were compared to those obtained using T. virens. The optimal conditions for the biodegradation processes in terms of total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), specific resistance to filtration (SRF) and production of biosolids enriched with fungal biomass protein in fresh POME treated with A. niger and T. virens have been predicted by multiple response optimization and verified experimentally at 19 % (v/v) <b>inoculum</b> <b>size,</b> 100 rpm, 30. 2 °C and 5 % (v/v) <b>inoculum</b> <b>size,</b> 100 rpm, 33. 3 °C respectively. As disclosed by ANOVA and response surface plots, the effects of <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> and agitation rate on fresh POME treatment process by both fungal strains were significant...|$|R
40|$|Protease is {{currently}} a significantly important group of enzymes in industrial scale. The aim {{of the study is}} to optimize the cultural conditions for protease production by Bacillus sp. Five physical factors were analysed and they were <b>inoculum</b> <b>size,</b> incubation time and temperature, pH and agitation rate. Firstly, both the extracellular and intra-cellular protease were analysed for higher enzyme activity and extracellular protease was extracted more. As a result, optimal protease activity occurred at 19. 889 U/ml for <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> of 8...|$|R

Experimentation was carried out to optimize the process parameters for maximum enzyme production by varying the parameters such as pH of the medium, temperature, <b>inoculum</b> <b>size,</b> age of <b>inoculum,</b> agitation and incubation time. The maximum enzyme activity was observed with pH 5. 0, temperature 30 °C, <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> 6 % (v/v) having 20 h age, under shaking conditions (100 rpm) after 24 h of incubation...|$|R
40|$|The form {{of growth}} of Mucor rouxii (National Regional Research Laboratory 1894) under {{nitrogen}} is dependent on <b>inoculum</b> <b>size.</b> With a large inoculum (106 spores inoculated per ml), the morphology consists mainly of swollen spores with some filaments and yeastlike cells. At lower inoculum levels growth is filamentous. The morphology of this strain on incubation under nitrogen and the dependence of the form of growth on <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> {{are similar to those}} found previously for other strains of M. rouxii...|$|R
30|$|At {{inoculum}} volume < 10 % (v/v), {{an improved}} distribution CO 2 {{as well as}} more efficient nutrient uptake also leads to a higher growth of algae when <b>inoculum</b> <b>size</b> was low, although optical density of cell suspension was found to be low. This {{may be due to the}} overpopulated culture and fixed amount of nutrient with which the microorganisms begin to liberate proteolytic enzyme enhancing self-consumption (Srinath et al. 2002; Jayanthi et al. 2013). So fixed amount of inoculums were optimized and 10 % (v/v) of inoculum volume gave the best result than other <b>size</b> of <b>inoculum.</b> On the other hand, higher <b>inoculum</b> <b>sizes</b> [> 10 % (v/v)] could result in the lack of carbon dioxide and depletion of nutrient in the culture media. So the maximum phycoremediation of arsenic [either As(III) or As(V)] was found using 10 % <b>inoculum</b> <b>size.</b>|$|R
