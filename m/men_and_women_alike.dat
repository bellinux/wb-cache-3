Certain clothing was common to both genders such as the tunic and the robe. Around 1425 to 1405 BCE, a light tunic or short-sleeved shirt was popular, as well as a pleated skirt.|$|R
40|$|This writing {{analyzes}} Amina Wadud’s view {{on gender}} in Islam. The issue put forward {{is on the}} question of Wadud’s reading method on gender in the Qur’an. This paper reveals that according to Wadud there are three main principles to solve gender problems, namely, tauhîd, taqwa and khalîfah. The principles of tauhîd and taqwa show equality because al-Qur’an prescribes that no one is being having more self-esteem except with the quality of taqwa. Wadud calls these principles as tauhidic paradigm. While the principle of khalîfah in al-Qur’an requires Muslim, both <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> <b>alike,</b> to become an agent of moral custodian to maintain the harmony of the world. She also urges that the Qur’an be interpreted holistically by considering three aspects; the context of revelation, stylistic and grammar of text, as well as weltanschauung or worldview of the text. As such she designates her methodology as a tauhidic hermeneutic, since upon this methodology, {{it can be argued that}} the Qur’an looks at <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>woman</b> equally...|$|R
25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>alike</b> feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects {{that he or she}} is being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E

The women tattooed their mouths, and sometimes the forearms. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional dress was a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree, called attusi or attush. Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.|$|E

500|$|From 1904 onwards, Bondfield was {{increasingly}} occupied {{with the issue}} of women's suffrage. In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>alike,</b> regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke. This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was [...] "talked out" [...] in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, {{in the course of a}} public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification. She wished good luck to those fighting for a [...] "same terms as men" [...] suffrage bill, but [...] "don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class". The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000. Her departure, she said, was [...] "alike a grief and a deliverance".|$|E

Corruption is not a contemporary affair, it has been on for so long in Africa. No regime in Africa can be exonerated from it. The menace has reached an unprecedented level most especially during Babangida and Abacha regimes which saw the institutionalization of the statement syndrome. The era of Obasanjo witnessed a crusade against corrupt politicians and government official. During his eight year reign the country witnessed the establishment of EFCC and ICPC two bodies that was saddled with the responsibility of prosecuting corrupt officials, {{in their effort to}} sanitize the polity.
