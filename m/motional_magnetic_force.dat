40|$|The {{distribution}} of the self-induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> in a section of a model coronal loop is examined and {{it is found that}} an axial current produces a pointwise <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> in the direction toward the axis of the loop.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two new {{theories and}} a new current representation to explain the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> between two filamentary current elements {{as a result of}} electric force interactions between current charges. The first theory states that a current has an electric charge relative to its moving observer. The second theory states that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> is an electric force in origin. The new current representation characterizes a current as equal amounts of positive and negative point charges moving in opposite directions at the speed of light. Previous work regarded electricity and magnetism as different aspects of the same subject. One effort was made by Johnson to unify the origin of electricity and magnetism, but this effort yielded a formula that is unequal to the well-known <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> law. The explanation provided for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> depends on three factors: 1) representing the electric current as charges moving at the speed of light, 2) considering the relative velocity between moving charges, and 3) analyzing the electric field spreading in the space due to the movement of charges inside current elements. The electric origin of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> is proved by deriving the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> law and Biot-Savart law using the electric force law.

40|$|Purpose: To map the {{distribution}} of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> induced in the human head during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4 T for a large group of healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: The magnetic field distribution in the head of 100 men and 18 women was mapped using phase mapping techniques. Statistical parametric map-ping methods using a family-wise error (FWE) corrected threshold P < 0. 05 and region-of-interest analyses were used to assess the significance of the results. Results: Eyeballs, orbitofrontal and temporal cortices, subcallosal gyrus, anterior cingulate, midbrain, and brain-stem (pons) are the brain regions most susceptible to mag-netic force. The strength of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> density in the head was lower than 11. 5 6 5. 3 N/m 3 (right eyeball). The strength of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> density induced in occi-pital cortex varied linearly with the x-rotation (pitch) angle. Conclusion: We found that the induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> is highly significant in the eyeballs, orbitofrontal and tempo-ral cortices, subcallosal gyrus, anterior cingulate as well as midbrain and brainstem (pons), regardless of subjects’ age or gender. The maximum induced <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> was 6 105 times weaker than the gravitational force; thus, biological effects of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> during imaging are not expected to be significant.

Numerical simulation results from a series of DOE have indicated that the dimension of core and the magnetic material block have the influence on planar electromagnetic actuators.
