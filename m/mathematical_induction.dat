5|$|By <b>mathematical</b> <b>induction,</b> a setQ is convex if and onlyif every convex {{combination}} of members ofQ also belongs toQ.

5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of <b>mathematical</b> <b>induction.</b> It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

The generalization procedure is iterated in a bottom-up fashion to construct nested inductions. Consequently, it can also find inductions whose induction formula is a limited form of bounded quantification...|$|R

5000|$|Also {{introduced}} by Chou in 1976 was the median-effect plot {{which is a}} plot of log (D) vs log (fa)/(1-fa) or log (fa)/(fu) yields a straight line with slope (m) and the x-intercept of log (Dm), where Dm equals to the anti-log of the x-intercept. This unique theory holds true for all dose-effect curves that follows the physico-chemical principle of the mass-action law, for all entities regardless of the first-order or higher-order dynamics, and regardless of unit or mechanism of actions.3 MEE is derived by system analysis using enzyme kinetics and <b>mathematical</b> <b>inductions</b> and deductions where hundreds of mechanism specific individual equations are reduced to a single general equation. 3 Both left and right sides of the MEE are dimensionless quantities. When the m and Dm are determined, the full dose-effect curve is defined. Since the median-effect plot yields straight lines, the theoretical minimum of only two data points allow the drawing of the full dose-effect curve, when the effect is accurately determined. This fundamental revelation defies the common held belief that two data points cannot draw a defined does-effect curve. The main significance of MEE is the mediation that [...] "Dose" [...] and [...] "Effect" [...] or [...] "Mass" [...] and [...] "Function" [...] are interchangeable. The [...] "Mass" [...] vs [...] "Energy" [...] was defined E=MC2 for subatomic fission and fusion; Now [...] "Mass" [...] vs [...] "Action" [...] is defined by MEE for supramolecular dynamics.|$|R

Having proved these two steps, the rule of inference establishes the statement to be true for all natural numbers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{explains}} {{the performance of}} the induction motor drive by using vector control to overcome the coupling effect and inferior dynamic response of scalar control. The basic idea of the vector control is to decompose a stator current into a magnetic field-generating component) (dsi and a torque generating component) (qsi and both components can be separately controlled to make {{the performance of the}} AC machine similar to that of DC machine. This paper also gives the mathematical modeling explained with d-q reference frame. The control used in this paper controls the speed in four quadrants without any additional control elements. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified by using MATLAB/SIMULINK Software and results are presented to validate the effectiveness of topology.

40|$|Operational logical {{relations}} and bisimulations are two particularly successful syntactic techniques for reasoning about program equivalence.

In this paper we give an alternative formulation of a SI logical relation in the style of Appel-McAllester-Ahmed. We derive this from a definition that is parametric on the indexing scheme by requiring it to satisfy the desirable properties of a SI logical relation. We then argue that SI logical {{relations and}} KW bisimulations approximate the same relation each in a distinct way.
