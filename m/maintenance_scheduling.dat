5000|$|Resource {{leveling}} is {{also useful}} {{in the world of}} maintenance management. Many organizations have maintenance backlogs. These backlogs consist of work orders. In a [...] "planned state" [...] these work orders have estimates such as 2 electricians for 8 hours. These work orders have other attributes such as report date, priority, asset operational requirements, and safety concerns. These same organizations have a need to create weekly schedules. Resource-leveling can take the [...] "work demand" [...] and balance it against the resource pool availability for the given week. The goal is to create this weekly schedule in advance of performing the work. Without resource-leveling the organization (planner, scheduler, supervisor) is most likely performing subjective selection. For the most part, when it comes to <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling,</b> there is less, if any, task interdependence, and therefore less need to calculate critical path and total float.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This study {{considers}} {{the problem of}} determining operation and <b>maintenance</b> <b>schedules</b> for a containership equipped with components during its sailing according to a pre-determined navigation schedule. The operation schedule, which specifies work time of each component, determines the due-date of each maintenance activity, and the <b>maintenance</b> <b>schedule</b> specifies the actual start time of each maintenance activity. The main constraints are component requirements, workforce availability, working time limitation, and inter-maintenance time. To represent the problem mathematically, a mixed integer programming model is developed. Then, due to the problem complexity, we suggest a heuristic {{for the objective of}} minimizing the sum of earliness and tardiness between the due-date and the starting time of each maintenance activity. Computational experiments were done on various test instances and the results are reported.

40|$|AbstractThe whole Electric Power System {{includes}} three aspects: Generation, Transmission and Distribution that all need maintenance to enhance system reliability and energy efficiency. Most unit <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> (MS) packages consider preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> for generating units over {{one or two}} years time horizon in order to minimize the total operation costs while satisfying system energy requirements. The inclusion of network constraints in generating unit maintenance will increase the complexity of the problem. This paper mainly considers the generation <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> taking into account the system security and reliability indices. For more realistic study transmission, security constraints as well as crew constraints and system reliability indices such as amount of not supplied energy are considered for the proposed <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem.

30|$|A {{handful of}} {{researches}} have {{devoted to the}} preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> in the recent years, {{most of which are}} attempts for coordinating preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> with the production line (Moghaddam and Usher 2011; Fitouhi and Nourelfath 2012; Nourelfath and Chatelet 2012). In this respect, some researchers also focus on the optimization of preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> (Moradi et al. 2011; Nourelfath et al. 2012; Xiaojun et al. 2012). Munoz et al. (1997) are among the first researchers who proposed the genetic algorithm as an optimization tool for preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>scheduling</b> (Lapa et al. 1999, 2000; Munoz et al. 1997) and then Lapa et al. (2006) used the genetic algorithm for the optimization of maintenance and inspection intervals in a new approach. Most of the schedules were originally developed for power plants but shortly after that the optimized scheduling was employed for mechanical components (Tsai et al. 2001) and then for production lines (Sortrakul et al. 2005). So far, it has not been used in the drilling industry.|$|E
