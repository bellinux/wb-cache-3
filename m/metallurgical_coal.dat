25|$|Coal mining {{began an}} {{expansion}} {{phase in the}} late 1960s with the signing of long-term contracts to supply <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coal</b> to the booming Japanese steel industry. This was of little benefit to Atlantic Canada, but led to the re-opening of closed mines {{and the development of}} new mines in Alberta and BC. Around the same time, Alberta and Saskatchewan began to use their substantial coal resources to generate electricity. Crude oil price increases in the 1970s and early 1980s increased the demand for coal worldwide. New mines opened in Alberta and BC, and new port facilities were built in BC to supply the growing demand in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coal),</b> which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The result is pig iron, and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make steel.|$|E

500|$|The {{downward}} moving {{column of}} ore, flux, coke or charcoal and reaction products must be porous {{enough for the}} flue gas to pass through. [...] This requires the coke or charcoal to be in large enough particles to be permeable, meaning there cannot be an excess of fine particles. Therefore, the coke must be strong enough so {{it will not be}} crushed by the weight of the material above it. Besides physical strength of the coke, it must also be low in sulfur, phosphorus, and ash. This necessitates the use of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coal,</b> which is a premium grade due to its relative scarcity.|$|E

50|$|Ukrainian {{reserves}} of hard coals {{are concentrated in}} the Donets Basin. More than two hundred coal mines of Donbass account for 90% of Ukrainian coal output; the balance comes from 18 mines in Lviv Oblast and Volyn Oblast. Metallurgical-grade coals account for 54% of national coal reserves.

Coal mining in Donbass is in continuous financial distress: the majority of coal mines, owned by the government, operate at a loss and require regular financial aid.

60|$|But anyhow I do {{not think}} there is much good {{in a kind of}} witch-smelling among Italian {{enterprises}} to find the hidden German. Certain things are necessary for Italian prosperity and Italy must get them. The Italians want intelligent and helpful capital. They want a helpful France. They want bituminous coal for metallurgical purposes. They want cheap shipping. The French too want <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coal.</b> It is more important for civilisation, for the general goodwill of the Allies and for Great Britain that these needs should be supplied than that individual British money-owners or ship-owners should remain sluggishly rich by insisting upon high security or high freights. The control of British coal-mining and shipping is in the national interests--for international interests--rather than for the creation of that particularly passive, obstructive, and wasteful type of wealth, the wealth of the mere profiteer, is as urgent a necessity for the commercial welfare of France and Italy and the endurance of the Great Alliance as it is for the well-being of the common man in Britain.|$|E
60|$|But we {{must admit}} that at present they do so only in a very rhetorical sense. There is no real council of {{empowered}} representatives, and nothing {{in the nature of}} a united front has been prepared. Unless we provide beforehand for something more effective, Italy, France, the United States, Japan, and this country will send separate groups of representatives, with separate instructions, unequal status, and very probably conflicting views upon many subjects, to the ultimate peace discussions. It is quite conceivable--it is a very serious danger--that at this discussion skilful diplomacy {{on the part of the}} Central Powers may open a cleft among the Allies that has never appeared during the actual war. Have the British settled, for example, with Italy and France for the supply of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coal</b> after the war? Those countries must have it somehow. Across the board Germany can make some tempting bids in that respect. Or take another question: Have the British arrived at common views with France, Belgium, Portugal, and South Africa about the administration of Central Africa? Suppose Germany makes sudden proposals affecting native labour that win over the Portuguese and the Boers? There are a score of such points upon which we shall find the Allied representatives haggling with each other in the presence of the enemy if they have not been settled beforehand.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{weathering}} on the modification of chemical, petrological and rheological properties of four <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coals</b> in different rank and geology was investigated. And that of coke qualities of these coals was investigated by 25 kg pilot coke oven. Weathering tests {{were carried out}} by storing coal in 20 ton pile on an open industrial yard for up to 208 days. Coal characteristics and coke qualities were monitored over an interval of one month. The mixture of four <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coals</b> was used to investigate the effect of weathering duration on the modification of coal blending as well. With increasing weathering, oxygen concentration was increased as expected, and calorific values were marginally decreased. This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the caking properties of coals such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties of coals is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values of all cokes marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank of coals and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the coke size decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity of coal blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges of individual coals. Coke strength of coal blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|R

30|$|The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} coke quality {{is important for}} the selection and valuation of <b>metallurgical</b> <b>coals.</b> Whilst many prediction models exist, they tend to perform poorly for coals beyond which the model was developed. Further, these models general fail to directly account for physical interactions occurring between the blend components, through the assumption that the aggregate properties of the blend are suitably representative of the overall behavior of the blend. To study this assumption, a parameter termed the vitrinite distribution category was introduced to directly account for the distribution of one of these commonly aggregated parameters, the vitrinite reflectance. The introduction of this parameter in a regression model for coke quality prediction improved the model fit. The vitrinite distribution category was demonstrated to provide new information about coal blending decisions, and was found to be capable of providing insight into the behavior of different blending structures. Residual analysis was applied to explore the behavior of the coke quality prediction model, with the vitrinite distribution category found to explain more than just {{the presence or absence of}} coals within a blend. This work provides the foundation of future studies in examining coal blending decisions, with the proposed parameter having the potential to be applied as part of a coke quality prediction model to optimize coal blending decisions.|$|R
