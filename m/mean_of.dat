5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often {{moves through the}} trees on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American {{squirrel monkey}}s, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, with a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these {{are believed to be}} temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
50|$|However, {{production}} {{not only}} involves labor, but also certain <b>means</b> <b>of</b> labor: tools, materials, {{power plants and}} so on. These <b>means</b> <b>of</b> labor—also known as <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production—are often the product of another labor process as well. So the labor process inevitably involves these <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production that already enter the process {{with a certain amount}} of value. Labor also requires other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production that are not produced with labor and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms <b>of</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production resulting from another labor process, LTV treats the magnitude of value <b>of</b> these produced <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production as constant throughout the labor process. Due to the constancy of their value, these <b>means</b> <b>of</b> production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.|$|R

Results from this analysis show, that the selection <b>of</b> the best <b>means</b> <b>of</b> transport is not single valued.
