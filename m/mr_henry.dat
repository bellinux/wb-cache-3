His second wife, Mrs Dashwood, and their daughters, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, inherit only a small income. On his deathbed, <b>Mr</b> <b>Henry</b> Dashwood extracts a promise from his son John {{to take care of}} his half-sisters. John's greedy wife, Fanny, soon persuades him to renege on the promise appealing to his envy for his father's apparent preference for his second family and his fatherly concerns about dinimishing his own son's inheritance. John and Fanny immediately move in as the new owners of Norland, while the Dashwood women are treated as unwelcome guests by a spiteful Fanny. Mrs Dashwood seeks somewhere else to live. In the meantime, Fanny's brother, Edward Ferrars visits Norland and soon forms an attachment with Elinor. Fanny disapproves of the match and offends Mrs Dashwood with the implication that Elinor is motivated by money.|$|E

The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E

25|$|These were {{followed}} in later years, by other extensive factories filled with valuable machinery. Adjoining the saw mill mentioned, {{was a large}} woolen factory, which had just got into active operation when it was swept away by a most destructive fire in 1863, which also consumed the sawmill and its contents, and also a large planing mill and sash and door factory just erected by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Henry</b> Lye in close proximity. This great loss for a time checked {{the progress of the}} village, and paralyzed the enterprise of several active and industrious citizens. Another large factory erected for a cotton mill, a wool carding and knitting factory, and a bit larger saw mill than the former one, had in the meantime been erected {{on the south side of}} the river, just below the bridge, and these important structures with their valuable machinery, continue in active operation, and not only reflect much credit upon the enterprise of the place, but contribute much towards its prosperity.|$|E

This fishing village named Api-Api (see Original names above) was chosen due to its proximity to the North Borneo Railway and its natural port that provided good anchorage, which was up to 24feet deep.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, an {{additional}} public house {{existed at the}} northern edge of the village near Norwood Farm and was known as The Woodman's Arms (and possibly also as The Norwood Arms). The pub was recorded on Ordnance Survey maps of the village between 1870 and 1946, but as of May 2012, the building is a Grade II listed private dwelling. Other listed buildings in the village include the timber-framed houses Norwood Manor and Blacksmiths Cottage. A large country house now known as Wormshill Court and [...] bordered to the north and east by a brick wall includes the outbuildings of Manor Farm. The property is part of a large estate which has for several generations belonged to the Nightingale family. The house and farm is also shown on a map of 1636 and at that time appears to represent the only building in the village other than the church and the rectory. In 1858 a further map of the manor named the property Court Lodge Farm and included an inset plan showing the exchange of land between the governors of Christ's Hospital and a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Henry</b> Hudson.|$|E

2500|$|In 1900 {{the owners}} of Alexandra Palace and Park were {{threatening}} to sell them for redevelopment, but a consortium of public-spirited men in the district, headed by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Henry</b> Burt, J.P. {{a member of the}} Middlesex County Council and the Hornsey District Council, at once embraced the opportunity of securing the palace and the beautiful grounds for the people of London. A committee was formed by <b>Mr</b> <b>Henry</b> Burt, J.P. and the consortium managed to raise enough money to purchase them just in time. By the Alexandra Park and Palace (Public Purposes) Act 1900, a charitable trust was created; representatives of the purchasing local authorities became the trustees with the duty to keep both building and park [...] "available for the free use and recreation of the public forever". In 1921 a plaque was erected at the entrance of the south terrace in honour of Henry Burt J.P. who was the originator of the proposal to purchase the palace and park for the people. His subsequent services and splendid financial help should here be recorded and his name held in remembrance by all who appreciate this great public possession. It is this duty that the present trustee, the London Borough of Haringey, is currently trying to overturn, protesters fear, by selling the building to a commercial developer. The palace passed {{into the hands of the}} Greater London Council in 1967, with the proviso that it should be used entirely for charitable purposes, and their trusteeship was transferred to Haringey council in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tributes to}} Henry upon his death were many. The Virginia Gazette printed a death notice bordered in black, [...] "As long as our rivers flow, or {{mountains}} stand, Virginia... {{will say to}} rising generations, imitate my H". The Petersburg Intelligencer regretted {{the death of a}} man who might have been able [...] "to conciliate all parties and produce that harmony and accord" [...] needed at a time of national controversy. The Argus, a paper which supported Jefferson's faction, noted that Henry [...] "pointed out those evils in our Constitution... against which we now complain... If any are deposed to censure <b>Mr.</b> <b>Henry</b> for his late political transition , if anything has been written on that subject, let the Genius of American Independence drop a tear, and blot it out forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his death, Purcell was honoured {{by many of}} his contemporaries, {{including}} his old friend John Blow, who wrote An Ode, on the Death of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Henry</b> Purcell (Mark how the lark and linnet sing) with text by his old collaborator, John Dryden. William Croft's 1724 setting for the Burial Service, {{was written in the}} style of [...] "the great Master". Croft preserved Purcell's setting of [...] "Thou knowest Lord" [...] (Z 58) in his service, for reasons [...] "obvious to any artist"; it has been sung at every British state funeral ever since. More recently, the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote a famous sonnet entitled simply [...] "Henry Purcell", with a headnote reading: [...] "The poet wishes well to the divine genius of Purcell and praises him that, whereas other musicians have given utterance to the moods of man's mind, he has, beyond that, uttered in notes the very make and species of man as created both in him and in all men generally." ...|$|E
