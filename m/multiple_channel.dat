40|$|A {{computer}} network {{consists of a}} set of computing nodes interconnected via communication channels. It is commonly assumed that, for each pair of network nodes u and v, there is at most one channel from u to v. However, it is often desirable to have <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes. That is, for every pair of network nodes u and v, there may be <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> from u to v. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing deterministic quality of service guarantees when there are <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes. We show that any packet scheduling protocol that operates over a single channel can be modified to operate over <b>multiple</b> <b>channels.</b> In addition, this transformation increases the packet delay through the node by only a small amount. However, having <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> between nodes may cause packet reorder. This reorder significantly increases the upper bound on end-to-end delay. We show how this increase in delay is avoided through the use of efficient sorting techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{multichannel}} protocols {{are designed}} to share <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> and allow non interfering use of channels through single transceiver. The IEEE 802. 11 standard allows {{for the use of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> available at the physical layer, but its MAC protocol is designed only for a single channel. A single-channel MAC protocol does not work well in a multi-channel environment, because of the multi-channel hidden terminal problem. Our proposed protocol enables hosts to utilize <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> by switching channels dynamically, thus increasing network throughput while increasing network analysis time. The protocol requires only one transceiver per host, but solves the multi-channel hidden terminal problem using temporal synchronization. Our scheme improves network throughput significantly, especially when the network is highly congested. The simulation results show that our protocol successfully exploits <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> to achieve higher throughput than IEEE 802. 11 and DCA protocol...|$|R

40|$|Wireless technologies, such as IEEE 802. 11 a, {{that are}} used in ad hoc {{networks}} provide for <b>multiple</b> non-overlapping <b>channels.</b> Most ad hoc network protocols that are currently available are designed to use a single channel. However, the available network capacity can be increased by using <b>multiple</b> <b>channels.</b> This paper presents new protocols specifically designed to exploit <b>multiple</b> <b>channels.</b> Our protocols simplify the use of <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> by using <b>multiple</b> interfaces, although the number of interfaces per host is typically smaller than the number of channels. We propose a link layer protocol to manage <b>multiple</b> <b>channels,</b> and it can be implemented over existing IEEE 802. 11 hardware. We also propose a new routing metric for multi-channel multi-interface networks, and the metric is incorporated into an on-demand routing protocol that operates over the link layer protocol. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in significantly increasing network capacity, by utilizing all the available channels, even when the number of interfaces per host is smaller than the number of channels.

Recently cooperative {{spectrum sensing}} is proposed as an efficient way to achieve better sensing accuracy. It makes use of multiple nodes to sense a channel and then analyzes their results together to get more accurate results. Several works have been conducted to study this technology and they mostly focus on the cooperation in individual channels. However, cognitive radio networks usually deal with <b>multiple</b> <b>channels,</b> therefore the coordination among <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> needs be studied to fully explore the potential of cooperative sensing. In this paper we focus on the coordination among <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> in cooperative spectrum sensing. We at first study the theoretical improvement made by multi-channel coordination, then propose a centralized and a distributed algorithm to implement it. The theoretical analysis proves cooperative sensing can be improved significantly if the coordination among <b>multiple</b> <b>channels</b> is considered. To verify our analysis, we measure licensed channels then conduct simulations basing on collected data. The results show that the proposed algorithms can approximate optimal solution very well...|$|R
