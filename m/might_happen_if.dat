25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen quite clearly when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at other loci might act as modifiers.

25|$|Salmon {{have been}} genetically {{modified}} in laboratories {{so they can}} grow faster. There is opposition to the commercial use of these fish, and, as of 2006, no approval has been given. A Canadian company, , has developed a modified Atlantic salmon which grows nearly twice as fast (yielding a fully grown fish at 16–18 months rather than 30), and is more disease resistant and cold tolerant. It also requires 10 percent less food. This was achieved using a chinook salmon gene sequence affecting growth hormones, and a promoter sequence from the ocean pout affecting antifreeze production. Normally, salmon produce growth hormones only {{in the presence of}} light. The modified salmon doesn't switch growth hormone production off. The company first submitted the salmon for FDA approval in 1996. In 2015, FDA has approved the AquAdvantage Salmon for commercial production. A concern with transgenic salmon is what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> they escape into the wild. One study, in a laboratory setting, found that modified salmon mixed with their wild cohorts were aggressive in competing, but ultimately failed.|$|E

The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers.

The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months.

Lafayette, who had been promoted to Lieutenant General on 30 June 1791, received command {{of one of the}} three armies, the Army of the Centre, based at Metz, on 14 December 1791. Lafayette did his best to mold inductees and National Guardsmen into a cohesive fighting force, but found that many of his troops were Jacobin sympathizers and hated their superior officers. [...] This emotion was common in the army, as demonstrated after the Battle of Marquain, when the routed French troops dragged their leader to Lille, where he was torn to pieces by the mob. One of the army commanders, Rochambeau, resigned. Lafayette, along with the third commander, Nicolas Luckner, asked the Assembly to begin peace talks, concerned at what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> the troops saw another battle.|$|E

As an example, Pound relates what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> a European {{is asked to}} define [...] "red". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it {{described in terms of}} vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power. Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once [...] "Bacon had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after Galileo and others had stopped discussing things so much, and had begun really to look at them". Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and Stravinsky. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.|$|E

The storyline was conceived when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed a documentary about homelessness, featuring a mother and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> a paedophile were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap.

Mr. Griffin was based on the personality of a drama teacher one of Duncan's daughters had in high school who [...] "was very strict and demanded that her students do the best work they were capable of doing", but for whom Duncan's daughter was later grateful.

500|$|The Japanese {{name of the}} series, , became officially romanized as New Super Android Cutey Honey or New Cutey Honey.

Unlike the {{original}} Cutie Honey, the series is an [...] "OVA" [...] (original video animation), one made for home video formats such as VHS tape. OVAs {{are known for their}} higher quality than anime television series, and Toei felt the new Honey was especially high-quality because (according to them) each episode used ten thousand cels, three times the usual number. By November 1994, series planner Naoko Takahashi said that Honey was tentatively set to last twelve episodes, with more to be considered later, but the series was cut short at the eighth episode, released in late November 1995. [...] Several scenes in that episode have unshaded foregrounds, partly drawn characters with missing legs, or both. A script for a planned ninth episode was produced as a drama CD voiced by the series' original voice actors. Its English dub, made by ADV Films in 1998, features Jessica Calvello, who was hand-picked by Nagai to perform the voice of Honey. In a post at the Anime on DVD forums, voice actor and writer George Manley—who has worked for the Houston-based ADV—praised both Neya and Calvello's work in Honey as examples of [...] "impressive" [...] performances, and said that the series, whose dub was released four years before he began voice work, [...] "was the title, and I often admit this, that brought me back to watching anime and started me on a long road to, 'Wow, I wonder what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> I moved to Houston....|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, France {{had been}} badly {{shaken by the}} Great Mutinies of the French Army {{in the spring of}} 1917 {{following}} the failure of the Nivelle Offensive together with a huge strike wave, and at the time, many believed that France might simply collapse as a result of war exhaustion. In July 1917, a new government under Georges Clemenceau, aka [...] "le tigre", had come into power, utterly committed to winning the war. In this context, having one German spy for whom everything that went wrong with the war so far could be blamed was most convenient for the French government, making Mata Hari the perfect scapegoat, which explains why the case against her received maximum publicity in the French press, and led to her importance in the war being greatly exaggerated. The Canadian historian Wesley Wark stated in a 2014 interview that Mata Hari was never an important spy and just made a scapegoat for French military failures which she had nothing to do with, stating: [...] "They needed a scapegoat and she was a notable target for scapegoating". Likewise, the British historian Julie Wheelwright stated: [...] "She really did not pass on anything that you couldn’t find in the local newspapers in Spain". Wheelwright went on to describe Zelle as [...] "...an independent woman, a divorcee, a citizen of a neutral country, a courtesan and a dancer, which made her a perfect scapegoat for the French, who were then losing the war. She was kind of held up as an example of what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> your morals were too loose”.|$|E

[...] Their trial strategy of arguing that the two Chiefs were simply fighting a war for their people's survival attracted worldwide attention, and galvanized opposition to the entire process. [...] Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs also opted to oppose the entire process, and also argued that the two chiefs were not subject to civilian jurisdiction since their people were at war with the United States. [...] Nor were the Indians apologetic. [...] At his trail Satanta warned what <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> he was hanged: [...] " [...] I am a great chief among my people. If you kill me, it will be like a spark on the prairie. It will make a big fire – a terrible fire!" [...] Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, as was Big Tree; but Edmund Davis, the Governor of Texas, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment for both was changed to life imprisonment. [...] Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas.
