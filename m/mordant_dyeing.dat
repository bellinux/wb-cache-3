50|$|Dyeing {{of clothes}} in ancient India was practised {{as an art}} form. Five primary colours (Suddha-varnas) were {{identified}} and complex colours (Misra - varnas) were categorised by their many hues. Sensitivity was shown to the most subtlest of shades; the ancient treatise, Vishnudharmottara states five tones of white, namely Ivory, Jasmine, August moon, August clouds after {{the rain and the}} conch shell. The commonly used dyes were indigo(Nila), madder red and safflower. The technique of <b>mordant</b> <b>dyeing</b> was prevalent in India since the second millennium BC.

40|$|In this study, a {{traditional}} Chinese herbal medicine—PentaHerbs formula (PHF), usually {{used for the}} treatment of atopic dermatitis, was successfully coated onto cotton fabrics by means of dyeing methods, i. e., <b>mordant</b> <b>dyeing</b> and direct dyeing process. Alum, copper sulphate and calcium chloride were used as mordant agents, and the mordanting processes adopted were pre-mordanting and post-mordanting process. The coated cotton fabrics with herbal medicine were mainly analyzed in terms of colour strength (K/S value) and drug loading using spectrophotometric analysis. Besides, the change of weight of the coated fabrics was also measured via gravimetric method. It was found that the mordanting process could significantly improve the drug loading, especially for the pre-mordanting process, compared with the direct dyeing method. Among the three mordants, alum treated fabrics had the highest drug loading. The results indicate that <b>mordant</b> <b>dyeing</b> process might be a promising way to develop herbal medicine garments. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

By the use of chemical software JChem (ChemAxon) it was found that <b>mordant</b> <b>dye</b> exhibiting stability in Fenton solution bears hydroxyl group with high dissociation constant, pK= 2, 57.

40|$|Aluminium {{sulphate}} {{was chosen}} as the simplest mordant, and purpurine (1, 2, 4 -hydroxyanthraquinone) as the simplest dye suitable for use in experiments with mordants. It was shown by a series of experiments that a solution containing about 16 atoms of aluminium to each molecule of purpurine has special properties. A section already dyed with an aluminium/purpurine solution till chromatin is dark and cytoplasm lightly tinged, is in equilibrium with such a solution: that is to say, it neither takes up more dye nor loses any part of what it already holds. If the proportion of dye to mordant is increased, the section will take up more of the dye; if the proportion of the mordant to the dye is increased, the section will lose part or all of the dye it held. The experiments described in the paper, taken in conjunction with existing know-ledge of the behaviour of aluminion ions in solution and of their capacity to form chelate compounds with anthraquinonoid dyes, afford a basis for the following theory of single-bath <b>mordant</b> <b>dyeing</b> by aluminium/purpurine.

To obtain optimum interaction of fabric, mordant, dye and fixer, washing procedure has been performed using Turkish Red Oil (TRO) before mordanting stage with varying washing time and repeated dyeing procedure with varying frequency of dyeing.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{stability}} (in terms of half-life time) and decolourisation efficiency of free and immobilised laccase was determined in four industrial dyeing effluents. The dyeing liquors composition and the chemical {{structure of the}} dyes influence significantly the stability and the decolourisation ability of the enzyme. The dyeing in enzymatically decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent provided consistency of the colour with both bright and dark dyes. Additionally the number of washing cycles necessary to remove the hydrolyzed dyestuff from dyed textiles was reduced using an enzymatic pre-treatment. In decolourisation experiments with immobilised laccase, two phenomenons were observed - initial decolourisation due to adsorption on the support and dye degradation due to the enzyme action. This research focuses on the stability and decolourisation ability of free and immobilised laccase in industrial dyeing effluents and their reuse for dyeing. In our experiments {{the stability of the}} immobilised laccase in dyeing liquors was unexpectedly lower than the stability of the free enzyme. The stability of the laccase in dyeing effluents {{is a result of the}} additive effect of all components presented. The decrease of enzymatic activity could be associated with the potential protein – dyeing effluent components interactions. Azoaromatic sulfonate dye anions could provide enzyme stabilisation. However, the structure of the immobilised laccase possibly became less accessible than the free enzyme for interaction with the anionic dyes, and thereby the stabilisation was not efficient. Non-ionic surfactants present in the dyeing liquors are able to stabilise the enzyme in solution by formation of a surrounding shell. The surfactant stabilisation was effective only on free enzyme. The salts in the dyebaths also displayed enzyme stabilising properties. The presence of CrVI and CrIII in the <b>mordant</b> <b>dyeing</b> effluent could cause significant loss of activity. The colour removal with immobilized laccase is due to the additive effects of dye-support adsorption, dye-protein adsorption and enzymatic dye degradation. In the decolourisation experiments carried out in pure dyes, the higher the hydrophilicity of the dye, the lower was the decolourisation. The Reactive Blue 158 adsorbed on the alumina support could act as mediator in laccase-assisted reactions, explaining the higher decolourisation of Reactive Black 5 with immobilized enzyme. The decolourisation efficiency in dyeing effluents was affected by the stabilization/destabilisation interactions in the dyeing formulation. Acceptable colour difference was achieved in dyeing with dyebaths prepared with laccase decolourised Reactive Black 5 effluent. Enzymatic treatment of dyed textiles provided water savings, reducing the number of the after-dyeing washing cycles. E...|$|E
