5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began {{to adapt to the}} changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary. The professors surmised {{that it would be}} cheaper to build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E
5|$|When it was re-released in 1947, {{it earned}} an {{impressive}} $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, {{and was one}} of the top ten releases of the year. Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it to retain its position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as Ben-Hur, but it was finally overtaken by The Sound of Music in 1966. The 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most lucrative picture after Doctor Zhivago from the latter half of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the release, with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million, placing it second only to The Graduate for that year. Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only The Sound of Music, The Graduate and Doctor Zhivago making <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> distributors. A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record from The Sound of Music, bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of 1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing the record again the following year to The Godfather.|$|E

25|$|In nature, {{males and}} females usually differ in {{reproductive}} fitness optima. Males generally prefer to maximize their number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to care <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> offspring and have fewer mates. Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource. This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors which can help them acquire mates.|$|E
25|$|The ruins are {{remarkable}} <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> {{extent than}} their magnificence: the chief objects of interest are the projecting corbels {{in the eastern}} front, which appear to have supported an open corridor; there are some large vaults, which were probably prisons. The walls, broken in many places, and intersected with remaining windows, assume, from different points of view, striking varieties of perspective scenery. After the great civil war, the edifice was dismantled, {{and part of the}} materials sold.|$|E

After the Trek, the Saskatchewan government provided free transportation as a peace sign back to the west. The camps were soon dismantled and replaced by seasonal relief camps run by the provinces, and that paid the men slightly <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> labor than the earlier camps. Although the Trek did not reach Ottawa, its reverberations certainly did. Several demands of the Trekkers were eventually met, and the public support that galvanized behind the Trek {{set the tone for}} the social and welfare provisions of the postwar era.|$|E

25|$|The lack {{of trained}} {{military}} {{was one of}} the most pressing difficulties of the revolutionary government in Buenos Aires. Besides the Patricios Regiment and other corps formed during the British invasions, the only troops with some experience were the Blandengues, lancers militia recruited to patrol the borders of the territories still controlled by indigenous people (mapuche and ranquel). Until 1812, with the arrival of veterans from the Napoleonic Wars, that would join as officers, the army was basically a militia. Most of the commanders were civilians or junior officers, put in charge <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> political leanings, status in society or charisma than for their military capacity.|$|E
25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or {{simply because they}} want to be paid <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than fair market prices.|$|E
25|$|Robert Henry Lyttelton (18 January 1854 – 7 November 1939) was an English cricketer who {{appeared}} in seven first-class matches between 1873 and 1880. A member of the Lyttelton family who were prominent in English cricket {{in the mid to}} late 1800s, he did not play county cricket, but appeared for a number of representative sides, in which players were often chosen <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> social status than their cricketing ability. In his later years he was known for his views about sportsmanship in cricket, and he successfully campaigned for changes in the laws of the game to penalise blocking the wicket with the legs. He published two books about cricket and collaborated with others on two more.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, two {{prominent}} geologists, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their {{studies of the}} geology of Wales to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology. They did fundamental work on the Old Red Sandstone but are remembered <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> work on the lower Palaeozoic sequence. It was Sedgwick who established the Cambrian system and Murchison first described the Silurian, naming it for the ancient Silures tribe which occupied mid Wales. An overlap between the two systems as mapped led eventually to protracted dispute between the two erstwhile collaborators. After their deaths, Charles Lapworth erected the Ordovician system (again named for an ancient tribe of northwest Wales, the Ordovices), {{to account for the}} sequence of rocks {{at the heart of the}} controversy.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is also}} possible, {{by holding}} the seam at an angle and rolling the fingers {{over the surface of}} the ball, to produce a {{deliberate}} off cutter in which the ball veers away from the off side when it bounces on the pitch, or leg cutter in which it veers away from a right-handed batsman. Former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement one way or the other. Some bowlers deliberately use cutters <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch - a tactic very effectively used by Mustafizur Rahman.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the selling}} of Liberty Bonds, the {{government}} raised $ for the war effort. The majority of sales were not to individuals but to banks and financial groups that ignored the patriotic appeal and bought the bonds principally as an investment opportunity. The bond campaigns themselves proved relatively ineffective at gaining widespread public support. The majority of Americans were simply uncomfortable converting {{a significant portion of}} their savings into what was, for them, a new and uncertain form of investment. The forceful sales atmosphere associated with the Liberty Bond campaigns ultimately produced disappointing sales figures. As such, the bond campaigns are remembered <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> associated level of coercion and bullying than its patriotic and voluntary nature. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. would face a balancing act between coercion and volunteerism in his bond campaigns during World War II.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{is unusual}} in that it has only {{slightly}} modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is valued at 25 cents, a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc meant that both the US one- and five-cent coins became worth <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) contained about two cents' worth of copper.|$|E
25|$|Billy Cannon {{took the}} kickoff {{to open the}} second half and {{returned}} it from the goal-line to midfield. LSU drove down the field and Brodnax scored on a three-yard run up the middle. Miami quarterback Fran Curci then led the Hurricanes on a drive down to the LSU 20, but the ball was turned over on downs. Neither team scored {{for the rest of}} the quarter. LSU opened the fourth quarter with two incomplete passes, and Cannon got off a 51-yard punt down to Miami's 15-yard line. The Hurricanes were also forced to punt, and a fair catch interference penalty on Miami gave LSU the ball at the 16. From there, Rabb passed to Brodnax down to the one-yard line, where Cannon ran it in for a touchdown on the next play. Miami received the kickoff and returned it to its own 35-yard line, but a holding penalty moved the ball back to the twelve. The Hurricanes went three-and-out and punted to midfield, where Purvis received it and ran it back to Miami's 22-yard line. Four plays later, Matherne passed to Don Norwood for a four-yard touchdown. LSU's Henry Lee Roberts intercepted a pass from Curci at midfield and the Tigers drove down the field once <b>more</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> last touchdown of the game.|$|E

The pair bowled unchanged for 30overs each, and claimed five wickets apiece as Somerset were dismissed for 105. Only Frederick Smith and Challen reached double figures, scoring 37 and 39. In response, Gloucestershire totalled 242, during which Bastard claimed four wickets, three {{of them from the}} tail. Somerset batted admirably in their second innings, with Roe and Hewett both scoring half-centuries (76 and 66 respectively), and they reached 246, six of the wickets falling to Woof, who collected eleven in the match. Gloucestershire achieved victory for the loss of just one wicket in their second innings, subjecting Somerset to their fifth successive loss.|$|E

Ivory, who was a trained wrestler, won the Women's Championship on June 14, by defeating Debra and defended her title against Tori at SummerSlam on August 22. Her feud with Tori turned Ivory into a villainous character. Ivory continued to feud with Tori in the weeks following SummerSlam, defeating her in the first ever WWF women's hardcore match on September 6. Ivory was then challenged by Luna Vachon, who Ivory defeated in a farcical hardcore match at Unforgiven on September 26. SLAM! Wrestling called the match [...] "pointless and senseless".
