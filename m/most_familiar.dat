5|$|Many other oxyanions form complexes; {{these include}} copper(II) acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and copper(II) carbonate. Copper(II) sulfate forms a blue {{crystalline}} pentahydrate, the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> copper compound in the laboratory. It {{is used in}} a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} Latin prose {{author of}} the Augustan age is the historian Livy, whose account of Rome's founding and early history became the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> version in modern-era literature. Vitruvius's book De Architectura, the only complete work on architecture to survive from antiquity, also belongs to this period.|$|E

5|$|Zinc is most {{commonly}} used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (coating of iron or steel) is the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893 thousand tonnes of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.|$|E
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E

5|$|In the {{previous}} year, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center {{found out that}} 56% of Russians felt pride and admiration at the anthem, even though only 40% (up from 19% in 2004) knew the first words of the anthem. It was also noted in the survey that the younger generation was the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> with the words.|$|E
5|$|Now {{known to}} be related to the Vangidae of Madagascar, the Artamidae are a {{collection}} of crow-like birds as well as the smaller woodswallows. They include some of the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> and most accomplished songbirds of the Australian (and Tasmanian) landscape. Six species are found in Tasmania. One is endemic and two more are endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Probably the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> form of {{cellular}} signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that {{has reached the}} end of one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is made possible by the action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E
50|$|The Wintuan languages, Takelma and Kalapuya, {{absent from}} this list, {{continue}} to be considered Penutian languages by <b>most</b> scholars <b>familiar</b> with the subject, often in an Oregonian branch, though Takelma and Kalapuya are no longer considered to define a branch of Penutian.|$|R

5|$|Tchaikovsky wrote many {{works that}} are {{popular with the}} {{classical}} music public, including his Romeo and Juliet, the 1812 Overture, his three ballets (The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty) and Marche Slave. These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto, the last three of his six numbered symphonies and his operas The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin, are among his <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> works. Almost as popular are the Manfred Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, the Capriccio Italien and the Serenade for Strings.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> {{condensed}} phases are solids and liquids {{while more}} exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems. The study of {{condensed matter physics}} involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an electric circuit, one of the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> forms of current, is thus deemed positive {{in the opposite direction}} to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E
50|$|Panola Mountain is 3.63 miles (5.84 km) to the southwest. While {{designated}} as one peak on USGS maps, <b>most</b> users <b>familiar</b> {{with the area}} consider the rock formation to be two peaks: Arabia Mountain to the northeast, and Bradley Mountain to the southeast, connected by a low saddle.|$|R

5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> with Adams and he was {{instrumental}} in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E
5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|The {{green algae}} {{are a large}} group of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.|$|E
50|$|Most if not {{all modern}} {{combines}} are equipped with hydrostatic drives. These are larger {{versions of the same}} system used in consumer and commercial lawn mowers that <b>most</b> are <b>familiar</b> with today. In fact, it was the downsizing of the combine drive system that placed these drive systems into mowers and other machines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> people <b>familiar</b> {{with this}} term {{understood}} {{it as the}} one who introduces superproduction, mainly based on the story of Wincenty Pstrowski, a miner who in 1947 achieved 270 percent of expected efficiency per month. Later Pstrowski died due to misconducted dental intervention, but in popular opinion it was due to deadly exhaustion.|$|R
60|$|Lord Lambeth sat {{nearly an}} hour with his American friends; {{but it is not}} our purpose to relate their {{conversation}} in full. He addressed a great many remarks to the younger lady and finally turned toward her altogether, while Willie Woodley wasted a certain amount of effort to regale Mrs. Westgate. Bessie herself was sparing of effusion; she thought, on her guard, of what her sister had said to her at luncheon. Little by little, however, she interested herself again in her English friend very much as she had done at Newport; only it seemed to her he might here become more interesting. He would be an unconscious part of the antiquity, the impressiveness, the picturesqueness of England; of all of which things poor Bessie Alden, like <b>most</b> <b>familiars</b> of the overciphered tabula rasa, was terribly at the mercy.|$|R
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans began using plant alkaloids in medical preparations as early as 3000 B.C. Although the active components of most medicinal plants have been isolated only recently (beginning in the early 19th century) these substances {{have been used as}} drugs throughout the human history in potions, medicines, teas and as poisons. For example, to combat herbivory by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, Cinchona trees produce a variety of alkaloids, the <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> of which is quinine. Quinine is extremely bitter, making the bark of the tree quite unpalatable, it is also an anti-fever agent, known as Jesuit's bark, and is especially useful in treating malaria.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of aperiodic tilings {{of the plane}}. A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have {{a finite number of}} shapes, called prototiles, and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The <b>most</b> <b>familiar</b> tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.|$|E
