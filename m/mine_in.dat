2500|$|In {{portions}} of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role.

Silver is a distant second, with [...] worth $69million <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> 2004 (see Silver <b>mining</b> <b>in</b> Nevada). Other minerals <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium.

5|$|Most copper is mined or {{extracted}} as copper sulfides {{from large}} open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> Utah, United States and El Chino <b>Mine</b> <b>in</b> New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey in 2005, Chile {{was the top}} producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites {{in the state of}} Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.|$|E

50|$|The first {{underground}} shaft <b>mine</b> {{was built}} <b>in</b> {{the region in}} 1874 near Scammon.
