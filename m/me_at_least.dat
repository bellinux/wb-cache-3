The Daily Telegraph had partly revealed the book's principal theme three months earlier: [...] "The publishers hope to establish 'Pinfold' as a household word meaning 'half round the bend'." [...] This comment followed closely on the release of Muriel Spark's first novel, The Comforters, which also dealt with issues of drug-induced hallucination. Although {{it would have been}} in Waugh's commercial interests to have ignored or downplayed Spark's book, he reviewed it generously in The Spectator on 22 February 1957: [...] "a complicated, subtle and, to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> an intensely interesting first novel".|$|E
500|$|In the {{publishing}} world, Willis {{was known as}} a shrewd magazinist and an innovator who focused on appealing to readers' special interests while still recognizing new talent. In fact, Willis became the standard by which other magazinists were judged. According to writer George William Curtis, [...] "His gayety [...] and his graceful fluency made him the first of our proper 'magazinists'". For a time, it was said that Willis was the [...] "most-talked-about author" [...] in the United States. Poe questioned Willis's fame, however. [...] "Willis is no genius–a graceful trifler–no more", he {{wrote in a letter to}} James Russell Lowell. [...] "In <b>me,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> he never excites an emotion." [...] Minor Southern writer Joseph Beckham Cobb wrote: [...] "No sane person, we are persuaded, can read his poetry".

Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay.

[...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a couple of minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming.

2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>least)</b> that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on the other foot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s Bunin, having become {{interested}} in the new Soviet literature, in particular the works of Aleksandr Tvardovsky and Konstantin Paustovsky, entertained plans of returning to the Soviet Union, as Aleksandr Kuprin had done in the 1930s. In 1946, speaking to his Communist counterparts in Paris, Bunin praised the Supreme Soviet's decision to return Soviet citizenship to Russian exiles in France, still stopping short of saying [...] "yes" [...] to the continuous urging from the Soviet side for him to return. [...] "It is hard for an old man {{to go back to}} places where he's pranced goat-like in better times. Friends and relatives are all buried... That for me would be a graveyard trip," [...] he reportedly said to Zhukov, promising though, to [...] "think more of it."

2500|$|The 1980s {{were a very}} {{turbulent}} time in Sweden that {{initiated the}} occasional decline of Social Democratic Party rule. In the 1980s, pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernized paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialized, and mechanical engineering was digitalized. In 1986, one of the Social Democratic Party's strongest champions of egalitarianism and democracy, Olof Palme was assassinated. Swedish capital was increasingly moving Swedish investment into other European countries as the European Union coalesced, and a hegemonic consensus was forming among the elite financial community: progressive taxation and pro-egalitarian redistribution became economic heresy. A leading proponent of capital's cause at the time, Social Democrat Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt reminisced in an interview, [...] "The negative inheritance I received from my predecessor Gunnar Sträng (Minister of Finance, 1955–1976) was a strongly progressive tax system with high marginal taxes. This was supposed {{to bring about a}} just and equal society. But I eventually came to the opinion that it simply didn't work out that way. Progressive taxes created instead a society of wranglers, cheaters, peculiar manipulations, false ambitions and new injustices. It took <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a decade to get a part of the party to see this." [...] With the capitalist confederation's defection from the 1938 Saltsjöbaden Agreement and Swedish capital investing in other European countries rather than Sweden, as well as the global rise of neoliberal political-economic hegemony, the Social Democratic Party backed away from the progressive Meidner reform.|$|E

[...] Egberto comes across the couple, sends Mina away, and then confronts Godvino, offering him the choice of two proffered swords. [...] Godvino refuses to take one. [...] The older man continues to press him ("Are you dead to any sense of honour?"), accusing him of cowardice and stating that he will reveal him to be a bastard. [...] At that remark, Godvino accepts the challenge and the two men fight until interrupted by the arrival of Aroldo. [...] Stating that [...] "I speak in the name of God", Aroldo tries to force the two men to stop their fighting.
