40|$|<b>Molinate</b> is a {{recalcitrant}} thiocarbamate used {{to control}} grass weeds in rice fields. The recently described <b>molinate</b> hydrolase, from Gulosibacter molinativorax ON 4 T, {{plays a key role}} in the only known <b>molinate</b> degradation pathway ending in the formation of innocuous compounds. Here we report the crystal structure of recombinant <b>molinate</b> hydrolase at 2. 27 Å. The structure reveals a homotetramer with a single mononuclear metal-dependent active site per monomer. The active site architecture shows similarities with other amidohydrolases and enables us to propose a general acid-base catalysis mechanism for <b>molinate</b> hydrolysis. <b>Molinate</b> hydrolase is unable to degrade bulkier thiocarbamate pesticides such as thiobencarb which is used mostly in rice crops. Using a structural-based approach, we were able to generate a mutant (Arg 187 Ala) that efficiently degrades thiobencarb.

40|$|Abstract This work {{aimed at}} {{studying}} {{variations on the}} diversity and composition of the bacterial com-munity of a rice paddy field floodwater, subjected to conventional management, namely by using the herbicide <b>molinate.</b> The promotion of the herbi-cide biodegradation either by the autochthonous mic-robiota or by a bioaugmentation process was also assessed. This study comprehended four sampling campaigns at key dates of the farming procedures (seeding, immediately and 6 days after application of the herbicide <b>molinate,</b> and after synthetic fertiliza-tion) and the subsequent physic-chemical and micro-biological characterization (pH, DOC and <b>molinate</b> contents, total cells, cultivable bacteria and DGGE profiling) of the samples. Multivariate analysis of the DGGE profiles showed temporal variations in the bacterial community structure and the Shannon’s index values indicated that the bacterial diversity reached its minimum at the <b>molinate</b> application day. The highest bacterial diversity coincided with the periods with undetectable concentrations of the herbi-cide, although microcosm assays suggested that other factors than <b>molinate</b> may {{have been responsible for}} the decrease of the bacterial diversity. The ability of autochthonous microorganisms to degrade <b>molinate</b> and the influence of the herbicide on the bacterial community composition were assessed in microcosm assays using floodwater collected at the same dates. Given <b>molinate</b> was not degraded by autochthonous microorganisms, and considering it represents an environmental contaminant, bioaugmentation micro-cosms were assayed aiming the assessment of the feasibility of a bioremediation process to clean con-taminated floodwater.

The combination of five cultivable isolates, purified from the enrichment culture, permitted the reconstitution of a degrading consortium.

Among the five isolates constituting the defined mixed culture, an actinomycete, strain ON 4, was essential for biodegradation, being involved in the cleavage of the thioester bond of <b>molinate,</b> the initial step of the degradation pathway. Isolate ON 4 was able to grow on <b>molinate</b> at concentrations below 2 mM, with the accumulation of ethanethiol and diethyl disulphide. These sulphur compounds were toxic to strain ON 4 when accumulating at higher concentrations. However, this inhibitory effect was avoided by the presence of other members of the mixed culture, out of which isolates ON 1 and ON 2 were observed to consume ethanethiol and diethyl disulphide.

40|$|<b>Molinate</b> is a thiocarbamate {{herbicide}} used {{worldwide in}} rice crop protection. As with other pesticides, <b>molinate</b> is a recognized environmental pollutant, detected in soils, irrigation water, or rivers and bio-accumulated by some wildlife forms. For this reason, {{and in spite}} of its low toxicity to humans, environmental protection measures, which include reduction of use and/or remediation processes, are recommended. Due to its physic-chemical properties, <b>molinate</b> can easily disperse and react in the environment, originating diverse transformation products, some with increased toxicity. In spite of being a xenobiotic compound, <b>molinate</b> can also suffer microbial transformation by bacteria or fungi, sometimes serving as nutrient and energy source. In an attempt to isolate microorganisms {{to be used in the}} bioremediation of molinatecontaminated sites, a mixed culture, dominated by the actinobacterium Gulosibacter molinativorax ON 4 T, was recovered from the runoff of a molinate-producing plant. Beyond a promising tool to decontaminate molinate-polluted sites, this culture also brought interesting insights into the biology of the degradation of this herbicide.

Aiming the development and future implementation of a bioremediation process to treat natural waters polluted with <b>molinate,</b> a molinate-mineralizing culture, composed of Pseudomonas chlororaphis ON 1 and Gulosibacter molinativorax ON 4 T (designated DC 1), was assayed in paddy field floodwater microcosms. The influence of abiotic (temperature, presence of other herbicides) and biotic (floodwater autochthonous microbiota) factors on <b>molinate</b> mineralization by culture DC 1 was assessed. In parallel, the proportion of the introduced strains in filter-sterilized floodwaters was monitored by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). <b>Molinate</b> mineralization and growth of culture DC 1 were observed under all tested conditions, although the kinetic parameters (maximum specific growth and degradation rates) were significantly affected by the environmental conditions and culture media used. Additionally, these two factors were observed to have a statistically significant interaction. The lowest values of both kinetic parameters were observed at 15 °C. The presence of the herbicides propanil, bentazone and MCPA, frequently applied in rice culture protection, did not affect the degrading capacity of culture DC 1. Furthermore, it was possible to infer that the autochthonous microbiota does not retard or limit <b>molinate</b> biodegradation, given the growth and degradation rates by culture DC 1 were higher in non-sterile microcosm assays. Although G. molinativorax ON 4 T is known to promote the initial breakdown of <b>molinate,</b> P. chlororaphis ON 1 appeared to be responsible to pull up the process, since higher proportions of this organism were found at the exponential growth and <b>molinate</b> degradation phase.

40|$|A novel pathway of <b>molinate</b> {{mineralization}} {{promoted by}} a defined mixed culture composed of five bacteria (named ON 1 to ON 5) was proposed previously. Evidence was obtained of a metabolic association between Gulosibacter molinativorax ON 4 T, capable of <b>molinate</b> breakdown, {{and the remaining}} bacteria. In the present study, the role of each isolate in that metabolic association was further explored and the possible synergistic effect of all the bacterial isolates for {{the stability of the}} mixed culture is discussed. The cleavage of the <b>molinate</b> thioester bond, whether occurring under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, releases ethanethiol (S-ethyl moiety) and an azepane moiety derivative, identified as azepane- 1 -carboxylic acid. This azepane moiety is degraded, in the presence of oxygen, by Pseudomonas strains ON 1 and ON 3 and G. molinativorax ON 4 T. Ethanethiol, which inhibits G. molinativorax ON 4 T, is consumed by Pseudomonas strain ON 1 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ON 2. Although a two-member mixed culture of G. molinativorax ON 4 T and Pseudomonas strain ON 1 was able to promote the aerobic mineralization of <b>molinate,</b> after 20 successive transfers of the five-member mixed culture in mineral medium with <b>molinate,</b> none of these isolates were lost.

40|$|The {{detection}} of pesticides in drainage water from rice in the MIA that frequently exceeded NSW Environmental Protection Agency {{guidelines for the}} protection of aquatic ecosystems led to rice growers with-holding water for up to 28 days. This project investigated the effects of different irrigation management systems on the dissipation of these chemicals after they are sprayed onto the free water of rice fields and accumulation of salt when water containing pesticides was retained on farm. A model was evaluated for its ability to simulate the fate of the pesticide <b>molinate</b> and hence predict the load in rice floodwaters prior to drainage. The aim of the project was to provide improved methods to minimize off-farm pesticide contamination. Dissipation of <b>molinate</b> and thiobencarb was determined in a 27 ha commercial rice field using a ‘static’ bankless channel irrigation system. The half-life was found to be 2. 7 days for <b>molinate</b> (@ 2 L/ha), and 3. 6 days for thiobencarb, (@ 3. 75 L/ha). The time required for the highest average concentration to dissipate to EPA Notification Levels of 3. 4 μg/L for <b>molinate</b> and 2. 8 μg/L for thiobencarb would be 24. 4 days and 21. 5 days, respectively. Subsequently, the dissipation of <b>molinate,</b> thiobencarb, clomazone and chlorpyrifos was determined in a small plot trial consisting of 12 individual plots. The half-life for <b>molinate</b> was 4. 7 days @ 2 L/ha and 4. 2 - 5. 6 days @ 3. 75 L/ha. The half-life for thiobencarb ranged between 3. 4 - 4. 1 days when applied at 3. 75 L/ha. The half-life of clomazone applied at 0. 5 L/ha was 2. 9 - 7. 2 days. The half-life for chlorpyrifos applied at 0. 1 L/ha was 5. 4 days. The persistence for <b>molinate</b> ranged from 33. 6 to 42 days; for thiobencarb ranged from 22. 2 to 29. 6 days and for chlorpyrifos ranged from 48. 6 to 59. 4 days to reach EPA notification levels. Although there are no set EPA Notification Levels for clomazone, it would take 14 days for values to dissipate to 3 μg/L. These data would suggest that the current withholding period of 28 days is adequate for complete dissipation of thiobencarb and clomazone but in some situations is inadequate for dissipation of <b>molinate</b> and chlorpyrifos. The effect of sampling position within bays and proximity of bays to water inflow points on pesticide concentration was studied in a commercial rice field with a bankless channel and zig-zag water flow pattern. Sampling position within a bay had a significant (P< 0. 05) effect on the concentration of the insecticide chlorpyrifos and the herbicide <b>molinate</b> but only in the bay which was closest to the water inflow point, not in other bays. The concentration of both <b>molinate</b> and chlorpyrifos increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in a direction distal from the bankless channel. There was no significant effect on the proximity of levees to sampling position. Concentrations of <b>molinate</b> and chlorpyrifos were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) in the top bay compared with two other bays located down the fall of the field, further away from the supply of water. The herbicide benzofenap was not affected by the sampling position within any of the bays, but the concentrations in the bay nearest the supply were all significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than in other two bays.

The largest surface water exposure concentrations of glyphosate, <b>molinate</b> and thiobencarb in San Joaquin and Sacramento Basins were 39. 0000 μg/L, 44. 0900 μg/L and 16. 9000 μg/L respectively. For the effect assessment toxicity data for fish from laboratory studies was retrieved from databases and the open scientific literature. The most sensitive fish to glyphosate was Oreochromis sp.

40|$|Pesticides {{have been}} used to control various types of pests, {{including}} plants and insects, for thousands of years, however the impact of exposure to these toxic chemicals, with respect to environmental and health consequences, is not fully understood. Two pesticides of interest, <b>molinate</b> and dieldrin, have been shown to cause neurotoxicity in humans, but their mechanisms of toxicity are still unknown. In order to better understand how exposure to these chemicals can cause toxicity, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) was defined to determine how specific changes to the structure of each pesticide affects the toxicity profiles of each of these compounds. Results of this study demonstrated that oxidation of <b>molinate</b> to <b>molinate</b> sulfoxide, and then further to <b>molinate</b> sulfone, a more potent inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase. The sulfone metabolite is capable of covalently modifying the active-site cysteine residue of aldehyde dehydrogenase, accounting for the observed enzyme inhibition. These results indicate that the compound responsible for the toxicity from <b>molinate</b> exposure is not the parent compound, but rather one of the sulfoxidation metabolites. When the SAR of dieldrin was investigated with respect to a Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease model, it was determined that the compounds that were previously found to be the least potent insecticides were the most toxic with respect to dopaminergic cells. Each of the compounds tested was observed to disrupt dopamine metabolism in accordance with their toxicity profiles in dopaminergic cells. In combination, these results implicate important structural features responsible for the toxicity with respect to Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease. This information is critical for the development of new pesticides, and will be important to increase the selective toxicity for insects while minimizing adverse/off-target effects. This can lead to the development of safer, more effective pesticides that will be essential for future environmental and human health...|$|E

This study constitutes the first attempt to predict pesticide exposure in surface-water and groundwater systems of a rice watershed using a combination of GIS and modeling. A rice-cultivated watershed in the region of Lombardy, province of Pavia, Italy was selected. The community of Tromello is bypassed by the river Terdoppio, which along with drainage canals and streams creates a rice watershed of 467 ha, comprising 201 paddies. The watershed was conceptualized using a combination of the rice water quality (RICEWQ 1. 6. 4 v) and river water quality (RIVWQ 2. 02) models. Spatial GIS data (land use, soil properties and hydrology), on-site scouting and personal interviews with the farmers were used for modeling parameterization. Application of RICEWQ in each of the paddies provided groundwater predicted environmental concentrations for the herbicides propanil and <b>molinate.</b> Groundwater predicted concentrations did not exceed 0. 1 mu g/L in any of the propanil-treated paddies, unlike <b>molinate,</b> whose predicted concentrations exceeded 0. 1 mu g/L in 7 of the 31 molinate-treated paddies.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that nano scale zero-valent iron (nZVI) oxidizes the herbicide <b>molinate</b> when it {{is used in the}} presence of oxygen. Further batch and column experiments were conducted to investigate the potential application of nZVI for the treatment of contaminants. Results of batch studies reveal a rapid initial degradation of <b>molinate</b> followed by slower degradation over more than a day. Additional insight into the nZVI-mediated process has been obtained from studies of the formation of para-hydroxybenzoic acid ((p) -HBA) from the oxidative degradation of benzoic acid with slow ongoing production of (p) -HBA over 24 h observed after an initial pulse of byproduct production. Addition of EDTA enhances the initial pulse by 50 % but does not appear to reduce surface passivation over a longer time frame. Oxygen availability during the initial pulse appears to be a limiting factor. Results of column studies reveal that the arrangement of the nZVI, sand and gravel within the column strongly affect the degradation performance despite each column having the identical nZVI loading. Under the optimal column configuration, > 90 % removal of 100 ppb <b>molinate</b> was observed over a 3 h period.

The most significant points of this review are: 0 Rice acreage decreased from 1994 by four percent; use of the herbicides increased and use of the insecticides decreased. 0 Concentrations of the five rice pesticides exceeded: performance goals in at least one Sacramento Valley * agricultural drain during May and June. <b>Molinate</b> was the only rice pesticide detected in the Sacramento River. Concentrations were less than 0. 2 parts per billion. l The moat. significant sources of rice pesticides in surface water appear to be aerial drift and seepage beyond the field perimeter. -. -r...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} {{and preservation of}} aquatic ecosystems is of utmost importance due to the high diversity and density of species and their complex food network. The evaluation of the potential adverse environmental impact caused by pesticides entering water bodies is an important parameter in aquatic toxicity. The toxicity of the insecticide, Fenitrothion and two of its metabolites, 3 -methyl- 4 nitrophenol and 3 -methyl- 4 -nitroanisole, and of the herbicides Thiobencarb and <b>Molinate,</b> commonly used in rice fields in Valencia near the protected area of lake Albufera, has been tested by using the Microtox™ system. The 15 min EC 50 values obtained with the marine luminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri showed that the Thiobencarb was the most toxic of the three tested pesticides with an EC 50 value of 0. 03 mg/l. The EC 50 values {{of the first two}} steps of the Fenitrothion hydrolysis indicated that while the first metabolite, 3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenol, was as toxic as its parent compound, a decreased toxicity was observed for the second metabolite, 3 -methyl- 4 -nitroanisole. In order to analyze the toxic effects of pesticides in complex mixtures the EC 50 values of Fenitrothion, <b>Molinate</b> and Thiobencarb as pure substances and their mixtures were compared. The impact of the pesticides in the natural ecosystem was also studied and a protective effect of lake water was observed...|$|E
40|$|Since {{maintaining}} {{high water}} quality {{standards in the}} state remains a high priority, monitoring for pesticides in water sources must continue. Determining the type, concentration, and characteristics of any pesticides present in water supplies {{are essential to the}} overall assessment of water quality. Five independent locations, implementing contained water management systems and recyclable water, were monitored in 1995 and 1996. Irrigation, runoff, and pond water samples were collected every 10 to 14 days between permanent flood establishment and draining. Water samples were transported to the laboratory and extracted for 16 pesticides using solid phase extraction (SPE) techniques. Quantification and confirmation of pesticide residues were obta 1 ned by HPLC and GC/MS analysis. The lower limit of quantitation for all pesticides was between 1. 0 - 1. 3 pg L- 1 in water. Pesticides selected for monitoring were determined after assessing state recommendations and our analytical capabilities. Pesticides included: benomyl, bensulfuron methyl, carbaryl, carbofuran, 2, 4 -D, fenoxaprop ethyl, propiconazole, malathion, MCPA, methyl parathion, <b>molinate,</b> pendimethalin, propanil, iprodione, quinclorac, triclopyr, and thiobencarb. Since each field location was independently managed, individual results are site specific. 2, 4 -D, benomyl, <b>molinate,</b> propanil, quinclorac, thiobencarb, and pendimethalin were the pesticides actually applied during the seasons. These pesticides were detected, usually at trace levels, in tailwaters shortly after application but did not appear to buildup in the reservoirs. Quinclorac residues in the tailwaters were more persistent (up to 8 weeks) than the other detected compounds (less than 2 weeks) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, rice weed control in California was simple and heavily {{dependent}} on two primary products, <b>molinate</b> and bensulfuron-methyl (Table 1). Other grass materials included thiobencarb (Bolero, Abolish) and propanil in designated areas. By {{the end of the}} decade, the pattern of grass herbicide use grew more complex, driven in part by events affecting broadleaf materials. Widespread resistance to bensulfuron among several broadleaf and sedge species stimulated increased phenoxy herbicide use. Subsequently, drift onto cotton in the Sacramento Valley caused a dramatic reduction in use of MCPA and 2, 4 -D after 1997. Concurrently; thiobencarb and propanil use increased because they are effective on smallflower umbrellasedge...|$|E

40|$|Self-assembling {{proteins}} forming amyloid fibrils {{are promising}} {{candidates for the}} fabrication of biomaterials, due to the chemical and mechanical stability of their structures. Among potential applications, their use as platforms for enzyme immobilization is rapidly gathering attention. In this work, we demonstrate that {{the production of the}} enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fused to the class I hydrophobin Vmh 2 from Pleurotus ostreatus represents an invaluable tool for the development of self-immobilizing enzymes useful for high throughput analyses. The proposed immobilization strategy is versatile since it can be applied, in principle, to every recombinant protein able to refold from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. A GST based biosensor has been developed to quantify toxic compounds, such as the pesticides <b>molinate</b> and captan, in aqueous environmental samples. The main advantages of this sensor include simplicity and speed of preparation, high sensitivity, reusability, and accuracy...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic aquatic model (DynA model) was {{previously}} developed {{to predict the}} fate of a chemical in aquatic scenarios characterized by daily or periodic changes in several input parameters. DynA model is here calibrated with data obtained from the literature in specific unsteady state scenarios, such as those of rice fields. The results obtained for two herbicides (cinosulfuron and pretilachlor) in rice paddy scenarios revealed the capability of the model to accurately predict water and sediment concentrations, as shown by some statistical indicators. Modelling efficiency (EF) values of 0. 86 – 0. 99 for the water compartment and of 0. 77 – 0. 84 for sediment show the good agreement between predicted and measured concentrations. An ‘‘external validation’’ was performed using measured data for a different herbicide (<b>molinate)</b> applied in a Portuguese paddy rice scenario. A sensitivity analysis for this volatile chemical revealed the influence of some climatic parameters (e. g. temperature) to the model outcomes, such as water and sediment concentrations. This confirmed the capability of DynA model as an efficient tool for the pesticide risk assessment in dynamic scenario...|$|E
40|$|Ceara, Brazil is {{considered}} important region of agribusiness {{of the country}} due to the installation of various fruit exporting companies. The present work has as main objective investigate twelve types of pesticides (<b>molinate,</b> atrazine, methyl parathion, malathion, chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion, pendimenthalin, triazophos, bentazone, azoxystrobin, propiconazole, difenoconazole) used {{in the region to}} assess the level of contamination of waters used for potable and irrigation. Analysis of pesticides were performed using chromatographic techniques (SPME-GC/MS and SPE-HPLC/DAD) through methodologies validated according to parameters recommended by ABNT. Among the 60 water samples, 48 were positive for {{at least one of the}} twelve active ingredients studied. Fungicides propiconazole and difenoconazole were detected more frequently. The total pesticide levels ranging from 0. 11 - 17. 30 µg/L were detected in the samples. The levels detected in surface and groundwater were lower than the limits established in Brazil, but 80 % of the samples analyzed were above total pesticide levels established by the European Community (> 0. 5 µg/L). Prolonged exposure to pesticides can cause adverse effects to human health and the aquatic ecosyste...|$|E
40|$|A Gram-positive, molinate-degrading bacterium, strain ON 4 T (=DSM 13485 T=LMG 21909 T), was {{isolated}} from a mixed bacterial culture able to mineralize the herbicide <b>molinate.</b> The strain was strictly aerobic, oxidase- and catalase-positive and non-acid-fast, with {{a growth temperature of}} 10 – 41 6 C. It contained the major menaquinone MK- 9 and a cell-wall peptidoglycan based on D-ornithine. 16 S rDNA sequence {{analysis revealed that}} the strain formed a distinct line of descent in the family Microbacteriaceae, showing the highest 16 S rDNA similarity (~ 95 %) to members of the genus Curtobacterium and ‘Brevibacterium helvolum’ DSM 20419 (=ATCC 13715). The latter was reported to have the cell-wall peptidoglycan type B 2 c and the major menaquinone MK- 9, which are typical of Clavibacter, but it is clearly separated from this genus at the phylogenetic level. Based on low values of 16 S rDNA sequence similarity to previously described genera and their distinctive phenotypic characteristics, it is proposed that strains ON 4 T and ‘B. helvolum’ DSM 20419 be classified as two novel genera and species, with the respective names Gulosibacter molinativorax gen. nov., sp. nov. and Pseudoclavibater helvolus gen. nov., sp. nov...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} inhalation {{risks to}} California communities from airborne agricultural pesticides by probability distribution analysis using ambient air {{data provided by}} the California Air Resources Board and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. The pesticides evaluated include chloropicrin, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate, diazinon, 1, 3 dichloropropene, dichlorvos (naled breakdown product), endosulfan, eptam, methidathion, methyl bromide, methyl isothiocyanate (MITC; metam sodium breakdown product), <b>molinate,</b> propargite, and simazine. Risks were estimated for the median and 75 th and 95 th percentiles of probability (50, 25, and 5 % of the exposed populations). Exposure estimates {{greater than or equal}} to noncancer reference values occurred for 50 % of the exposed populations (adults and children) for MITC subchronic and chronic exposures, methyl bromide subchronic exposures (year 2000 monitoring), and 1, 3 -dichloropropene subchronic exposures (1990 monitoring). Short-term chlorpyrifos exposure estimates exceeded the acute reference value for 50 % of children (not adults) in the exposed population. Noncancer risks were uniformly higher for children due to a proportionately greater inhalation rate-to-body weight ratio compared to adults and other factors. Target health effects of potential concern for these exposures include neurologic effects (methyl bromid...|$|E
