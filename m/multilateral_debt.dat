40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the collective action problem in sovereign debt restructurings using a benchmark model of sovereign debt renegotiation.

One conclusion is that collective action clauses allow the implementation of an efficient renegotiation equilibrium for the model economy while unanimity rules provide incentives for opportunistic behavior by individual bondholders that leads to inefficient outcomes. The potential role for a <b>multilateral</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> restructuring mechanism (SDRM) is also discussed. It is argued that {{the establishment of an}} official international bankruptcy tribunal that collectively restructures all of a country’s debt may not improve upon the universal adoption of collective action clauses for sovereign bond issues. With collective action clauses, mutual gains from collective renegotiation are internalized so that sufficient incentives exist for the private formation of bondholder councils to restructure various debt issues together. The approach abstracts from transactions costs, and the last conclusion might well be sensitive to renegotiation and coordination costs...|$|R
