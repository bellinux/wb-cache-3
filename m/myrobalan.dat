5|$|Giridhar {{lost his}} {{eyesight}} {{at the age}} of two months. On 24 March 1950, his eyes were infected by trachoma. There were no advanced facilities for treatment in the village, so he was taken to an elderly woman in a nearby village who was known to cure trachoma boils to provide relief. The woman applied a paste of <b>myrobalan</b> to Giridhar's eyes to burst the lumps, but his eyes started bleeding, resulting in the loss of his eyesight. His family took him to the King George Hospital in Lucknow, where his eyes were treated for 21 days, but his sight could not be restored. Various Ayurvedic, Homeopathic, Allopathic, and other practitioners were approached in Sitapur, Lucknow, and Bombay, but to no avail. Rambhadracharya has been blind ever since. He cannot read or write, as he does not use Braille; he learns by listening and composes by dictating to scribes.|$|E
5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, <b>myrobalan,</b> tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, quicksilver (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|E

40|$|The use of lauha bhasma, a {{traditional}} Indian herbometallic preparation, is in vogue for centuries {{for the treatment}} of various ailments related to iron deficiency. The preparation of lauha bhasma requires strict adherence to time-consuming, well-practiced, multistage, and multistep procedures. One of the steps is the treatment of purified metallic ingredients with Triphala decoction (the aqueous extract of Indian gooseberry, Chebulic <b>myrobalans,</b> and Beleric <b>myrobalans)</b> in the presence of sunlight (Bhanupaka). The formation of metal complexes due to the reaction of the metallic ingredients with the constituents of Triphala decoction has been ascertained by FTIR spectroscopy and carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses. Our results demonstrate that Bhanupaka is an essential step in the preparation of lauha bhasma...|$|R
2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and <b>myrobalan</b> fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E

40|$|Symptoms of sharka disease {{were first}} {{observed}} on plums in Chrudim district, Central Bohemia, in former Czechoslovakia {{in the forties}} of the last century. Plum pox virus (PPV) was first detected in the Bohemian part of Czechoslovakia in 1952 (SMOLÁK, NOVÁK 1956). An investigation into the diversity and distribution of natural sources of PPV in the Czech Republic began in 1995. Partial results were published by POLÁK (1997) and POLÁK and PÍVALOVÁ (2001) for the years 1999 – 2001. The results of distribution of PPV in naturally growing plum trees, <b>myrobalans</b> and blackthorns were presented completely in 2002 (POLÁK 2002). A small percentage of isolates of the PPV-M serotype in the Czech Republic was found by NAVRÁTIL et al. (1997). They identified it from different, not in greater detail characterised hosts, genetic resources, and experi-mental plants of institutions. The occurrence of PPV-M strain was investigated in our laboratory from 1999 to 2001 at various localities in naturally growing plums, <b>myrobalans</b> and blackthorns. 78 plum and damson trees, 32 <b>myrobalans,</b> and 8 blackthorns were investigated. By means of Mabs, PPV-M was detected only in two plum trees and one damson tree (POLÁK 2002). Furthermore, the presence of PPV-M strain was investigated in se-lected peach and apricot orchards. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material The incidence and distribution of PPV-M strain were investigated in two selected intensive orchards of ap-ricots and peaches in Southern Moravia and Central Bohemia.

50|$|Vegetable tanning uses tannins (a {{class of}} {{polyphenol}} astringent chemicals), which occur naturally in the bark and leaves of many plants. Tannins bind to the collagen proteins in the hide and coat them, {{causing them to}} become less water-soluble and more resistant to bacterial attack. The process also causes the hide to become more flexible. The primary barks processed in bark mills and used in modern times are chestnut, oak, redoul, tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove, wattle (acacia; see catechol), and <b>myrobalans</b> from Terminalia spp., such as Terminalia chebula. Hides are stretched on frames and immersed for several weeks in vats of increasing concentrations of tannin.

5000|$|The {{agent of}} choice for teeth {{blackening}} became known as missī, a powdery mixture of (1) iron and copper sulphate, (2) a plant source of tannins, such as <b>myrobalans,</b> and (3) flavouring agents. The use of missī, thought to be sanctified by Fāṭimah, the Prophet's daughter, became deeply engrained in Islamic culture {{across much of the}} subcontinent. Teeth blackening as a life cycle event related to sexual maturity and in its literary portrayals acquired distinct sexual overtones. It was integrated into to the culture of courtesans and prostitutes where missī became synonymous with the ritual of selling a woman’s virginity. Although not a primary motivation, medicinal considerations also {{played a role in the}} use of missī. Early references to blackening the gums and edges of the teeth suggest a connection to an older tradition of filing the interstices between teeth which had become prohibited by Islamic law. Geographically and culturally distinct traditions of teeth blackening also prevailed among diverse indigenous groups living along the slopes of the Eastern Himalayas, from Nepal through Meghalaya and Assam to Nagaland.|$|R
