These relations are then used to dynamically generate outline definitions of terms in on-line query mode.

The simple definitions based on terminological relations are supplemented by information contained in facets and modifiers, which allow the user to capture different views of the data. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} report on our {{participation}} in the Indonesian-English ad hoc bilingual task of the 2006 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). This year we compare the use of several language resources to translate Indonesian queries into English. We used several readable <b>machine</b> <b>dictionaries</b> to perform the translation. We also used two machine translation techniques to translate the Indonesian queries. In addition to translating an Indonesian query set into English, we also translated English documents into Indonesian using the <b>machine</b> readable <b>dictionaries</b> and a commercial machine translation tool. The results show performing the task by translating the queries is better than translating the documents. Combining several dictionaries produced better result than only using one dictionary.

40|$|Abstract. The {{dictionaries}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} useful lexical resources. However, most of the dictionaries today are not in digital form. This makes them cumbersome for usage by humans and impossible for integration in computer programs. The process of digitalizing an existing traditional dictionary is expensive and labor intensive task. In this paper, we present a method for development of <b>Machine</b> Readable <b>Dictionaries</b> by using the already available resources. <b>Machine</b> readable <b>dictionary</b> consists of simple word-toword mappings, where word from the source language can be mapped into several optional words in the target language. We present a series of experiments where by using the parallel corpora and open source Statistical Machine Translation tools at our disposal, we managed to develop an English-Macedonian <b>Machine</b> Readable <b>Dictionary</b> containing 23, 296 translation pairs (17, 708 English and 18, 343 Macedonian terms).

40|$|Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an {{important}} part of <b>Machine</b> Readable <b>Dictionary</b> (MRD) which is extensively used in Expert System/Intelligent Systems. All languages have multiple meanings of words or phrases depending on the context of their usage. WSD draws the correct (intended) meaning using a database called <b>Machine</b> Readable <b>Dictionary</b> (MRD). Some rudimentary designs of MRD have been made for some European Languages. In this paper a preliminary attempt has been made towards the formulation and design of MRD in Punjabi Language using modified Lesk Algorithm which uses a simple method for relating the appropriate word sense relative to set of dictionary meanings of the word or phrase. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we apply a {{spreading}} activation algorithm {{to the problem}} of mapping senses between <b>machine</b> readable <b>dictionaries,</b> which is required in order to combined information extracted from them.

On a sample corpus of sense definitions, our strategy correctly identifies the corresponding homograph in a second dictionary in 97 % of the cases, and the correct sense within that homograph in 90 % of the cases. This result is a substantial improvement over previously proposed strategies, such as Lesk's method. It also demonstrates that spreading activation strategies, which have rarely been used in computational lexicography, are one means to exploit the full potential of relations implicitly encoded in machine-readable dictionaries. 2 It is widely recognized that <b>machine</b> readable <b>dictionaries</b> are a rich source of semantic information about word senses, and several researchers are working on automatic procedures to identify an...|$|R

So, <b>machine</b> readable electronic <b>dictionary</b> becomes the central resources for Natural Language applications. Dictionaries and other lexical resources are not yet widely available in electronic form for Manipuri language. And there is no <b>machine</b> readable <b>dictionary</b> that can provide both of lexical resources and conceptual information.

40|$|Many {{concerns}} {{have been given}} to morphophonemic phenomena in Indonesian from the perspective of morphology-phonology intersection or even semantics. This paper studies the same phenomenon from Natural Language Processing (NLP) application, and proposes an automatic prefixing model which can later be used to perform NLP tasks such as pattern matching and automatic extraction. The focus of this paper is the phenomena of meN- prefixing in Indonesian. The machine readable linguistic resources built in this paper is expected to transform the linguistic description pertaining to the morphophonemic constraints to an applicable mean for NLP. To accomplish this goal, Local Grammar (LG) approach is employed since this approach is very powerful to describe and formalize a linguistic phenomenon. A corpus processing software, UNITEX, is also employed to apply LG in carrying NLP tasks. It demonstrates how morphophonemic prefixing in Indonesian can be carried out automatically to generate an inflected form <b>machine</b> readable <b>dictionaries</b> as lexical resources and how the resources are used for pattern matching and automatic extraction.
