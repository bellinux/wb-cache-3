It includes an orchard, {{fruit and vegetable}} gardens, ornamental borders and a rose walk, {{as well as the}} national collection of tree quince (Cydonia oblonga), with 20different varieties. Close to the walled garden is a GradeII listed ice house, probably dating from the 18thcentury, which is constructed in brick covered with a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> The entrance is surrounded by stone walls, from which a tunnel leads to a circular domed chamber.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} post mills {{were quite}} small, and {{this led to}} problems with stability as they were liable to blow down in strong winds. A solution was found by burying {{the bottom of the}} trestle in a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> The last sunk post mills in England were at Warton, Lancashire, and Essington, Staffordshire.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} dolmens {{scattered}} around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, {{in various states of}} ruin.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} cromlechs, {{it is likely}} that originally, the burial chamber would have had a {{forecourt}} immediately outside the entrance to the chamber and the chamber would have been covered by a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and smaller stones. This has either been eroded, or removed, over time, leaving only a much lower barrow behind the current structure. However, as the chamber is unusually tall, {{it is possible that the}} capstone was never fully covered.|$|E
25|$|The four prisoners now had {{to kneel}} with their heads towards a small <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> and {{were killed by the}} two SS, one after another by a shot through the back of the neck.

For three of the prisoners the first shot caused death, but for the German-speaking Englishwoman a second shot had to be fired as she still showed signs of life after the first shot.|$|E
25|$|There is then {{a gap in}} {{the archaeological}} record {{until the end of the}} Bronze Age c 1100 BC, when the first burials took place at the large {{cemetery}} of Kastri in the interior of the island. Here built tombs covered with small <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> were typical until the end of the Iron Age. In the earliest tombs were a small number of locally imitated Mycenaean pottery vessels, but the majority of the hand-made pottery with incised decoration reflects connections eastwards with Thrace and beyond.|$|E

25|$|The {{most famous}} pyramids are the Egyptian — huge {{structures}} built of brick or stone, {{some of which}} are among the world's largest constructions. They are shaped as a reference to the rays of the sun. Most pyramids had a polished, highly reflective white limestone surface, to give them a shining appearance when viewed from a distance. The capstone was usually made of hard stone – granite or basalt – and could be plated with gold, silver, or electrum and would also be highly reflective. After 2700 BC, the ancient Egyptians began building pyramids, until around 1700 BC. The first pyramid was erected during the Third Dynasty by the Pharaoh Djoser and his architect Imhotep. This step pyramid consisted of six stacked mastabas. The largest Egyptian pyramids are those at the Giza pyramid complex. The Egyptian sun god Ra, considered the father of all pharaohs, was said to have created himself from a pyramid-shaped <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> before creating all other gods.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Walker was {{appointed}} as contractor, with Edward Leader Williams as chief engineer and designer and general manager. The [...] route {{was divided into}} eight sections, with one engineer responsible for each. The first reached from Eastham to Ellesmere Port. Mount Manisty, a large <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> on a narrow stretch between the canal and the Mersey northwest of Ellesmere Port, was constructed from soil taken from the excavations. It and the adjacent Manisty Cutting were named after the engineer in charge. The last section built was the passage from Weston Point through the Runcorn gap to Norton; the existing docks at Runcorn and Weston had to be kept operational until they could {{be connected to the}} completed western sections of the ship canal.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 1809, Low Fell {{was part}} of Gateshead Fell; itself a {{constituent}} part of the ancient County of Durham. Once described as a [...] "windswept, barren and treacherous heath", it took its name from nearby Gateshead {{and the fact that}} the area was [...] "a fell or common contigious to it". That portion of Gateshead Fell which would later become Low Fell was, in the 1640s, little more than boggy marsh and wetlands owned by the Bishop of Durham who simply divided the land into plots and rented them to the few tenants willing to pay for them. By the 18th century, the lower section of Gateshead Fell consisted broadly of sparsely populated farm and woodland, demarcated from the section of Gateshead Fell which was to become Sheriff Hill by a boundary formed by a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
500|$|Within {{a period}} of about 50years, a bank barrow was built over the enclosure. It was a [...] long <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> with a ditch on either side; the {{parallel}} ditches were [...] apart. Many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased, but as the barrow at Maiden Castle did not cover any burials, {{it has been suggested that}} it was a boundary marker, which would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500years after the bank barrow's construction. Around 1,800BC, during the early Bronze Age, the hill was cleared and used to grow crops, but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned. This period of abandonment lasted until the Iron Age, when the hill fort was built. The bank barrow survived into the Iron Age as a low mound, and throughout this period construction over it was avoided.|$|E

This sighting was made public on 13 August. That evening, a dog walker alerted police to two <b>mounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> at Warren Hill, just outside Newmarket. The suggestion was that these might be the graves of the two missing girls. However, an overnight examination revealed that the <b>mounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> were badger setts, and no trace of either girl was found.|$|R

500|$|One {{contemporary}} {{account of}} these keeps comes from Jean de Colmieu around 1130, who described how the nobles of the Calais region would build [...] "a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> {{as high as they}} can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible.

500|$|Redevelopment of the Witton End stand {{began in}} mid-1976. The stand {{had not seen}} any major work since 1924, and its rear {{remained}} a <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth.</b> Initial renovations saw the levelling {{of the earth and}} new concrete terraces constructed on the lower tier in preparation for the construction of an upper tier. Stage two began in February 1977 and was officially opened in late October. The stand's design and fittings were impressive for the time, including novelties such as an 'AV' logo spelled out in coloured seats and a double row of executive boxes. As well as the new Witton End stand, renamed the North Stand, Villa Park went through further renovations throughout the ground. The cost of the work was £1.3million. As a result, and as with the construction of the Trinity Road Stand fifty years earlier, Villa were again burdened with debt. An internal investigation found that £700,000 of the £1.3million worth of bills were unaccounted for. A later report by accountants Deloitte Haskins & Sells found that the bills were inflated by only 10% but that there were [...] "serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision." ...|$|E

500|$|Like {{several other}} Flemish towns, Cassel commemorates legendary giants in annual processions. The town's two giants are Reuze-Papa (Father Giant, {{also known as}} Le Reuze) and Reuze-Maman (Mother Giant, also known as La Reuzaine). They are [...] and [...] in weight and [...] and [...] high respectively. The current effigies date from 1827 and 1860 respectively, though the {{tradition}} dates from the 16th century (when Reuze-Papa was known as Titenka). Reuze-Papa is depicted as a bearded man wearing a Roman-style breastplate and helm, while Reuze-Maman used to be depicted as a shrimp fisher carrying a basket on her back but is now shown wearing a diadem, a red robe and a golden shawl. The couple had their first child, Kint'je, in 1900, followed by Pietje, Boutje and a baby daughter, Meisje. They are escorted by six bodyguards named Allowyn, Dagobert, Gélon, Goliath, Roland and Samson, who all wear Roman dress. The giants commemorate a tradition that the hill of Cassel was created when a couple of giants were carrying a huge <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> but tripped, spilling the earth {{on the ground and}} forming the hill. The figures make their appearances each year around Easter, when they are paraded around Cassel during the annual carnival. For {{the rest of the year}} they are looked after by the association of the amis du Reuze. They are registered as UNESCO [...] "intangible cultural heritage" [...] treasures.|$|E

[...] To {{the south of the}} hall the inner garden comprises a modern formal garden occupying the site of the original 16th-century formal garden. [...] Beyond this, in the parkland, are the earthworks of an earlier garden. [...] The parkland is almost square in shape, with a section curving out from the south border. [...] It consists of [...] "one huge grassed area" [...] with [...] "lumps and bumps". [...] The Cheshire historian George Ormerod, writing in 1819, considered that this area contained a tilting ground for jousting. [...] That claim is repeated in the hall's official guidebook, which goes on to suggest that it was created in the hope that Queen ElizabethI would visit the hall on her royal progress, but she never did so. [...] There is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden, but it is generally accepted that it comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden. [...] A raised <b>mound</b> <b>of</b> <b>earth</b> in the southwest corner of the garden would have been used to view the garden from an elevated position. [...] A corresponding mound at the southeast corner was removed during the Second World War. [...] To the west of the hall a wooded area known as the Rookery contains mature lime trees. Limited excavation work carried out in 1989–90 discovered, inter alia, a filled-in canal running in a north-south axis down the centre of the garden. The excavations provided [...] "a tremendous insight into the past, although not enough to date it with certainty". [...] To the north of the hall are four fish ponds.|$|E
