5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance <b>mufflers,</b> 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger.

500|$|Despite {{addressing}} the mobility problems {{introduced by the}} previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV—the Ausf.J—was considered a retrograde from the Ausf.H. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production. The electric generator that powered the tank's turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain.

40|$|A quasi-steady semi-analytical {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to predict the}} grazing-bias flow in a perforated-pipe <b>muffler</b> at low Mach numbers for high Reynolds numbers based on {{the diameter of the}} perforation. This model allows both the prediction of the steady flow distribution through a <b>muffler</b> and the prediction of the acoustical response of the perforated pipe in terms of the impedance. The model is compared with experimental and numerical data from the literature. The incorporation of the influence of the flow in this impedance allows predicting the global acoustical response of the <b>muffler</b> by means of a Finite Element Method solution of the Helmholtz equation, neglecting other convective effects. This procedure is tested for two extreme cases. Firstly we consider a through flow <b>muffler</b> consisting of an expansion chamber mounted axis-symmetrically around a perforated pipe. Secondly a plug flow <b>muffler</b> is considered, which is the same <b>muffler</b> but with a plug placed halfway along the perforated pipe, forcing the flow through the pipe perforations. In both cases the model predicts the transmission loss of the <b>muffler</b> within 1 dB for Strouhal numbers (based on the perforation diameter and main flow velocity) of order unity. The performance of the through flow <b>muffler</b> is essentially that of an expansion chamber without major contribution of flow effects.

Although there is only one additional tube in the inter-connected fork <b>muffler</b> (fork <b>muffler</b> with H-connection), yet it substantially changes the acoustic impedance felt at the source. In order to understand the effect of the H-connection, we need to carry out the analysis of the whole exhaust system. This paper first deals with the analysis of the fork <b>muffler</b> (which falls under the category of single-inlet multiple-outlet <b>muffler)</b> with and without H-connection using the transfer matrix approach, the results of which have been validated by a means of a 3 -D finite element analysis. In general, the convective effect of the mean flow plays very little role in the performance of the <b>muffler.</b> But, the mean flow effect at the H-junctions may be crucial to the effectiveness of H-connection and its effect has been taken into account in the parametric study of the fork <b>muffler</b> with H-connection. The dissipative effect of the mean flow at the perforations has been considered throughout the analysis. The parametric study of the fork <b>muffler</b> with H-connection is then carried out to construct the design guidelines for efficient use of the H-connection in designing exhaust systems.
