In April 2013, Chile began negotiations to purchase 100 Leopard 2A5 tanks from surplus German stocks, as well as <b>modernization</b> <b>kits</b> to upgrade all its current Leopard 2A4s up to A5 standard.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Boeing {{was awarded}} a [...] {{contract}} to develop an Avionics <b>Modernization</b> Program <b>kit</b> for the C-130. The program was beset with delays and cost overruns until project restructuring in 2007. On 2 September 2009, Bloomberg news reported that the planned Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) upgrade to the older C-130s would be dropped to provide more funds for the F-35, CV-22 and airborne tanker replacement programs. However, in June 2010, Department of Defense approved funding for the initial production of the AMP upgrade kits. Under the terms of this agreement, the USAF has cleared Boeing to begin low-rate initial production (LRIP) for the C-130 AMP. A total of 198 aircraft are expected to feature the AMP upgrade. The current cost per aircraft is [...] although Boeing expects that this price will drop to US$7 million for the 69th aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology (NT) is {{the study}} of {{manipulating}} matter on atomic and molecular scale. Nanotechnology deals with structures sized between 1 to 100 nanometer, and in at least one dimension (Quantum Dots are of zero dimensions). Dominance of electromagnetic force, the presence of quantum mechanical phenomena, the large surface area to volume ratio and the importance of random kinetic motion cause nano-scale sized particles to often have very different properties than their macro-scale (bulk matter) counterparts. NT enable military technologies will ensure high speed and high capacity systems for command, control, communication, surveillance; automation and robotics for minimizing exposure war fighters, first responders; superior platforms, weapons with miniaturisation [...] The military use of nanotechnology should lead to higher protection, more lethality, longer endurance and better self-supporting capacities of future soldiers. Nanotechnology could greatly improve some of the existing technologies that will be fitted on military platforms and thus create new operational opportunities or, at least, help the engineers to deal with some shortcomings The paper is a review of NT applications in military technology and proposes few applications for Air force in particular. Still very little is known about NT and its side effects. Old systems can replace subsystem with NT enable sub-system for enhance operation capability like survival <b>kit</b> <b>modernization</b> in fighter aircraft,quantum dots enable display system of aircraft and Aircraft canopy can be coated with CNT. NT enable combat suit is need of the hour for Armed Forces. It is unknown if producing items this small could be dangerous to the manufacturers or the soldiers using them for protection, as it is not known if the nanoscale devices could penetrate cel...|$|R
