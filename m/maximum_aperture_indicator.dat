50|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> for a {{zoom lens}} {{may be the}} same (constant) for all focal lengths, {{but it is more}} common that the <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> is greater at the {{wide-angle}} end than at the telephoto end of the zoom range. For example, a 100 mm to 400 mm lens may have a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/4.0 at the 100 mm end but will diminish to only f/5.6 at the 400 mm end of the zoom range. Zoom lenses with constant <b>maximum</b> <b>apertures</b> (such as f/2.8 for a 24-70mm lens) are usually reserved for lenses with higher build quality and are thus more expensive than those with variable <b>maximum</b> <b>apertures.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most SLR cameras provide {{automatic}} aperture control, {{which allows}} viewing and metering at the lens's <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture,</b> but stops the lens {{down to the}} working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> afterward.|$|R
5000|$|Lens speed {{refers to}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> diameter, or minimum f-number, of a {{photographic}} lens. A lens with a larger <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> (that is, a smaller minimum f-number) is called a [...] "fast lens" [...] because it can achieve the same exposure with a faster shutter speed. Conversely, a smaller <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> (larger minimum f-number) is [...] "slow" [...] because it delivers less light intensity and requires a slower (longer) shutter speed.|$|R
50|$|The lens is {{exceptionally}} sharp, {{even when}} stopped {{down to its}} <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/1.4. The lens also excels in low-light photography given its fast <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/1.4, resulting in creamy smooth bokeh and a thin field-of-view.|$|R
5000|$|In Afghanistan, Dennis used a {{zoom lens}} with a focal length of 24mm to 70mm with a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of 2.8. Dennis founded the lens choice with the [...] "diversity {{necessary}} to get wide and tight shots". He used two normal lenses in Yadkinville: a lens with a focal length of 35mm with a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of 1.4 and a second with a focal length of 50 mm and a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of 1.2. Due to the wide aperture he could even film in low light situations.|$|R

50|$|The Leica lens {{is unusually}} fast for a compact camera, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/1.4. The 3.8x maximum zoom {{of the lens}} is {{relatively}} limited, however, and zooming limits the aperture. For example, at 2x optical zoom, the <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> (lowest f-stop) is f/1.8, and at 3.8x zoom it is f/2.3.|$|R
5000|$|Zeiss' {{domination}} of photographic lens innovation {{was due to}} Dr Paul Rudolph. In 1890, Rudolph designed an asymmetrical lens with a cemented group at {{each side of the}} diaphragm, appropriately named [...] "Anastigmat". This lens was made in three series: Series III, IV and V, with <b>maximum</b> <b>apertures</b> of f/7.2, f/12.5, and f/18 respectively. In 1891, Series I, II and IIIa appeared with respective <b>maximum</b> <b>apertures</b> of f/4.5, f/6.3, and f/9 and in 1893 came Series IIa of f/8 <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture.</b> These lenses are now better known by the trademark [...] "Protar" [...] which was first used in 1900.|$|R
50|$|As a lens {{is stopped}} down from its <b>maximum</b> (widest) <b>aperture,</b> most lens aberrations (spherical aberration, coma and astigmatism) are decreased, but lens {{diffraction}} increases. The effect {{is that for}} most lenses, the balance between the decreasing aberrations and the increasing diffraction effects of stopping down the lens means that lenses have an optimum aperture for best results, often about three stops closed down from <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture,</b> so for a lens with a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of ƒ/2.8, ƒ/8 would be the optimum aperture.|$|R

50|$|The lens is sharp {{straight}} from its <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/2.0, {{with only a}} mildly apparent fall-off in acuity {{toward the edge of}} the frame. The lens also excels at low-light photography given its fast <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/2.0 and exceptional coma control. In addition, having a wide-angle field-of view allows for longer exposures to be taken of stars without the effect of star trails affecting the resultant image.|$|R

5000|$|Canon EF 24-105mm lens, {{available}} in two versions—one an L class lens, {{and the other}} a consumer-level lens—with a similar but slightly longer focal length. The L version has a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/4 and image stabilization, similar to the 24-70mm f/4L IS USM, but lacks that lens' macro feature. The consumer version is also image-stabilized, but replaces the USM motor drive with STM, has a variable <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture,</b> and also lacks a macro feature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Maximum</b> <b>{{aperture}}</b> {{also affects}} {{the shape of}} a lens hood. As the aperture gets larger the amount of light and consequentially the amount of the frame the sensor [...] "sees" [...] increases. This can be seen when comparing two lens hoods of the same focal length but with differing apertures - compare the lens hood of a telephoto 4 lens with that of the same lens but with a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of 2.8.|$|R

50|$|The lens {{comes in}} five {{different}} versions, {{all of which}} have fixed <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> at all focal lengths and are L-series lenses.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{features}} an exceptionally fast <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/0.95, lending itself to creamy smooth bokeh and a narrow field of view.|$|R
50|$|The Sony E 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS is a {{variable}} <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> superzoom lens for the Sony E-mount, released by Sony in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{is set to}} its working aperture. Enlarging lenses have an {{optimum range}} of {{apertures}} which yield a sharp image from corner to corner, which is 3 f/ stops smaller than the <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of the lens. For an enlarging lens with a <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> of f/2.8, the optimal aperture would be f/8. The lens is normally set to this aperture and any color filtration dialed in, if making a color print or one on variable-contrast black-and-white paper.|$|R
50|$|While a {{prime lens}} {{of a given}} focal length is less {{versatile}} than a zoom, it is often of superior optical quality, wider <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture,</b> lighter weight, smaller size. These advantages stem from having fewer moving parts, optical elements optimized for one particular focal length, and a less complicated lens formula {{which means that they}} suffer from fewer problems of optical aberration. The larger <b>maximum</b> <b>aperture</b> (smaller f-number) allows photography in lower light, and a shallower depth of field.|$|R

50|$|The Exakta 66 added a TTL metered prism {{coupled to}} the shutter speed dial {{on the camera}} body and the {{aperture}} ring on the lens. It does this by projecting slightly over {{the front of the}} camera, allowing a rotating cam on the specially designed Schneider lenses to tell it what aperture setting was selected.
