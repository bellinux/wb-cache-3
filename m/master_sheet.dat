50|$|Before the Model A, {{in order}} to make a paper lithographic master for a lithographic press like the Multigraph 1250, one had two choices: Type up a new master using wax-coated carbon paper on a special <b>master</b> <b>sheet,</b> or use a metal plate coated with a {{modified}} silver halide photographic emulsion. If retyping the document was not feasible, the photographic method could be used, but it was slow, expensive, and messy. Because the Model A's toner repelled water but attracted oil-based inks, a lithographic master could be made easily by simply making a copy of the document with the Model A onto a blank paper master. It reduced the cost of creating a lithographic master for an existing document from three dollars to less than forty cents. Ford saved so much money by using the Model A that the savings were specifically mentioned in one of Ford's annual reports.|$|E

The Prime Minister's Department had its origin in 1904 as a Prime Minister's Office in the Department of External Affairs and was created on 1 July 1911. The primary function of the Department was in providing advice and guidance to the Prime Minister and the government on the whole range of Commonwealth activities: policy issues and government relations internationally with State governments, with interest groups and individuals. A central thread was the requirement that the Department advise the Prime Minister on all submissions coming to Cabinet.

40|$|Background: The {{surgical}} {{work output}} in Uganda is qualitatively and quantitatively inadequate. The number of surgeons {{is estimated at}} 100 for a population of over 26 million Ugandans. This paper reports {{on how to improve}} recruitment of surgical trainees and training of surgeons in Uganda, focusing on perceptions of potential trainees, trainers, and medical administrators. Methods: This was cross sectional, descriptive study sampled at least 50 % of each of the relevant category of interviewees. Self-administered questionnaire and focus group discussions were used to collect data, which was analyzed manually using a <b>master</b> <b>sheet.</b> It was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee. Results: Paediatrics and Public Health were rated as the disciplines of choice for postgraduate training in Uganda. The reasons why potential trainees would shy away from specialized surgical training were excessive workload, risk of catching HIV/AIDS, low financial returns and a poor learning environment. The major bottlenecks in surgical training, which were cited, included inadequate number of scholarships, inadequate supervision by trainers, inadequate facilities and poor work conditions for trainers. Conclusion: The remedies to this complex problem revolve round providing more resources, (human, materials, money), improving supervision by the trainers, advocacy for an evidence based curriculum content and availing more funding into the Medical Education sector to improve Human Resource for Health development...|$|E

Objective: To describe a newly established health promotion clinic at primary health care centers, in Abha city, KSA. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted during the year 2009. The files of 429 individuals were reviewed after one year from attending the health promotion clinics in Abha city, KSA. <b>Master</b> <b>sheet</b> was designed based on the relevant items of the file.

Results: After one year, the percentage of the individuals who intake imbalanced diet and did not perform any type of physical activity was more than 90 % while 8 % are currently smokers and 14 % had depression. Clinical examination and investigation revealed that more than one quarter of our subjects were overweight. Obesity was 42 % in males versus 51 % in females (P< 0. 04).

This list {{is known as a}} contaminant candidate list (CCL). This year it is expected that the USEPA is to publish the 4 th such list of the CCL or CCL 4. Candidacy to be on the CCL 4 is based on a compound’s occurrence in the environment, public health toxicity and recommendation from expert opinion. Methods to qualitatively determine occurrence and toxicity for compounds were developed in this research and based off USEPA methods. This process involved looking at a large range of chemicals/compounds found in the environment from varying groups such as: disinfection bi‐products, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, inorganics, volatile organic compounds, industrial and cyanotoxins. These compounds may have been included on previous CCL lists or are contaminants of concern currently found in the drinking water industry. Data approaches such as the creation of a <b>master</b> <b>sheet,</b> space diagrams and numerical algorithms ranked compounds based on occurrence and toxicity. These data approaches, along with others, were then provided to an expert panel (TAW) that considered all of these tools, in addition to others, to develop expert opinions about the top candidates for the CCL 4. Results from this approach categorized the compounds and binned them into 4 groups. Of the 122 studied compounds, recommendations for the USEPA are as followed: Group 1. Top priority for inclusion in CCL 4 (7 compounds and super‐group DBPs). Group 2. Recommend inclusion on CCL 4 but insufficient data currently for regulatory determination (10 compounds). Group 3.
