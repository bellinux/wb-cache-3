40|$|We {{present the}} design of a new badge {{platform}} for facilitating interaction in large groups of people. We have built this device to be very flexible in order to host a wide variety of interactions in the areas where wearable and social computing converge, from game environments to meetings and conventions. This badge has both RF and IR communication, a 5 x 9 LED display capable of presenting graphics and scrolling text that users in the vicinity can read, an onboard microphone for 12 -bit audio sampling, a 12 -bit audio output, a pager <b>motor</b> <b>vibrator</b> for vibratory feedback, 3 onboard processors, capacity for up to 256 MB of flash memory, provisions for connecting LCD displays, and connectors that mate into the Responsive Environments Group's Stack Sensor platform, allowing a variety of different sensors to be integrated. We describe several applications now being developed for this badge at the MIT Media Laboratory, and touch on how it was used in a multiplayer, augmented reality urban adventure hunt game in Manhattan in the summer of 2003...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to enhance earthquake prediction feasibility. We present the concept and the design layout of a novel seismic transmission system capable of continuously monitoring the Lithosphere for changes in Earth physics parameters governing seismic wave propagation. New-technology seismic vibrator sources (magnetic levitation vibrator, linear synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>vibrator)</b> transmit, in continuously repeatable fashion, mutually uncorrelated, low-frequency signals simultaneously from different source locations, over regional distances. The signals are retrieved at seismic stations by long-term (weeks, months) coherent stacking and correlation (matched filtering) with the emitted signal code. Any Earth parameter changes along a propagation path, potentially representing earthquake preparation activity, will show up as time-lapse changes in the received signals. We model spatial static stress variation, attenuation, and anisotropy as medium-contrast-source perturbations in an isotropic, inhomogeneous medium. The potential earthquake preparation zone (EPZ) is to be mapped and characterized by means of ray-tracing and contrast-source inversion methods. Successful EPZ-evolution imaging should contribute {{to our understanding of}} earthquake processes, and may yield earthquake precursor statistics for issuing realistic earthquake warnings based on a tolerable false-alarm rate. In addition, the system may be used in general seismic tomography, and in reservoir parameter monitoring for gas, oil, and water resource management. Information Technology and System...|$|E

5000|$|The power plot {{is useful}} in both {{positioning}} and orienting the vibrator, and when adjusting the vibrator unbalance. Poor or inappropriate vibrator locations or orientations, or excessive vibrator unbalance settings, cause large peaks in the power plot. Use of higher-powered <b>vibrator</b> <b>motors</b> (above 2-kW) provides more [...] "head-room" [...] for peaks in power to be tolerated, and treatment to take place, which was the case here: The power peak at ≈ 3700-RPM was {{only half of the}} <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor’s</b> 2.3-kW power capacity (top of the power scale).|$|R
40|$|A small-sized pin-type vibrotactile {{display module}} is {{developed}} for tactile output. The {{size of the}} vibrotactile display module is 5 mm× 5 mm× 5 mm, which is smaller than any <b>vibrator</b> <b>motors.</b> The method of making a user feel tactile sensation with the vibrotactile display module is by small pin stimulation to bare skin of a human, which {{is different from that}} with <b>vibrator</b> <b>motors.</b> The power consumption is about 0. 3 ~ 0. 4 W per one module, which {{is similar to that of}} a <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor.</b> Several types of communication and control modules are also developed, small enough to wear around a hand (on a wrist or back of the hand, etc.), by which one can control frequencies and amplitudes of several pin-type vibrotactile display modules individually. We made a watch-type vibrotactile display wearable on a wrist of a user like wrist belt or wrist watch using several modules. We also made a virtual reality game popping virtual bubble with tactile sensation...|$|R
50|$|HistoryIn 1963, Aurora {{introduced}} the now-legendary Thunderjet 500 motor, an innovative design by British-American engineer Derek Brand. The Thunderjet {{was intended as}} a high-performance, high-reliability replacement for Aurora's successful but finicky <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor.</b> Its two-inch (50 mm) unitized chassis, containing a wide, flat motor-armature, was strikingly different from the conventional inline motors of its HO competitors. It was nicknamed the pancake motor because of the armature's shape.|$|R
3000|$|Tactile {{feedback}} [...] Another {{approach is}} to transform obstacle information into a vibrotactile or electrotactile stimulations on {{different parts of the}} body. Visually impaired users are then trained to interpret the information. This approach allows the hearing sense to be free for the task of precautions or warning dangers. Johnson and Higgins [12] created a wearable device consisted of <b>vibrator</b> <b>motors,</b> each motor is assigned to detected regional obstacles. The value of the closest object in each region is transformed to vibration applied on the skin of abdomen. In [14], obstacle information is transformed to electrical pulses that stimulate the nerves in the skin via electrodes in the data gloves.|$|R

The device is much similar to the conventional white cane in appearance and it is fabricated using ultrasonic sensors, a <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor</b> scheme, a controller and a power unit inside the walking stick. The sensor system comprises of three ultrasonic sensors to acquire obstacle distance measurements and the user can interpret the distance information as a tactile sensation. The sonar sensors are fired with a sequential firing mechanism to avoid crosstalk. Distance is felt by the user {{in terms of the}} vibration intensity change. This device was tested with blind school students and results are presented...|$|R

A max speed capability of at least 6000 - 8000-RPM is recommended. Equally important is tight <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor</b> speed regulation (±0.25%), which greatly improves the ability to detect and drive the resonance(s) (abilities that are required for stress relieving to occur). Driving a resonance involves tuning the vibrator speed {{to the top of}} the resonance peak. This is increasingly challenging as workpiece rigidity increases, which causes resonances to become very narrow. To record such resonances, a slow, automated scan through the speed range and plotting of the vibration response of the workpiece is made.|$|R
40|$|A micro {{ultrasonic}} motor using a micro-machined cylindrical bulk piezoelectric vibrator is introduced. This motor {{consists of}} the vibrator, a glass case and a rotor. The diameter of the piezoelectric vibrator is 0. 8 mm {{and that of the}} motor case is 1. 8 mm. Since the stator transducer is fixed {{at the end of the}} cylinder, it is easy to support the vibrator and the structure of the motor is not complicated. In addition, the vibrator and rotor are supported by the glass case. This is important for the micro ultrasonic motor because it is difficult to support the vibrator when the vibrator is miniaturized. We have fabricated and evaluated the cylindrical shaped traveling type micro ultrasonic <b>motor</b> using this <b>vibrator.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a simple concept and {{design for a}} travel aid for the visually impaired. The proposed device uses ultrasonic signal in sensing and detecting an object (obstacles). The aid can inform the user about {{the distance of the}} detected obstacles by means of tactile vibrations. A prototype device called the intelligent walking stick (INSTICK) was developed under this concept. The INSTICK involves four main portions, ultrasonic transmitters, ultrasonic receiver, control unit and the output portions that consists of a <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor</b> and a speech synthesizer unit. Concept of radio detection is being employed here to receive the returned echo of ultrasonic signals reflected by the obstacles. The echo travel time is used to determine the distance from the user to the obstacle. A PIC microcontroller is used to control the transceiver and process the received signal to an audible format through speech synthesizer. A few tests and survey were carried out involving visually impaired and despite some limitations satisfactory results were observed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} harvesting the electrical power by the piezoelectric actuator from vibration energy. This paper presents the energy harvesting technique using the piezoelectric element of a bimorph type driven by a geared <b>motor</b> and a <b>vibrator.</b> The geared <b>motor</b> {{is a type of}} PWM controlled device that is a combination of an oval shape cam with five gears and a speed controller. When using the geared motor, the piezoelectric element is size of 36 L× 13 W× 0. 6 H. The output voltage characteristics of the piezoelectric element were investigated in terms of the displacement and vibration. When using the vibrator, the electric power harvesting is based on piezoelectric effect and piezoelectric vibrator consists of a magnetic type oscillator, a cantilever, a bimorph actuator and controllers. Low frequency operating technique using piezoelectric vibrator is very important because normal vibration sources in the environment such as building, human body, windmill and ship have low frequency characteristics. We can know from this study results that there are many energy sources such as vibration, wind power and wave power. Also, these can be used to the energy harvesting system using smart device like piezoelectric element...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{a device}} is {{designed}} and implemented {{that it is}} doing three jobs {{in order to help}} blind people to walk without accidents may occur. The first proposed one is accomplished by putting the ultrasonic sensor in a measured angle about 40 o on a suitable blinding stick to detect if there is a hole or stair in front of blind at about 48 cm distance to prevent him from falling and as a result may be causing many injuries. The second one uses a moisture sensor in the first leg of the four legs stick to measure the degree of the land soil moisture in front of the blind and alert him when that degree exceeds a measured level that may immerse the feet of him. While, the third one is made by using another ultrasonic sensor on the stick to turn an alarm ON when there is an obstacle, person, or wall at a small distance about 50 cm near him to prevent a collision accident. The stick is implemented practically using four leg blinding cane, Arduino microcontroller and the three sensors. Also, the three buzzers and one <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor</b> and three LEDs are used on the stick to turn on when a such problems occur. The device gives good results when many visually impaired people in Merjan medical city in Babylon used it. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} ‘Embedded Glove’, a hand mounted tactile (vibration mechanism) feedback Sound Navigation And Ranging (SONAR) obstacle avoidance system, by warning through vibration motors for visually impaired to whom traveling in indoor/outdoor environments is really a difficult task. This system acts as an Electronic Travelling Aid (ETA) providing independent mobility of the visually impaired. This model comprises of a glove strapped to the wrist, embedded with ultrasonic sensors, battery, microcontroller and <b>vibrator</b> <b>motors.</b> Along with being completely reliable, this system also provides to be a cost-effective guidance mechanism for the visually impaired. The system is designed to scan a wide area {{with a set of}} ultrasonic sensors which also provides a good range and speed in the detection of the obstacle. The detected obstacle is immediately notified to the possessor thereby the presence of obstacle along with its direction is conveyed to the visually impaired person by means of a tactile system. The energy consumption for the whole system is controlled by a Photovoltaic (PV) panel, making it more efficient. The analysis described in this paper helps to estimate the distance at which the obstacle is present based on the reliability of measurement performed with ultrasonic sensors. It is also possible to detect the speed of moving objects in addition to direction with increased accuracy, with the enhanced response timings and varying intensities in the vibration mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) and {{the world}} of Smart Systems are {{ushering}} in an era where people, machines, devices (e. g. sensors) and processes are all interconnected and able to interact seamlessly with one another. Business and IT leaders predict they will see an increase of more than one-third (33 %) in revenues from the use of smart technologies over the next five years. Smart system is the future of technology with so many different applications to it. We present in this project a system developed for a more convenient outdoor navigation. It involves the development of a power harnessing smart shoe to aid navigation and reduce the dependency of individuals on maps i. e. the need to constantly look at the maps for direction rather than focusing on the road. The project uses the Arduino UNO microcontroller as the brain box of the designed system. The microcontroller was programed to achieve the various tasks needed in this project. The smart shoe is fitted with piezo-electric crystals which are pressure sensors generating the power required for the system, a Bluetooth module to interface with the mobile application which was programmed specifically for the shoe, and also <b>vibrator</b> <b>motors</b> which act as the output signal that is felt by the user to help inform them which way to turn.

5000|$|As Scalextric {{became an}} instant hit, American hobbyists and {{manufacturers}} were adapting 1:24 car models to slots, and British-American engineer Derek Brand developed a tiny <b>vibrator</b> <b>motor</b> {{small enough to}} power model cars roughly in scale with HO and OO electric trains. In 1959, Playcraft division of Mettoy produced these in the UK, and a year later, Aurora Plastics Corp. released HO vibrator sets with huge success in the USA. The tiny cars fascinated the public, and their cost and space requirements were better suited to the average consumer than the larger scales. In only a year or two, Scalextric's 1:32 cars and Aurora's [...] "Model Motoring" [...] HO line had set off the [...] "slot car craze" [...] of the 1960s.The slot car craze was largely an American phenomenon, but, commercially, {{it was a huge}} one. In 1963, after {{a million and a half}} had been produced, Aurora replaced the trouble-prone vibrator cars with an innovative flat-commutator ("pancake") motor, also created by Brand, and what is probably the best-selling slot car in history, the Aurora Thunderjet-500 was born. Faller (Germany) produced it for sale in Europe, and competing companies tried in vain to match the speed and reliability of Brand's design. The Thunderjets and their improved versions, the AFX, sold in the tens of millions, completely dominating the HO market for almost a decade, until challenged by the Tyco cars in the early 1970s.|$|R
