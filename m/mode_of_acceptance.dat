This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the [...] "mirror image rule".

If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer.

As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted objectively {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person, as determined in the early English case of Smith v Hughes [...] It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance,</b> only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the offeree must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding agreement. Notification of acceptance must actually reach a point where the offeror could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> It is not possible for an offeror to impose an obligation on the offeree to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the offeror may waive the need for communication of acceptance, either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require communication of acceptance, the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the offeror himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|E

40|$|Realistic Fictionalism, {{argues for}} two main claims: First, {{that there is}} no {{conceptual}} or logical incoherence in the idea of a fictionalist theory of some discourse which accommodates a form of realism about that discourse (a claim which has been made in passing by various people, but which has never been adequately explored and assessed); and Second, that just such a fictionalist theory promises to be the best theory of our ordinary moral commitments, judgements and deliberation. In Part I, I explore the spirit of fictionalism and argue that thinking of fictionalism as closely tied to an analogy between its target discourse and fiction is liable to be misleading and is not mandatory. It emerges that the fictionalist’s strategy requires just a semantic thesis (representationalism) and a thesis about the sort of ‘acceptance’ appropriate for some practice involving their target discourse (nondoxasticism). I offer a theory of what ‘acceptance’ is, which treats belief as a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and distinguishes the nondoxastic modes of acceptance from belief in a principled and independently plausible way. And I argue that the coherence of realistic fictionalism is preserved by the fact that a person (the realistic fictionalist) can perfectly coherently both believe and nondoxastically accept the same claims. In Part II, I employ the theory of acceptance developed in Part I to propose a fictionalist model of how our ordinary moral commitments often are and generally ought to be. I then give an argument to the conclusion that, in respect of the relation between moral commitment and action guiding at least, {{it would be better if}} our moral commitments were to be nondoxastic. I then argue that realistic fictionalism offers a better way of explaining why we ought to have any moral commitments at all than a non-realist fictionalist theory could...|$|E

40|$|Graph data {{appears in}} a variety of {{application}} domains, and many uses of it, such as query-ing, matching, and transforming data, naturally result in incompletely specified graph data, i. e., graph patterns. Queries need to be posed against such data, but techniques for querying pat-terns are generally lacking, and even simple properties of graph patterns, such as the languages needed to specify them, are not well understood. In this dissertation we present several contributions in the study of graph patterns. We analyze how to query them and how to use them as queries. We also analyze some of their applications in two different contexts: schema mapping specification and data exchange for graph databases, and formal language theory. We first identify key features of patterns, such as node and label variables and edges specified by regular expressions, and define a classification of patterns based on them. Next we study how to answer standard graph queries over graph pat-terns, and give precise characterizations of both data and combined complexity for each class of patterns. If complexity is high, we do further analysis of features that lead to intractability, as well as lower-complexity restrictions that guarantee tractability. We then turn to the the study of schema mappings for graph databases. As for relational and XML databases, our mapping languages are based on patterns. They subsume all previously considered mapping languages for graph databases, and are capable of expressing many data exchange scenarios in the graph database context. We study the problems of materializing solutions and query answering for data exchange under these mappings, analyze their complexity, and identify relevant classes of mappings and queries for which these problems can be solved efficiently. We also introduce a new model of automata that is based on graph patterns, and define two <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> for them. We show that this model has applications not only in graph databases but in several other contexts. We study the basic properties of such automata, and the key computational tasks associated with them. ii...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how the {{decision}} for elective cesarean section comes about in the clinical environment. A prospective longitudinal study based on the Health Belief Model was conducted about first time mothers’ decision making processes and their health beliefs which led to their satisfaction with their decision about their <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> delivery. A convenience sample of 144 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies and no medical indications requiring a cesarean delivery were recruited using internet based informational notices and with flyers. Women (n = 127) planning a vaginal delivery (VDMR) represented 88. 2 % of the sample and women (n = 17) requesting a cesarean delivery (CDMR) represented 11. 8 % of the sample. Data were collected during the third trimester and six weeks after the delivery using an internet-based questionnaire. Data were analyzed using t-tests and multiple linear regression to predict the effect of maternal health beliefs, maternal childbirth self efficacy, partner support, <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the maternal role, and request group (VDMR vs. CDMR) on the dependent variables of maternal perception of the delivery and maternal satisfaction with her decision for the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> delivery. Compared to women with VDMR, women with CDMR were significantly older, less educated, perceived more risk of emergent cesarean and less ability to deliver vaginally. Hypothesis testing indicated that the overall regression model {{did not significantly predict}} maternal perception of the delivery. The model accounted for a significant amount (15. 1 %) of the variance in maternal satisfaction with the decision for <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> delivery. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the maternal role and maternal request group significantly contributed to the model indicating that women with higher <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the maternal role and women with CDMR had poorer satisfaction with their decision for the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> delivery.

40|$|Introduction: For a {{substantial}} number of women in Portugal, the news of a positive diagnosis of HIV infection occurs during routine prenatal care. These women are confronted with critical decisions in relation to pregnancy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and describe medical, demographic and psychological characteristics of HIV-positive women who become pregnant, and also to discriminate the profiles of those who decide to continue pregnancy from those who decide to terminate it, after receiving news of their positive HIV status. Methods: A sample of 36 HIV-infected pregnant women was assessed. Data was collected for the following variables: demographic characteristics (age; race/ethnicity; marital status; socio-economic status), obstetric history, pregnancy information; and HIV-associated information (<b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transmission; knowledge of serological status). Results: Results showed that decision to continue pregnancy was significantly associated with marital status (p< 0. 01), <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transmission (p< 0. 05), knowledge of HIV infection prior to pregnancy (p< 0. 05) and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy (p< 0. 01).

We propose an alternative interpretation, which argues that the <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a European political order stems from at least two rationales.

This tendency is emphasized and explained by the model of “constraining dissensus”. On the other hand, we observe the reinforcement of indifference and indecision amongst ordinary citizens not expert in political matters, faced with this same process. The first rational of appropriation is linked to an active form of contentment or rejection, whereas the second demonstrates a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> tacit <b>acceptance.</b> In the latter case, the {{politicization of the}} EU leads ordinary citizens {{at the same time to}} develop more ambivalent attitudes towards the integration process and to consider the EU as “normal politics”.

Results from hierarchical linear modeling showed that patients with higher levels of SPB reported higher levels of depression and anxiety, as well as lower levels of mental health over time. Results also revealed that SPB predicted cancer patients’ pattern of change in anxiety over time. As the high SPB group had a higher anxiety level at baseline, their anxiety level remained higher than that of the low SPB group despite a sharper decrease. Study 2 is the first quantitative study to scrutinize the psychological process of how cancer patients attempted to cope with SPB. A new Self-perceived Burden Coping Scale was developed. Our findings indicated that the scale displayed good content, construct, and discriminant validities, and most subscales show acceptable reliability. Results from principal components analysis showed that cancer patients adopted six coping modes in an attempt to deal with SPB: (a) positive outlook, (b) managing the needs of others, (c) resigned acceptance, (d) making preparations, (e) entitlement, and (f) concealing need. Specially, the coping <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> resigned <b>acceptance</b> and concealing need were related to poorer adjustment, whereas managing the needs of others and entitlement were related to better adjustment. Stress-buffering effects of managing the needs of others and making preparations were also found. Finally, Study 3 adopted a qualitative paradigm to explore perception as care-receivers, aspects of SPB, and coping with SPB among Chinese non-terminal cancer patients. Narratives from patients revealed four perspectives regarding to their perception as care-receivers: self-reliance, acceptance, overwhelming, and SPB. Results revealed that the SPB experience among Chinese non-terminal cancer patients was similar to those observed in Western terminal cancer patients, with a new aspect of financial burden. In addition to the six coping <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> SPB found in Study 2, a potential new coping <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> being compliant with others was found, which may be unique among Chinese cancer patients in the context of SPB. Findings from these studies may advance our knowledge on SPB, provide insights for future research, as well as shed lights on the development of counseling services, psychological interventions, and public policies for cancer patients. published_or_final_versionPsychologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
