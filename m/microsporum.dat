5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium <b>microsporum</b> are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E
25|$|Ringworm is a fungal {{skin disease}} that in dogs {{is caused by}} <b>Microsporum</b> canis (70%), <b>Microsporum</b> gypseum (20%), and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (10%). Typical signs in dogs include hair loss and scaly skin.|$|E
25|$|Athlete's foot {{is caused}} by a number of {{different}} fungi. These include species of Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and <b>Microsporum.</b> The condition is typically acquired by coming into contact with infected skin, or fungus in the environment. Common places where the fungi can survive are around swimming pools and in locker rooms. They may also be spread from other animals. Usually diagnosis is made based on signs and symptoms; however, it can be confirmed either by culture or seeing hyphae using a microscope.|$|E
25|$|Keratinophilic fungal {{species that}} {{fall under the}} genus Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, or <b>Microsporum,</b> are {{pathogenic}} to humans and other animals, and {{are referred to as}} dermatophytes {{on the basis of their}} ability to cause dermatophytosis in these hosts. However, infections in these hosts caused by soil-derived keratinophilic saprotrophs like A.fulvescens are very seldom and only a few cases have been documented in the literature. The first documented case of A.fulvescens causing tinea corporis was in 1970 when the fungus was repeatedly isolated from a 4 x 5cm red patch on the inner right thigh of a 21-year-old white male. This case showcases the clinical importance of non-dermatophyte keratinophilic fungi such as A.fulvescens as a result of the ability to cause dermatophytosis in the form of tinea corporis in humans. While visually, the case of tinea corporis was indistinguishable from those caused by true dermatophytes, the infection did not respond well to typical treatment. This observation is crucial for correct diagnosis and treatment of the skin lesion and highlights the necessity of awareness for atypical opportunistic human pathogenic fungi.|$|E
2500|$|In medicine, the Wood's lamp is used {{to check}} for the {{characteristic}} fluorescence of certain dermatophytic fungi such as species of <b>Microsporum</b> which emit a yellow glow, or corynebacterium which have a red to orange color when viewed under a Wood's lamp. Such light {{is also used to}} detect the presence and extent of disorders that cause a loss of pigmentation, such as vitiligo. It {{can also be used to}} diagnose other fungal infections such as ringworm, <b>microsporum</b> canis, tinea versicolor; bacterial infections such erythrasma; other skin conditions including acne, scabies, alopecia, porphyria; as well as corneal scratches, foreign bodies in the eye, and blocked tear ducts.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. [...] There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. [...] About 70 percent of infections are caused by <b>Microsporum</b> canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. [...] Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. [...] Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the cliinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or clotrimazole. [...] Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or itraconazole. [...] Infection can spread to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{diseases}} that affect dogs or humans are not transferable {{between the two}} species. [...] Diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are terrmed zoonoses. [...] A well-known zoonosis is rabies, a viral infection transmitted through a bite. [...] A common bacterial zoonosis is leptospirosis, transmitted through urine. [...] Some {{of the most important}} zoonoses are parasitic. [...] Zoonotic intestinal parasites transmitted through contact with feces include Toxocara canis (the canine roundworm), which causes toxocariasis, visceral larva migrans, and ocular larva migrans, and hookworms, which can cause cutaneous larva migrans. [...] Zoonotic skin parasites include scabies, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. [...] The most common zoonotic fungal disease is ringworm, caused in this case by <b>Microsporum</b> canis.|$|E
2500|$|Cats are {{reservoirs}} and {{are able}} to transmit mycotic infections. [...] Cats, especially kittens can pass on a Ringworm infection to people. Ringworm is a fungal disease and approximately 40 types of fungi can cause ringworm. They are typically of the Trichophyton, <b>Microsporum,</b> or Epidermophyton type. [...] It gets its name from the characteristic ring-like rash on the skin. The disease is spread by touching an infected cat. The rash may be scaly, reddened, and circular. Ringworm on the scalp usually makes a bald patch of scaly skin. Long-haired [...] cats do not always show signs of ringworm infection. Kittens with ringworm have patches that are hairless, circular, or irregularly shaped areas of scaling, crusting, and redness {{that may or may not}} be itchy. The area may not be completely hairless, and instead have brittle, broken hairs. If the claws are affected, they may have a whitish, opaque appearance with shredding of the claw's surface.|$|E
5000|$|Infrequently {{isolated}} (less than 1%) are Epidermophyton floccosum, <b>Microsporum</b> audouinii, <b>Microsporum</b> canis, <b>Microsporum</b> equinum, <b>Microsporum</b> nanum, <b>Microsporum</b> versicolor, Trichophyton equinum, Trichophyton kanei, Trichophyton raubitschekii, and Trichophyton violaceum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> gallinae is {{a fungus}} {{of the genus}} <b>Microsporum</b> that causes dermatophytosis, {{commonly}} known as ringworm. Chickens represent the host population of <b>Microsporum</b> gallinae but its opportunistic nature allows it to enter other populations of fowl, mice, squirrels, cats, dogs and monkeys. Human cases of M. gallinae are rare, and usually mild, non-life-threatening superficial infections.|$|E
50|$|The {{identification}} of rough-walled macroconidia, {{a hallmark of}} the <b>Microsporum</b> genus, lead to the dermatophyte being classified as M. gallinae. There is still debate about the phylogenetic placement of this dermatophyte, but the accepted name is <b>Microsporum</b> gallinae. Analysis of its DNA sequences by PCR shows M. gallinae is most closely related to <b>Microsporum</b> vanbreuseghemii and Arthroderma grubyi, both are also zoophilic fungi.|$|E
50|$|Ectothrix: Characterized by {{the growth}} of fungal spores (arthroconidia) on the {{exterior}} of the hair shaft. Infected hairs usually fluoresce greenish-yellow under a Wood lamp. Associated with <b>Microsporum</b> canis, <b>Microsporum</b> gypseum, Trichophyton equinum, and Trichophyton verrucosum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> nanum is geophilic and zoophilic. There are {{records of}} {{isolation}} from both pig farm soil and the infected pigs. Like M. canis, M. audouinii, and M. ferrugineum, M. nanum causes ectothrix infection. Its growth is usually {{stops at the}} keratinized layer of the skin. However, there is some literature suggesting that <b>Microsporum</b> nanum may form endothrix infection under certain circumstances. Unlike other species of <b>Microsporum,</b> Wood's Light Examinationof the skin yields inconsistent findings and fluorescence {{may or may not}} be observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> canis {{species have}} a {{worldwide}} distribution. Extremely high occurrence {{has been reported}} in Iran, while lower incidence is associated with England and Scandinavian countries, as well as South American countries. <b>Microsporum</b> canis is uncommon in some parts of US and Europe, and is completely absent from equatorial Africa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> gallinae is a {{cosmopolitan}} zoophilic fungi that very rarely affects humans. It obtains nutrients from keratin-rich skin, nails and hair, releasing enzymes during its digestion that elicit a host immune response {{as seen in}} ringworm. <b>Microsporum</b> gallinae infection is diagnosed by culturing the scrapings from skin lesions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> gallinae {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the scalp, and smooth skin in human populations.Microsporum gallinae infections are most commonly tinea capitis and tinea corporis. Very few human cases of M. gallinae infection have been reported, none of which were life-threatening. Of the reported cases, individuals ranged from 3-96 years old. They had cutaneous lesions on the glabrous skin or the scalp. These localized lesions are frequently accompanied by itching. The cutaneous manifestations {{are very similar to}} those of <b>Microsporum</b> canis therefore many cases of <b>Microsporum</b> gallinae could have been unreported.|$|E

50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> nanum is a {{mesophile}} {{and grows}} moderately rapid on Sabouraud's Dextrose agar. Its macroconidia are ovoid in shape and, unlike those {{of most other}} species of <b>Microsporum,</b> normally consist {{of no more than}} three cells. Rare to moderate numbers of rough-walled microconidia can also be found in the colony. <b>Microsporum</b> nanum grows optimally at 25 °C but is capable of growth at temperatures up to 37 °C. Physiological tests have shown that M. nanum does not require vitamin supplementation for its growth. Like many other dermatophytes, M. nanum is tolerant of the antifungal agent cycloheximide. In addition, M. nanum also exhibits soil association characters such as urease activity and the formation of perforating organ on hair shafts.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Microsporum</b> canis reproduces {{by means}} of two conidial forms, large, spindle-shaped, multicelled macroconidia and small, {{single-celled}} microconidia. First records of M. canis date to 1902. Evolutionary studies have established that M. canis, like the very closely related sibling species M. distortum and M. equinum, is a genetic clone derived from the sexually reproducing species, Arthroderma otae. Members of Ascomycota often possess conspicuous asexual and sexual forms that can coexist in time and space. <b>Microsporum</b> canis exemplifies a common situation in ascomycetous fungi in which, over time, one mating type strain has undergone habitat divergence from the other and established a self-sustaining reproductive population that consists only of the asexual form. It is hypothesized that asexual lineage of <b>Microsporum</b> canis evolved {{as a result of}} host-specific interactions, changes in ecological niche, as well as, geographic isolation of + and - mating types of Arthroderma otae, hence making it difficult to sustain sexual reproduction. Early domestication of animals, such as cats and dogs, in Africa led to a later evolution of host-specific fungus, <b>Microsporum</b> canis, which is commonly associated with loose fur animals. Nearly all reported isolates of <b>Microsporum</b> canis represent the [...] "-" [...] mating strain of A. otae. Together with two closely related taxa, M. ferrugineum and M. audouinii, the clade is thought to have an African center of origin.|$|E
50|$|The hair {{perforation}} test, {{also known}} as an in vitro hair perforation test, is a laboratory test used to help distinguish the isolates of dermatophytes, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and its variants. The test is performed by placing an organism into a petri dish containing water, yeast extract, and hair. The Mayo Clinic's mycology laboratory has identified five common dermatophytes; <b>Microsporum</b> gypseum, <b>Microsporum</b> canis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Trichophyton tonsurans.|$|E

50|$|Ringworm in pets {{may often}} be asymptomatic, {{resulting}} in a carrier condition which infects other pets. In some cases, the disease only appears when the animal develops an immunodeficiency condition. Circular bare patches on the skin suggest the diagnosis, but no lesion is truly specific to the fungus. Similar patches may result from allergies, sarcoptic mange, and other conditions. Three species of fungi cause 95% of dermatophytosis in pets: these are <b>Microsporum</b> canis, <b>Microsporum</b> gypseum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{dermatophytosis}} is also {{diagnosed in}} sheep, dogs, cats, and horses. Causative agents, besides Trichophyton verrucosum, are T. mentagrophytes, T. equinum, <b>Microsporum</b> gypseum, M. canis, and M. nanum.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study by}} Singh an co-workers, {{eighteen}} fungi were isolated from soil and tested for their antagonistic interactions. The maximum inhibition of <b>Microsporum</b> equinum, M. fulvum, M. gypseum and M. racemosum was caused by multiple fungi, including C. keratinophilum. On the other hand, staling products of C. lucknowense accelerated the growth of many fungi, including C. keratinophilum. Another study tested C. keratinophilum for its anti-dermatophyte activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton flocossum. In their study, C. keratinophilum inhibited T. rubrum, T. tonsurans and T. mentagrophytes, but not M. gypseum and <b>Microsporum</b> nanum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> canis has no {{specific}} growth factor or nutrition requirements, hence it grows well on most commercially available media. In addition, M. canis exhibits rapid colony growth at 25 °C. Two growth media that help distinguish M. canis from other <b>Microsporum</b> spp. (notably the morphologically similar species, M. audouinii) - specifically polished rice and potato dextrose agar. On potato dextrose agar, M. canis produces a lemon-yellow pigment that is easily visualized, {{due to the}} presence of aerial hyphae, while on the polished rice, most isolates (even atypical strains) produce yellow pigment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microsporum</b> gypseum is a soil-associated dermatophyte that {{occasionally}} {{is known to}} infect the upper dead layers of the skin of mammals. The name refers to an asexual [...] "form-taxon" [...] that {{has been associated with}} four related biological species of fungi: the pathogenic taxa Arthroderma incurvatum, A. gypsea, A. fulva and the non-pathogenic saprotroph A. corniculata. More recent studies have restricted M. gypseum to two teleomorphic species A. gypseum and A. incurvatum. The conidial states of A. fulva and A. corniculata have been assigned to M. fulvum and M. boullardii. Because the anamorphic states of these fungi are so similar, they can be identified reliably only by mating. Two mating strains have been discovered, [...] "+" [...] and [...] "-". The classification of this species has been based on the characteristically rough-walled, blunt, club-shaped, multicelled macroconidia. Synonyms include Achorion gypseum, <b>Microsporum</b> flavescens, M. scorteum, and M. xanthodes. There has been past nomenclatural confusion in the usage of the generic names <b>Microsporum</b> and Microsporon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> nanum is a {{pathogenic}} fungus in {{the family}} Arthrodermataceae. It {{is a type of}} dermatophyte which causes infection in dead keratinized tissues such as skin, hair, and nails. <b>Microsporum</b> nanum is found worldwide and is both zoophilic and geophilic. Animals such as pigs and sheep are the natural hosts for the fungus; however, infection of humans is also possible. Majority of the human cases reported are associated with pig farming. The fungus can invade the skin of the host; if it is scratched off by the infected animal, the fungus is still capable of reproducing in soil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Microsporum</b> is a genus of fungi {{that causes}} tinea capitis, tinea corporis, ringworm, and other dermatophytoses (fungal infections of the skin). <b>Microsporum</b> forms both macroconidia (large asexual {{reproductive}} structures) and microconidia (smaller asexual reproductive structures) on short conidiophores. Macroconidia are hyaline, multiseptate, variable in form, , spindle-shaped to obovate, 7-20 by 30-160 um in size, with thin or thick echinulate to verrucose cell walls. Their shape, size and cell wall features are important characteristics for species identification. Microconidia are hyaline, single-celled, [...] to clavate, smooth-walled, 2.5-3.5 by 4-7 um {{in size and}} are not diagnostic for any one species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microsporum</b> canis is a pathogenic, asexual fungus in the phylum Ascomycota that infects the upper, dead {{layers of}} skin on domesticated cats, and {{occasionally}} dogs and humans. The species has a worldwide distribution.|$|E
