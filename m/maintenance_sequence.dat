Initial replication events are dependent on a gene product(s), encoded by the BPV- 1 E 1 open reading frame. Mutational analysis of the viral upstream regulatory region shows the requirement of two domains in cis for replication. Domain one, located outside of the viral 69 % transforming fragment, is an enhancer-like activity and can be replaced by other known viral enhancers.

40|$|A divergently {{transcribed}} pair of Caenorhabditis elegans hsp 16 genes {{was introduced}} into mouse fibroblasts by stable transfection with vectors containing bovine papillomavirus plasmid <b>maintenance</b> <b>sequences</b> and a selectable gene. The hsp 16 genes were transcriptionally inactive in the mouse cells under normal growth conditions and were strongly induced by heat shock or arsenite. In a cell line with 12 {{copies of the}} gene pair, there were estimated {{to be more than}} 10, 000 hsp 16 transcripts in each cell after 2 h of heat shock treatment. The hsp 16 transcript levels were more than 100 times higher than those of a gene with a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter carried on the same vector. A single heat shock promoter element (HSE) could activate bidirectional transcription of the two hsp 16 genes when placed between the two TATA elements, but the transcriptional efficiency was reduced 10 -fold relative to that of the wild-type gene pair. Four overlapping HSEs positioned between the two TATA elements resulted in inducible bidirectional transcription at greater than wild-type levels. The number of HSEs can therefore be a major determinant of the promoter strength of heat-inducible genes in mammalian cells.

The centrally located γ origin contains 7 iterons that bind to the plasmid-encoded initiator protein, π. Ori α, located {{at a distance of}} ∼ 4 kb from γ, contains a single iteron that does not directly bind to π but is believed to access the protein by π-mediated α-γ iteron-iteron interaction that loops out the intervening ∼ 3. 7 kb of DNA. Although the cis-acting components and the trans-acting proteins required for ori γ function have been analyzed in detail, such information was lacking for ori α. Here, we have identified both the sequence elements located at α and those at γ, that together promoted α activity. The data support the conclusion that besides the single iteron, a neighboring DNA primase recognition element called G site is essential for α-directed plasmid <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Sequences</b> preceding the iteron and immediately following the G site, although not absolutely necessary, appear {{to play a role in}} efficient plasmid maintenance. In addition, while both dnaA 1 and dnaA 2 boxes that bind to DnaA protein and are located at γ were essential for α activity, only dnaA 2 was required for initiation at γ.

The transposons contain a Flp recombinase-excisable, approved kanamycin resistance selection marker and an R 6 K origin of replication for transposon rescue. In vivo mutagenesis of virulent B. pseudomallei strain 1026 b was highly efficient, with up to 44 % of cells transformed with the delivery plasmid harboring chromosomal HimarBP insertions.

40|$|In a {{subclone}} of ID 13 mouse fibroblasts latently {{infected with}} bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV- 1) DNA, the viral genome occurred as {{a mixture of}} extrachromosomal circular monomers and oligomers. Multiple copies were also associated with the host cell genome, predominantly at a single site in a head-to-tail tandem array. We examined the replicative intermediates of extrachromosomal forms of BPV- 1 DNA by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results obtained indicate that initiation of DNA replication occurred {{near the center of}} the EcoRI-BamHI 5. 6 -kilobase fragment. In some molecules, however, this fragment was replicated from one end to the other by means of a single fork initiated elsewhere. Termination also occurred within this fragment. The EcoRI-BamHI 2. 3 -kilobase fragment replicated as a DNA molecule containing a termination site for DNA replication and also by means of a single fork traversing the fragment from one end to the other. Thus, replication forks proceeded through these fragments in different manners, apparently depending on whether they were part of a monomer, a dimer, a trimer, or higher oligomers. These observations lead to the conclusion that initiation of DNA replication in BPV- 1 DNA takes place at or close to plasmid <b>maintenance</b> <b>sequence</b> 1. From this point, replication proceeds bidirectionally and termination occurs approximately 180 degrees opposite the origin. The results obtained are consistent with one or more replication origins being quiescent in BPV- 1 DNA oligomers...|$|E
40|$|EBNA 1 {{activates}} the EBV plasmid <b>maintenance</b> <b>sequence</b> oriP by binding to its two essential regions. One {{region is}} a family of 30 -base-pair (bp) repeats and is activated by EBNA 1 {{to act as a}} transcriptional enhancer. The other region contains a 65 -bp dyad symmetry and lacks enhancer function. To explore the functional differences between the two regions, we determined oriP activities as functions of the number of 30 -bp repeats and compared them with activities determined when tandem copies of the dyad symmetry region were used to replace the 30 -bp repeats. Three conclusions have been drawn. (i) Activation of the 30 -bp repeats by EBNA 1 to enhance transcription or to permit plasmid maintenance is a highly cooperative process involving at least six or seven 30 -bp repeats for full activity. (ii) Tandem copies of the dyad symmetry region cooperatively enhance transcription but are less effective than 30 -bp repeats providing a similar number of EBNA 1 -binding sites. (iii) Tandem copies of the dyad symmetry region alone cooperatively activate replication, suggesting that the region contains the actual origin of replication. We also report that while rodent-derived cell lines do not support replication of EBV-derived plasmids they do permit EBNA 1 -dependent enhancer activity. EBV plasmid replication thus requires the interaction of EBNA 1 or oriP with a host factor that is not required for enhancement of transcription...|$|E

To reach its full potential, this nascent technology requires new optimized expression vectors and {{a deeper understanding of}} episome maintenance. Here we present the development of an additional diatom vector (pPtPBR 1), based on the parent plasmid pBR 322, to add a plasmid maintained at medium copy number in E. coli to the diatom genetic toolkit. Using this new vector, we evaluated the contribution of individual yeast DNA elements comprising the 1. 4 -kb tripartite CEN 6 -ARSH 4 -HIS 3 sequence that enables episome maintenance in P. tricornutum. While various combinations of these individual elements enable efficient conjugation and high ex-conjugant yield in P. tricornutum, individual elements alone do not. Conjugation of episomes containing CEN 6 -ARSH 4 and a small sequence from the low GC content 3 ’ end of HIS 3 produced the highest number of diatom ex-conjugant colonies, resulting in a smaller and more efficient vector design. Our findings suggest that the CEN 6 and ARSH 4 sequences function differently in yeast and diatoms, and that low GC content regions of greater than ~ 500 bp are a potential indicator of a functional diatom episome <b>maintenance</b> <b>sequence.</b> Additionally, we have developed improvements to the conjugation protocol including a higher-throughput option utilizing 12 -well plates, and plating methods that improve ex-conjugant yield and reduce time and materials required for the conjugation protocol.

ResultsAll active maintenance therapy-containing regimens, with the exception of gemcitabine+cisplatin (first-line) →erlotinib (maintenance), were more costly than induction-only regimens. Concerning treatments that may be cost effective, the incremental costs per life-year gained were $ 121, 425, $ 148, 994, and $ 191, 270 for gemcitabine+cisplatin→erlotinib versus gemcitabine+cisplatin→best supportive care (BSC), pemetrexed+cisplatin→BSC versus gemcitabine+cisplatin→erlotinib, and for pemetrexed+cisplatin→pemetrexed versus pemetrexed+cisplatin→BSC, respectively.

AA patients who did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy and those who obtained unmaintained remission early after cyclosporine (CyA) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy exhibited essentially a normal CDR 3 size pattern. In contrast, five patients who needed continuous administration of CyA to maintain remission exhibited a skewed CDR 3 size pattern in a number (G 40 %) of BV subfamilies suggestive of clonal predominance. The skewing of CDR 3 size distribution be-came less pronounced in one of the CyA-dependent patients when the patient achieved unmaintained remission after a 4 -year therapy with CyA, whereas it persisted longer than 7 years in the other patient requiring <b>maintenance</b> therapy. <b>Sequencing</b> of BV 15 cDNA for which the CDR 3 size pattern exhibited apparent clonal predominance in all CyA-depen-dent patients showed high homology of the amino acid sequence of the CDR 3 between two different patients. These findings indicate that antigen-driven expansion of T cells is involved in the pathogenesis of AA characterized by CyA-dependent recovery of hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of surveys for sequence {{variation in the}} search for genes involved in anthelmintic resis-tance has become widely used over the last decade. The lack of association of polymorphism with re-sistance can be used to exclude a gene from consideration as a candidate for the cause of resistance. The finding of an association {{can also be used to}} focus research on specific genes that may have a func-tional role in the expression of resistance. Subsequent work can then isolate specific changes in the DNA or protein sequence of a gene that cause resistance. Here I review the population genetic theory of the generation and <b>maintenance</b> of <b>sequence</b> variation and the factors that influence recombination and the maintenance of genetic linkage. Although the use of linked genetic markers is a powerful tec h-nique, the interpretation of sequence data needs some care. We currently lack data on the rate of re-combination in parasitic nematodes and so we have little specific knowledge on the distance over which linked markers may be useful. There are ways in which such data can be gathered and this, in combination with sequence data from the ongoing genome projects will bring in a new era for the ap-plication of linkage analysis in the field of research into anthelmintic resistance...|$|R
40|$|The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) {{formation}} flying mission, {{which consists of}} four spacecraft flying in a tetrahedral formation, has challenging navigation requirements associated with determining and maintaining the relative separations required to meet the science requirements. The baseline navigation concept for MMS is for each spacecraft to independently estimate its position, velocity and clock states using GPS pseudorange data provided by the Goddard Space Flight Center-developed Navigator receiver and maneuver acceleration measurements provided by the spacecraft's attitude control subsystem. State estimation is performed onboard in real-time using the Goddard Enhanced Onboard Navigation System flight software, which {{is embedded in the}} Navigator receiver. The current concept of operations for formation maintenance consists of a <b>sequence</b> of two <b>maintenance</b> maneuvers that is performed every 2 weeks. Phase 2 b of the MMS mission, in which the spacecraft are in 1. 2 x 25 Earth radii orbits with nominal separations at apogee ranging from 30 km to 400 km, has the most challenging navigation requirements because, during this phase, GPS signal acquisition is restricted to less than one day of the 2. 8 -day orbit. This paper summarizes the results from high-fidelity simulations to determine if the MMS navigation requirements can be met between and immediately following the <b>maintenance</b> maneuver <b>sequence</b> in Phase 2 b...|$|R
5000|$|WAT is {{the second}} {{psychological}} test of SSB selection process, in this test the candidates are shown a word on a screen {{for a period of}} 15 seconds, in this time duration the candidate has to write the first thought that comes in his/her mind for that word. Total 60 words will be shown one after another( [...] i.e. between each word the gap will be of 15 seconds). The answer sheets will be provided to candidates only once, candidates are required to make no mistakes such as unnecessary cutting or scribbling. There will be no blank slide, {{as in the case of}} TAT, so candidates should not write any response on a blank slide. The words shown will be very simple and of day to day use, this test will not assess a candidates proficiency in English language. If a candidate is not aware of meaning of a certain words he can skip that word and wait for next word to flash, and write the response for the next word. The main idea is to maintain the sequence of responses given to the word, the <b>maintenance</b> of <b>sequence</b> is important, as assessor can derive the result systematically for the respective response.|$|R
40|$|Memory T cells protect hosts from {{pathogen}} reinfection, but {{how these}} cells {{emerge from a}} pool of antigen-experienced T cells is unclear. Here, we show that mice lacking the transcription factor Foxo 1 in activated CD 8 + T cells have defective secondary, but not primary, responses to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Compared to short-lived effector T cells, memory-precursor T cells expressed higher amounts of Foxo 1, which promoted their generation and <b>maintenance.</b> Chromatin immunoprecipitation <b>sequencing</b> revealed the transcription factor Tcf 7 and the chemokine receptor Ccr 7 as Foxo 1 -bound target genes, which have critical functions in central-memory T cell differentiation and trafficking. These findings demonstrate that Foxo 1 is selectively incorporated into the genetic program that regulates memory CD 8 + T cell responses to infection...|$|R
40|$|Acquisition {{of genetic}} {{information}} through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) {{is an important}} evolutionary process by which micro-organisms gain novel phenotypic characteristics. In pathogenic bacteria, for example, it facilitates maintenance and enhancement of virulence and spread of drug resistance. In the genus Mycobacterium, to which several primary human pathogens belong, HGT has not been clearly demonstrated. The few existing reports suggesting this process are based on circumstantial evidence of similarity of sequences found in distantly related species. Here, direct evidence of HGT between strains of Mycobacterium avium representing two different serotypes is presented. Conflicting evolutionary histories of genes encoding elements of the glycopeptidolipid (GPL) biosynthesis pathway led {{to an analysis of}} the GPL cluster genomic sequences from four Mycobacterium avium strains. The sequence of M. avium strain 2151 appeared to be a mosaic consisting of three regions having alternating identities to eitherM. avium strains 724 or 104. Maximum-likelihood estimation of two breakpoints allowed a~ 4100 bp region horizontally transferred into the strain 2151 genome to be pinpointed with confidence. The <b>maintenance</b> of <b>sequence</b> continuity at both breakpoints and the lack of insertional elements at these sites strongly suggest that the integration of foreign DNA occurred by homologous recombination. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate naturally occurring homologous recombination inMycobacterium. This previously undiscovered mechanism of genetic exchange may have major implications for the understanding of Mycobacterium pathogenesis...|$|R
