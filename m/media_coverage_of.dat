5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, the point most {{emphasized}} in <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the game was the fact that Wake Forest had not won an ACC championship in football since 1970. The point spread for the game was relatively constant, with spread bettors favoring Georgia Tech by a single point.|$|E

5|$|Images of meth mouth {{are usually}} {{considered}} disturbing {{and have been}} used in anti-drug campaigns, even being placed on hoardings/billboards. The condition is often mentioned in <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> methamphetamine, and it has been included in media portrayals of drug abuse to demonstrate the scope of the drug's effects or to provoke disgust in the audience. Opponents argue that the term is used to negatively stereotype methamphetamine users, and that it is falsely portrayed as inevitable or characteristic.|$|E
5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement {{was the most important}} issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's murder {{received}} {{considerable attention}} in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more {{on the lack of}} parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the murder has been cited as an example of blaming the victim. Leigh's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled A Property of the Clan, which was later revised and renamed Blackrock, as well as a feature film of the same name.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent to}} which the {{deterrence}} argument is well-founded, however, is far from the only interesting and important aspect of this common justification of capital punishment. In fact, current conceptualizations of the deterrence argument are also paramount, insofar as they implicitly operate under the assumption that the media and publicity are integral to shaping individuals' awareness and understandings of capital punishment. In other words, current conceptualizations of the deterrence argument presuppose that most people are made aware of executions through the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> said executions, which means that the media's selection of executions to cover, as well as the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> said executions are necessary for the deterrence effect to transpire. In this regard, in contemporary society, the deterrence argument relies upon the implicit understanding that people's understandings and actions - including actions that may deprive an individual of life - are influenced by the media. Although it is increasingly unclear {{as to whether or not}} the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> has affected criminal behavior, it is necessary to examine how the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> executions and, more abstractly, its holistic construction of capital punishment has shaped people's actions and understandings related to this controversial practice.|$|R
40|$|The year 2011 was memorable {{for many}} in India – for {{those who participated in}} {{numerous}} anti-corruption protests, and for those who witnessed these protests via all pervasive mainstream news media. This paper will use inter-media agenda-setting discourse to explain the Indian <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the so-called ‘Anna movement’. It will outline how the use of mobile and social media platforms by the ‘India Against Corruption’ organisers and the educated middle class influenced the mainstream <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the protests. The paper will consider the implication <b>of</b> this <b>coverage,</b> {{in the light of the}} unique position of power the Indian news media has in this transitioning society...|$|R
50|$|Further, Noelle-Neumann {{describes}} the spiral of silence as a dynamic process, in which predictions about public opinion become fact as mass <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> {{the majority opinion}} becomes the status quo, and the minority becomes less likely to speak out.|$|R
5|$|<b>Media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the {{movement}} has focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of {{the movement}}.|$|E
5|$|Ron Fournier {{from the}} National Journal said the {{incident}} was a reflection of how Veterans Affairs was failing soldiers suffering from PTSD. Fournier also commented on how <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> {{the incident was}} largely ignoring the fact that Gonzalez was a war veteran with mental health issues. As {{a result of the}} Gonzalez incident, and other controversies relating to the security of the White House, including the 2011 White House shooting, Pierson resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E

She finished {{in a time of}} 32.16 in eighth and last place, nine seconds behind South African Isabel Le Roux in seventh position. Having had no funding, Omar competed in loose fitting equipment donated by the Sudanese team, but despite finishing in last place, the <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> her meant that she was cheered loudly by the crowd as she finished.|$|E

5|$|The Irascibles or Irascible 18 {{were the}} labels {{given to a}} group of American {{abstract}} artists who put name to an open letter, written in 1950, to the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, rejecting the museum's exhibition American Painting Today - 1950 and boycotting the accompanying competition. The subsequent <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the protest and a now iconic group photograph, that appeared in Life magazine, gave them notoriety, popularised the term Abstract Expressionist and established them as the so-called first generation of the putative movement.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrical {{themes are}} dark, {{focusing}} on global tensions and political happenings during 2014. The {{rise of the}} Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the 2015 general election in the United Kingdom, and various mass shootings influenced its writing. The band's musical sound was composed to provide contradiction to the violent subject matter, and is inspired by artists such as Radiohead, Suicide, and Kendrick Lamar. As with previous Everything Everything work, most of the songs are presented as in-character narrations.|$|E

Track and field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.|$|E

50|$|The spring 1996 {{issue of}} Ryerson Review of Journalism, {{published}} by the journalism school, ran an investigative piece on the Hannon controversy.

5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|Chinese <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was {{compared}} favourably {{to that of}} the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported that over 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mainstream}} <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> hippie {{life in the}} Haight-Ashbury {{drew the}} attention of youth from all over America. Hunter S. Thompson termed the district [...] "Hashbury" [...] in The New York Times Magazine, and the activities in the area were reported almost daily.|$|R
5000|$|The Johnson {{administration}} {{employed a}} [...] "policy of minimum candor" [...] in its {{dealings with the}} media. Military information officers sought to manage <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> by emphasizing stories that portrayed progress in the war. Over time, this policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements. As the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the war {{and that of the}} Pentagon diverged, a so-called credibility gap developed.|$|R
40|$|The {{title is}} {{a quote from}} a blog entry written by the Swedish {{journalist}} Linus Fremin. For many years Fremin suffered from bulimia and he claims that men {{for a long time}} have been excluded from <b>medias</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> eating disorders. We wanted to try this thesis and decided to do a quantitative study of articles published in two Swedish newspapers, Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter, regarding eating disorders during the period 20101129 - 20121129. We studied 199 articles and counted the occurrence {{of men and women in}} the texts. Our study showed that women were represented in a majority of the articles, whereas the men were clearly much more absent. In most of the articles eating disorders were described as a female issue and men were rarely included. It’s difficult to say how the ideal division of men and women in <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> eating disorders should look like. Perhaps the ideal to strive for is not “fifty-fifty”, since more women than men today are diagnosed with an eating disorder. But it is important to know that this exclusion <b>of</b> men in <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> eating disorders contributes to the public opinion that eating disorders is an non-issue among men. ...|$|R
5|$|Following the loss, Virginia Tech {{won five}} {{straight}} games {{to win the}} Coastal Division of the ACC, while Boston College stumbled, losing two games before defeating the Clemson Tigers to win the Atlantic Division and representation in the Championship Game. Most pre-game <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the event cast the game {{as an opportunity for}} Virginia Tech to avenge its earlier loss. In addition, the winner of the game would be awarded an automatic bid to the Bowl Championship Series 2008 Orange Bowl game in Miami, Florida on January 3, 2008. Despite Boston College's earlier win over Virginia Tech, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech by five points.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the game focused on Auburn's {{exclusion}} from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the {{weeks leading up}} to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
