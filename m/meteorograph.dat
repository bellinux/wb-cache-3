5000|$|The <b>meteorograph</b> {{recording}} of weather variables [...] "as they happen" [...] is simply another application of time-series. Examples are the barograph, wind, or thermograph traces, and early upper air soundings. [...] The mechanical <b>meteorograph,</b> {{which was used}} {{to take the first}} atmospheric soundings above the surface, traced the data in a series of lines similar to the seismograph, became known as a meteorogram of the sounding data.|$|E
50|$|What {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of the observatory was an article published in Diario de Manila by Jesuit Fr. Jaime Nonell which described Jesuit Fr. Francisco Colina's observations of the typhoon of September 1865. The article led the public to ask Jesuit Superior Juan Vidal for the observations to be continued. After initial hesitation {{on the part of the}} Jesuits because of the primitive instruments available, the Superior yielded upon the promise of a Secchi Universal <b>Meteorograph</b> purchased from the Vatican.|$|E
50|$|Professor C. G. A. Rossby, {{who led the}} Institute's {{division}} of Meteorology, collaborated in studies to develop improved methods of recording weather data for comprehensive studies of cloud formations and their connection with the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Specially designed photographic equipment was installed in the plane. The readings are automatically and continuously recorded throughout the flight on a thin sheet of smoked aluminum foil on a revolving drum. The research plane has places for three passengers {{in addition to the}} pilot, and was fitted with various scientific instruments for special weather studies, including a <b>meteorograph</b> used for registering temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity.|$|E
40|$|These include: {{differences}} in the paths followed by the airplane and the balloon and therefore possibly even different air masses encountered; the limited experience of persomiel in the technique of calibrating and of mnking regularly scheduled observations of this kind; {{differences in}} time, in some cases, between the airplane and radiometeorograph observations; diiferences in rate of ascent and lag of radiometeorograph and aerometeorograph; possible changes in the aerometeorograph since last calibration; and possible differences between the initial temperatures of the instruments. It is planned {{in the near future}} to obtain comparisons by sending aloft the vnrious types of radiometeorographs simultaneously from the smie place, ulth recording, i. e., nonradio, <b>meteorographs</b> attached to the same balloon. This method of comparison is considered to be more relidble than the airplane observations used so far. In view of the promising results being obtained with radiometeorographs and because of the great value of the observationnl data, it is planned {{to increase the number of}} stations to six next fiscal year. To do this, it will be necessary to re,place airplane with radiometeorogrnph observations at some place,s, since additional funds were not made avnilable for this work. An important factor in this connection, which should reduce the cost materially at favorably located stations, is the large percentage of instruments which will be found and returned. The percentages of recovery for some of the past sounding balloon series made in t’his country wit,h recording <b>meteorographs,</b> i. e., the nonradio types, are given in table 3...|$|R
5000|$|He {{graduated}} from Petersburg University in 1914, {{worked in the}} Main Physical (Geophysical) Observatory in Pavlovsk between 1917 and 1939 {{and then at the}} institute of civil air fleet in Leningrad. He studied possibilities of applying aerological data to the weather forecast. Molchanov constructed <b>meteorographs,</b> carried by sondes and aircraft and improved pilot observation technique. The radiosonde was first launched by him - on January 30, 1930. [...] Named [...] "271120", it was released 13:44 Moscow Time in Pavlovsk, USSR from the Main Geophysical Observatory and reached a height of 7.8 kilometers measuring temperature there (-40.7 °C). 32 minutes after the launch radiosonde sent the first aerological message to the Leningrad Weather Bureau and Moscow Central Forecast Institute. In July 1931, conducting programme of the International Polar Year, German scientists invited him to take part in an expedition into the Arctic onboard LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin and launch his radiosondes in polar latitudes. Twelve sondes were prepared for that purpose at Pavlovsk Observatory under Molchanov's leadership and successfully launched, conducting the first aerological observations in the Arctic. Molchanov also participated in first Soviet stratospheric balloon ascents (1933-34).|$|R
50|$|Formal {{meteorological}} and astronomical {{services in}} the Philippines began in 1865 {{with the establishment of}} the Observatorio Meteorológico de Manila in Padre Faura St., Manila when Francisco Colina, a young Jesuit scholastic and professor at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila started a systematic observation and recording of the weather {{two or three times a}} day. Jaime Nonell, another Jesuit scholastic, wrote a brief treatise on these observations, which was printed by the Diario de Manila. The treatise attracted the attention of businessmen in Manila and a request was made to the Jesuit director, Fr. Juan Vidal, SJ, for regular observations for the purpose of warning the public against approaching typhoons. The businessmen financed the procurement and acquisition of an instrument called the Universal <b>Meteorograph</b> (an invention of another Jesuit, Fr. Angelo Seechi, SJ of the Vatican Observatory in Rome) which would greatly aid in the day and night observations of the weather.|$|E
50|$|In 1901 he {{commenced}} researches {{into the}} problems of the upper air, and designed or perfected several instruments for use with kites, as well as a form of the Hargraves box-kite, which proved of great value. In 1905 he was appointed by the Meteorological Office director of experiments in connexion with the investigation of the upper air, and in 1907 designed a <b>meteorograph</b> for use with balloons. He also produced, in conjunction with Dr. Napier Shaw, the microbarograph and a recording mercury barometer, as well as various other instruments. From 1901 to 1902 he was President of the Royal Meteorological Society and in 1905 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Although he was never a full-time academic, {{he was a member of}} the International Commission for Scientific Aeronautics, and became an honorary or corresponding member of various foreign scientific societies. He is the author of many important papers on the meteorology of the upper atmosphere which appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society, the Geophysical Memoirs of the Meteorological Office and elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|He {{received}} dispens for his D Sc (Ph D) {{degree at}} the University of Uppsala in 1925 while still in Norway. He left the following year with {{the closure of the}} Haldde observatory (after a short time in Tromsö) to become 'docent' at the Meteorological Institute in Uppsala and was elected professor in 1936 to succeed Filip Åkerblom. The institute was at this time located in the 'Observatorieparken' since the late 19th century. The professorship did then include an adjacent eight-room house, very suitable for his family of six children and a new wife. The Seismograph housed in an adjacent building was at the time part of the Institute. The 'Instrumenthuset', another separate small building housed the Theorell <b>meteorograph</b> [...] an automatic weather station, registering the temperarature since 1853. A new Institute building was on Kōhler's initiative completed in 1949,also located in observatorieparken. During 1947-48 Kŏhler also established an observatory including a 30m high tower in Marsta a small community north about 10 km north of Uppsala. Wind-speeds and temperature were measured and registered at several heights at the tower. Instruments were mostly built in the workshop at the Uppsala Institute. The tower was considered unsafe in the 1980s because of corrosion and subsequently demolished. A second professorship in meteorology to specialize on weather prognosis was on Köhler's recommendation instituted and upheld by Tor Bergeron in 1949. The institute had 2-3 positions at the level of assistant. These had jour-duty associated with making weather observations that included calibrating the thermometer readings of the 'Theorell'. The institute {{has its roots in the}} works of Anders Celsius and Köhler had a keen interest in supporting this heritage and the daily observations was part of this.and so was the care-taking of original records and instruments including the Celsius thermometer. One example of his historical interest was his paper on the 'older history of the thermometer'.The snow and cloud investigations on Pårtetjåkko and Haldde now resulted in several publications as well as theoretical aspects of these investigations. The chlorine in form of salts (in particular sodium-chlorate) in the fog and clouds as well as droplet-sizes was the subject of his 1933 article ref. Another work on the similar subject but now also including an analysis of the chlorine content in sea-water The aim of this study was to prove (or disprove) that the nuclei of condensation in the clouds had the same composition as that of the sea-water.He was also interested in climatology and acquired a Dobson ozone spectrophotometer collecting data 1951-1986.|$|E
40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{overlays}} are appealing, {{since they}} can aggregate resources of end systems without relying on sophisticated infrastructures. Services {{can thus be}} rapidly deployed over such overlays. Primitive P 2 P overlays only support searches with single keywords. For queries with multiple keywords, presently only unstructured P 2 P systems can support by extensively employing message flooding. In this study, we propose a similarity information retrieval system called <b>Meteorograph</b> for structured P 2 P overlays without relying on message flooding. <b>Meteorograph</b> is faultresilient, scalable, responsive and self-administrative, which is particularly suitable for an environment with an explosion of information {{and a large number}} of dynamic entities. An information item stored in <b>Meteorograph</b> is represented as a vector. A small angle between two vectors means that the corresponding items are characterized by some identical keywords. <b>Meteorograph</b> further stores similar items at nearby locations in the P 2 P overlay. To retrieve similar items, only nodes in nearby locations are located and consulted. <b>Meteorograph</b> is evaluated with simulation. The results show that <b>Meteorograph</b> can effectively distribute loads to the nodes. Discovering a single O log N and item and a set (in size k) of similar items takes () k) O(log N) (⋅ messages and hops respectively, where N is the c number of nodes in the overlay and c is the storage capacity of a node. 1...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the special {{features of the}} F-type radiosonde in distinguishing from {{the rotation of the}} fan whether the downward movement of the radiosonde balloon is due to a strong vertical downward current or due to the accumulation of snow. It shows how the rate of rotation of the fan can be used to identify regions of turbulence in the atmosphere. The observations of the turbulence with the F-type radiosonde are compared with the inferences drawn by turbasondes in the U. S.
