Myers {{also said that he}} believed it would <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> for there to be a dedicated radio station for jazz listeners than the current 45 hours of jazz to be played on Smooth FM, as required by the licence granted to them by Ofcom.

25|$|While {{most years}} China's {{agricultural}} production {{is sufficient to}} feed the country, in down years, China has to import grain. Due to the shortage of available farm land and an abundance of labor, it might <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> to import land-extensive crops (such as wheat and rice) and to save China's scarce cropland for high-value export products, such as fruits, nuts, or vegetables. In order to maintain grain independence and ensure food security, however, the Chinese government has enforced policies that encourage grain production {{at the expense of}} more-profitable crops. Despite heavy restrictions on crop production, China's agricultural exports have greatly increased in recent years.|$|E
25|$|This {{has been}} a {{particular}} problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins in other currencies) because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies and then melt them down for their metal value. It cost more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the coins in circulation could be expensive for the US Treasury. This {{was more of a}} problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so strict laws against alteration <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> historically.|$|E

This {{raised the issue of}} where the match should be played, as the cup final is traditionally played in Glasgow. The Scottish Football Association decided that an Edinburgh venue would <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense,</b> and decided upon New Logie Green, the home of St Bernard's. Hearts won 3–1 before a crowd of 17,000. The following season a victory over Hearts in their final League match could have given them the league championship, but a 1–0 defeat allowed Hearts to go on claim the title instead.|$|E

500|$|Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "I Do" [...] as a [...] "mini-season finale", {{as it was}} {{the last}} episode before mid-season hiatus, and would end in a cliffhanger.

500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics.

[...] The writer praised Browning's take on [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", writing that it [...] "adds a lush darkness and vibrant vulnerability to the song reminiscent of Portishead's Beth Gibbons but with a flair all her own." [...] Florino awarded the album four and a half stars out of five, and concluded his review, writing, [...] "This is the kind of soundtrack that needs to be listened to from front to back, and if it's any indication, the film is destined {{to be one of the}} most mind-blowing and magnificent screen event this year, perhaps even the decade." [...] Allmusic's Heather Phares reviewed the album positively, praising Browning for [...] "deliver the soundtrack’s most affecting performances". Phares concluded her review with [...] "Sucker Punch is elaborate and sometimes overwrought, but it’s absolutely true to the film’s aesthetic." [...] Billboard reviewer Phil Gallo described the soundtrack as [...] "a rush of male-targeted female power" [...] which de Vries and Bates scored with [...] "dark, eerie and violent soundscapes". Gallo found Yoav's contribution to [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] to be [...] "the soundtrack's most tender moment". Writing for Empire, Danny Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as [...] "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for [...] "an exuberant version of Roxy Music’s 'Love Is The Drug'" [...] and considering Björk's collaboration [...] "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie". Jon M. Gilbertson of Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was not very fond of the album, writing that [...] "Maybe these covers <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> in filmic context, but on their own they exude an air of pointlessness.
