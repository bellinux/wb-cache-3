500|$|In February 2014, a short {{preview of}} the song was {{released}} featuring the chorus, performed by Kanye West and Big Sean. Following the track list reveal for the album, on February 7, 2014, producer DJ Mustard revealed that he co-produced [...] "Sanctified" [...] with Kanye West. The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook in fifteen minutes while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how he feels about people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not going to worry about it. Then later he says, [...] "Wipe <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> with a handkerchief and wash my sins in the blood of Jesus, People sayin', 'Ye, we need another Yeezus." [...] This being a reference to his experimental sixth studio album.|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 1913 Wedge {{announced}} his resignation from the ministry in Eureka, California, as [...] "the {{call of the}} blood was too strong". Wedge announced: [...] "I am quitting the ministry for several sufficient reasons. <b>My</b> <b>forehead</b> is too low, my jaw is too square. I like the things of the world too well".|$|E

I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand into my pocket, and took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E

2500|$|In 1913, Pound was {{contacted}} by the widow of the recently deceased Orientalist Ernest Fenollosa, who while in Japan had collected word-by-word translations and notes for 150 classical Chinese poems that fit in closely with this program. Chinese grammar offers different expressive possibilities from English grammar, a point that Pound subsequently made much of. For example, in Chinese, {{the first line of}} Li Po's (called [...] "Rihaku" [...] by Fenollosa's Japanese informants) poem [...] is a spare, direct juxtaposition of 5 characters that appear in Fenollosa's notes as mistress [...] hair [...] first [...] cover [...] browIn his resulting 1915 Cathay, Pound rendered this in simple English as While my hair was still cut straight across <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Manilow {{returned}} to Arista Records under Davis {{for a new}} covers album, released January 31, 2006, called The Greatest Songs of the Fifties. Manilow said he was blown away with the idea, which Davis presented when he visited Manilow's Las Vegas show. [...] "When he suggested this idea to me, I slapped <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> and said, 'Why hasn't anyone thought of this idea?'" [...] Manilow said. It was an unexpected success, debuting at {{number one in the}} Billboard 200, marking the first time a Manilow album debuted {{at the top of the}} album chart as well as the first time a Manilow album has reached number one in 29 years. It was eventually certified Platinum in the U.S., and sold more than 3 million copies worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, in his Spectator blog {{he wrote}} about Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the Labour Party, in unflattering terms. Liddle began the article by asking: [...] "So — Harriet Harman, then. Would you? I mean after a few beers obviously, not while you were sober." [...] Tanya Gold {{asserted}} in The Guardian that Liddle had delivered a [...] "tissue-thin polemic." [...] Pointing {{out that it was}} The Spectators cover story that week, Gold wondered if, after 100 years of striving to improve women's rights, whether [...] "we're back in the schoolyard – or is it the brothel?" [...] Rachel Cooke in The Observer nearly two months later recalled finding Liddle's piece [...] "so disgusting I flushed violently all the way from my breastbone to <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> when I first read it. I looked like I had German measles." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Tuesday, 22d.--Barometer rapidly falling. Heavy {{clouds in}} the south-east. My heart sank into gloomy forebodings. Read Manfred, and doubted whether I should live long.

2500|$|When {{there were}} rumours that Sun He {{could no longer}} secure his {{position}} as Crown Prince, Lu Xun wrote a memorial to Sun Quan: [...] "The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir apparent so he should have a foundation as solid as hard rock. The Prince of Lu is a vassal and a subject of the state, so he should receive less favours than the Crown Prince. If both of them know their places, Your Majesty and all your subjects will have peace. I humbly kowtow and beg Your Majesty, {{to the point of}} bleeding (from <b>my</b> <b>forehead),</b> to (re)consider this issue carefully." [...] He wrote several memorials to Sun Quan and even requested to leave Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei) and go to the capital to speak up on this problem. Sun Quan denied him permission. Lu Xun's maternal nephews Gu Tan, Gu Cheng (顧承) and Yao Xin (姚信), who supported Sun He during the succession struggle, were sent into exile. Wu Can, the Crown Prince's Tutor (太子太傅), who had been exchanging letters with Lu Xun, was imprisoned and later executed.|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lines From <b>My</b> Grandfather's <b>Forehead,</b> {{a comedy}} sketch show for radio, was first {{broadcast}} on BBC Radio 4 from 15 February 1971. Two series of eight episodes were broadcast, {{the second was}} transmitted from 21 July 1972. In addition, there were two [...] "specials". A Christmas special, entitled 'Lines From My Grandfather Christmas's Forehead', was broadcast on 24 December 1971; and a compilation of selected items from past editions, under the title 'Just A Few Lines From My Grandfather's Forehead', was broadcast on 27 August 1977.|$|R

After leaving the army, he worked with seaside orchestras, a touring opera company and as a ship's musician, but it was during the 1960s he came to prominence as a pianist, arranger and composer on BBC programmes such as Music in the Air, Melody around the World and Ronnie Barker's Lines From <b>My</b> Grandfather's <b>Forehead.</b> In later life he lived in East Devon, mainly composing but occasionally appearing in recordings, concerts and broadcasts.|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{broadcast}} on BBC Radio 4 {{in the late}} night Friday slot, as a summer replacement for Week Ending. Lines From <b>My</b> Grandfather's <b>Forehead</b> occupied the slot as well. A running joke was that Cecil, an actor with a very distinctive voice, played many character parts, all the same apart from a slight twang, which the actors in the programme would discuss before the story resumed. Cecil often dropped the accents, Welsh, American and so on, after a few lines. Jason and Gooderson played most of the voice parts, though Jason had a recurring role as Charlie, the sound effects man.|$|R

The music of the Cows' bells (for their wealth, like the Patriarchs', is cattle) in the pastures, (which reach to a height far above any mountains in Britain), and the Shepherds' shouting to us from crag to crag, and playing on their reeds where the steeps appeared almost inaccessible, with the surrounding scenery, realized all that I have ever heard or imagined of a pastoral existence:--much more so than Greece or Asia Minor, for there we are a little too much of the sabre and musquet order; {{and if there is a}} Crook in one hand, you are sure to see a gun in the other:--but this was pure and unmixed--solitary, savage, and patriarchal....
