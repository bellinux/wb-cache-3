Such an identity system is expected, from where, people can retrieve any of the identities necessary to access every available service with adequate security. Success of such identity depends on its usability in the current and probable future wireless technology. Authentication is another important issue for acceptance of this system. This paper proposes a concept of identity mechanism through which individuals can exercise exactly the similar real world roles in the digital world. The concept enhances the privacy of individual by <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> of identifying information. It focuses on the possible use of widely accepted mobile phone technology to authenticate user to such identity system and to interact services through it.

40|$|Drawing {{on recent}} {{observational}} fieldwork {{as well as}} existing research studies {{in the fields of}} law and of psychology, this article examines the nature of police practices in the disclosure of evidence before and during custodial interviews of legally represented suspects. Whilst police pre-interview disclosure to lawyers was a fixed practice, the format of disclosure varied and lawyers were rarely permitted to inspect the evidence, relying instead on the officer’s account. Disclosure was sometimes provided in stages, either as a deliberate tactic or when evidence was lacking. Officers occasionally exaggerated the strength of their case to suspects and resisted providing more detail to lawyers – an approach that seemed designed to elicit an admission from the suspect. In line with past research, lawyers relied on the evidence that police disclosed when advising clients before the interview and occasionally argued with the police for more disclosure. Taken together, these findings suggest that police are complying with the <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements set out by legislation, and that police may be more open with lawyers than previous research suggests. Some of our findings warrant concern, however, and raise questions about risks to vulnerable suspects in custody and risks to suspects without legal representation...|$|R

The broadening {{of the definition of}} the duty to inform that senior officers owe directors to include an underlying affirmative duty to provide information, even when director or shareholder action is not requested, offers an opportunity for greater monitoring of corporate governance by focusing on those often most culpable. Currently, the plain language of Delaware’s delegation of authority statute protects directors who reasonably rely in good faith on the reports of corporate officers. However, officers’ reports must include more than <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements.

The empirical data was gathered from the years 2008 to 2010 to provide {{a clear picture of}} the change in the level and extent of NMD, and its influences over the periods 2008 to 2010. It {{can be seen from the}} Fiji perspective that the mandatory requirements tend to have a financial focus. However, it would be expected that the level of company disclosures would have changed over time, with not only global market forces but through differing societal values which have increased the frequency and demand of non-mandatory reporting by companies. All companies showed some degree of NMD, and on average this demonstrates an increasing trend. The stakeholders are receiving more information about a company’s activities. The companies were analysed in light of recent developments in corporate governance by the Capital Markets Development Authority (CMDA) implementing their 10 corporate governance principles. This became a major driver of the increase in NMD levels of the disclosures in the annual reports of the listed companies. However, a large variation still exists between the level and extent of the NMD and the different listed companies. The <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> level found over the three years was 9. 09 percent, which has increased to a minimum of 13. 66 percent in 2010, and the maximum disclosure level over the three years was 81. 82 percent. The findings for {{the extent of}} NMD was also similar where the minimum words used in NMDs was 114, increasing to 854 in 2010, and the maximum disclosure extent over the three years was 21, 414 words. However, it was found that the measurement of counting words tended to fluctuate over different periods where significant events took place that affected the company. Therefore, it was established that disclosure is impacted by what happens in the reporting period, and can explain why one period may have greater disclosure than another.

40|$|HIV/Aids {{is one of}} {{the largest}} risks facing Africa today. The disease has spread at a rapid rate {{throughout}} the continent and South Africa in particular. To date it remains an epidemic without any cure. It is systematically destroying the economic progress made over centuries. HIV/Aids is most prevalent in the economically active groups in South African society and could ultimately change the demographic, social and economic landscape in South Africa. Business is taking up the challenge and response strategies are being developed and implemented to contain and mitigate the risks posed by the disease. Stakeholders have a direct interest in being kept informed on both the risks and the responses to the disease. As such, information pertaining to HIV/Aids should be disclosed in the annual report of a company, and such information should be useful, relevant, reliable and comparable. HIV/Aids disclosure is currently voluntary and adheres to the characteristics of social accounting. Social accounting aims to inform beyond the traditional financial aspects and is increasing as stakeholders demand more information from reporting entities for decision-making purposes. In South Africa, a number of developments have increased the prominence of voluntary HIV/Aids disclosure in annual reports. These include the Second King Report on Corporate Governance, the Global Reporting Initiative’s proposals for HIV/Aids disclosure in South Africa and a joint disclosure project between the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants and the JSE Securities Exchange. This study investigates current practices related to HIV/Aids disclosure in an attempt to develop a framework for future disclosure practices through thematic content analysis. The study covered a six-year period from 1998 to 2003. The annual reports of all listed South African companies on the JSE Securities Exchange were investigated for that period. The study found that there was an increase in disclosure related to HIV/Aids over the period under review, but that by the end of 2003, still fewer than half of all JSE-listed companies disclosed HIV/Aids information. An upward trend in disclosure was identified, and it is expected that the number of reporting entities will continue to increase. The information disclosed varied considerably between the disclosing entities. This dilutes the usefulness and comparability of HIV/Aids information for stakeholders. Valuable information was obtained as to preferential themes and data related to HIV/Aids that are disclosed voluntarily in annual reports. The study concludes with a recommended framework based on the literature review and the results of the empirical study. The framework proposes <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> content focusing on two main risks, namely the risk to employees and the South African community and the associated responses by the company. The framework also proposes the disclosure of current and future costs and losses related to HIV/Aids, where such information exists. The proposed framework aims to find a balance between the normative and the descriptive in HIV/Aids disclosure, and proposes that fewer issues be disclosed, thereby focusing on specific issues that will enable consistency and comparability in HIV/Aids disclosure practices.

40|$|Abstract Over {{the past}} few years, a large and ever increas-ing number of Web sites have {{incorporated}} one or more social login platforms and have encouraged users to log in with their Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other social networking iden-tities. Research results suggest that {{more than two million}} Web sites have already adopted Facebook’s social login plat-form, and the number is increasing sharply. Although one might theoretically refrain from such social login features and cross-site interactions, usage statistics show that more than 250 million people might not fully realize the privacy implications of opting-in. To make matters worse, certain Web sites do not offer even the minimum of their functional-ity unless users meet their demands for information and social interaction. At the same time, in a large number of cases, it is unclear why these sites require all that personal informa-tion for their purposes. In this paper, we mitigate this prob-lem by designing and developing a framework for <b>minimum</b> information <b>disclosure</b> in social login interactions with third-party sites. Our example case is Facebook, which combines a very popular single sign-on platform with information-rich social networking profiles. Whenever users want to browse to a Web site that requires authentication or social interaction using a Facebook identity, our system employs, by default, a Facebook session that reveals the minimum amount of infor-mation necessary. Users have the option to explicitly elevate that Facebook session in a manner that reveals more or al...|$|R

We develop techniques for setting up secure group communication and providing accesses to group members for many database systems, which incorporate new security constrains and policies raised by current information technologies. We create new forms of access control models to identify and address issues of sharing information in collaborative environments and to specify and enforce privacy protection rules to support identified issues. In role based access control systems (RBAC) permissions are associated with roles, and users are made members of appropriate roles thereby acquiring the roles’ permissions. This greatly simplifies management of permissions. Roles are created for various job functions in an organization and users are assigned roles based on their responsibilities and qualifications. Users can be easily reassigned from one role to another. Roles can be granted new permissions as new applications and systems are incorporated, and permissions can be revoked from roles as needed. The principal motivation of RBAC is to simplify administration. In large organizations the number of roles {{can be in the}} hundreds or thousands, and users can be in the tens or hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions. Effective management of permission-role assignment could be very useful in practice to avoid the security breach, especially when conflicting permissions granted to the same role. Constraints are an important aspect of RBAC and are a powerful mechanism for laying out higher level organizational policy. Even for the usage control (UCON) model, constraints are discussed less and no formal language is proposed to describe constraints precisely. An appealing is to study constraints formally in RBAC and UCON models. Our work looks at proposing formal approaches to check conflicts and help allocate permissions without compromising security in RBAC and proposing a formal language to specify constraints for system designers and administrators in UCON models. Delegation requirement arises when a user needs to act on another’s behalf to access resources. Essentially, in a multi-agent system, delegation becomes the primary mechanism of inter-agent collaboration and cooperation. However, the previous delegation model could not work efficiently in large systems and perform the sensitive delegation task within the broad area of security. In this thesis, we introduce a flexible ability-based delegation model within RBAC. Moreover, to avoid risk during the delegation process, we propose a secure multi-level delegation model, where a projection between the reliability of delegatees and the sensitivity of delegated tasks is built. Our multi-level delegation model allows that a delegatee in a higher trust level can be assigned with a higher level task. With the widespread use of information technology, privacy protection becomes a major concern and it could not be easily achieved by traditional access control models. In this thesis, we propose a privacy-aware access control model with generalization boundaries, which could maximize data usability while, minimizing disclosure of privacy. Moreover, our privacy-aware access control model provides a much finer level of control. Although Hippocratic database enforced the fine-grained disclosure policy through creating a privacy authorization table, but it does not allow to distinguish which particular method is used for fulfilling a service in a real world case. We use a goal-oriented approach to analyze privacy policies of the enterprises involved in a business process, in which one can determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>disclosure</b> of data for fulfilling the root purpose with respect to customer’s maximum trust. We provide efficient algorithms to automatically derive the optimal way of authorizations needed to achieve a service from enterprise privacy policies. ...|$|R
