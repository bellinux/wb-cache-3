Monoclonal mouse anti-swine IgM was used as the capturing antibody, and rabbit anti-PRV hyperimmune gamma globulin was used as the indicating antibody. Sera from non-PRV-infected, experimentally infected, vaccinated and challenged, passively immune and challenged, and naturally infected swine were evaluated. The PRV MACELISA had a specificity of 95 % and was as sensitive and reproducible as previously reported in direct assays. An antibody response was still detectable with the MACELISA 21 days after inoculation. The PRV MACELISA did not detect a consistent antibody response in sera from swine vaccinated with either killed-PRV or <b>modified</b> <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> but did detect an antibody response in sera from passively immune pigs after challenge with virulent PRV.

40|$|The {{search for}} antigens capable of causing immune-complex-mediated {{glomerulonephritis}} continues. <b>Modified</b> <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> commercially available {{for veterinary use}} are a possible source. In this study, repeated vaccination of mink with <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> was investigated {{as a model for}} vaccine-induced glomerular injury. Three groups of 10 -wk-old mink, 15 per group, were vaccinated once with 4 -way vaccine against distemper, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, botulism and mink viral enteritis. Subsequently, all mink in each group each were vaccinated either with the 4 -way vaccine, a monovalent canine distemper vaccine, or saline. Glomerular function was assessed at 2 -wk intervals by determining the urinary protein:creatinine (P:C) ratio. Kidney sections taken at necropsy, 20 wk after the 1 st vaccination, were examined by light and immunofluorescent microscopy for deposition of immunoglobulin and complement. There was no statistically significant difference between the treated and control groups based on average urinary P:C ratio medians. Light microscopic changes were detected in glomeruli, but Fisher's exact test showed no significant differences between any of the treatment groups. Deposition of immunoglobulin but not complement was significantly more frequent (P < 0. 05) in the glomeruli of animals that received multiple injections of the 4 -way vaccine than in the glomeruli of those given only the monovalent canine distemper vaccine or saline. These findings suggest that repeated vaccination may increase the glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin. Further studies are required to determine if the increased deposition of immunoglobulin contributes to the development of glomerular damage and to identify the antigens driving production of the deposited immunoglobulin...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination is {{a useful}} option to control {{infection}} with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and several modified live-PRRSV vaccines have been developed. These vaccines have shown some efficacy in reducing the incidence and severity of clinical disease {{as well as the}} duration of viremia and virus shedding but have failed to provide sterilizing immunity. The efficacy of <b>modified</b> <b>live-virus</b> (MLV) <b>vaccines</b> is greater against a homologous strain compared with heterologous PRRSV strains. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of Fostera PRRS MLV vaccine in protecting against challenge with a heterologous field strain widely circulating in the swine herds of eastern Canada. Forty-six piglets were divided into 4 groups: nonvaccinated-nonchallenged; nonvaccinated-challenged; vaccinated-challenged; and vaccinated-nonchallenged. The animals were vaccinated at 23 d of age with Fostera PRRS and challenged 23 d later with a heterologous field strain of PRRSV (FMV 12 - 1425619). Overall, the vaccine showed some beneficial effects in the challenged animals by reducing the severity of clinical signs and the viral load. A significant difference between nonvaccinated and vaccinated animals was detected for some parameters starting 11 to 13 d after challenge, which suggested that the cell-mediated immune response or other delayed responses could be more important than pre-existing PRRSV antibodies in vaccinated animals within the context of protection against heterologous strains...|$|R
40|$|Equine {{arteritis}} virus (EAV) replicase {{consists of}} two polyproteins (pp 1 a and pp 1 ab) that are encoded by open reading frames (ORFs) 1 a and 1 b of the viral genome. These two replicase polyproteins are posttranslationally processed by three ORF 1 a-encoded proteinases to yield at least 13 nonstructural proteins (nsp 1 to nsp 12, including nsp 7 α and 7 β). These nsps are expressed in EAV-infected cells, but the equine immune response they induce has not been studied. Therefore, {{the primary purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response of horses to each of the nsps following EAV infection. Individual nsp coding regions were cloned and expressed in both mammalian and bacterial expression systems. Each recombinant protein was used in an immunoprecipitation assay with equine serum samples from horses (n = 3) that were experimentally infected with three different EAV strains (VB, KY 77, and KY 84), from stallions (n = 4) that were persistently infected with EAV, and from horses (n = 4) that were vaccinated with the <b>modified</b> <b>live-virus</b> (MLV) <b>vaccine</b> strain. Subsequently, protein-antibody complexes were subjected to Western immunoblotting analysis with individual nsp-specific rabbit antisera, mouse anti-His antibody, or anti-FLAG tag antibody. Nsp 2, nsp 4, nsp 5, and nsp 12 were immunoprecipitated by most of the sera from experimentally or persistently infected horses, while sera from vaccinated horses did not react with nsp 5 and reacted weakly with nsp 4. However, serum samples from vaccinated horses were able to immunoprecipitate nsp 2 and nsp 12 proteins consistently. Information from this study will assist ongoing efforts to develop improved methods for the serologic diagnosis of EAV infection in horses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{activate}} both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, {{require only}} a single boosting, and generally provide longer immune protection than killed or subunit vaccines. However, growth of <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serialtransfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes {{has the potential to}} attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein.

The level of replication of bovine and human PIV- 3 and the efficacy of immunization with bovine PIV- 3 in protecting against subsequent challenge with human PIV- 3 was evaluated in nonhuman primates. The dura-tion and magnitude of replication of human and bovine PIV- 3 in {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tracts of New World monkeys was similar, and animals infected with bovine PIV- 3 developed resistance to challenge with human PIV- 3. The replication of two bovine strains of PIV- 3 was restricted 100 -to 1000 -fold in Old World primates but was sufficient to induce high levels of neutralizing antibody to human PIV- 3.

Development of {{safe and effective}} <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> against neurotropic flavivirus infections demands a detailed knowledge of their neuropathogenesis in a primate host that is evolutionarily close to humans.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease (ND) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} viral disease of poultry caused by pathogenic strains of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Live NDV vaccines are administered by drinking water, eyedrops or coarse aerosol spray. To further enhance mucosal immune responses, chitosan nanoparticles were developed for the mucosal delivery of a live NDV vaccine. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A lentogenic <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccine</b> (strain LaSota) against NDV encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles were developed using an ionic crosslinking method. Chitosan nanoparticles containing the lentogenic <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccine</b> against NDV (NDV-CS-NPs) were produced with good morphology, high stability, a mean diameter of 371. 1 nm, an encapsulation rate of 77 % and a zeta potential of + 2. 84 mV. The Western blotting analysis showed that NDV structural proteins were detected in NDV-CS-NPs. The virus release assay results of NDV-CS-NPs indicated that NDV was released from NDV-CS-NPs.

We have tested candidate CDV vaccines incorporating the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (HA) proteins in the highly attenuated NYVAC strain of vaccinia virus and in the ALVAC strain of canarypox virus, which does not productively replicate in mammalian hosts. Juvenile ferrets were vaccinated twice with these constructs, or with an attenuated <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> while controls received saline or the NYVAC and ALVAC vectors expressing rabies virus glycoprotein. Control animals did not develop neutralizing antibody and succumbed to distemper after developing fever, weight loss, leukocytopenia, decreased activity, conjunctivitis, an erythematous rash typical of distemper, CNS signs, and viremia in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (as measured by reverse transcription-PCR).

Swine influenza virus (SIV) infection also poses important human public health concerns. Vaccination is the primary method {{for the prevention of}} influenza virus infection. Previously, we generated two elastase-dependent mutant SIVs derived from A/Sw/Saskatchewan/ 18789 / 02 (H 1 N 1) : A/Sw/Sk-R 345 V (R 345 V) and A/Sw/Sk-R 345 A (R 345 A). These two viruses are highly attenuated in pigs, making them good candidates for a <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> In this study, the immunogenicity and the ability of these candidates to protect against SIV infection were evaluated in pigs. We report that intratracheally administrated R 345 V and R 345 A induced antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity characterized by increased production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibodies in the serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, high hemagglutination inhibition titers in serum, an enhanced level of lymphocyte proliferation, and higher numbers of gamma interferon-secreting cells at the site of infection. Based on the immunogenicity results, the R 345 V virus was further tested in a protection trial in which pigs were vaccinated twice with R 345 V and then challenged with homologous A/Sw/Saskatchewan/ 18789 / 02, H 1 N 1 antigenic variant A/Sw/Indiana/ 1726 / 88 or heterologous subtypic H 3 N 2 A/Sw/Texas/ 4199 - 2 / 9 / 98. Our data showed that two vaccinations with R 345 V provided pigs with complete protection from homologous H 1 N 1 SIV infection and partial protection from heterologous subtypic H 3 N 2 SIV infection. This protection was characterized by significantly reduced macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions, lower virus titers from the respiratory tract, and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

To this end, we analyzed all the samples by ELISA, using an indirect assay set up in the laboratory. Specific anti-NDV IgG antibodies were detected in tracheal and cloacal swabs and tracheal and intestinal washes of immunized animals. We also found specific anti-NDV IgG antibodies in tracheal and intestinal tissue culture supernatants, indicating that the IgG found in swabs and washes was not transudated from serum or, at least, was not all transudated from serum. Knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the immune response of chickens to different NDV vaccines should increase our understanding of the mucosal response against the virus and, eventually, provide new useful information for the development and evaluation of synthetic vaccines...|$|R
40|$|We {{constructed}} recombinant feline herpesviruses (FHVs) {{expressing the}} envelope (env) and gag genes of {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV). Expression cassettes, utilizing the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, were inserted within the thymidine kinase gene of FHV. The FeLV env glycoprotein expressed by recombinant FHV was processed and transported to the cell surface much as in FeLV infection, with the exception that proteolytic processing to yield the mature gp 70 and p 15 E proteins was less efficient {{in the context of}} herpesvirus infection. Glycosylation of the env protein was not affected; modification continued in the absence of efficient proteolytic processing to generate terminally glycosylated gp 85 and gp 70 proteins. A recombinant FHV containing the FeLV gag and protease genes expressed both gag and gag-protease precursor proteins. Functional protease was produced which mediated the proteolytic maturation of the FeLV gag proteins as in authentic FeLV infection. Use of these recombinant FHVs as <b>live-virus</b> <b>vaccines</b> may provide insight as to the role of specific retroviral proteins in protective immunity. The current use of conventional attenuated FHV vaccines speaks to the wider potential of recombinant FHVs for vaccination in cats...|$|R
