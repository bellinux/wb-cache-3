Specifically, it explores the extent of strategic <b>management</b> accounting (SMA) <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> usage among Malaysia’s E&E companies. The results indicate that E&E companies use SMA <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> extensively. The results imply that companies are extending their <b>management</b> accounting <b>information</b> towards more externally focused and strategic material. This finding enriches our current knowledge about the extent of SMA information usage among organisations.

40|$|Ad hoc {{networking}} is {{the basis}} of the future military network-centric warfare architecture. Such networks are highly dynamic in nature, as mobile ad hoc networks are formed over wireless links that are susceptible to failure. Strict requirements on security and reliability combined with the dynamic nature of the network provide a strong motivation for self-forming, self-configuring, and selfhealing capabilities in the network. This paper describes a policy-based mobile ad hoc network management system that addresses these needs. The system provides the capability to express networking requirements in the form of policies at a high level and have them automatically realized in the network by intelligent agents. Our system provides the following capabilities: flexible monitoring and reporting that enables collection of <b>management</b> <b>information</b> from network <b>elements</b> at configurable intervals; automated configuration and reconfiguration of network elements based on reported network status; user-definable aggregation and filtering of monitored <b>management</b> <b>information</b> at the source of the data so as to reduce management station processing and network transmission overhead. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work was to define {{guidelines}} based on which lead management could be best supported. The focus was on how systems and processes could support this work. To reach the objectives, both theoretical and empirical research was conducted. Theoretical research was a literature review related to sales lead <b>management</b> and <b>information</b> <b>elements</b> tied to sales leads. Knowledge and activity information that could be tied to leads were investigated. Empirical research included interviews and participant observation. Analysis was conducted inductively. As a result, the requirements and roles involved in lead management were solved, {{as well as what}} kinds of information is tied to leads and how their quality could be evaluated and improved. It was found that to best support sales’ lead management work, the CRM system should be configured to support collaboration between different stakeholders. Collaboration was seen as an important part of being able to manage leads through information. For better end-to-end process visibility, the existing web lead management system should be migrated onto the same platform as other CRM activities. The CRM system’s usability should also be developed to support collaboration. By utilizing tacit knowledge in qualifying leads, the process can be systemized and lead information standardized...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{autonomous}} network management, the Autonomic Managers (AMs) need to collect <b>management</b> <b>information</b> from other <b>elements</b> in order to infer an overall state of the network considered by the decision making process. Two concurrent strategies are commonly used to achieve this operation. On one hand, approaches based on a situated view only gather information in a bounded neighborhood, thus providing a high reactivity to AMs for control operations. On the other hand, approaches based on a global view provide a good accuracy {{at the cost of}} a larger convergence time. Being able to choose the best approach in a given context is crucial to ensure the efficiency of an autonomous management system. Thus, in this paper, we perform an exhaustive performance analysis of these approaches by considering typical schemes of both of them, namely a one-hop and two-hops situated view against gossip- and tree-based global aggregation schemes. Metrics we consider are the convergence time, communication and computation cost, scalability and the accuracy of estimated aggregates. Given them, we show under which conditions an approach outperforms the others...|$|R
