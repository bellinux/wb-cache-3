5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E
5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or rape of a mortal woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. In a few cases, a female divinity <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E
50|$|Females {{prefer to}} <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> certain males more than others. Females show a {{distinct}} preference for <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> new males. Female G. bimaculatus <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> {{at least two}} males before zygote production occurs.|$|R
40|$|If <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> an {{inferior}} male has high fitness costs, females {{may try to}} avoid <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> these males. Alternatively, females may accept {{an inferior}} male to ensure they have obtained at least one mate, and/or to avoid the costs of resisting these males. We hypothesized that females compensate for <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> an inferior male by remating. We tested this hypothesis by measuring remating propensity in females that had <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> an old, multiply-mated male, a 9 -day-old virgin male, or a young, virgin male. Females {{were more likely to}} remate when they had <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> multiply-mated males than when they had <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> a 9 -day-old or young virgin male. We discuss the observed mating behavior by females in terms of sexual selection for multiple mating...|$|R
50|$|Many mammal species, {{including}} humanity's closest primate relatives, tend {{to avoid}} <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> close relatives, {{especially if there}} are alternative partners available. However, some chimpanzees have been recorded attempting to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> their mothers. Male rats have been recorded engaging in <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> their sisters, {{but they tend to}} prefer non-related females over their sisters.|$|R
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|Romulan agents {{board the}} ShiKahr and capture Kirk. Spock agrees to their demands and travels with them. Whilst en route, Spock enters pon farr and finds {{that he is}} linked to Kirk, but <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> the Romulan Thea {{to allow it to}} pass. They {{retrieve}} Kirk, and discover that taking Kirk and Spock was a ploy to have them both travel back in time to stop the Romulan agents from preventing the formation of the Federation. They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. Kirk and Spock mindmeld as reality shifts once more and restores the original timeline.|$|E
50|$|Females Drosophila pseudoobscura mate through {{polyandry}} {{meaning they}} <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> {{more than one}} male. By <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> multiple males, polyandrous females have more genetically diverse offspring.|$|R

50|$|Assortative mating {{in humans}} {{has been widely}} {{observed}} and studied, and {{can be broken down}} into two types of human assortative mating. These are genetic assortative mating, or assortative <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> <b>mate</b> choice based on genetic type and phenotypical expression, and social assortative mating, or assortative <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> <b>mate</b> choice based on social, cultural, and other societal factors.|$|R
5|$|Species is a 1995 American {{science fiction}} horror film {{directed}} by Roger Donaldson and written by Dennis Feldman. It stars Natasha Henstridge (in her debut film role), Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger. In the film, a motley crew {{of scientists and}} government agents tries to track down a seductive alien played by Henstridge before she successfully <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> a human male. Due to her ruthlessness, the alien character was cited {{as an example of}} negative treatment of female sexuality and aliens by Hollywood. The design of Sil was also linked to a chupacabra sighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} caste of {{a mature}} colony includes a fertile female and male, {{known as the}} queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates {{at a certain time}} of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5000|$|These {{pipefish}} have a polygynandrous <b>mating</b> system, <b>with</b> {{both males}} and females <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> multiple partners during a breeding season.|$|R
50|$|Unlike bees in the Apini tribe {{where the}} queen {{exhibits}} polyandry, queens in P. remota are monandrous. The males will crowd around {{the entrance to}} the colony since this will increase the male’s chances of <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> the virgin queen. The male will attempt to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the queen as she tries to leave the nest. The male that <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> the queen will then leave a mating plug to deter further chances of mating.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{relative}} ease of <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> a gold compared to other pieces, it is often advantageous to keep an gold in hand during the endgame so that a <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a dropped gold can be executed.|$|R
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working <b>mates.</b> <b>With</b> the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of Meerkat Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E
50|$|Like {{almost all}} heterobranchs, Glaucus is a hermaphrodite, having {{both male and}} female {{reproductive}} organs. Unlike most nudibranchs, which <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> their right sides facing, sea swallows <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> ventral sides facing. After mating, both animals produce egg strings.|$|R
500|$|Younger or {{subdominant}} male pinnipeds may {{attempt to}} achieve reproductive success in other ways. Subadult elephant seals will sneak into female clusters {{and try to}} blend in by pulling in their noses. They also harass and attempt to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> females that head out to the water. In otariid species like the South American and Australian sea lions, non-territorial subadults form [...] "gangs" [...] and cause chaos within the breeding rookeries to increase their chances of <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> females. Alternative <b>mating</b> strategies also exist in young male grey seals, which do have some success. Female pinnipeds do appear to have some choice in mates, particularly in lek-breeding species like the walrus, but also in elephant seals where the males try to dominate all the females {{that they want to}} <b>mate</b> <b>with.</b> When a female elephant seal or grey seal is mounted by an unwanted male, she tries to squirm and get away, while croaking and slapping him with her tail. This commotion attracts other males to the scene, and the most dominant will end the copulation and attempt to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the female himself. Dominant female elephant seals stay {{in the center of the}} colony where they are more likely to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a dominant male, while peripheral females are more likely to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> subordinates. Female Steller sea lions are known to solicit <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> their territorial males.|$|R
500|$|During the nuptial flight, a queen may <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> {{multiple}} males, {{while the}} males will only <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a single queen, making them monogynous. However, Ochetellus glaber queens will only <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a single male, making them polygynous. Sometimes, colonies proliferate by [...] "budding" [...] (also called [...] "satelliting" [...] or [...] "fractionating"), where {{a subset of}} the colony including queens, workers and brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site.|$|R
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she <b>mates</b> <b>with,</b> and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
25|$|In {{behavioral}} ecology, polyandry is a {{class of}} mating system where one female <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> several males in a breeding season. Polyandry is often compared to the polygyny system based on the cost and benefits incurred by members of each sex. Polygyny is where one male <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> several females in a breeding season (e.g., lions, deer, some primates, and many systems where there is an alpha male).|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} proximate {{benefit for}} females {{is that sometimes}} after a male <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> a female, he becomes her mate. Then, he would defend and protect her. This is seen in many primate species.|$|E
25|$|Virgin queens go on mating flights {{away from}} their home colony to a drone {{congregation}} area, and <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> multiple drones before returning. The drones die {{in the act of}} mating. Queen honey bees do not <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> drones from their home colony.|$|R
50|$|Females who <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> virgin {{males were}} less likely to suffer genital damage {{compared}} to those who <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> sexually experienced males.
