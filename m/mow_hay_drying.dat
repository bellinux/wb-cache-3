40|$|The {{production}} of ventilated barn hay {{results in a}} high quality fodder for ruminants. Nevertheless, this production method is still a niche in Germany even it is found in organic farming. Reasons are the few publications about required investments of the needed technology for <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> in the barn. This article provides investment and energy costs for different drying techniques: for box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> three different farm sizes were compared, for bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> only one farm size is calculated. Bale <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> demands more power and investment cost as box <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> of loose <b>hay.</b> Bale <b>drying</b> {{is more complicated than}} barn drying in that the number of bale drying locations in a barn is a limiting factor to throughput, as is also the drying of densely packed bales. Barn drying is above all practical on farms where hay is the only forage on offer. Its particular advantage is the large amounts of crop that can be dried at the same time. Bale drying tends to be applied more on farms that want their forage partly as grass silage and partly as barn-dried hay...|$|R

40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted a study to enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on a wire <b>hay</b> rack. Results: <b>Drying</b> on a <b>hay</b> rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried on a wire hay rack.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that plants {{accumulate}} sugars in leaves during the day because the rate of photosynthetic production of sugar is faster than its export to other parts of the plant and faster than its conversion to structural cellulose and lignin carbohydrates.
