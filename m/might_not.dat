5|$|The {{school has}} {{developed}} a specific program focus that includes film, photography, writing, and art, using Gordon Parks's life as an inspiration and guide. In partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, students are documenting stages of transition along University Avenue through the stories of elders, business owners, and residents affected by the METRO Green Line light-rail transit project. The students {{learn more about the}} neighborhood's history, document stories of the LRT project that <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be told, and share images that <b>might</b> <b>not</b> otherwise be seen.|$|E

5|$|After {{a week of}} shooting, {{the film}} was shelved due {{to the view that}} such a story <b>might</b> <b>not</b> succeed in Telugu; the {{production}} company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure. D.L. Narayana then decided to revive Devadasu as an independent producer. Janaki, who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati, was replaced by Savitri.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were more}} than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come, and in that interval, which seemed a long one, I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks. I loved my darling so well that I was more {{concerned}} for their effect on her than on any one. I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am quite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be wholly prepared? When she first saw me, <b>might</b> she <b>not</b> be a little shocked and disappointed? <b>Might</b> it <b>not</b> prove a little worse than she expected? <b>Might</b> she <b>not</b> look for her old Esther and <b>not</b> find her? <b>Might</b> she <b>not</b> have to grow used {{to me and to}} begin all over again? ...|$|R

5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be as weakened as previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, {{meaning that they}} can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use them to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been used during the killings, that the crime scene may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E

5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they should also.|$|E
5|$|Careful {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending {{on the law of}} the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{technical}} {{leap forward}} boosted the public's understanding of conflicts between {{technology and the}} environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts. In France, the use of acoustic fencing alongside TGV tracks <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise. In the UK, the CPRE has issued tranquillity maps since 1990.|$|E

[Improvement.] If I {{should a}} little improve the text where this title is first given to man, {{and show the}} posture he was in when it was said to him, 'Thy name shall be called Israel'; and should also debate upon the cause or ground of that, 'An Israelite indeed,' thou <b>mightest</b> <b>not</b> repent it who shall read it; and {{therefore}} {{a few words to}} each.|$|R

Give her ten years of power, and the hated name of Christian might be forgotten, and Athene Polias, colossal in ivory and gold, watching in calm triumph over the harbours of a heathen Alexandria.... But the price! ...|$|R
5|$|Despite her editors' {{warnings}} {{that the book}} <b>might</b> <b>not</b> sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, {{in her hometown of}} Monroeville, and throughout Alabama.

5|$|During {{the storm}} of 10 July 1968, the lake gained an extra 471millionimperial gallons (2,140,000m³) and rose 19inches (480mm) in under 12hours.

5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We <b>might</b> <b>not</b> win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, {{the sons}} of Frederick Law Olmsted, {{landscape}} architect for Central Park in New York, Carey and Frederick, Jr. were asked to design the park's master plan while they were at work on Grant Park.

5|$|Initially, Disney {{executives}} {{wanted to}} set the film in contemporary times, out of concern that a period piece <b>might</b> <b>not</b> appeal to a large audience.
