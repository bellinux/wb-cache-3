5|$|The main {{landing gear}} was {{strengthened}} {{and the size of}} the <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> was increased to 650 x 200mm (25.5 x 7.87in).|$|E
5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was {{the first}} model produced, a total of 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units, replacing the single <b>main</b> <b>wheels.</b> Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-212, {{one such}} variant, began in 1947 as a twin-engined, all-metal, two-seat jet fighter. The round, {{streamlined}} fuselage was optimized to reduce drag and house the {{considerable amount of}} equipment and fuel required by the VVS. It had mid-mounted straight laminar flow wings and the engine nacelles were mounted {{in the middle of}} the wing, with the wing spars continued by banjo rings around the engines. The cruciform tail unit was swept at 45°. To save weight, the main load-bearing structures of the airframe were constructed from V-95 aluminum alloy and high-strength steel. Elektron (a magnesium alloy) was used for many components and castings. The aircraft used a tricycle undercarriage with the <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> retracting into the fuselage. Hydraulically actuated air brakes were fitted either side of the rear fuselage.|$|E
40|$|The {{customary}} side hand propulsion ring {{adjacent to}} each <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> of a manual wheelchair is mounted through a lost motion {{connection between the}} propulsion ring and <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> so that the propulsion ring can have limited rotational movement relative to the <b>main</b> <b>wheel.</b> A friction brake drum or partial drum fixed to the wheelchair frame inside of the <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> is engaged {{by at least one}} of a plurality of circumferentially spaced over center friction locking devices pivotally held on the <b>main</b> <b>wheel.</b> Each over center friction locking device is moved by a release element to a non-locking position relative to the drum or partial drum in response to reverse movement of the propulsion ring by a chair occupant. Economy and ease of operation are provided for. The wheelchair occupant need not remove his or her hand from the propulsion ring when operating the anti-rollback mechanism.

5000|$|The {{airplane}} {{stands on}} a sprung, retractable main undercarriage with a six-inch hub, and a nose wheel which is likewise sprung and retracts simultaneously with the <b>main</b> <b>wheel.</b> A fixed tail wheel is also provided. This undercarriage scheme simplifies ground handling, since fuselage [...] are not required. The <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> is located near the glider's empty centre of gravity.|$|R
50|$|The Sprite {{was built}} in two {{different}} versions, differing only in <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> placement.|$|R
5|$|The first F-111C, A8-126 {{selected}} for conversion to the RF-111C variant was modified at General Dynamics plant at Fort Worth, Texas between October 1978 and 18 April 1979. After {{four months of}} test flights, the aircraft returned to Australia in August 1979 where it conducted further tropical weather trials at Darwin. The other three aircraft were modified by the RAAF's No. 3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley in 1980, using kits purchased from General Dynamics. The RF-111C variant proved to be highly successful, and {{was considered to be}} among the best tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the world. Three of the four RF-111Cs remained in RAAF service until 2010. The other aircraft was retired in 2006 after suffering damage from landing on its belly after one of its <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> separated during take off; although the aircraft was repairable it was judged not worthwhile doing so due to the impending retirement of the entire F-111 fleet. The RAAF does not have an aircraft with the RF-111C's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities since they were retired.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} {{consists}} of two widely separated <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> and a nose skid. These are deployed using springs, assisted by gravity. Once deployed, they cannot be retracted inflight.|$|E
25|$|One {{aircraft}} {{built by}} Stroukoff, as C-123B but fitted with boundary layer control system, tailplane endplates, redesigned landing gear with tandem <b>main</b> <b>wheels.</b> Later designated YC-134A when fitted with Pantobase landing gear.|$|E

50|$|Below {{this second}} arbor, {{there is the}} fly arbor which is {{connected}} via an 8-pin birdcage, making a x3 gear ratio. Each turn of the <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> will turn the fly 18 times. As the <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> has 8 hour pins, each single hour strike corresponds to 2¼ turns of the fly, which {{is located at the}} back of the clock outside the clock frame.|$|R
25|$|The Sealand was a {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with a flying boat hull and both underwing floats and a standard tail-wheel undercarriage; the two <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> retracted into recesses in the hull below the wings, while the tailwheel retracted behind the hull's planing bottom.|$|E
25|$|The Navy-Wright NW-1 was an {{unconventional}} streamlined design, {{based on a}} sesquiplane with <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> faired into the lower wing, and bracing minimized to further reduce drag. Lamblin radiators were suspended beneath the fuselage and wire bracing was incorporated for the mid-fuselage mounted main wing and tailplane.|$|E
25|$|No aircraft, or {{significant}} parts from one, survive. The Royal Air Force Museum has some Heyford components: {{a pair of}} <b>main</b> <b>wheels,</b> two blades of a Heyford propeller and tailplane parts of Heyford III, K6875 of 166 squadron, recovered from its crash site in the Peak District.|$|E

25|$|The Buccaneer II {{is similar}} to the SX, but with a wider hull to {{accommodate}} two seats, in side-by-side configuration. The ailerons are 2/3 span. The landing gear is repositioned by a lever control and moves the tailwheel in concert with the <b>main</b> <b>wheels.</b> The main gear includes mechanical brakes.|$|E
25|$|Conventional landing gear, or tailwheel-type landing gear, is an {{aircraft}} undercarriage {{consisting of two}} <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> forward {{of the center of}} gravity and a small wheel or skid to support the tail. The term taildragger is also used, although some claim it should apply only to those aircraft with a tail skid rather than a wheel.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is the wheel landing. This requires the pilot {{to land the}} aircraft on the <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> while maintaining the tailwheel {{in the air with}} elevator to keep the angle of attack low. Once the aircraft has slowed to a speed that can ensure control will not be lost, but above the speed at which rudder effectiveness is lost, then the tailwheel is lowered to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Model {{with the}} <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> set further {{back and a}} nose wheel. Also {{incorporates}} a larger cockpit for taller pilots. Introduced in 1996.|$|R
50|$|This {{model has}} an aft-position <b>main</b> <b>wheel,</b> a non-sprung {{tailwheel}} and an aluminum nose skid. It {{was intended for}} purchase by schools and clubs.|$|R
50|$|AB-95-115 - 86 kW (115 hp) Textron Lycoming O-235 engine, more {{streamlined}} {{engine and}} <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> fairings (45 built). Subsequently, this was developed into AB-115.|$|R
25|$|A steam {{locomotive}} {{is a type}} of railway locomotive that produces its pulling power through a steam engine. These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible material – usually coal, wood, or oil – to produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind.|$|E
25|$|Executed {{just above}} the runway, the flare arrests the aircraft's descent just prior to touchdown. By raising the aircraft's nose (pitching up) lift {{momentarily}} increases, reducing the descent rate, and allows the <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> to gently contact the runway. During the flare, pilots retard the throttles to idle to reduce engine thrust. A squat switch in the main landing gear detects the touchdown and automatically deploys the spoilers, if armed. This destroys any remaining lift and helps the aircraft slow down.|$|E
25|$|The Spitfire Mk 26 is an '80% or 90% scale' (but {{see note}} of scale {{inaccuracies}} in the Variants section below) replica {{based on the}} original Supermarine Spitfire design. Despite its smaller size provision is made for a passenger to be seated in tandem behind the pilot. The stressed skin structure consists of 2024 aluminium alloy skins, formers and longerons with some fibre-glass mouldings for parts such as fairings and air scoops. The design features retractable undercarriage with differential braking to the <b>main</b> <b>wheels.</b> The aircraft has {{been approved by the}} British Light Aircraft Association.|$|E

25|$|The {{guideway}} was uni-directional, {{with all}} vehicles {{traveling around the}} airport in a counter-clockwise direction. The top of guideway walls contained rails that steered the vehicles. Small urethane wheels {{on either side of}} the vehicle engaged the rail and were mechanically linked to a conventional steering suspension on the <b>main</b> <b>wheels.</b> Switching was provided by switching bars {{on either side of the}} guideway that raised or lowered to trap one of the two sets of guidance wheels under them. The switch was adapted from existing fail-safe switches used on railways.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the first}} {{prototype}} was completed in 1968. A first flight on 27 June 1967 ended prematurely due to oscillations caused by control problems; one set of <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> contacted the ground hard bursting a tyre and bending a wheel hub. The cause of the oscillations {{proved to be a}} harmonic amplification of vibrations in the cockpit floor feeding back into the control column when a roll demand was input into the cyclic stick. It was widely but erroneously reported in the Western press that the aircraft had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The G.11E's {{fuselage}} has a tapered, oval section. The forward part is a {{light alloy}} monocoque containing the well glazed cockpit, accessed by two sliding doors. The rear fuselage is a steel tube structure, covered in fabric, bearing a tall T-tail with a moving, one-piece tailplane which corrected the cyclic pitch via the control column to prevent once per revolution pitch oscillations. A wide track undercarriage has <b>main</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted on horizontal V-struts from the fuselage bottom and with a single bracing strut to the mid-fuselage on each side.|$|E
40|$|A failed <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> hub of an {{aircraft}} was forwarded to the laboratory for analysis. Examination {{revealed that the}} <b>main</b> <b>wheel</b> hub has failed by fatigue. Fatigue crack {{was found to have}} initiated at a corrosion pit at the fillet of the outer face rim flange. Corrosion pits were also observed at few other places along the fillet. Chemical analysis showed that the material of the wheel hub conforms to L- 77 alloy specification. The microstructure of the wheel hub was found to be satisfactory and there were no evidences of metallurgical abnormalities...|$|R
