500|$|From 1987 to 1992, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty {{released}} music under names including The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) and The KLF. [...] Following {{a run of}} {{five consecutive}} UK top-five singles, The KLF executed a high-profile retirement from the music business and deleted their entire back catalogue, declaring that [...] "For the foreseeable future, {{there will be no}} further record releases from any past, present or future name attached to our activities." [...] Drummond and Cauty's subsequent art project, the K Foundation, disposed of The KLFs earnings, including by burning one million pounds of it, money which was originally provisionally earmarked by the duo for millennial celebrations. Bill Drummond: [...] "Originally we were going to invest the whole lot in some capital growth fund and spend it all on one big event, <b>maybe</b> <b>at</b> the millennium".|$|E
500|$|Born around 1080, Bethune was the {{youngest}} son of a knightly family, [...] whose name derives {{from the town of}} Béthune in Artois. His friend and biographer William of Wycombe said he and Robert came from nearby villages, which suggests that Robert grew up in Buckinghamshire, <b>maybe</b> <b>at</b> Wingrave where in 1086 the major landowner was the knight Gunfrid of Chocques, whose family came from the village of that name outside Béthune. Robert's eldest brother, also called Gunfrid, was a schoolmaster and trained his young brother in the same profession. However he died, and Robert had to make provision for his children. This done, he went to study theology under William of Champeaux and Anselm of Laon. He was a canon of Llanthony Priory before 1115, and was elected prior of that house in the middle 1120s. Before becoming prior, he was entrusted with establishing a cell of the priory at Weobley, which had been established by Hugh de Lacy shortly before Lacy's death around 1115.|$|E

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{disliked the}} episode, criticizing it as [...] "sloppy," [...] the science as [...] "repeating itself," [...] and the fringe element [...] as [...] "especially goofy"; he rated the episode 6.0/10. Writing for Mania.com, critic Stephen Lackey thought Anna Torv's {{performance}} [...] "felt forced", but heaped praise on John Noble. Lackey believes Torv and Joshua Jackson have good chemistry, and consequently partly disliked the episode {{because they had}} few scenes together. He also thought {{the case of the}} week was [...] "fairly entertaining," [...] but the storyline was [...] "just...passable", as he wanted the show [...] "to be done with all of the introductions and get more into the mystery of the pattern". He concluded his review, [...] "Hopefully, next week the story will be just a little more concise, Olivia and Peter back working together and <b>maybe</b> <b>at</b> some point Astrid will actually have something important to do". The Los Angeles Times thought the episode was [...] "solid if unexceptional", as he liked Walter but disliked the [...] "vacuum of personality" [...] that is Astrid.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, <b>maybe,</b> <b>at</b> one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E

2500|$|Nearly universally panned by theatre critics, they concurred that Beauty and the Beast was a [...] "great spectacle, but {{not great}} theater". Likening the musical to the Empire State Building, David Richards of The New York Times called the show [...] "hardly {{a triumph of}} art, but it'll {{probably}} be a whale of a tourist attraction." [...] While awarding specific praise towards its musical numbers, choreography, costumes and cast – particularly Mann's ability to [...] "convey the delicacy of awakening love" [...] despite the physical demands of his costume, {{at the same time}} Richards criticized the production's set and special effects for lacking subtlety, ultimately accusing them of leaving little [...] "to the imagination". Richards concluded, [...] "The result is a sightseer's delight, which isn't the same thing as a theatergoer's dream." [...] Also writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby disparaged the musical entirely as [...] "relentlessly bland, busy, upbeat and robotlike", criticizing the production for resembling [...] "a dinner theater." [...] Canby felt that the new Menken-Rice songs were [...] "inferior" [...] to the originals, likened the special effects to Fourth of July sparklers, criticized the sound engineering for ranging from too loud to barely audible, and panning Woolverton's book for failing to supplement her screenplay. Minor praise was awarded to the performances of Lamberts, Beach and Fowler, as well as Mann's climactic beast-to-prince transformation. In addition to predicting that Beauty and the Beast would be derided by traditional Broadway theatre-goers and critics alike, Variety writer Jeremy Gerard was largely negative in his own review. While admitting that the production [...] "boasts several real pluses", Gerard criticized the show for appearing [...] "bloated, padded, gimmick-ridden, tacky and... utterly devoid of imagination." [...] The critic voiced his strong disapproval of the costumes while dismissing the set as [...] "something designed to be seen by people in moving seats, <b>maybe</b> <b>at</b> Disneyland", panning West's choreography and ultimately deriding Roth's directing and blocking of actors who [...] "look generally like they're following dotted lines on the stage." [...] Critics agreed that Roth's direction and West's were equally uninspired. In a mixed review with a headline reading [...] "Beauty and the Beast isn't magical in the least, even if it does bristle with magic tricks", New Yorks John Simon wrote that the production resembles [...] "a belated infomercial" [...] for the film by which he was bored, yet impressed by its special effects and illusions. Simon also felt that the actors struggled to resemble their animated counterparts despite Hould-Ward's, criticizing Egan's acting, Woolverton's dialogue and the new Menken-Rice numbers while praising Moses', Beach's and Fowler's performances.|$|E
