5|$|Domnall mac Causantín's {{nickname}} was dásachtach. This simply meant a madman, or, {{in early}} Irish law, a <b>man</b> <b>not</b> {{in control of}} his functions and hence without legal culpability. The following long reign (900–942/3) of his successor Causantín is more often regarded {{as the key to}} formation of the Kingdom of Alba.|$|E
5|$|In {{seventeenth century}} Spain, Lope de Vega, with a {{detailed}} knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance La Arcadia (1598), {{it leads to}} absurdity; in his novela Guzman el Bravo (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for <b>man,</b> <b>not</b> man for the stars. Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy Astrologo Fingido (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy Feint Astrologue.|$|E

Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{confirms that}} the test results conclusively disprove Fassl as the killer. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, Fassl notices a mysterious Bearded Man. After being released, he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When the Bearded Man appears, Fassl begs for the <b>man</b> <b>not</b> to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old <b>man</b> <b>not</b> far from the shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why {{he wants to keep}} the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E

25|$|Free-standing statues (three-dimensional depictions) {{are almost}} {{non-existent}} within the Orthodox Church. This is {{partly due to}} the rejection of the previous pagan Greek age (Greek gods) of idol worship and partly because icons are meant to show the spiritual nature of <b>man,</b> <b>not</b> the sensual earthly body. Bas reliefs, however, became common during the Byzantine period and led to a tradition of covering a painted icon in a silver or gold 'riza' in order to preserve the icon. Such bas relief coverings usually leave the faces and hands of the saints exposed for veneration.|$|E

25|$|The {{medicine}} men {{of ancient}} Maya society provided many services {{to their communities}} and were held in high regard. Known for their extensive knowledge and spirituality, medicine men were called upon for many reasons, but most often for their healing capabilities. These Maya doctors often employed specialists for specific healing techniques such as bone-setting and childbirth, similar to the method of modern doctors. In addition to his duties as a doctor and sorcerer, a medicine <b>man</b> <b>not</b> only cured diseases, but also sporadically accepted compensation to cause them. The ah-man was also called ah-pul-yaah, the “disease thrower”.|$|E
25|$|In Italy a {{familiar}} DNA search {{has been done}} to solve the case of the murder of Yara Gambirasio whose body was found in the bush three months after her disappearance. A DNA trace was found on the underwear of the murdered teenage near and a DNA sample was requested from a person who lived near the municipality of Brembate di Sopra and a common male ancestor was found in the DNA sample of a young <b>man</b> <b>not</b> involved in the murder. After a long investigation the father of the supposed killer was identified as Giuseppe Guerinoni, a deceased man, but his two sons born from his wife were not related to the DNA samples found on the body of Yara. After {{three and a half years}} the DNA found on the underwear of the deceased girl was matched with Massimo Giuseppe Bosetti who was arrested and accused of the murder of the 13-year-old girl.In the summer of 2016 Bosetti was found guilty and sentenced to life by the Corte d'assise of Bergamo.|$|E
25|$|Cesare Angelotti {{had been}} a wealthy {{landowner}} in Naples and defender of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic. When it fell to the British forces and Ferdinand IV was returned as ruler, he fled to Rome where {{he became one of}} the Consuls of the equally short lived Roman Republic. He is a wanted <b>man,</b> <b>not</b> only for his revolutionary activities but also for a youthful dalliance in London, where he had an eight-day liaison with Emma Hamilton. In those days she {{had been a}} prostitute going by the name of Emma Lyon, but by the time of the play she had become the wife of the British Envoy to Naples, William Hamilton, and was a favourite of Queen Maria Carolina. Determined to avoid a scandal, the Queen demanded that he be returned to Naples and hanged. He was languishing in Rome's Castel Sant'Angelo, when his sister Giulia, the Marquise Attavanti, helped him to escape. According to historian Susan Vandiver Nicassio, Angelotti was partly based on Liborio Angelucci, who had briefly been a Consul of the Roman Republic, although the resemblance in terms of their life histories ends there. Another influence on the choice of surname may have been Nicola Antonio Angeletti (1791–1870), a prominent Italian revolutionary and member of the Carbonari.|$|E

25|$|General Edmund Hogan {{was also}} a veteran of several heated {{political}} campaigns for seats in the council of the Territorial Legislature. Hogan represented Arkansas in the Territorial General Assembly of Missouri in 1816 and 1818, when Arkansas {{was part of the}} Missouri Territory. In the election of 1827, there were three candidates, Colonel Walker, General Hogan and Judge Scott. The election was apparently very heated. After the election was over, tensions appeared to calm and everything appeared quiet. On May 31, 1828 a public hanging occurred in Little Rock, which drew spectators from far and near. When the hanging was over Judge Scott {{made his way to the}} store of McLane & Badgett on the west side of Main street. He was discussing the circumstances of the hanging, when General Hogan entered the store. General Hogan was a man weighing nearly three hundred pounds, and stood over six feet tall. Judge Scott was a small <b>man,</b> <b>not</b> weighing more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The conversation went on, with both Scott and Hogan taking part, neither showing any animosity to the other. The conversation soon diverged from the hanging to politics, and before the men knew it they were discussing the old Walker and Hogan political race. This seemed to revive in the mind of General Hogan something that occurred in the triangular race between himself, Walker and Scott. He turned to Scott and accused him of writing a letter which was derogatory to Hogan. Scott at once informed the general that he had been misinformed. Hogan reiterated the statement and said that he believed that it was true. Scott denied it again, and apparently accused Hogan of lying. Both men were standing up and as soon as Scott made the last remark, Hogan struck him, knocking him to the floor. Scott remained on the floor for a moment, apparently knocked senseless. As Scott revived, he struggled to his feet, and Hogan prepared to strike another blow. As Scott arose he unsheathed a dirk from a sword cane which he carried and plunged the dirk several times into the body of General Hogan. Hogan fell and expired within an hour. Judge Scott was arrested by his brother, United States Marshal George Scott, and taken before an officer for trial. The facts as stated above were there proven, and the court held Hogan to have been the aggressor and released Judge Scott.|$|E
