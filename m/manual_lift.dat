50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by <b>manual</b> <b>lift</b> of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E
40|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>lifting</b> greatly {{increases}} the risk of developing work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD). Muscle loading related to manual tasks may be significantly influenced by workers’ body conditions, being obesity one of them. In the present study, different tasks of <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> were performed by 14 participants with different obesity levels, defined in terms of individuals’ fat mass percentage. Surface electromyography (EMG) data were collected bilaterally from 3 muscles recruited during this type of tasks. EMG data normalization was based on the percentage of maximum contraction during each task (MCT). Furthermore, the participants reported physical loading by using the Rated Perceived Exertion scale (RPE). These techniques sought to analyze the physical loading during <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks. The obtained results indicate that obesity level influenced the MCT percentage, which in turn {{increases the}} muscle loading during <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks.

The proportion of explained variance in the number of lifts ranged from 77 % to 92 %, depending on the variables in the model. Data on scaffold parts and scaffold volume can easily be obtained from the company's administration, since this is its usual paperwork supporting logistics and customer invoicing, respectively.

Nowadays, even though mechanized equipment is widely available, <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> is still considered as an essential way to perform material handling task. Improper lifting strategies may contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), where overexertion contributes as the highest factor. To overcome this problem, electromyography (EMG) signal is used to monitor the workers’ muscle condition and to find maximum lifting load, lifting height and number of repetitions that the workers are able to handle before experiencing fatigue to avoid overexertion. Past researchers have introduced several EMG processing techniques and different EMG features that represent fatigue indices in time, frequency, and time-frequency domain. The impact of EMG processing based measures in fatigue assessment during <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> are reviewed in this paper.

To determine whether musculoskeletal symptoms are prevalent in different and multiple body regions among manual handling workers, and to determine whether a simple index (i. e., perceived risk of lifting injury) evaluated by the worker is significantly associated with musculoskeletal outcomes in single and multiple body regions. Summary of Background Data. Little research has been conducted to investigate the effect of <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks on musculoskeletal symptoms in different and multiple body regions. Methods. A structured interview that followed a set of standardized questionnaires was administered to each worker by the same investigator. The workers were asked to detail their demographic characteristics, physical fitness level, years of experience in <b>manual</b> <b>lifting,</b> current working condition, and musculoskeletal symptom survey. Results. Lower back symptoms were the most frequent among manual handling workers, followed by the shoulders, then the upper back, hips-upper legs, and neck. Finger symptoms had the lowest prevalence values. Musculoskeletal symptoms for multiple body parts (two or more) were more prevalent (64 % of all workers) than those for single body regions (19 %). Approximately 85 % of lower back symptoms were associated with disorders in other body regions. Multivariate analyses indicated that the effects of perceived risk were significant for eight body regions, and that age was significant for three of them. Perceived risk of lifting injury also was significant for multiple body regions. Conclusions. Musculoskeletal symptoms are prevalent in single and multiple body regions among manual handling workers.

The manual materials handling activity of lifting is {{a major source of}} work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Biomechanical evaluation offers useful information about the physical stress imposed on the worker’s body joints; however, biomechanical analysis is usually tedious and complex. For evaluation purpose, the biomechanical method needs to be easy to apply in a field environment. <b>Manual</b> <b>lifting</b> occurs {{as one of the most}} common manual materials handling tasks in the workplace. A biomechanical evaluation method was developed based on the ratio of joint moment to joint capacity. The method was applied to evaluate the physical stress of <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> in truck loading jobs using a nine-link whole body joint model. Thirty eight industrial tasks were evaluated using the developed joint moment ratio. The moment ratio was compared with subjectively rated body discomfort, overall workload, and the NIOSH lifting index.

It can expose workers to physical conditions that can lead to injuries that represent {{a large percentage of the}} over half a million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported in the U.S. each year, and often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs. Ergonomic improvements can be used to modify manual handling tasks to reduce injury. These improvements can include reconfiguring the task and using positioning equipment like lift/tilt/turn tables, hoists, balancers, and manipulators to reduce reaching and bending. The NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) 1991 Revised Lifting Equation can be used to evaluate <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks. Under ideal circumstances, the maximum recommended weight for <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> to avoid back injuries is 51 lb (23.13 kg).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the mechanical stresses on the lower back during <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> and to analyze how people adapt to the stresses. This purpose was accomplished by approaching the mechanical stresses on the lower back from three different perspectives. The effects of <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks were measured as: the fatigued condition, the knowledge of load and the previous lifts, and effort in lifting over a constraining barrier. A biomechanical model (linked segment and rigid body) was applied to estimate the peak compressive forces at the L 5 /S 1 (lower back) joint during the <b>manual</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks. Three-dimensional locations of joint markers were digitized using a Peak Video and Analog Motion Measurement System. A strain-gage force platform was used to determine the location, direction and magnitude of external ground reaction forces acting on the feet. The peak compressive forces at the lower back were insignificantly different when individuals were fatigued. Some individuals increased and others decreased when they were fatigued. Individuals tended to lift faster and bring the load closer to the body when fatigued. Individuals applied different techniques of lifting when they were fatigued. Individuals lifted and adapted differently during the subsequent lifts when lifting known or unknown loads of different masses. Lifting under an unknown condition generated greater stresses on the lower back, especially when the load was light. When lifting a light load, individuals adapted to the lifts by bringing the load closer to the body, which reduced the stresses on the lower back. However, when the load was heavy, individuals adapted the lifts by changing the lifting technique, which did not reduce the stresses on the lower back. Lifting over a constraint barrier developed greater forces on the lower back. Individuals required more flexing of the lower back and less bending of the knees when lifting over the barrier. Individuals adapt to their internal or external lifting environment. These adaptations can increase or decrease the peak compressive forces...|$|R
