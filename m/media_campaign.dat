40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that self-persuasion can be activated by <b>media</b> <b>campaigns,</b> which were more effective than those using direct argumentation. Extending these findings, in the present paper we investigated conditions under which self-persuasion can be successfully applied in <b>media</b> <b>campaigns.</b> We examined {{whether there was a}} difference in effectiveness of pro- and counter-attitudinal self-persuasive messages in <b>media</b> <b>campaigns.</b> In two studies we tried to facilitate volunteering and donating by means of pro-attitudinal self-persuasive campaigns. Findings revealed that when people are not motivated to process the self-persuasive messages in <b>media</b> <b>campaigns,</b> campaigns, providing people with arguments led to a higher amount of hours people intended to volunteer. However, when processing was facilitated by means of a counter-attitudinal message, self-persuasion led to an increased amount of donation to a good cause. We suggest that active processing is vital for self-persuasive <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> and should be stimulated by a message itself...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the unprecedented growth of social media, companies are continuously creating unique social <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> encouraging customers to share their advertising messages. However, many of these social campaigns end up backfiring. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine consumers' preferences toward 4 social <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> and to investigate the impact of positive and negative word-of-mouth and social value on consumer-campaign identification. Using a sample of 525 respondents in Australia, the results show social <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> that contain negative messages are more likely to receive negative word-of-mouth while partnering with non-profit organizations may help generate positive word-of-mouth. This study will assist marketing managers to better understand the consumers' perceptions on recent social <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> in Australia.

5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George {{to announce}} his candidacy for governor of Kentucky.

Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive <b>media</b> <b>campaign</b> promoting his candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race.

5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social <b>media</b> <b>campaign</b> to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu {{for the better part}} of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
40|$|AIM [...] To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between national and local <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{with respect to the}} number of patients requesting HIV antibody tests as a surrogate marker of the effectiveness of different campaign strategies. METHODS [...] Analysis by month of the numbers of HIV tests performed in the regional genitourinary (GUM) clinic for Lothian over a 5 year period and in the whole of Lothian Region, Scotland over a 3 year period. Changes in testing rates were monitored with respect to <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> over the same time period. RESULTS [...] Television based <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> produced the greatest increase in testing rates (average 46 % increase over 2 months) compared with newspapers and poster campaigns (average 6 % increase over 2 months). Regional HIV testing rates correlated significantly with GUM clinic testing rates. No increase in positive HIV tests was seen following <b>media</b> <b>campaigns.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Using HIV testing rates as a surrogate marker, television based <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> appear to be the most effective way of increasing awareness of HIV. The effect of <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> is short-lived indicating a need for constant reminder of the dangers of HIV infection. The increase in HIV testing occurs largely in the "worried well" with few additional HIV positive patients being identified...|$|R

5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a business. A strong <b>media</b> <b>campaign</b> funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments. Following through on his campaign promise to make more diverse appointments, he named a woman and an African-American to his cabinet. During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was Kenny Rogers Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star Kenny Rogers.|$|E

40|$|Background: International {{evidence}} shows that mass <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> are effective tobacco control interventions. However, they require substantial investment; a key question is whether their costs are justified by their benefits. The {{aim of this study}} was to systematically and comprehensively review economic evaluations of tobacco control mass <b>media</b> <b>campaigns.</b> Methods: An electronic search of databases and grey literature was conducted to identify all published economic evaluations of tobacco control mass <b>media</b> <b>campaigns.</b> The authors reviewed studies independently and assessed the quality of studies using the Drummond 10 -point checklist. A narrative synthesis was used to summarise the key features and quality of the identified studies. Results: 10 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. All the studies included a cost effectiveness analysis, a cost utility analysis or both. The methods were highly heterogeneous, particularly in terms of the types of costs included. On the whole, studies were well conducted, but the interventions were often poorly described in terms of campaign content and intensity, and cost information was frequently inadequate. All studies concluded that tobacco control mass <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> are a cost effective public health intervention. Conclusions: The evidence on the cost effectiveness of tobacco control mass <b>media</b> <b>campaigns</b> is limited, but of acceptable quality and consistently suggests that they offer good value for money...|$|R
