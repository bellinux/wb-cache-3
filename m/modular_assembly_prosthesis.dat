5000|$|The most {{straightforward}} method to generate new zinc finger arrays is to combine smaller zinc finger [...] "modules" [...] of known specificity. The {{structure of the}} zinc finger protein Zif268 bound to DNA described by Pavletich and Pabo in their 1991 publication has been key to much of this work and describes the concept of obtaining fingers {{for each of the}} 64 possible base pair triplets and then mixing and matching these fingers to design proteins with any desired sequence specificity. [...] The most common <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> process involves combining separate zinc fingers that can each recognize a 3 basepair DNA sequence to generate 3-finger, 4-, 5-, or 6-finger arrays that recognize target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length. Another method uses 2-finger modules to generate zinc finger arrays with up to six individual zinc fingers. [...] The Barbas Laboratory of The Scripps Research Institute used phage display to develop and characterize zinc finger domains that recognize most DNA triplet sequenceswhile another group isolated and characterized individual fingers from the human genome.A potential drawback with <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> in general is that specificities of individual zinc finger can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and DNA. A recent study demonstrated that a high proportion of 3-finger zinc finger arrays generated by <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> fail to bind their intended target with sufficient affinity in a bacterial two-hybrid assay and fail to function as zinc finger nucleases, but the success rate was somewhat higher when sites of the form GNNGNNGNN were targeted.

40|$|C 2 H 2 zinc fingers (C 2 H 2 -ZFs) are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} type of vertebrate DNA-binding domain, and typically appear in tandem arrays (ZFAs), with sequential C 2 H 2 -ZFs each contacting three (or more) sequential bases. C 2 H 2 -ZFs can be assembled in a modular fashion, providing one explanation for their remarkable evolutionary success. Given a set of modules with defined three-base specificities, <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> also presents a way to construct artificial proteins with specific DNA-binding preferences. However, {{a recent survey of}} a large number of three-finger ZFAs engineered by <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> reported high failure rates (∼ 70 %), casting doubt on the generality of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly.</b> Here, we used protein-binding microarrays to analyze 28 ZFAs that failed in the aforementioned study. Most (17) preferred specific sequences, which in all but one case resembled the intended target sequence. Like natural ZFAs, the engineered ZFAs typically yielded degenerate motifs, binding dozens to hundreds of related individual sequences. Thus, the failure of these proteins in previous assays is not due to lack of sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Our findings underscore the relevance of individual C 2 H 2 -ZF sequence specificities within tandem arrays, and support the general ability of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> to produce ZFAs with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity...|$|R
40|$|In a {{turbulent}} market environment an assembly {{system with a}} high level of flexibility and changeability is necessary. Especially in the automotive industry the developments towards product differentiation and shorter product lifecycles require highly flexible and changeable assembly systems. One basic enabler to reach this goal is modularization. In a <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system having uncoupled workstations and a flexible transportation of products, however, the methods of production planning need to be adapted as well. In this paper, the well-established methodology of assembly line balancing for the planning of workstations in an assembly line production is analyzed. However, it is shown that this methodology as well as other methods to plan workstations in an assembly system are not applicable for a <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system due to its different characteristics. For this reason, a new planning method to assign assembly tasks to workstations is developed, based on the different targets and restrictions of a <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system. In this method, the assignment of assembly tasks to workstations is primarily based on their position in the assembly priority chart of the products being assembled. The application of the described method is shown in an example of a product-based <b>modular</b> automotive <b>assembly</b> system developed by the authors. In this context, the method is one main aspect of planning and operating a <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system, which is supposed to handle the further increasing diversity and dynamics of the automotive industry by its high level of flexibility and changeability...|$|R

40|$|Next {{generation}} {{manufacturing companies}} have to become highly responsive in order to succeed in an ever more rapidly changing global market. The ability to effectively develop and adapt their assembly facilities (systems) to changing requirements on demand {{plays a crucial role}} in achieving high responsiveness since the assembly process has to deal with the full inherent complexity of increasingly mass-customised products. This work was motivated by the current lack of a holistic assembly system design theory that would enable design environments to address the need for rapid system development and adaptation. The challenge is to create a common environment where domain experts can effectively collaborate while taking advantage of the best practices of their diverse domains. This thesis investigates how a domain ontology can help to overcome those challenges. The approach is taking advantage of the higher levels of standardisation inherent in the <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system paradigm which is considered {{to be one of the}} fundamental enabling factors to achieve a high level of adaptation. A new ontology framework has been developed to support the design and adaptation of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> systems (ONTOMAS). The ONTOMAS framework is based on engineering ontology principles structuring the domain using formalisms for aggregation, topology, taxonomies, and system theory principles. A number of design patterns have been identified and formalised to support key design decision-making tasks during the design of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> systems. Furthermore, the function-behaviour-structure paradigm has been applied to capture the characteristics of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> equipment at different levels of abstraction that reflect the specific needs of the engineering design process. The proposed ONTOMAS framework provides a sound foundation for computer based support tools to reduce the assembly system design effort and time while maintaining a high level of quality. An integrated design framework for the requirements driven specification of assembly processes and configuration of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system has been developed. The design approach applies the new formalisms of ONTOMAS to support the design decision-making activities. The developed ONTOMAS framework has been applied in several industrial and synthetic use cases to verify its applicability and appropriateness. Furthermore, the new ontology and design framework have been used as foundation for the development of a prototype collaborative design environment which allows different domain experts to participate in the design of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> systems.

In the <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> approach, amanufacturer acquires {{pre-assembled}} modules from its suppliers, rather than the individual components, as in the traditional assembly approach. We analyze the competitive behavior of a two-stage <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> system consisting of a manufacturer, and a supplier who pre-assembles two components into a module. The firms can choose their own inventory policies and we show the existence of Nash equilibrium in the inventory game. Moving from the traditional to the modular approach has a twofold effect on the supply chain. First, we investigate the effect of centralizing the compo-nent suppliers. It can be shown that {{when there is no}} production time shift, the module supplier always holds more com-ponent inventories than suppliers do in the traditional approach, which yields a lower cost for the manufacturer. However, the suppliers, and therefore the supply chain may incur a higher cost in the modular approach. Second, we study the effect of a shift in production time from the manufacturing stage to the supplier stage. From numerical studies, it has been found that such a lead time shift always benefits a centralized supply chain, but not necessarily so for a decen-tralized system. Combining the two effects, we find that the modular approach generally reduces the cost to the manufac-turer and the supply chain, which explains the prevalence of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> from the perspective of inventory management. These results also provide some insight into how firms can improve supply chain efficiency by choosing the right decision structure and lead time configuration.

Increased global competitiveness is only one important issue mentioned in Visionary Manufacturing Challenges for 2020 (NRC 1988), Swedish technology foresight panel 4 (IVA 2000) and Made in Holland (Deloitte 2003). These roadmaps are addressing the importance of flexibility, reusability, competitiveness, competence and customer value of the future manufacturing systems. If nothing is done within a few years to improve the situation, it is predicted that 20 % of the production facilities will be lost to low cost countries with labour flexibility as the main tool for production planning and control. Some of the other issues in these roadmaps for the future are: Functional sales, flexibility, reconfigure ability, individualised products, and short lead times. These statements make <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> systems to one of the future key enablers for successful and profitable production. However, {{there is a need for}} technology enabling minimisation of <b>modular</b> <b>assembly</b> systems resetting lead-time. In order to reconfigure the assembly system with a minimum of lost production caused by time consumption in the reconfiguration process, rework, and ramp-up of new products or product variants, there is a need for offline reconfiguration, without disturbing the ongoing product assembly. This can be done by using an approach where the modules in the assembly system are available in digital form, where discrete event simulation software can be used to analyse the reconfiguration process as well as the assembly process effectiveness. Johansson and Kaiser (2002) discusses the use of Discrete Event Simulation software in the reconfiguration process of assembly systems, however this approach did not consider the modular aspects of the assembly system, which is even more powerful.
