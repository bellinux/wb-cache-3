5|$|The {{system of}} pre-defining the {{indicator}} {{setting for the}} day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who {{did not make the}} change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered <b>message</b> <b>key</b> twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E
500|$|The {{settings}} {{provided by}} French Intelligence covered two months that straddled a changeover {{period for the}} rotor ordering. A different rotor {{happened to be in}} the right-hand position for the second month, and so the wirings of two rotors could be recovered by the same method. [...] Rejewski later recalled: [...] "Finding the [...] in the third , and especially... in the , now presented no great difficulties. Likewise there were no difficulties with determining the correct torsion of the [...] side walls with respect to each other, or the moments when the left and middle drums turned." [...] By year's end 1932, the wirings of all three rotors and the reflector had been recovered. A sample message in an Enigma instruction manual, providing a plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext produced using a stated daily key and <b>message</b> <b>key,</b> helped clarify some remaining details.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scrambler}} rotor {{positions at}} the start of enciphering the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> (the Grundstellung or [...] "indicator-setting") — up to May 1940; or thereafter the initial positions of each rotor {{at the start of}} enciphering the message (the [...] "message key") from which the indicator-setting could be derived. There are 17,576 possible three-letter keys.|$|E
50|$|Rejewski made an {{incredible}} discovery. Without knowing the plugboard settings, the rotor positions, the ring settings, or the ground setting, he could solve {{for all the}} daily <b>message</b> <b>keys.</b> All he needed were enough messages and some code clerks using non-random <b>message</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With {{sufficient}} traffic, the Poles {{would find}} <b>message</b> <b>keys</b> {{that started with}} the same two characters. Say the Poles received <b>messages</b> with <b>keys</b> [...] "AAA" [...] and [...] "AAT".|$|R
50|$|Faster <b>message</b> <b>keying</b> may {{encounter}} the Diffused Component as significant system noise.|$|R
2500|$|For each {{transmitted}} message, {{the sending}} operator would follow a standard procedure. From September 1938, {{he would use}} an initial position to encrypt the indicator and send it in clear, followed by the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> that had been enciphered at that setting. If the ground setting (...) was GKX for example, he would then use Enigma with the rotors set to GKX to encrypt the message setting, which he might choose to be RTQ; which might encrypt to LLP. (Before May 1940, the encrypted message setting was repeated, but that makes no difference to Herivel's insight.) The operator would then turn his rotors to RTQ and encrypt the actual message. Thus, the preamble to the message would be the unencrypted ground setting (GKX), followed by the encrypted message setting (LLP). A receiving Enigma operator could use the information to recover the message setting and then decrypt the message.|$|E
5000|$|Communications were {{sometimes}} garbled, {{and if the}} <b>message</b> <b>key</b> were garbled, then the recipient {{would not be able}} to decrypt the message. Consequently, the Germans took the precaution of sending the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> twice; if there was a garble, the recipient should be able to find the <b>message</b> <b>key.</b> Here, the Germans committed error. Instead of sending the encrypted <b>message</b> <b>key</b> (e.g., [...] "PKP") twice to get [...] "PKP PKP", the Germans doubled the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> (e.g., [...] "ABL ABL"), encrypted the doubled key to get ("PKP JXI"), and sent the encrypted doubled key. That mistake allowed Rejewski to identify six sequential permutations of the Enigma and exploit that they encrypted the same <b>message</b> <b>key.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During December 1932, Marian Rejewski was tasked by the Cipher Bureau {{to work on}} the German Enigma. The Bureau had {{attempted}} to break a few years earlier, but had failed. Within a few weeks, Rejewski had discovered how to break the German Enigma cipher machine. The German Enigma message procedures at the time used common but secret daily machine settings, but the procedures also had each code clerk choose a three-letter <b>message</b> <b>key.</b> For example, a clerk might choose [...] "ABL" [...] as the <b>message</b> <b>key.</b> The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> was used to set the initial position of the rotors when encrypting (or decrypting) the body of the message. Choosing a different <b>message</b> <b>key</b> was a security measure: it avoided having all the day's messages sent using the same polyalphabetic key which would have made the messages vulnerable to a polyalphabetic attack. However, the sender needed to communicate the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> to the recipient in order for the recipient to decrypt the message. The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> was first encrypted using the day's Grundstellung (a secret initial position of the Enigma's rotors, e.g., [...] "FOL").|$|E
50|$|To make unique {{session and}} <b>message</b> <b>keys</b> the shared secret is usually {{combined}} with an initialization vector (IV). An {{example of this is}} the derived unique key per transaction method.|$|R

50|$|But then, on September 15, 1938, the Germans changed {{entirely the}} {{procedure}} for enciphering <b>message</b> <b>keys,</b> {{and as a result}} the card-catalog method became completely useless.This spurred the invention of Rejewski's cryptologic bomb and Zygalski's perforated sheets.|$|R
5000|$|The Enigma {{was used}} with radio communications, so letters were {{occasionally}} corrupted during transmission or reception. If the recipient {{did not have}} the correct <b>message</b> <b>key,</b> then the recipient could not decipher the message. The Germans decided to send the three-letter <b>message</b> <b>key</b> twice to guard against transmission errors. Instead of encrypting the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> [...] "YEK" [...] once and sending the encrypted key twice, the Germans doubled the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> to [...] "YEKYEK" [...] ("doubled key"), encrypted the doubled key with the ground setting, and sent the encrypted doubled key. The recipient could then recognize a garbled <b>message</b> <b>key</b> and still decrypt the message. For example, if the recipient received and decrypted the doubled key as [...] "YEKYEN", then the recipient could try both message keys [...] "YEK" [...] and [...] "YEN"; one would produce the desired message and the other would produce gibberish.|$|E
50|$|The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> {{contains}} the start {{position of the}} text in the grid, designated by the column and header dipgraphs. The digraphs for the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> are encoded with the letter conversion table and then included in the message header.|$|E
50|$|The {{weakness}} in this indicator procedure came from two factors. First, {{use of a}} global Grundstellung —this was changed in September 1938 so that the operator selected his initial position to encrypt the <b>message</b> <b>key,</b> and sent the initial position in clear followed by the enciphered <b>message</b> <b>key.</b> The second problem was the repetition of <b>message</b> <b>key</b> within the indicator, which was a serious security flaw. The message setting was encoded twice, resulting in a relation between first and fourth, second and fifth, and third and sixth character. This security problem enabled the Polish Cipher Bureau {{to break into the}} pre-war Enigma system as early as 1932. On 1 May 1940 the Germans changed the procedures to encipher the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> only once.|$|E
50|$|The {{end result}} was that without knowing the Enigma's {{plugboard}} settings, the rotor positions, or the ring settings, Rejewski determined each of the permutations A B C D E F, and hence all of the day's <b>message</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R
50|$|In May 1940, the Germans {{once again}} {{completely}} changed {{the procedure for}} enciphering <b>message</b> <b>keys</b> (with {{the exception of a}} Norwegian network). As a result, Zygalski's sheets were of no use, though fortunately the Herivel tip could be used.|$|R
50|$|At this point, the Poles would exploit {{weaknesses}} in the code clerks' selection of <b>message</b> <b>keys</b> to determine which candidates were the correct ones. If the Poles could correctly guess the key for a particular message, then that guess would anchor two cycles {{in each of the}} three characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> {{is three}} {{characters}} long, so the doubled key is six characters long. Rejewski labeled the permutations for the successive message-key characters A B C D E F. He {{did not know}} what those permutations were, but he did know that A and D permutations encrypted the same <b>message</b> <b>key</b> letter, that B and E encrypted the same letter, and that C and F encrypted the same letter. If [...] are the (unknown) plaintext letters of the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> and [...] are the corresponding (known) ciphertext letters, then ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the Germans {{distributed}} a secret monthly {{list of all}} the daily machine settings. The Germans knew that it would be foolish to encrypt the day's traffic using the same key, so each message had its own [...] "message key". This <b>message</b> <b>key</b> was the sender-chosen initial rotor positions (e.g., YEK). The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> had to be conveyed to the recipient operator, so the Germans decided to encrypt it using the day's pre-specified daily ground setting (Grundstellung). The recipient would use the daily machine settings for all messages. He would set the Enigma's initial rotor position to the ground setting and decrypt the <b>message</b> <b>key.</b> The recipient would then set the initial rotor position to the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> and decrypt the body of the message.|$|E
50|$|Up until 15 September 1938, the {{transmitting}} operator {{indicated to}} the receiving operator(s) {{how to set}} their rotors, by choosing a three letter <b>message</b> <b>key</b> (the key specific to that message) and enciphering it twice using the specified initial ring positions (the Grundstellung). The resultant 6-letter indicator, was then transmitted before the enciphered text of the message. Suppose that the specified Grundstellung was RAO, and the chosen 3-letter <b>message</b> <b>key</b> was IHL, the operator would set the rotors to RAO and encipher IHL twice. The resultant ciphertext, DQYQQT, would be transmitted, followed by the message enciphered using <b>message</b> <b>key</b> IHL. The receiving operator would use the specified Grundstellung RAO to decipher the first six letters, yielding IHLIHL. The receiving operator, seeing the repeated <b>message</b> <b>key</b> would know {{that there had been}} no corruption and use IHL to decipher the message.|$|E
5000|$|The grill method found {{application}} {{as late as}} December 1938 {{in working}} out the wiring in two Enigma rotors newly introduced by the Germans. (This {{was made possible by}} the fact that a Sicherheitsdienst net, while it had introduced the new drums IV and V, continued using the old system for enciphering the individual <b>message</b> <b>keys.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{utility of}} the card catalog, writes Rejewski, was {{independent}} {{of the number of}} plug connections being used by the Germans on their Enigma machines (and of the reconstruction of <b>message</b> <b>keys).</b> Preparation of the catalog [...] "was laborious and took over a year, but when it was ready... daily keys be obtained within about fifteen minutes." ...|$|R

50|$|For each message, the {{operator}} would choose a three-letter <b>message</b> <b>key</b> to encrypt {{the body of}} the message. The intention was for this key to be random, and using a random key for each message was a good security practice. The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> needed to be communicated to the recipient so the recipient could decrypt the message.|$|E
50|$|The <b>message</b> <b>key</b> table {{contained}} the initial rotor settings {{to be used}} with each message. A <b>message</b> <b>key</b> was never to be used more than once. The keying material was distributed in a foil-covered package, with the daily key tables and punched cards fan-folded in a pouch with perforations between each item. The other tables were in a side pouch.|$|E
30|$|<b>Key</b> <b>messages</b> {{were defined}} as content that was most {{important}} to the trainer. When comparing the RKR for overall learning content and <b>key</b> <b>messages,</b> the RKR for <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> was significantly higher at all time points in the postgraduate group. In the student group, the slope according to the forgetting curve of Ebbinghaus was seen again. The difference {{could be explained by}} the lack of clinical experience in the student group making it more difficult to recognize <b>key</b> <b>messages.</b> The students would then more likely be prone to direct their attention at to more detailed information not crucial to the general concept. Therefore, a PS can be improved by highlighting and repeating <b>key</b> <b>messages</b> {{at the end of every}} presentation.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, codebooks {{were only}} used {{each day to}} set up the rotors, their ring {{settings}} and the plugboard. For each message, the operator selected a random start position, let's say WZA, and a random <b>message</b> <b>key,</b> perhaps SXT. He moved the rotors to the WZA start position and encoded the <b>message</b> <b>key</b> SXT. Assume the result was UHL. He then set up the <b>message</b> <b>key,</b> SXT, as the start position and encrypted the message. Next, he transmitted the start position, WZA, the encoded <b>message</b> <b>key,</b> UHL, and then the ciphertext. The receiver set up the start position according to the first trigram, WZA, and decoded the second trigram, UHL, to obtain the SXT message setting. Next, he used this SXT message setting as the start position to decrypt the message. This way, each ground setting was different and the new procedure avoided the security flaw of double encoded message settings.|$|E
