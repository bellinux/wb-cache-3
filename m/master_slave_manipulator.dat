40|$|In ITER, {{maintenance}} {{operations in the}} vessel and in the Hot Cell will be largely done by Remote Handling (RH). Remotely performed maintenance actions {{tend to be more}} time-costly than actions performed by direct human access. With a human operator in the control loop and adequate situational feedback, a two-armed <b>master</b> <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> system can mimic direct access with dexterous manipulation, tactile feedback and vision. But even then, turnaround times are still very high. Adapting the design for simplified {{maintenance operations}} can yield significant time savings. One of the methods known to produce a simpler, more robust design, which is also better suited for handling with robots, is Design For Assembly (DFA). This paper discusses whether and how the principles of DFA can be applied to simplify maintenance operations for ITER. While DFA is normally used with series-production and ITER is a unique product, it is possible to apply the principles of DFA to ITER maintenance operations. Furthermore, DFA's principles can be applied at different abstraction levels. Combining principles of DFA with Virtual Reality leads to new insights and provides additional value...|$|E
40|$|A new {{facility}} {{has been taken}} in operation to investigate the influence of visual and haptic feedback {{on the performance of}} remotely executed ITER RH maintenance tasks. A reference set of representative ITER remote handling maintenance tasks was included the <b>master</b> <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> system (MS 2) benchmark product. The benchmark product was used in task performance tests in a representative two-handed dexterous manipulation test bed at NRG. In the setup, the quality of visual feedback was varied by exchanging direct view with indirect view setups in which visual feedback is provided via video cameras. Interaction forces were measured via an integrated force sensor. The impact of feedback quality on the performance of maintenance tasks at the level of handling individual parts was measured and analysed. Remote execution of the maintenance actions took roughly 3 - 5 times more time than hands-on. Visual feedback was identified as the dominant factor, including aspects like (lack of) operator control over camera placement, pan, tilt and zoom, lack of 3 D perception, image quality, and latency. Haptic feedback was found to be important, but only in specific contact transition and constrained motion tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Bilateral force {{feedback}} teleoperation provides the operator with an enhanced realtime {{understanding of the}} remote slave environment. It is common for an uncompensated delay within a closed loop path to lead to system instability. The control problem becomes significantly more complex when the delay conditions are not foreseeable. A good example of such conditions is when the feedback control loop includes the internet, as in remotely controlled teleoperators. Closed loop bilateral teleoperation via a communications path which has no clearly defined or predictable delay time presents difficulty in maintaining both robust stability and adequate system performance for all delay conditions. In light of this researchers have developed a new transmission line based control law through {{the introduction of the}} ‘Wave Variable’ to enable stable teleoperator systems in the presence of network delays. However wave variables, by their inherent scattering design introduce reflections at the wave junctions. These reflections can prove very disorientating for the operator of a wave based teleoperator. In this research the existing wave variable teleoperator architecture is augmented to establish stable robust bilateral teleoperator operation which minimizes the return wave based reflections, thus facilitating good teleoperator performance characteristics to allow operation in nonlinear environments. The work presented in this thesis results in a new teleoperator architecture which: 1) improves wave based teleoperator transient response for the tasks of position tracking and contact stability without the need for prior knowledge of the remote environment wave reflections; 2) enhances {{force feedback}} fidelity, with particular focus on the ability to use the teleoperator in complex nonlinear environments such as stick-slip friction; 3) guarantees stable operation of the teleoperation without prior knowledge of the communications delay.

From a control point of view, the haptic control loop, where motion and force data are exchanged between the <b>master</b> and the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator,</b> is very challenging {{as it is}} closed over a communication network, e. g. the Internet. The communication network introduces unreliabilities such as (time-varying) time delay and packet loss, which are not only distorting the human haptic perception of the remote environment but can destabilize the overall system. In recent years control approaches based on the passivity framework and the scattering transformation have been developed in order to stabilize the teleoperation system {{in the presence of}} such communication unreliabilities, see e. g.

The major reason for the success of the passivity formalism in teleoperation is that it can cope with the largely unknown, nonlinear and time-varying human arm and environment dynamics, which, however, can assumed to be passive. The scattering transformation transforms passive systems into finite gain L 2 -stable systems with a L 2 gain γ ≤ 1 and guarantees the finite gain L 2 -stability of the overall teleoperation system for all communication network operators that are small gain, e. g. constant time delay but also appropriately handled packet loss [2].

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A solution is proposed for the kinematic conditioning problem in teleoperation. The proposed solution helps the operator in understanding the kinematic conditioning of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> with the help of haptic interface. Teleoperation involves manipulation at a remote location by an operator through a master device located at the control station. Visual feedback of the remote location helps the operator in understanding the behavior of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> and its environment. The precise perception of the environment and <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> configuration is impossible with the current visual feedback methods where the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> has to work in complex environment. In such a situation, to assist the operator, the kinematic configuration of the master device is kept {{similar to that of the}} salve manipulator. Use of this solution may result in an awkward-to-operate master device which decreases the efficiency of the operator. To make the operator aware of the kinematic conditioning of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator,</b> the proposed solution utilizes the capabilities of the haptic interface, which is widely used in teleoperation. Haptic interfaces have been used to transfer the real interaction between the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> and its environment to the master side. The algorithm developed uses them to generate the virtual force feedback depending on the kinematic conditioning and other physical limits of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator.</b> It helps in enhancing the operator skills, increasing the operation efficiency and precision. Singularity condition, joint angle limit, joint velocity limit and non-holonomic constraint of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> are considered as factors affecting the kinematic conditioning. Different force feedback strategies are developed to handle the problematic situations, based on which virtual force feedback is generated that assists in deciding further course of action and guides the operator out of the problematic situation. To assess the effectiveness of the virtual force feedback for kinematic conditioning a test bed is developed.

40|$|Position error between {{motions of}} the <b>master</b> and <b>slave</b> {{end-effectors}} is inevitable as it originates from hard-to-avoid imperfections in controller design and model uncertainty. Moreover, when a <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> is controlled through a delayed and lossy communication channel, the error between the desired motion originating from the master device and the actual movement of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> end-effector is further exacerbated. This paper introduces a force feedback scheme to alleviate this problem by simply guiding the operator {{to slow down the}} haptic device motion and, in turn, allows the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> to follow the desired trajectory closely. Using this scheme, the master haptic device generates a force, which is proportional to the position error at the slave end-effector, and opposite to the operator’s intended motion at the master site. Indeed, this force is a signal or cue to the operator for reducing the hand speed when position error, due to delayed and lossy network, appears at the slave site. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by performing experiments on a hydraulic telemanipulator setup developed for performing live-line maintenance. Experiments are conducted when the system operates under both dedicated and wireless networks. Results show that the scheme performs well in reducing the position error between the haptic device and the slave end-effector. Specifically, by utilizing the proposed force, the mean position error, for the case presented here, reduces by at least 92 % as compared to the condition without the proposed force augmentation scheme. The scheme is easy to implement, as the only required on-line measurement is the angular displacement of the <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> joints...|$|R

A virtual spring connects a <b>master</b> and <b>slave</b> system where local force {{feedback on the}} slave system compensates for {{the dynamics of the}} mobile manipulator. This scheme is robust in the presence of time delays and disturbances and provides good tele-presence. The <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator</b> is mounted on a mobile base and controlled within the operational space framework. In this framework, the redundancy of the mobile manipulation system is addressed through a decoupled decomposition of task and posture dynamics. ...|$|R
40|$|Tele-operation {{has been}} a hot topic {{for a long time}} in {{computer}} science and electrical engineering fields since it {{has been a}}pplied in many different domains such as dangerous operating environments, deep-sea operations, and multiple operations through network. At the same time, bilateral control technology has resulted in significant interests by people, since information such as force reflection will improve the perception of the operator to interact with environment with great capabilities. As a result, stability of bilateral systems is of particular importance as unstable force reflection could hurt the human operator. However, in tele-operation systems, time delay always exists and it varies with the network performance, and this time delay, even very small, will destabilize an originally stable system. That is why that stability problem is so important and critical in the tele-operation bilateral systems. This is the main motivation for this thesis research. In this thesis, wave transfer method is investigated and introduced into the stability and control of bilateral tele-operation systems. However, using a wave variable tele-operation system with a PD controller to maintain the position tracking of the slave side has resulted in undesired position drifts. Sliding mode control is an effective robust control method and is particularly useful for solving tracking problems. The control objective is to force the system dynamics approach to the sliding surface and remain on it for all the future time to eliminate or minimize the tracking errors. Consequently, the designed sliding-mode controller as validated and verified in the simulation results decreases the tracking error and guarantees the <b>slave</b> track the <b>master</b> position quite satisfactorily for bilateral tele-operation system with varying time delay. The contribution of this thesis is the investigation of the model of the phantom haptic device and analysis of the tele-operation system using the phantom device as <b>master</b> and <b>slave</b> <b>manipulator.</b> The designed wave variable sliding mode controller guarantees the stability of the tele-operation system having time varying communication delay...|$|R
