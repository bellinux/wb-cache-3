50|$|In fungi, tugor {{pressure}} {{has been observed}} as a large factor in substrate penetration. In species such as Saprolegnia ferax, <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea</b> and Aspergillus oryzae, immense turgor pressures have been observed in their hyphae. The study showed that they could penetrate substances like plant cells, and synthetic materials such as polyvinyl chloride. In observations of this phenomenon, {{it is noted that}} invasive hyphal growth is due to turgor pressure, along with the coenzymes secreted by the fungi to invade said substrates. Hyphal growth is directed related to turgor pressure, and growth slows as turgor pressure decreases. In <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea,</b> pressures of up to 8 MPa have been observed.|$|E

50|$|The fungus {{is known}} to have {{antifungal}} properties. Ethyl acetate extracts from the fungus show activity against fungal pathogens of plants including <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea</b> and Fusarium oxysporum.

[...] These phytopathogens are known to infect economically important plants such as durian, black peppers, tangerine, strawberry, tomato, corn and pomelo.|$|E
5000|$|The native human enzyme is bifunctional, {{much like}} the LKR/SHD found in plants, and thus, {{is thought to be}} similar in structure. [...] The bifunctionality of this enzyme {{comes from the fact that}} it {{contains}} two distinct active sites, one at its C-terminal, and one at its N-terminal. [...] The C-terminal portion of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase contains the SHD activity and the N-terminal portion contains LKR. [...] To date, a structure of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase has not been determined. [...] The enzyme does not have linker region present in plants between its C and N-termini, so theories suggest the actual structure contains an LKR-activity region bound to an SHD-activity region, like that in <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea,</b> {{also known}} as rice blast fungus, rice rotten neck, rice {{seedling}} blight, blast of rice, oval leaf spot of graminea, pitting disease, ryegrass blast, and Johnson spot, is a plant-pathogenic fungus that causes a serious disease affecting rice. It is now known that M. grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not interbreed. Complex members isolated from Digitaria have been more narrowly defined as M. grisea. The remaining members of the complex isolated from rice {{and a variety of}} other hosts have been renamed Magnaporthe oryzae. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors.|$|E

50|$|The fungal genus, Trichoderma {{produces}} enzymes such as chitinases which {{degrade the}} cell walls of other fungi. They {{are able to}} detect other fungi and grow towards them, they then bind to the hyphae of other fungi using lectins on the host fungi as a receptor, forming an appressorium. Once this is formed, Trichoderma inject toxic enzymes into the host and probably peptaibol antibiotics, which create holes in the cell wall, allowing Trichoderma to grow inside of the host and feed. Trichoderma are able to digest sclerotia, durable structures which contain food reserves, which is important {{if they are to}} control pathogenic fungi in the long term. Trichoderma species have been recorded as protecting crops from Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria solani, Glomerella graminicola, Phytophthora capsici, <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea</b> and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum; although this protection may not be entirely due to Trichoderma digesting these fungi, but by them improving plant disease resistance indirectly.|$|E
5000|$|Microfungi {{can also}} be harmful, causing {{diseases}} of plants, animals and humans {{with varying degrees of}} severity and economic impact. The irritating human skin disease known as athlete's foot or tinea pedis is caused by species of the microfungal genus Trichophyton. Microfungi may cause diseases of crops and trees which range in severity from mild to disastrous, and in economic importance from beneficial to seriously costly. The mould Botrytis cinerea can cause spoilage of crops including grapes, but is also responsible for the [...] "noble rot", which concentrates sugars in the grapes used to make the intensely sweet and concentrated Sauternes dessert wines from the Bordeaux region of France. The potato famine in Ireland during the mid-to-late 19th century was caused by a fungus called Phytophthora infestans that rotted the potato crops for several years. Dutch elm disease, which has ravaged elms across Europe and North America in the last 50 years, is caused by the microfungi of the genus Ophiostoma. Rice blast, a devastating fungal disease of cereals including rice, wheat and millet, is caused by the phytopathogenic Ascomycete fungus <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea.</b> In the built environment, the toxic fungus Stachybotrys chartarum causes damage to damp walls and furnishings, and may be responsible for sick building syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Finger millet is {{generally}} seen as not very prone to diseases and pests. Nonetheless, finger millet blast, {{caused by the}} fungal pathogen <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea</b> (anamorph Pyricularia grisea), can locally cause severe damages, especially when untreated. In Uganda, yield losses up to 80% were reported in bad years. The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves, neck rots and ear rots. These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis, translocation of photosynthetic assimilates and grain filling and therefore reduce yield and grain quality. Finger millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related Eleusine indica, Eleusine africana or Digitaria spp., Setaria spp. and Doctylocterium spp. Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures, chemical treatments {{and the use of}} resistant varieties. Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with non-host crops like legumes, deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields, washing of field tools after use to prevent dissemination of the pathogen to non-infected fields, weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts and avoiding of too high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant. Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides, such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or tricyclazone or seed dressings with fungicides like trycyclozole.|$|E

40|$|Rice blast {{is caused}} by the fungus <b>Magnaporthe</b> <b>grisea,</b> which elaborates {{specialized}} infection cells called appressoria to penetrate the tough outer cuticle of the rice plant Oryza sativa. We found that the formation of an appressorium required, sequentially, the completion of mitosis, nuclear migration, and death of the conidium (fungal spore) from which the infection originated. Genetic intervention during mitosis prevented both appressorium development and conidium death. Impairment of autophagy, by the targeted mutation of the MgATG 8 gene, arrested conidial cell death but rendered the fungus nonpathogenic. Thus, the initiation of rice blast requires autophagic cell death of the conidium.
