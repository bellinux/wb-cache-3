25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't want those buildings standing {{if they are going to}} hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
500|$|I {{like the}} whole dance. It was really {{different}} and weird for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> usually don't, you know, be a crazy person every time. It was so fun to do {{and it was really}} out of the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!" [...] But this time it was like, you just need to let go and feel it.|$|E

500|$|Upon signing for Sydney FC, Del Piero said, [...] "It's {{a special}} day for me. I {{am happy to}} {{announce}} that I just signed for two years for Sydney FC. This {{is a very big}} moment for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want to continue my career in a new part of the world where I can make a major contribution and help grow the game I love." [...] After the announcement of the transfer to Sydney FC, Juventus wished good luck to their former captain. Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi said they were saddened by his departure.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just wanted}} to create and do {{something}} different and branch out. At {{the heart of it}} I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I was 195 pounds when I gave birth... I worked crazily {{to get my}} body back. I {{wanted to}} show my body. I wanted {{to show that you}} can have a child and you can work hard and you can get your body back. I know that there's so many women that feel the same thing after they give birth. You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel like I have to protect that side of <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really good show for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know? It was really {{something}} he could sink his teeth into and he just did a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too". This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E
500|$|Northrup {{went to a}} {{psychiatrist}} to obtain advice about Hubbard's increasingly violent and irrational behaviour, {{and was told that}} he probably needed to be institutionalized and that she was in serious danger. She gave Hubbard an ultimatum: get treatment or she would leave with the baby. He was furious and threatened to kill Alexis rather than let Northrup care for her: [...] "He didn't want her to be brought up by <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was in league with the doctors. He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with the devils." [...] She left Palm Springs on February 3, leaving Hubbard to complain that Northrup [...] "had hypnotized him in his sleep and commanded him not to write." ...|$|E

500|$|During the rehearsals that day, Harrison and McCartney had {{a heated}} {{disagreement}} over the lead guitar {{part for the}} song. Harrison's idea was to play a guitar phrase {{as a response to}} each line of the vocal, which did not fit with McCartney's conception of the song's arrangement, and he vetoed it. In a 1994 interview, McCartney said, [...] "looking back on it, I think, Okay. Well, it was bossy, but it was ballsy of <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> could have bowed to the pressure." [...] Ron Richards, a record producer who worked for Martin at both Parlophone and AIR Studios, said McCartney was [...] "oblivious to anyone else's feelings in the studio", and that he was driven to making the best possible record, at almost any cost.|$|E
500|$|Todd's rampant {{popularity}} intruded on Howarth's life. [...] "It's really {{starting to}} frustrate <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can't just go to work anymore," [...] he said. He stopped {{doing a lot of}} press interviews after female fans screamed [...] "Rape me, Todd" [...] at fan events, and because of his disagreement with Todd's redemption arc. His comings-and-goings from time to time throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted with anticipation, excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Teá). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press.|$|E
500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Heaven! You say that?... Lenore Anderson, {{you think}} <b>me</b> insincere <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{did not ask}} you to marry me," [...] he asserted, with bitter pathos.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care why! I must {{write down}} what {{happened}} between Midwinter and <b>me</b> to-night, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> must. There's a reason that nobody can answer--myself included." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you! Was {{it hard to}} own that, Jim? However, you won't have to {{make the}} effort to send <b>me</b> off, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> mean to stay." ...|$|R
500|$|It {{was about}} getting revenge. People were always hating on <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was different. I was like, [...] "I'm going to sing, I'm {{going to do}} this, I'm going to do that," [...] they were like [...] "OK, sure you are." [...] And I was like [...] "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." [...] And {{everybody}} was like, [...] "Yeah right." [...] Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, [...] "You'll be back." [...] So {{it was kind of}} just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.|$|E
500|$|Actor John Noble {{called the}} {{beginning}} scene with Olivia and Walter naked [...] "the funniest thing" [...] yet, explaining [...] "The writers keep throwing challenges at <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Troutham {{have turned}} <b>me</b> away <b>because</b> <b>I</b> let the rooks {{have a few}} peckings of corn. And there's my wages--the last I shall ever hae!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I haven't been to {{the theatre}} today. They let <b>me</b> off <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to be}} married. I'm so sorry. I hope you didn't wait long.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{glad you}} didn't let <b>me</b> pass, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was going out}} into the street, and it's {{doubtful}} if I'd have come back." ...|$|R
500|$|During this period, Hershey {{changed her}} stage name to [...] "Seagull". In 1979, a blunt {{newspaper}} article from the Knight News Service referenced {{this period of}} her life, saying of her acting career that [...] "it {{looked as if she}} blew it." [...] The article referred to Hershey as a [...] "kook" [...] and stated that she was frequently [...] "high on something." [...] In addition to that criticism, she had been ostracized for breast-feeding her son during an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show, and for breast-feeding him beyond the age of two years. She said that this period of her life hurt her career; [...] "Producers wouldn't see <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable. I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career." [...] After splitting up with Carradine, she changed her stage name back to [...] "Hershey", explaining that she had told the story of why she adopted the name [...] "Seagull" [...] so many times that it had lost its meaning.|$|E
500|$|It {{had been}} {{unlikely}} that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher. He {{was unable to}} make his high school varsity team until he was a junior, and he went undrafted as a high schooler. He {{failed to make the}} Bowling Green State University team as a freshman, and after graduating, he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball. Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number, 55, like Drysdale's own number, 53, indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors (lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days). [...] After the record was broken, Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken. Even though Hershiser had the second-best (behind Dwight Gooden) career ERA among active pitchers, he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher, saying, [...] "I think someone's going to break it from <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> know I'm not any big deal".|$|E
500|$|Potemkin {{returned}} to court in January 1774 expecting {{to walk into}} Catherine's arms. The political situation, however, had become complex. Yemelyan Pugachev had just arisen as a pretender to the throne, and commanded a rebel army thirty thousand strong. In addition, Catherine's son Paul turned eighteen and began to gain his own support. By late January Potemkin had tired of the impasse and effected (perhaps with encouragement from Catherine) a [...] "melodramatic retreat" [...] into the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. Catherine relented and had Potemkin brought back in early February 1774, when their relationship became intimate. Several weeks later he had usurped Vasilchikov as Catherine's favorite, and was given the title of Adjutant General. When Catherine's friend Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm objected to Vasilchikov's dismissal, she wrote back to him, [...] "Why do you reproach <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> dismiss a well-meaning but extremely boring bourgeois in favour {{of one of the}} greatest, the most comical and amusing, characters of this iron century?" [...] His uncouth behavior shocked the court, but Potemkin showed himself capable of suitable formality when necessary.|$|E
