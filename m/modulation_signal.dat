The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants.

Particularly simple is their implementation in the voltage-controlled RC filters in a Sallen-Key topology, where the RO provides a nearly exponential dependence of the cutoff frequency on the controlling current, without using feedback by the <b>modulation</b> <b>signal.</b> However, due to the slow response of ROs, most synthesizer developers of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ARP, Korg, Moog and Roland, preferred other elements. As of August 2013 RO-based synthesizers are produced by Doepfer (Germany). A still popular use for ROs are Lowpass Gates like the 292 by Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments or the Makenoise MMG.|$|E

The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation m(t) to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal Fourier transform of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation m(t) having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis addresses the problem of classifying both analog and digital <b>modulation</b> <b>signals</b> using different kinds of classifiers. The classification of <b>modulation</b> <b>signals</b> has both civilian and military applications. A total of 31 statistical signal features are extracted and used to classify 11 <b>modulation</b> <b>signals</b> plus white noise in a hierarchical fashion. The <b>modulation</b> <b>signals</b> include carrier wave (CW), AM, FM, SSB, FSK 2, FSK 4, PSK 2, PSK 4, OOK, QAM 16, and QAM 32. A hierarchy of classifiers is introduced, and the genetic algorithm is employed to obtain the most effective set of features at each level of the hierarchy. Based on the selected features at each level, Bayesian and neural network classifiers are designed to separate the most distinct subclasses at that level. The thesis also discusses the real-time implementation of the developed classification system on a high performance DSP processor, namely TMS 320 C 6701. Various steps taken to optimize the classification algorithm on the DSP processor, and the real-time performance issues are presented.
