Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely <b>my</b> <b>prayer</b> and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E

Amongst the most famous is Hear <b>My</b> <b>Prayer,</b> whose second half contains [...] "O for the Wings of a Dove," [...] which became often performed as a separate item. The piece is written for full choir, organ, and a treble or soprano soloist. Mendelssohn's biographer Todd comments [...] "The very popularity of the anthem in England later exposed it to charges of superficiality from those contemptuous of Victorian mores".|$|E

She revealed some of {{the lines of the}} song on Seacrest's show, [...] "This is <b>my</b> <b>prayer,</b> that I'll die living just as free as my hair", adding that the composition of [...] "Hair" [...] was interesting since it was juxtaposing saxophone with a dance record. In {{an interview}} with radio station Z-100 she added, [...] "Some of those themes are explored more on this album. To put my money where my mouth is." [...] Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was the music of E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen; to her they represented a different genre of music, at the same time encompassing all the different elements of it. She ultimately decided to ask Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument.|$|E

Perry told Do Something in November 2008 {{she was proud}} to be a gay activist, saying [...] "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." [...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California.

2500|$|At a High Mass, {{the priest}} blesses the incense, then incenses {{the bread and}} wine. Among the prayers the priest says is Psalm : [...] "Let <b>my</b> <b>prayer,</b> O Lord, be {{directed}} as incense in Thy sight;...", which is prayed as he incenses the altar. The priest then gives the thurible to the deacon, who incenses the priest, then the other ministers and the congregation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} of the psalms spans at least five centuries, from Psalm 29, possibly adapted from an entire Canaanite hymn to Baal which was transposed into a hymn to Yahweh, to others clearly from the post-Exilic period (not earlier than the 5th cent. B.C.) The majority originated in the southern kingdom of Judah and {{were associated with the}} Temple in Jerusalem, where they probably functioned as libretto during the Temple worship. Exactly how they did this is unclear, although there are indications in some of them: [...] "Bind the festal procession with branches, up to the horns of the altar," [...] suggests a connection with sacrifices, and [...] "Let <b>my</b> <b>prayer</b> be counted as incense" [...] suggests a connection with the offering of incense. Davidic authorship is not accepted as historical fact by modern scholars.|$|E
2500|$|His only opera, Genoveva, Op. 81, {{was written}} in 1848. In it, Schumann {{attempted}} to abolish recitative, which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on Richard Wagner; Schumann's consistently flowing melody {{can be seen as}} a forerunner to Wagner's Melos). The subject of Genoveva – based on Ludwig Tieck and Christian Friedrich Hebbel –was not an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, [...] "Do you know <b>my</b> <b>prayer</b> as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: Nibelungen, Lohengrin and Till Eulenspiegel.|$|E

Lady Avon also attended various state occasions, as well as gatherings of former Prime Ministers and their families. In 1972 (while her husband was still alive) she described to Cecil Beaton the Duchess of Windsor's [...] "very strange" [...] and nervous demeanour – [...] "Is this my seat?" [...] "Is this <b>my</b> <b>prayer</b> book?" [...] "What do I do now?" [...] – at the funeral of her husband, the former King Edward VIII, while thirty years later Tony Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell noted that, at a dinner at 10 Downing Street in 2002 to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, attended by five Prime Ministers and several relatives of deceased Prime Ministers:Prince Philip was deep in conversation with T B, the Countess of Avon, Macmillan's and Douglas-Home's families, and there was lots of reminiscing about life in Number 10.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After <b>my</b> <b>prayer</b> as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E

[...] The Head of Christ is venerated in the Coptic Orthodox Church, after twelve-year-old Isaac Ayoub, who diagnosed with cancer, saw the eyes of Jesus in the painting shedding tears; Fr. Ishaq Soliman of St. Mark's Coptic Church in Houston, on the same day, [...] "testified to the miracles" [...] and on the next day, [...] "Dr. Atef Rizkalla, the family physician, examined the youth and certified that there were no traces of leukemia". With episcopal approval from Bishop Tadros of Port Said and Bishop Yuhanna of Cairo, [...] "Sallman's Head of Christ was exhibited in the Coptic Church", with [...] "more than fifty thousand people" [...] visiting the church to see it. In addition, several religious magazines have explained the [...] "power of Sallman's picture" [...] by documenting occurrences such as headhunters letting go of a businessman and fleeing after seeing the image, a [...] "thief who aborted his misdeed when he saw the Head of Christ on a living room wall", and deathbed conversions of non-believers to Christianity.

2500|$|There {{is a story}} which relates {{that when}} the son of Johanan ben Zakai was very sick, the father {{solicited}} the prayers of Hanina. Hanina readily complied, and the child recovered. The overjoyed father could not refrain from expressing his admiration for his wonderful pupil, stating that he himself might have prayed the whole day without doing any good. His wife, astonished at such self-abasement {{on the part of}} her famous husband, inquired, [...] "Is Hanina greater than thou?" [...] To this he replied, [...] "There is this difference between us: he is like the body-servant of a king, having at all times free access to the august presence, without even having to await permission to reach his ears; while I, like a lord before a king, must await an opportune moment" [...] (Berakhot, 34b). Another tale states that, at the solicitation of Gamaliel II, Hanina entreated mercy for that patriarch's son, and at the conclusion of his prayers assured Gamaliel's messengers that the patient's fever had left him. This assurance created doubt {{in the minds of the}} messengers, who promptly asked, [...] "Art thou a prophet?" [...] To this he replied, [...] "I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but experience has taught me that whenever <b>my</b> <b>prayer</b> flows freely it is granted; otherwise, it is rejected." [...] The messengers thereupon noted down Hanina's declaration, and the exact time when it was made; on reaching the patriarch's residence they found that Hanina had spoken truly (ibidem; compare Berakhot, v. 5 and Yerushalmi Berakhot, v. 9d).|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and <b>my</b> <b>prayer,</b> is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E

Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E
