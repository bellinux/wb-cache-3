These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body <b>mass</b> <b>index,</b> smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body <b>mass</b> <b>index.</b> Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{different}} body components {{may contribute}} to the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of the present study was to examine the association of fat mass and fat free <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> with markers of insulin resistance, independently of each other and giving, at the same time, gender-specific information in a wide cohort of European adolescents. Methods: A cross-sectional study in a school setting was conducted in 925 (430 males) adolescents (14. 9 ± 1. 2 years). Weight, height, anthropometric, bioimpedance and blood parameters were measured. <b>Indices</b> for fat <b>mass</b> and fat free mass, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) were calculated. Multiple regression analyses were performed adjusting for several confounders including fat free mass and fat mass when possible. Results: <b>Indices</b> of fat <b>mass</b> were positively associated with HOMA (all p < 0. 01) after adjusting for all the confounders including fat free <b>mass</b> <b>indices,</b> in both sexes. Fat free <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> were associated with HOMA, in both males and females, after adjusting for center, pubertal status, socioeconomic status and cardiorespiratory fitness, but the associations disappear when including fat <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> in the adjustment’s model. Conclusion: Fat <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> derived from different methods are positively associated with insulin resistance independently of several confounders including fat free <b>mass</b> <b>indices.</b> In addition, the relationship of fat free mass with insulin resistance is influenced by the amount of fat mass in European adolescents. Nevertheless, future studies should focus not only on the role of fat mass, but also on other body components such as fat free mass because its role could vary depending of the level and distribution of fat mass. The HELENA study takes place with the financial support of the European Community Sixth RTD Framework Programme (Contract FOOD-CT- 2005 - 007034).

40|$|Obesity is {{frequently}} associated with insulin resistance. Recently {{an important role}} of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a in mediating insulin resistance of obesity through its overexpres-sion in fat tissue has been reported. In order to examine the relation of insulin resistance to obesity and to serum neopterin, as a parameter of immune activation, we studied 1234 otherwise healthy outpatients, who visited the physician’s office for a medical health check-up. 7 % showed elevated glucose concentrations, 34 % elevated body <b>mass</b> <b>indices.</b> There were significant correlations between glucose concentrations and body <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> and of the latter with serum neopterin concentrations. Neopterin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with elevated body <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> (Mann-Whitney test, U 5 131 358, p 5 0. 0003) and elevated glucose concentrations (Mann-Whitney test, U 5 35 350 p 5 0. 02).

A body <b>mass</b> <b>index</b> {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold.

Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body <b>mass</b> <b>index</b> (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones.

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body <b>mass</b> <b>index,</b> and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} echocardiographic {{reference values}} for cardiac chambers, left ventricular mass, and left ventricular (LV) <b>mass</b> <b>indexes</b> in an asymptomatic adult population sample. Methods: This was an observational study {{based on a}} randomly selected population sample {{from the city of}} Vitória, Brazil. Two hundred and ninety-five volunteers (61. 7 % women) with no past history of cardiovascular disease underwent transthoracic echocardiography. The following M-mode echocardiographic parameters were measured: ventricular diameters, interventricular septal thickness, LV posterior wall thickness, LV mass, left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>indexes,</b> plus aortic and left atrial diameters. Values were expressed as mean and standard deviation and percentiles, with a 95 % confidence interval. Results: Echocardiographic values were slightly influenced by gender and age. Overall, cardiac measurements were higher in the male gender. LV posterior wall thickness, <b>mass</b> <b>indexes</b> corrected for height and diastolic diameter were influenced by age. The 95 % percentiles of interventricular septum and LV posterior wall were 9. 9 mm and 9. 6 mm for men, respectively, and 9. 3 mm for septum and posterior wall for women. Conclusion: The 95 % percentile values of interventricular septum and posterior wall and, therefore, of both absolute and <b>indexed</b> left ventricular <b>mass</b> found in our study conducted in the Vitória population are lower than those reported in previous studies. In this framework, our results will be useful as a reference, since they are consistent with the new limits suggested in the literature for the echocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy.

Hours of outdoor play and television viewing are associated with BMI. Higher maternal perceptions of neighborhood collective efficacy are associated with more hours of outdoor play, fewer hours of television viewing, and more trips to a park or playground.

40|$|PURPOSE: To study {{young adult}} elite athletes with age- and sex-matched {{sedentary}} controls to assess sex-specific differences for left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) volumes and mass {{as well as}} for LV contraction and relaxation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 23 male athletes (mean age 25 +/- 4 years, training 22 +/- 7 hours/week in rowing, swimming, or triathlon) and 20 female athletes (mean age 24 +/- 4 years, training 19 +/- 5 hours/week in rowing, swimming, or triathlon) and age- and sex-matched sedentary controls (21 male/ 17 female) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (1. 5 Tesla). Cardiac phase contrast imaging using a black-blood k-space segmented gradient echo sequence was used for analysis of cardiac contraction and relaxation and steady-state free-precession cine images were acquired for determination of cardiac volumes and mass. RESULTS: Male and female athletes showed similar increases in LV and RV volume and <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> when compared to controls (ranging between 15 % and 42 %). No sex-specific differences in training effect on LV and RV volumes, <b>mass</b> <b>indices,</b> and ejection fractions, as well as LV to RV ratios of these volume and <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> (parameters of balanced LV and RV dilatation and hypertrophy) were observed (all P for interaction > 0. 05).

Gadolinium contrast agents previously used for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are contraindicated because of an association with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. In other populations, increased myocardial native T 1 times on cardiac MRI {{have been shown to}} be a surrogate marker of myocardial fibrosis. We applied this method to 33 incident hemodialysis patients and 28 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers who underwent MRI at 3. 0 T. Native T 1 relaxation times and feature tracking–derived global longitudinal strain as potential markers of fibrosis were compared and associated with cardiac biomarkers. Left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> were higher in the hemodialysis than the control group. Global, Septal and midseptal T 1 times were all significantly higher in the hemodialysis group (global T 1 hemodialysis 1171 ± 27 ms vs. 1154 ± 32 ms; septal T 1 hemodialysis 1184 ± 29 ms vs. 1163 ± 30 ms; and midseptal T 1 hemodialysis 1184 ± 34 ms vs. 1161 ± 29 ms). In the hemodialysis group, T 1 times correlated with left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>indices.</b> Septal T 1 times correlated with troponin and electrocardiogram-corrected QT interval. The peak global longitudinal strain was significantly reduced in the hemodialysis group (hemodialysis - 17. 7 ± 5. 3 % vs. - 21. 8 ± 6. 2 %). For hemodialysis patients, the peak global longitudinal strain significantly correlated with left ventricular <b>mass</b> <b>indices</b> (R = 0. 426), and a trend was seen for correlation with galectin- 3, a biomarker of cardiac fibrosis.
