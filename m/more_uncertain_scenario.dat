H 577 P LMS 2016 Liaoviii, 178 pages :color illustrationsThe thesis {{consists}} of four projects {{under the umbrella of}} revenue maximization with limited capacity. The topics are motivated from real practices of revenue management and competition in the airline industry, hotel industry, and property market, etc. The first two projects are motivated by the increasing popularity of the travel package and emerging impact of the new third-party channel on the hotel's traditional dynamic pricing. They consider a monopolistic framework in which the supplier owns limited inventory of perishable resource, and dynamically controls the selling process in a finite planning horizon. The first project considers a revenue-maximizing supplier who holds two resources and sells a line of products made up of individual components and a package comprising these two resources. In every period, three streams of consumers arrive: one stream for each component and one for the package. We adopt both quantity-based and price-based controls to maximize the expected revenue. The results show that the optimal solutions behave monotonically with respect to time and inventory level. Finally, we numerically compare the performances between quantity-based and price-based controls. The second project studies a dynamic dual-channel pricing problem. In the travel industry, suppliers usually use both their own direct channel and Online Travel Agency (OTA) channel to distribute services. In particular, we consider the OTA-supplier contract's rate stipulation which prohibits the price of the direct channel be lower than that of OTA channel. We formulate a dynamic pricing model, where a monopolistic supplier with limited capacity faces consumer arrivals from direct and OTA channels in every period. We show that the rate stipulation leads the direct channel's consumers to unilateral switch to the OTA channel. We also obtain the structural properties of optimal prices and the supplier's optimal channel policy with respect to time and inventory level. The last two projects are motivated respectively by the firms' products-size design problems such as the TV stations' advertisement duration decision in the prime time, and the use of Commission Override Model to mitigate the capacity competition between the Online Travel Agency and the hotels. They consider the revenue maximization with limited inventory in a competitive framework. The third project studies whether capacitated suppliers should introduce a small-size product or large-size product in a competitive environment. We study a model where symmetric duopoly capacitated suppliers can either choose to sell the small or large product. We demonstrate that the equilibrium product strategy depends on the decision sequence between the suppliers, and the relative capacity compared to the extent of increasing marginal utility experienced by the consumer when consuming an additional unit of the inventory. The fourth project considers a commonly used allocation scheme in the hotel industry: Commission Override Model (COM), which uses both wholesale contract and consignment contract to sell hotel rooms, allowing the hotel to more flexibly allocate rooms among channels. We study two firms, a hotel that has a direct channel and an OTA that owns the OTA channel. We formulate a two-period stochastic model and obtain the game equilibrium. Our results show that COM is able to benefit the two firms more than the traditional wholesale or consignment contract in a <b>more</b> <b>uncertain</b> <b>scenario.</b> Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.

40|$|While {{the process}} of {{economic}} globalisation has presented the region with significant opportunities the future and continuing economic development of the region is also threatened by global exposure of the export orientated sectors {{in the face of}} economic downturn. Nevertheless, there remains a broad consensus to develop a high knowledge-based and high technology based productive sector. The initial trend in 2001 is that while the new economy downturn has resulted in job losses and closures such as Gateway, Motorola and others the current skills and labour shortages have seen significant numbers of such staff immediately re-employed elsewhere.

40|$|Objective: To {{measure the}} {{uncertainty}} of temporal assertions like “ 3 weeks ago ” in clinical texts. Design: Temporal assertions extracted from narrative clinical reports were compared to facts extracted from a structured clinical database for the same patients. Measurements: The authors correlated the assertions and the facts to determine the dependence of {{the uncertainty of}} the assertions on the semantic and lexical properties of the assertions. Results: The observed deviation between the stated duration and actual duration averaged about 20 % of the stated deviation. Linear regression revealed that assertions about events further in the past tend to be <b>more</b> <b>uncertain,</b> smaller numeric values tend to be <b>more</b> <b>uncertain</b> (1 mo v. 30 d), and round numbers tend to be <b>more</b> <b>uncertain</b> (10 versus 11 yrs). Conclusions: The authors empirically derived semantics behind statements of duration using “ago, ” and verified intuitions about how numbers are used. � J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2009; 16 : 220 – 227.

The objective of the paper is to investigate the predictability of these type of models. The research approach was to study a well measured and documented case and try to extract some general rules from it. Preliminary results show that: (1) 90 % {{of the time the}} plant energy measurements are in between the simulated bandwidth when all parameters are varied according to most <b>uncertain</b> case <b>scenario.</b> (2) Similarly, 30 % of the time the relative humidity measurements are within the simulated bandwidth. (3) In this specific case, simulation results seem most sensitive for changes in insulation material layer thickness, ventilation rate and the internal surface heat transfer resistance. Most important and contrary to the expectations, it seems that even in the most <b>uncertain</b> <b>scenarios,</b> the measurements do not fit within the simulated bandwidths...|$|R
