5|$|The {{immediate}} postwar {{fate of the}} Navy was the scrapping and <b>mothballing</b> {{of ships}} on a large scale; by 1948 only 267 ships were active in the Navy. In 1948 the Women's Armed Services Integration Act gave women permanent status in the Regular and Reserve forces of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} houses three 380MWth International Combustion boilers, which are fuelled by {{pulverised}} bituminous coal. Each of these provide steam {{for one of}} three 140 megawatt (MW) Parsons turbo-alternators, situated in the station's turbine hall. These give the station a total generating capacity of 420MW. The electricity generated was fed at 24 kilovolt (kV) to a substation to power the smelter during operation. The substation also has a 132kV connection to the National Grid, where electricity is distributed to homes and other industries by Northern Electric Distribution Limited. The smelter's two pot lines required 310MW of the 420MW that the power station produces, so the excess 110MW which was fed into the national grid. Since the <b>mothballing</b> of the smelter, all exports now go to the grid.|$|E

25|$|The RoCAF's Mirages have {{suffered}} from low operational readiness and high maintenance costs; the harsh environment and high operational tempo had caused higher-than-expected wear and tear. After the presence of cracks in the blades of the aircraft's engines were detected in 2009, Dassault worked with Taiwanese authorities to successfully rectify the issue and provided compensation for the engine damage. By the following year, normal training hours of 15 per month had resumed and the fleet's operational readiness had been restored, after having reportedly dropped to 6 hours per month due to the engine troubles. In addition to this issue, there were considerations of <b>mothballing</b> the entire Mirage fleet due to its high maintenance costs. Although the aircraft's maintenance supplies cost more {{than those of the}} Republic's AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo and the Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon, the fleet was reportedly still being maintained adequately because of its popularity. Yet plans to upgrade the fleet had not been carried out as costs for doing so in France would be very high.|$|E
25|$|The Viva {{remained}} on sale {{until the end}} of 1979, when the Opel Kadett D was launched. It was intended that this car would also be produced in America and the UK, as the second generation Chevette, but due to various industrial issues at the time GM decided to shelve most of the Ellesmere Port Plant, retaining only the assembly shop to build the new car. These would be produced from 'knock-down' kits shipped from Opel's Russelsheim plant. Due to the huge loss of workforce which this would cause, representations were made which resulted in the decision to continue production of existing models alongside the new. This meant that a new name would have to be found for Vauxhall's version of the new Opel Kadett, and so in March 1980 the Vauxhall Astra was born, replacing the Viva in the Vauxhall range, while the Chevette {{remained on}} sale until 1984. At this time, the planned <b>mothballing</b> of the major proportion of the Ellesmere Port Plant went ahead as originally planned.|$|E

25|$|After the {{departure}} of Paris Gibson Junior High School from the old Great Falls High School building in June 1975, there was deep concern that the building might be demolished. The building was in disrepair from decades of use as a public school, the HVAC and mechanical systems needed upgrading, and the building was ill-prepared for <b>mothballing.</b> Vandalism, weather, and lack of use quickly began to take its toll, as the building sat vacant for a year. A local coalition of historic preservationists, concerned citizens, and art aficionados quickly formed to save the historic structure. Great Falls had long been home to the C. M. Russell Museum (dedicated to the works of Western artist Charles Marion Russell and others), {{but there was no}} institution supporting contemporary artists or art in other genres. The effort to save the historic high school began in 1974, during the citywide debate over whether to purchase the Catholic high school for use as a junior high. Jean Warden Dybdal and Pam Marlen, leaders in the Junior League chapter in Great Falls, organized an informal citizen's task force {{to come up with a}} plan to save the high school building. The initial plan was to create a community cultural center, although over time this changed into a more formal museum proposal. The Junior League and its allies successfully pushed the Great Falls Public Schools and Commissioners of Cascade County to sign an agreement whereby the structure became jointly owned by both governmental bodies. Cascade County agreed to provide funding for the structure's renovation and operations. The art museum was tasked with becoming financially self-sustaining. GFPS agreed to lease the structure to the museum for $1 a year, but not pay for any renovations. As part of the agreement with GFPS, the museum also agreed to devote a substantial portion of its resources to educating students and the public about art and art-making.|$|E

2500|$|In October, 1950, the NYS put new Budd RDC cars {{into service}} on the North Hawthorne-Susquehana Transfer route. [...] Like their {{predecessors}} the Brills and the ACFs, the new RDCs were stored overnight in North Hawthorne at the car shop-turned-garage. [...] This continued to until 1958, when an economic downturn and rising operating costs forced the NYS to begin <b>mothballing</b> and selling off its fleet of RDCs. [...] The rapid transit service was cancelled, but North Hawthorne continued to operate as a passenger terminal, {{as well as a}} storage facility for non-motorized rail cars. [...] Finally, on June 30, 1966, the last passenger trains left North Hawthorne, and the yard began to fall into disrepair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} debt {{was seen as}} an indicator of waste and corruption, and Jeffersonians wanted it paid off totally. [...] They also wanted to buy Louisiana and fight a war with Britain, and Gallatin managed to finance these grand objectives, but he could not simultaneously pay off the debt. The debt stood at $80 million in 1801, and Gallatin devoted three quarters of federal revenues to reducing it. Despite spending $15 million on Louisiana, and losing the tax on whiskey when it was repealed in 1802, Gallatin trimmed the debt to $45 million. The government saved money by <b>mothballing</b> the navy and keeping the army small and poorly equipped. [...] Gallatin reluctantly supported Jefferson's embargo of 1807–1808, which tried to use economic coercion to change British policies, and failed to do so. The War of 1812 (1812–1815) proved expensive, and the debt soared to $123 million, even with burdensome new taxes.|$|E
