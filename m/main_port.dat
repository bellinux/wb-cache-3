5|$|Historically, the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> on {{the river}} was at Bridgwater, where a span crossed the river from 1200 AD onwards. Quays were built at Bridgwater in 1424, with another quay, the Langport slip, being built in 1488 {{upstream}} of the Town Bridge. A custom house was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. Bridgwater built some 167 ships, the last one being the Irene launched in 1907.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm {{striking}} Réunion, officials advised residents to remain inside. Officials ordered residents in Saint-Leu along the coast to evacuate inland, and at least 300people evacuated island-wide. The airport at Saint-Denis was closed, but reopened after the storm passed the island; several flights were canceled as a result. The <b>main</b> <b>port</b> was also closed, as were most childcare facilities, and mail service was suspended. Officials issued a red alert for the island, the first since Cyclone Dumile a year prior.|$|E

5|$|Named after Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez (born in Macharaviaya, Malaga, Spain), Galveston's first European {{settlements}} on {{the island}} were built around 1816 by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury to help the fledgling Republic of Mexico fight Spain. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its independence from Spain. The city was the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> for the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution, and later served as {{the capital of the}} Republic of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The port of Linnville was {{established}} on Matagorda Bay in 1831, {{and served as}} a <b>main</b> <b>port</b> for the Republic of Texas. The Great Comanche Raid of 1840 destroyed the town and forced the inhabitants to flee to the nearby Labbacca, which would later become known as Port Lavaca. Lavaca or la vaca, Spanish for cow, was founded {{in the wake of the}} Comanche Raid in 1841. It replaced Linnville as the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> on Matagorda Bay. However, the sandbar-heavy Lavaca Bay caused some navigational problems for ships. As a result, Lavaca was surpassed by Indianola as the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> on Matagorda Bay in the 1850s, even though the sandbars were dredged later in the decade. Indianola had been founded in 1846 as a landing place for German immigrants. It rapidly developed into a major seaport, and became the second largest in the state (after Galveston) by the 1860s. The two ports, and strategic control of Matagorda Bay in particular, became important during the American Civil War. Control of the bay shifted between the Union and Confederate forces several times. The Union presence in the area ended in June 1864. After the war, Indianola continued its growth, and had a population of 5,000 in the 1870s. A hurricane in 1875 caused massive damage to the city. It was rebuilt on a smaller scale shortly thereafter, but a second and more intense hurricane made landfall in 1886 (the fifth most intense in U.S. history), causing even greater destruction. The following year, Indianola was completely abandoned. Although Lavaca was also significantly affected by the hurricanes, it survived as a port, and again became the largest on the bay. It continues to hold this distinction today. It was renamed Port Lavaca in the late 19th Century. Palacios {{was established}} around 1901, and Port O'Connor was founded on the bay in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{took part}} in the {{operation}} off Lissa in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence. There, she silenced the Austrian coastal batteries protecting the <b>main</b> <b>port,</b> but she was too badly damaged {{to take part in the}} ensuing Battle of Lissa. The ship's postwar career was limited due to a combination of drastically reduced naval budgets and the appearance of more modern ironclads. Formidabile was used as a training ship starting in 1887; she was discarded in 1903 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|After {{training}} in the United States the division was sent overseas in March 1944. Under Bruce's leadership the 77th Division fought in the Pacific War, participating in campaigns in Guam, Leyte, and Ryukyu. At Leyte, in the Philippines, the division was responsible for taking Palompon, the last <b>main</b> <b>port</b> the Japanese held on the island. During the ten-day battle for that area of the island, from December 21 through December 31, 1944, the division estimated that they had killed 5,779 Japanese soldiers and taken 29 prisoners, with only 17 Americans killed, 116 wounded, and 6 missing in action. For his service {{the government of the}} Philippines later awarded him the Philippine Legion of Honor, the Philippine Liberation Medal, and the Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for {{passengers}} and mail. It had a signal station (built 1872) {{and a time}} ball tower (built 1875). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s. When {{the decision was made}} to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250,000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30,000. Port Adelaide was the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2,500.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{joined the}} French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, {{but the news}} did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months. The {{immediate}} priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India, especially their <b>main</b> <b>port</b> of Pondicherry. Once the British had completed this operation {{at the end of}} August 1793, the squadron returned to Europe. This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly exposed, and privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels, including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal, which three privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the docks}} {{declined}} in use and were finally closed in 1980, {{leading to the}} setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981. London's <b>main</b> <b>port</b> is now at Tilbury, further down the Thames estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted {{to the needs of}} modern container ships in 1968, and so they survived the closure of the inner docks. Various wharves along the river continue to be in use but on a much smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|On the {{offshore}} Socotra island, over 1,000families evacuated to schools {{set up as}} shelters. On 1November, Chapala became the first hurricane-force storm to impact Socotra since 1922, bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall. Residents reported rainfall {{to be the most}} severe in decades, and northeastern areas of the island were rendered inaccessible due to flooding, forcing residents to ride out the storm on their roofs. Chapala damaged Socotra's <b>main</b> <b>port,</b> and also caused an island-wide power outage. Chapala wrecked 237homes on the island and damaged at least 497homes, forcing about 18,000people to leave their homes. Initial reports indicated that three people were killed and at least 200others sustained injuries on the island; subsequently, the government reported that there were no deaths on the island.|$|E
5|$|Some {{coastal cities}} {{surrendered}} to the Romans which allowed {{them to have a}} base in the coastal regions of Laconia. Gythium was a large city and had been made by the Spartans as their <b>main</b> <b>port</b> and naval arsenal. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese and Rhodian fleets built siege engines which had devastating effects on the walls. One of the city's joint commanders, Dexagoridas, offered to surrender the city to the Roman legate in charge of the fleet while Flamininus was gone. When the other commander Gorgopas found out he murdered Dexagoridas.|$|E

5|$|The History of Galveston, Texas, {{begins with}} the archaeological record of Native Americans who used the island. The first European {{settlements}} on the island were constructed around 1816. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its successful revolution from Spain. The city served as the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> for the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution. Galveston was founded in 1836 by Matthew Sabo and served as {{the capital of the}} Republic of Texas. The Battle of Galveston was fought in Galveston Bay during the American Civil War when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city.|$|E
5|$|The Yemeni Government {{declared}} a state of emergency for Socotra shortly after the storm's passage on 1November. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. Various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. Neighboring Oman sent 14cargo planes' worth of food totaling 270tons worth of goods. The planes mostly carried food, as well as blankets and tents. The United Arab Emirates also sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra. Due to damage to the island's <b>main</b> <b>port,</b> residents built a makeshift pathway to help distribution of aid.|$|E
5|$|The third {{significant}} cyclone in 14months {{to affect}} the region, Ivy produced heavy rainfall and high winds in Vanuatu. Due to advance warning, only two people were killed, and several people were injured. The high winds damaged about 11,000houses, leaving many people homeless. The cyclone passed {{very close to the}} Vanuatu capital city of Port Vila, forcing the evacuation of about 2,000people and shutting down the <b>main</b> <b>port.</b> Cyclone Ivy also affected the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia with rainfall, and later it produced high waves in New Zealand that killed two people. Because of its severe damage on Vanuatu, the name Ivy was retired following its usage.|$|E

5|$|A Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 {{warships}} of over 50 guns, 21 {{of less than}} 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between {{the southern tip of}} Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet's fireships were captured, one by the allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{communication}} disruptions on Socotra made {{it difficult}} for relief workers to determine the needs of the affected residents. Due to the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from a ship carrying 700tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. The United Arab Emirates sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food.

5|$|In 1626 the {{southern}} {{threat to the}} Commonwealth was overshadowed by a northern one, as an incursion by Swedish forces reignited the Polish–Swedish War. In June, Gustavus Adolphus, with a fleet of 125 ships and an army of over 14,000 men, approached the Polish coast and began collecting tariffs on trade passing through Gdańsk (Danzig). Having taken Piława and Braniewo, Swedish forces spread through Pomerania, taking Frombork, Tolkmicko, Elbląg, Malbork, Gniew, Tczew and Starograd, while other Swedish forces landed near Puck—the <b>main</b> <b>port</b> of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth fleet—and captured it. The major city of Gdańsk, however, refused to surrender {{even in the face}} of lightning Swedish advances. In a battle that took place between 22 and 30 September 1626 near the village of Gniew, Gustavus defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund, who retreated and called for reinforcements from other parts of the country. In response, Koniecpolski was tasked with defending Royal Prussia against the Swedish incursion. He was delayed by the unstable situation in the south, though, and it was not until 1 October that he finally departed for Prussia.|$|E
