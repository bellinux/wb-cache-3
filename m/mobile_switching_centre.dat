50|$|In {{cellular}} wireless networks, such as GSM, the picocell {{base station}} is typically a low-cost, small (typically {{the size of}} a ream of A4 paper), reasonably simple unit that connects to a base station controller (BSC).

50|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> station, {{abbreviated}} as MSC Server or MSS, is a 2G {{core network}} element which controls the network switching subsystem elements. Alternatively or adaptively, MSS {{can be used}} in GSM networks as well, if the manufacturer has implemented support for GSM networks in the MSS. Since an immediate upgrade of existing GSM network to 3G is not viable due to various issues like handset incompatibilities and high expenditure, most manufacturers do implement GSM support in MSS. In fact, MSS along with other 3G network elements such as media gateway (MGW), can be configured to support GSM network exclusively and can be considered as an upgraded version of existing GSM <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centres.</b> The MSC Server is standards-based and communicates with other distributed elements using industry open standards such as media gateway control protocol, megaco/H.248, session initiation protocol, M2UA and M3UA. The MSC server incorporates industry standards as defined by ETSI, ITU, GSM, 3GPP and 3GPP2 and other leading standard bodies. The MSS supports the regulatory environment set by governing bodies via its support for E911, CALEA/legal intercept, wireless and local number portability, TTY/TTD, and Number Pooling requirements.|$|R
50|$|The key {{interface}} {{in these}} architectures is {{that between the}} femtocell access points and the femtocell gateway. Standardisation enables a wider choice of femtocell products {{to be used with}} any gateway, increasing competitive pressure and driving costs down. For the common WCDMA femtocells, this is defined as the Luh interface. In the Luh architecture, the femtocell gateway sits between the femtocell and the core network and performs the necessary translations to ensure the femtocells appear as a radio network controller to existing <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> (MSCs). Each femtocell talks to the femtocell gateway and femtocell gateways talk to the Core Network Elements (CNE) (MSC for circuit-switched calls, SGSN for packet-switched calls). This model was proposed by 3GPP and the Femto Forum. New protocols (HNBAP Node B Application Part and RUA User Adaptation) have been derived; HNBAP is used for the control signaling between the HNB and HNB-GW while RUA is a lightweight mechanism to replace the SCCP and M3UA protocols in the RNC; its primary function is transparent transfer of RANAP messages.|$|R

5000|$|A Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is an E.164 defined {{telephone}} number used to route telephone {{calls in a}} mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway <b>Mobile</b> <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre)</b> to the target MSC (see Network Switching Subsystem).

A MSRN is assigned for every mobile terminated call, not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN' ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The mobile radios, {{whether they}} are part of a {{cellular}} system or an Ad Hoc wireless network of sensors, are meant to support extreme forms of portability – cell to cell in the same cluster, cluster to cluster, city to city, country to country and in the case of Ad Hoc networks, one route to another. Consequently, the frequency of the radio receiver has to change frequently. As is known, the frequency switching takes place remotely, under the supervision of the <b>mobile</b> <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> (MSC) and base transceiver station (BTS) of the cellular system in cellular networks and it has to change automatically for Ad Hoc networks. The reliability of the network depends on the precise and optimum tuning of the receiver. In this paper, I have described a circuit which helps the tuning quickly and reliably to achieve the optimum receiver performance for any such wireless networks...|$|E

Planning a good, stable and reliable microwave network can be quite challenging. At the same time, it poses several interesting optimization problems.
