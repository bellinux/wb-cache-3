5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) and a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 1,800m (1,969yd) when {{fired from the}} P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 32,000m (35,000yd).

5|$|The top 100 {{constrained}} autopilot dynamics candidate paths {{were selected}} {{on the basis}} of their match with the satellite data from Flight 370 and their consistency with autopilot behaviour. The distribution of these paths at the intersection with the 6th handshake was then generated, with some paths outside (south) of the <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of the aircraft and which can therefore be eliminated. The candidate paths generated by the data error optimisation method were weighed according to the root mean square of the BFO values at each handshake. The distribution of results from these two methods were charted together, indicating that the total probability areas overlap on the 08:11 arc between approximately 35–39°S. These paths have then been extrapolated to the seventh handshake at 08:19 and constrained by the <b>maximum</b> <b>range,</b> intersecting the seventh arc between approximately 33.5–38.3°S. This is the most likely location of Flight 370 at the time of the seventh handshake.|$|E

40|$|This project report {{presents}} the experiments and performance analysis of virtual fence unit consists of microwave motion detector and IEEE 802. 15. 4 {{wireless sensor network}} for <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range.</b> In particular, the analysis is focusing on the <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> of virtual fence unit in terms of azimuth angle, elevation angle, height, sensitivity level for indoor and outdoor implementation. The WSN platform is developed using Octopus II sensor nodes while the microwave motion detector is HB 100 which detect movement using Doppler effect. Results show the <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> is <b>maximum</b> at 0 º angle in both azimuth and elevation. The <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> of virtual fence unit is decreasing as azimuth angle increasing. For elevation angle, a significant increment of <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> at 45 º and 60 º elevation angle in downwards direction compared to 45 º and 60 º elevation angle in upwards direction is observed. With high sensitivity level of virtual fence unit, the <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> of virtual fence unit {{is larger than the}} <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> of virtual fence unit at normal sensitivity level. However, high sensitivity level will not further increase the <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> if the virtual fence unit has reached its <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range.</b> Results also show virtual fence unit behaves differently in indoor and outdoor environment and the virtual fence unit has longer <b>maximum</b> sensing <b>range</b> in indoor environment than outdoor environment...|$|R

5|$|Secondary {{armament}} included eighteen 15cm (5.9inch) SK L/40 guns; {{six were}} emplaced in single turrets amidships and twelve were mounted in MPL casemates. These guns fired armor-piercing shells {{at a rate}} of 4–5 per minute. The ships carried 120 shells per gun, for a total of 2,160 rounds total. The guns could depress to −7degrees and elevate to 20degrees, for a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 13,700m (14,990yd). They were manually elevated and trained.|$|E
5|$|The Bayern-class battleships {{were armed}} with a main battery of eight 38cm (15in) SK L/45 guns in four Drh LC/1913 twin gun turrets. These turrets could train 150degrees {{to either side of}} the centerline, and their guns could depress to −8degrees. As the Germans thought that {{conditions}} in the North Sea would dictate short-range actions, the guns initially could elevate only to 16degrees, which allowed a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 20,400m.

5|$|The need to test Zeus against targets flying {{realistic}} ICBM profiles {{presented a}} problem. While White Sands was fine for testing the basic missile and guidance systems, {{it was too}} small to test Zeus at its <b>maximum</b> <b>range.</b> Such testing began at Point Mugu in California. where the Zeus missiles could fly out over the Pacific. Consideration was given to using Point Mugu to launch against ICBMs flying from Cape Canaveral, but range safety requirements placed limits on the potential tests. The Atlantic Test Range, to the northeast of Canaveral, had a high population density and little land available for building accurate downrange tracking stations, Ascension being the only suitable location.|$|E
5|$|These guns fired 100lb (45.4kg) shells {{at a rate}} {{of between}} 57 per minute. The shells were fired with a muzzle {{velocity}} of 2,775fps (846mps), though the guns were capable of higher velocities. It was reduced in order to standardize the performance of all the 6inch guns in Royal Navy service, which would simplify range calculations for guns of the calibre.

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is highly}} {{contagious}} via the fecal-oral (intestinal source) and the oral-oral (oropharyngeal source) routes. In endemic areas, wild polioviruses can infect {{virtually the entire}} human population. It is seasonal in temperate climates, with peak transmission occurring in summer and autumn. These seasonal differences are far less pronounced in tropical areas. The time between first exposure and first symptoms, known as the incubation period, is usually 6 to 20days, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 3 to 35days. Virus particles are excreted in the feces for several weeks following initial infection. The disease is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route, by ingesting contaminated food or water. It is occasionally transmitted via the oral-oral route, a mode especially visible in areas with good sanitation and hygiene. Polio is most infectious between 7 and 10 days {{before and after the}} appearance of symptoms, but transmission is possible as long as the virus remains in the saliva or feces.|$|E

5000|$|Shotgun slugs (12 gauge) achieve typical {{velocities}} {{of approximately}} 1800 fps for 1-oz. (437.5 grain) slugs, for an energy of over 3,100 ft-lbs (4200 J). In contrast, a [...]30-06 bullet weighing 150 grains at a velocity of 2600 fps achieves an energy of 2,250 ft-lbs (3051 J). However, a shotgun slug has greater air resistance and slows {{more quickly than}} a spitzer bullet fired from a rifle. Shotgun slugs thus are best suited for uses over shorter ranges than rifle bullets. However, for hunting in built-up populated areas, shotgun slugs (with regard to range) are considerably safer than rifles, with <b>maximum</b> <b>ranges</b> typically under 400 yards, in comparison to <b>maximum</b> <b>ranges</b> of several miles for errant projectiles from rifles.|$|R

5|$|Their {{anti-aircraft}} battery {{consisted of}} fourteen 10.5cm C/33 L/65 guns, sixteen 3.7cm L/83 guns, and between ten and twenty 2cm guns. The 10.5cm guns fired {{at a rate}} of 15–18 rounds per minute, and had an effective ceiling of 12,500m (41,010feet). They were mounted in six Dop. L. C/31 twin mounts amidships, which allowed depression to −8° and elevation to 80°. When used to engage surface targets, the guns had a <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of 17,700m (19,357yd) at an elevation of 45°. The 3.7cm guns were placed in eight manually operated Dopp LC/30 twin mounts. At 85°, they had an effective ceiling of 6,800m (22,310ft), though tracers were limited to 4,800m (15,750ft).

5|$|The {{combined}} SDU {{and ground}} station bias was calculated from 17 signals exchanged between the ground {{station and the}} aircraft during a 30-minute period before take-off, when the aircraft's location was known (at Kuala Lumpur International Airport). To establish the accuracy of their calculations, the bias value was {{used to calculate the}} distance from the aircraft to the satellite during the time it was on the ground at KLIA, with errors of <1 km-8.85 km (<1 mi-5.5 mi). The distance from the satellite to the aircraft was also calculated while the aircraft was in-flight and at a known location shortly after take-off, showing similar accuracy. The distance between the satellite and aircraft could thus be calculated for signals exchanged between 02:25–08:19, after Flight 370 disappeared from radar. However, this could only produce a ring on Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated value, adjusted to account for the aircraft flying at 10,000 m (33,000 ft). The ring could also be reduced to an arc by taking into consideration the <b>maximum</b> <b>range</b> of the aircraft if it flew at its maximum speed.|$|E
