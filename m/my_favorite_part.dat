500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I Won't Give Up" [...] {{was written}} by Jason Mraz and Michael Natter, while {{production}} was handled by Joe Chiccarelli. The acoustic folk ballad features a slower tempo and a sparse arrangement written in the key of E Major. Lyrically, it is a poignant ode to a long-lasting relationship, which Mraz says he won't give up on her whatever happens. [...] "Well, I won't give up on us/Even if the skies get rough/I'm giving you all my love/I'm still looking up," [...] he sings. It is guitar led with some additional vocal landscapes {{towards the end of}} the song. Mraz told Billboard magazine: [...] "That, to me, has always been <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of making music; the singing and what voices can do and the voices singing in harmony." [...] It is likely that the song was inspired by Mraz's relationship with singer-songwriter Tristan Prettyman. Mraz showcases his light and versatile range singing from B3 to G#5.|$|E
5000|$|Chad Bower of About.com said, [...] "I've watched all {{the episodes}} {{so far and}} have really enjoyed them. Ostronomy and Strigl have done the Talking Metal podcast for quite a while, and really know their metal." [...] He added, [...] "One of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the show is}} when John and Mark jam with various metal musicians like Exodus. The only part of the show that I dislike is the cheesy, {{annoying}} masked announcer".|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} is an excerpt from my book Wired for War: The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21 st Century (Penguin, 2009). This chapter explores how the world of science fiction actually helps to shape the very real human-built environment around us. Besides being one of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of the book to research and write, I thought it a particularly fun fit for the ACADIA audience, as it takes {{us back to the}} question of what originally inspires us...|$|R
5000|$|For this album, I {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} full songs, {{then went back}} and selected <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> - significant words/notes/syllables/etc - and left only those parts. I got to use my voice as an instrument and play with the different sounds it can make. I wrote melodies on bass, piano, strings, synthesizer, guitar, organ, and glockenspiel. I acted like my own choir. I programmed drums ... I kept writing and re-arranging, adding and taking away, until it sounded just how I wanted it to.|$|R
5000|$|... "That's <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> {{of being}} Valerie, that Spencer {{is at the}} end of her name. I'm so honored to be a part of a legacy family. It's {{incredibly}} humbling." [...] Sarpy on Valerie being a Spencer.|$|E
5000|$|Dimitrova {{once said}} of the role: [...] "Turandot may not be <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part,</b> but it shows off the voice to great advantage. The way the music is written, you need a voice like a trumpet to do it justice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Laigh Raines of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 4/5. [...] "The ending was {{probably}} <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part.</b> When the girls found {{a picture of}} Claire funneling on Spring Break in 1990 and Claire started screaming [...] "What is tagging!?!" [...] I was in stitches laughing. This is why parents don't need Facebook!!" ...|$|E
3000|$|... “As {{someone with}} very limited income, {{being part of}} Virtually Connecting has given me access to events that I {{otherwise}} would have no chance to attend. With this access comes pretty amazing content but even more comes invaluable exposure to the “human creator” that is behind behind every idea...One of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of Virtually Connecting is its casual immediacy and spontaneous insight. Seeing the kind of “unplugged” version of people I’ve previously only encountered in highly polished + edited perfection is so refreshing”. (Hammershaimb, 2016) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|One of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> about <b>my</b> job {{is helping}} to share music from {{relatively}} unknown acts with a larger audience. We went through a ton of songs for this scene - including songs from much bigger acts - but this song won the day, {{and it was one}} of the most popular song uses in the show's history. I still hear from people about this one, thanking me for helping them discover this band. Andy Gowman, How I Met Your Mother music supervisor ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{what some}} people at Forbes may think (and no, I’m not going to link to that {{particular}} article), summer time for professors is not all margaritas and six-week vacations*. Rather, {{for many of us}} who have primarily teaching appointments summer is the time to get research done. Case in point, the Drew lab (well most of us anyway) are headed to Fiji in just under a month and there is a LOT of work to get done. Preparing for an expedition has always been one of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of the trip. I love buying equipment, packing it up, and perhaps making internal references to that scene from Commando (except you know, with less automatic weapons). My office is getting crowded with dive gear, duffle bags, plug adaptors, and label makers...|$|R
50|$|Of course, {{even for}} all of the fretboard-ferocity, the drumwork on the album is {{probably}} <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part.</b> To my ears, the drumming is near flawless in composition and execution. Kevin McGuill, the man behind the tubs, lends a bit of his own personality to each and every breakdown that give it that extra little bit of badassery.|$|E
5000|$|So for {{the first}} game, {{everybody}} got paid. Elissa Steamer, myself Reynolds, whoever else was in it, we were laughing—we got like one check for royalties that was like US$190,000 or something. We were like what! This is amazing! ... I really love that Elissa Steamer got $190,000 out of it too laughs that’s <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Leigh Raines of TV Fanatic gave a 4.5/5 grade. About his {{favorite}} part of the show he said: [...] "Hands down <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of this episode was small, but perfect. When Haley walked in after a night out and thought Phil was reprimanding her but really he was practicing his speech to Mitchell, I thought she was so busted." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 3, 1998, Rhino Records reissued <b>My</b> <b>Favorite</b> Things as <b>part</b> of its Atlantic 50th Anniversary Jazz Gallery series. Included as bonus {{tracks were}} {{both sides of}} the [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] single, {{released}} as Atlantic 5012 in 1961.|$|R
500|$|... "Welcome Wagon" [...] {{sees the}} {{promotion}} of four actors to star billing, two of whom, Cindy [...] "Mac" [...] Mackenzie (Tina Majorino) and Don Lamb (Michael Muhney), had previously served as recurring characters, and two of whom, Stosh [...] "Piz" [...] Piznarski (Chris Lowell) and Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo) make their first appearance in the episode. Thomas revealed that Majorino {{was going to be}} a series regular the previous summer, a move that pleased many fans. Asked by Michael Ausiello whether Veronica and Mac would be roommates, Thomas replied that they would not, citing that such a living arrangement would prevent Veronica from having scenes with Keith. Nevertheless, Majorino commented that Mac and Veronica's relationship would continue to be close throughout the season. [...] "The friendship with Veronica is one of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of the entire show. It's great to have two really strong personalities getting along so well." ...|$|R
5000|$|IGN's Jenna Busch {{gave the}} episode a mixed review stating that [...] "the episode {{was really a}} bit cheesy" [...] and that she [...] "didn't like the framework". She did, however, praise several {{character}} moments including Melissa Rauch's portrayal of Bernadette saying, [...] "Bernadette was wonderful, as always. She's just so adorable, I could see her dating Rick Fox". Busch summed up by writing [...] "There were definitely funny moments here, but that zing was missing tonight". Jeffrey Kirkpatrick from TV Fanatic gave the episode a more positive review saying that [...] "The brilliance of the show, as I've said before, is when Penny and Sheldon interact, but it's even striking a chord each time Penny and Amy are thrown together". Kirkpatrick also praised Kaley Cuoco as Penny, he wrote: [...] "Kaley Cuoco is a very gifted comedienne, and her reactions to the nuttiness of the supposedly genius minds around her are always <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of every episode".|$|R
5000|$|Max Cavalera quoted on the Roadrunner website {{about his}} {{appreciation}} with Dave Peters, [...] "To work with David was a trip. The song's a full assault, {{and it feels}} really natural. It's got that uncompromising attitude." [...] He also had wishful thoughts about this song, [...] "It's the closest thing I've done to Pantera. Dave put some killer lyrics to the music. The fast part at the end is <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> on the album." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> was {{the energy}} of a crowd out to see some music. Nothing {{was going to stop}} them from seeing music. They were going to see all the music. That sheer {{determination}} converted me: I slipped into the crowd and immediately abandoned all pretense of maintaining an academic disinterest in the bands I'd only heard of peripherally. It swept away my staunch decision to maintain no bias when seeing a band I kind of love right now.|$|E
50|$|In another interview, McCready stated:I came in {{with that}} riff and {{we just kind of}} started jamming on it. It was a blast to play. The track that {{actually}} ended up on there, halfway through the song, Matt lost his headphones. He was going off. That's <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of that song, his crazy drum fills. I like the solo too, but the drum fills are insane how good they are. He's doing them without his headphones, just by watching the bass.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dancing Crazy" [...] is a mid-tempo pop rock {{track with}} pop and dance-pop lyrics dealing mainly with Cosgrove {{and her friends}} just going out, partying, {{and having a good}} time. The single is written in a common verse-chorus style. The song opens up with the first verse, and then transpires to bridge. After that, the first chorus is sung, {{followed}} by the second verse. The second bridge and chorus follow that. The third verse slows down, and sees Cosgrove singing the chorus in a slower melody. The final chorus then ensues. The song closes with the ending word [...] "Smack". During a Behind the Scenes look at the recording of the song, Cosgrove stated, [...] "Dancing Crazy is so fun. I just think about going out with my friends and going to parties and having a good time. of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of the song is when is when I say 'I know whatever happens, you will be right by my side'. It's just like, you know you'll always have your friends there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Harriet Cunningham of The Sydney Morning Herald highly praised the Saxophone Concerto, writing, [...] "Adams has thrown down the {{gauntlet}} with a solo line which demands speed, flexibility, musicality and, above all, stamina {{to keep going}} with barely a bar's rest. McAllister delivered, punching out the 'nervous bebop' sound (Adams' description) with manic intensity, like a Charlie Parker or Stan Getz solo sustained across 30 minutes." [...] She continued, [...] "But the most beautiful moments were all Adams, from the brain-addling cross-rhythms of the final movement to the delicate interplay between solo saxophone and clarinet." [...] The work was also lauded by Charles T. Downey of The Classical Review, who observed, [...] "Adams pushes the soloist to the edge with dizzying scales and disjunct leaping passages, often bouncing off the orchestra in syncopated or otherwise disorienting rhythmic patterns. ... All in all, Adam's Saxophone Concerto is a worthy addition to {{a small but growing}} repertory for this instrument." [...] Alexandra Gardner of NewMusicBox added, [...] "One of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> is the very opening of the piece, which sounds as if McAllister is pulling an entire orchestra out of the ground with his instrument alone." ...|$|R
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Laura Prudom {{noted that}} the episode [...] "proved to be an undeniably {{satisfying}} hour of television, deepening our understanding of Archie/Jiminy's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David's tragic romance. I don't know about you, but I really could watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she [...] "ragged on Robert Carlyle initially, his campy Rumpel is quickly becoming one of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of this show." [...] Tor.com's Teresa Jusino called Espenson's script [...] "so engaging" [...] because it deviated from the series' typical two-story format and [...] "incorporated a third, separate modern storyline" [...] that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket, in which [...] "each storyline got just enough attention." [...] She added that the episode's best parts were its [...] "intimate character moments, particularly the scenes between Archie/Jiminy and the boys in his life," [...] and attributed this to Espenson's strength as a writer. Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge's performance, as he [...] "navigated both Archie and Jiminy’s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an Art Talk with AMMO Magazine, Woolfalk says [...] "I create {{fictional worlds}} {{that are as}} {{immersive}} and full-scale as possible. I take elements {{from the real world}} and fold them into fantasy so that they are semi-recognizable to my viewers. <b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of building these places is when they start to almost make themselves. It gets really exciting when the logic of a project has become so clear that he project tells me what should happen next in the story." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 13 September 2012, it was {{announced}} that Goulding would embark on a nine-date tour across the United Kingdom.

5000|$|Writing for The Onions The A.V. Club, Noel Murray {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B", {{remarking}} that he [...] "enjoyed the episode overall—largely because it's {{just such a}} treat to have be [...] back in this world with these people—I'm not sure it was wholly successful {{in its attempt to}} play by the old rules." [...] He added that after the opening exchange between Olivia and Fauxlivia, the episode [...] "settles into a fairly typical" [...] Fringe formula involving a [...] "villain of the week" [...] and a freakish event.

5000|$|Daewon to me has {{the best}} board control I have ever seen anyone have. The things he can do with his skateboard.. {{technical}} abilities , the balance he has while going a million miles a hour is incredible. I’ve {{never seen anything like}} it. He still kills it, he’s still ripping and he’s been doing it also for 20 plus years at the highest level.

2500|$|In a March 2015 {{review of}} the Android app, Sarah Mitroff of CNET wrote that the new Material Design-inspired app was [...] "cleaner", with [...] "fewer distractions and {{colorful}} graphics that add a lot of personality to an otherwise dull app". She praised the Smart Suggestions feature for making new event creation easy, adding that [...] "Even {{after just a few}} letters, the app will suggest the most relevant appointments. This is a great feature for creating events that occur over and over, like a haircut or doctor's appointment, because the app remembers the phrases you use". She complimented the integration between Google Calendar and Gmail, writing that [...] "All of the relevant details are there, including confirmation numbers, links to the source email, even gate assignments for flights", and called it [...] "one of <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>parts</b> of the app", but also noted that the feature could be turned off. Furthermore, she praised [...] "the personal design touches that keep it from looking dull", namely the app offering visual illustrations for certain types of events, like a bucket of popcorn for movie events, or a visual map of the event location, as well as themed illustrations for different months, including [...] "a snow-covered mountain and a skier" [...] for December. Overall, she wrote that Google Calendar [...] "is a reliable, simple and playful alternative to your device's built-in calendar" [...] and that it is [...] "efficient and a breeze to use".|$|R
5000|$|<b>My</b> <b>favorite,</b> life-changing <b>parts</b> of “The Classical Style” are the blow-by-blow {{accounts}} of great passages {{of music in}} the wonkiest of terms. He delves into the exposition of Mozart's piano concerto in E-flat, K. 271, showing how each new idea fulfills various needs raised by the last, while leaving others still open: a continuous game of symmetry and asymmetry, expectation and fulfillment, hiding beneath the innocent surface. ... Charles insists on addressing the notes; but he shows us how behind the notes are felt needs, requirements, laws of how things ought to be—a whole system of judgment, of taste, of meaning. ... The book ... occasionally feels like a page-turner, a thriller: these three geniuses—Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven—building on each other’s discoveries, like scientists almost, creating unprecedented inventions, invoking a golden era of form meeting content.|$|R
5000|$|Two weeks later, an {{official}} statement was released via Entertainment Weekly, whereupon Swift expressed further excitement and anticipation: [...] "Ryan Adams {{is one of}} the artists who shaped my songwriting. <b>My</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part</b> of his style of creating music is his ability to bleed aching vulnerability into it, and that’s what he’s done with his cover project of my album 1989. When I first heard that Ryan was going to be covering my entire album, I couldn’t believe it. It’s such an honor that he would want to take my stories and lyrics and give them a new life. He’s gotten some of the best musicians together to record this album and if the clips he’s released are any indication, {{this is going to be}} something really special." [...] Taylor Swift ...|$|E
5000|$|Adele {{added the}} song {{to the set}} list on her second {{worldwide}} tour Adele Live. She also performed the song during the 2011 iTunes Festival in London. American singer Jeremih covered the song during Billboards Mashup Mondays. During an interview he said: [...] "I know you probably haven't heard this type of sound from my voice, so I just wanted to touch it. And see what I could do with it. ... The bridge is <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>part.</b> It showcased my vocals entirely, being so bare, just the keys and guitar. At first I was going to switch from keys to strings, {{but that was just}} too much." [...] Jessica Letkemann of Billboard praised Jeremih's tenor and his [...] "dusky-yet-feminine voice" [...] saying that he was [...] "centered on stripping the song's instrumentation down." [...] During the cover, Jeremih made references to Vanilla Ice, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury.|$|E
