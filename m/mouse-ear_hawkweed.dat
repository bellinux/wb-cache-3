Six kinds of clovers and vetches; and besides, dandelion, and rattle, and oxeye, and sorrel, and plantain, and buttercup, and a little stitchwort, and pignut, and <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> too, which nobody wants.|$|E
50|$|In Britain {{it appears}} in autumn (fall), {{particularly}} in frost free periods, and prefers sandy heaths, grassy clearings, or unimproved fields. It is often seen {{in the company of}} <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium pilosella).|$|E
50|$|The <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> {{contains}} umbelliferone, {{a compound}} similar to coumarin and a known antibiotic against brucellosis, {{as well as}} a frequent active compound in sunscreen lotions. The plant is also a potent diuretic.|$|E
50|$|Shetland <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> (Pilosella flagellaris subsp. bicapitata) is similar, but has two flowers per leaf stalk. It {{is found}} in the Shetland Islands only, on rocky coastal grassland. It flowers from May to August.|$|E
50|$|The grass {{around the}} burial mounds is of {{considerable}} age. It includes {{species such as}} bird's-foot trefoil, <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> harebells, whitlow grass, and slender clover, which are {{not found in the}} more modern grasslands nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{unimproved}} grassland {{consists of}} two main types. There is short grazed limestone grassland and taller neutral grassland. The former is herb rich. These include Devil's bit Scabious, Burnet Saxifrage, <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>Hawkweed</b> and Lady's Bedstraw.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{vegetation}} {{at the site}} is herb-rich grassland over limestone. With about 5 grass species, 2 sedges and 20 broad-leaved herbs and allows a rich insect fauna to maintain itself. Grasses found include Quaking-grass, Crested Dog's-tail, Sheep's- fescue, Downy Oat-grass and Yellow Oat-grass. Amongst these grasses is <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>Hawkweed,</b> Wild Thyme, Bird's-foot-trefoil, Lady's Bedstraw, Carline Thistle, Mountain Everlasting, Purging Flax and Eyebright.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} flora {{is made up}} of a {{wide range}} of limestone-loving plants which include field scabious, lady's bedstraw, common bird's-foot-trefoil and oxeye daisy. Various colour-forms of greater knapweed may be found as well as common twayblade. Cowslips bloom in the spring. White campion, common toadflax and <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> are also supported. Common cornsalad may also be found which is becoming increasingly rare.|$|E
50|$|Hieracium pilosella (syn. Pilosella officinarum), {{known as}} <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> is a yellow-flowered species of {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} daisy family Asteraceae, native to Europe and northern Asia. It produces single, lemon-coloured inflorescences. It is an allelopathic plant. Like most hawkweed species, it is highly variable {{and is a member}} of a species complex of several dozens of subspecies and hundreds of varieties and forms.|$|E
50|$|Other grasses {{that are}} {{frequent}} in the sward include meadow oat-grass, Avenula pratensis, quaking grass, Briza media, sheep's fescue, Festuca ovina, and crested hairgrass, Koeleria macrantha. There {{is a rich}} variety of herbs, including rock-rose, Helianthemum nummularium, glaucous sedge, Carex flacca, spring sedge, C. caryophyllea, and <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> Pilosella officinarum, and a small population of purple milk-vetch, Astragalus danicus, a local rarity on magnesian limestone.|$|E
50|$|A further {{distinctive}} {{habitat is}} provided by an area of gravel exposed by historic sand extraction, and on which grows wild thyme (Thymus praecox), common stork's-bill (Erodium cicutarium), <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium pilosella) and common centaury (Centaurium erythraea) together with common bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common restharrow (Ononis repens), blue fleabane (Erigeron acer), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and fern-grass (Desmazeria rigida). The margin of this area supports viper's-bugloss (Echium vulgare) and bloody crane's-bill.|$|E
50|$|Hum is {{the growing}} place of many plant species, {{especially}} subalpine ones, {{the remains of the}} Pleistocene vegetation, like the hirsute rhododendron, yellow veronica, primula, <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> Clusius gentian, houseleek, pink, etc. On the sunny side and in light deciduous forests, thermophile plants adapted to dry grounds can be found, for example daphne, smoke tree, holy grass, sessile oak, Solomon's seal, stonecrop, heath and others. Beside these, the following members of the other flore do grow in this region: butcher's broom, the lily of Carniola, black hellebore, honeysuckle, hacquetia, cyclamen, euphorbia, milkwort, helleborine, hart's tongue fern, cranesbill redbrown and many others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> {{has become}} a common {{introduced}} invasive species in North America (where it is found in southern Canada and both north-east and north-west United States), and New Zealand. It is a level C noxious weed in the United States (with higher levels in the states of Washington and Oregon), and a weed in Quebec. It does not have special designations in other locations of Canada. It {{is known to be}} strongly invasive in New Zealand's tussock fields, where there are no native species of hawkweed, and biological control measures are being undertaken to control it and other hawkweed species.|$|E
50|$|The grasslands undergo {{periodic}} wildfires, and the paintbrush {{appears to}} thrive in this fire regime, possibly because fires clear out taller vegetation that would otherwise compete with it, or provide it nutrients in the ash. If the paintbrush is fire-adapted, it would experience negative effects from fire suppression efforts. Other threats to the species include habitat destruction during residential or other development, and encroachment from introduced plant species such as <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium pilosella), Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius), and oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare). Plants experience herbivory by wild animals, trampling by hikers, and losses when they are picked by wildflower enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|On anthills, and in {{the more}} {{disturbed}} turf that is especially {{a feature of the}} impact area, <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> (Hieracium pilosella) is abundant together with sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) and wild thyme. Annuals are also characteristic of this habitat, including common whitlowgrass (Erophila verna), rue-leaved saxifrage (Saxifraga tridactylites,) hairy rock-cress (Arabis hirsuta) and the nationally scarce dwarf mouse-ear (Cerastium pumilum) and fine-leaved sandwort (Minuartia hybrida). A very local community characterised by a lichen-rich turf (Cladonia species) and the broom moss (Dicranum scoparium) is found in some stabilised missile-impaction craters on the central ranges. This vegetation type is found elsewhere only on Porton Down SSSI and on the Brecklands.|$|E
50|$|The {{slopes of}} all three {{properties}} form {{one of the largest}} remaining areas of chalk grassland in the county and support a wide range of flowers and butterflies. Plants found in the grassland include autumn gentian, clustered bellflower, blue fleabane, vervain, common rock-rose, horseshoe vetch, kidney vetch, marjoram, yellow-wort, purging flax, wild carrot, chalk milkwort, stemless thistle, eyebright, <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> salad burnet, ragwort, wild thyme, hairy violet, squinancywort, hawkweed ox-tongue, common spotted orchid and pyramidal orchid. Scattered bands of hawthorn scrub provide shelter for insect life and several butterfly species can be found, including chalkhill blue, marbled white, adonis blue, grizzled skipper and dingy skipper.|$|E
50|$|The species {{occurs in}} {{different}} plant communities, most commonly in highly diverse Festuca ovina-Avenula pratensis grasslands that exist because of intense grazing by sheep or rabbits. These grasslands contain grasses, dicots, and mosses in different mixtures. The turf is short, continuous and consist of very small individual plants. Characteristic species {{that may be}} abundant in these grasslands in the UK include the grasses Sheep's fescue Festuca ovina, red fescue F. rubra, Quaking-grass Briza media, crested hair-grass Koeleria macrantha and Crested dog's-tail Cynosurus cristatus, the dicots ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, Small burnet Poterium sanguisorba ssp. sanguisorba, Common Bird's-foot Trefoil Lotus corniculatus, Common Cat's-ear Hypochaeris radicata, <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> Pilosella officinarum, Rough hawkbit Leontodon hispidus and Dwarf thistle Cirsium acaule, and the moss Pseudoscleropodium purum.|$|E
50|$|Woodnook Valley {{has been}} a SSSI since March 1986. It {{is an example of}} a {{calcareous}} grassland. On the site are two types of orchid - the early purple orchid, and the man orchid. There is also the carline thistle, the <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> harebell, glaucous sedge and the common centaury. Insect life is apparent when grassland plants are in flower. Garden bumblebees can be seen on field scabious and lycaenid butterflies typical of this habitat such as the small copper and common blue, and a variety of browns including meadow brown, gatekeeper and ringlet can also be seen. Raptors such as the kestrel, buzzard and red kite also inhabit the area, hunting small rodents and rabbits which inhabit the grassland.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a cost-benefit analysis of biological control of hieracium. In South Island high country areas, species of the introduced hieracium genus are problem weeds. <b>Mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed</b> and king devil hawkweed are among two of the most abundant tussock grassland species in some areas of the South Island run country. These species exclude other plants and reduce feed availability, so causing a loss of agricultural production. They also exclude native grassland species and represent a threat to conservation values. The analytical framework presented provides a useful tool for further analysis of the assumptions used and the issues involved in biological control...|$|E
40|$|The {{biology of}} the {{sympatric}} hoverXies Cheilosia urbana (Meigen) and Cheilosia psilophthalma (Becker) was studied at Delémont, Switzerland. Both species {{are associated with}} <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>hawkweed,</b> Hieracium pilosella L., in Central Europe and were chosen as potential biological control agents of alien invasive hawkweeds in New Zealand. Cheilosia urbana and C. psilophthalma are univol-tine species which overwinter in the pupal stage. Adults start emerging in early April and have a protandric emergence pattern. Gravid C. urbana and C. psilophthalma females were collected on Hieracium between 10 April and 16 May. Females of both species oviposit onto leaf axils of H. pilosella rosettes during April and May, but their larvae occupy diVerent feeding niches. Freshly hatched C. urbana larvae move into the soil and feed externally on the roots, creating small holes. Cheilosia psilophthalma larvae remain on the aerial plant parts to feed in leaf axils, rosette centers, stolon tips, and leaves. Fecundity was estimated by keeping Weld-collected females in small vials provided with food. Field-collected C. urbana females laid on average 74 eggs with a maximum of 184 eggs per female, C. psilophthalma females laid 54. 3 eggs with a maximum of 158 eggs. At 20 °C, C. urbana eggs hatch within Wve days, whereas C. psilophthalma eggs need four days. Both species have three larval instars. Mature C. urbana larvae pupate in the soil, {{very close to the}} surface, whereas C. psilophthalma larvae pupate on the soil surface. Two Phygadeuon spp. (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) were reared from puparia of C. urbana and C. psilophthalma, and a braconid from mummiWed C. psilophthalma larvae...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The rate of {{spread of}} <b>mouse-ear</b> <b>{{hawkweed}}</b> (Hieracium pilosella) patches, the effect of hawkweed on soil properties, and the nutrient content of hawkweed biomass was investigated on grazed unfertilised land on Glencairn Station (altitude 440 m, mean annual rainfall 500 – 600 mm) in the Mackenzie basin, southern South Island, New Zealand. Pallic soils (Typic Ustochrepts) under hawkweed patches and under surrounding herbfield were analysed for exchangeable cations, organic C and total N. Total nutrients in hawkweed and herbfield biomass were measured. Previous results showing lower topsoil pH and more organic C under hawkweed than under herbfield were confirmed. Soils under hawkweed had higher values of exchangeable Ca and Mg than soils under herbfield. The hawkweed patches had 85 % more biomass (herbage plus roots) per unit area than the surrounding herbfield, and hawkweed biomass contained about three times the Ca and K of the herbfield biomass. In each of two successive years hawkweed patches, which had initial diameters of 1 – 1. 2 m, increased their diameter c. 13 cm by expanding into the “halo ” of bare soil surrounding them. Mean patch area increase was 25 % per year. The halo soil contains less organic C and total N and has lower total exchangeable cations values compared to soils under hawkweed and herbfield. The halo, which is underlain by hawkweed roots, {{appears to be a}} zone in which nutrients are depleted to the benefit of the hawkweed patches. As patches grow in size, the advantage that the inferred nutrient depletion in the halo confers on hawkweed patches will become limited to patch margins...|$|E
