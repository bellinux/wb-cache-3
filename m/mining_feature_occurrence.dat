40|$|In {{response}} to recent {{state and federal}} legislative mandates, the Indiana State University Remote Sensing Laboratory (ISURSL) has initiated a research program applied to evaluation of coal strip <b>mine</b> <b>features</b> in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio using machine-assisted processing of Landsat MSS data. Specifically, two large strip mines in western Indiana were analyzed implementing both supervised and unsupervised non-parametric classification algorithms which were partially or totally developed at ISURSL. Nine classes of strip <b>mine</b> <b>features</b> were identified which included bare mine spoil, revegetated mine spoil, and water features in various physical states. An estimation of accuracy was made through comparison of the Landsat classification results with 1 / 30, 000 scale aerial photographs taken {{the same day as}} the Landsat pass. Class accuracies ranged from 73 % to 96 % with an overall accuracy of 85 %. The non-parametric approaches to classification used at ISURSL provide coal strip <b>mine</b> <b>feature</b> information of comparable quality to that generated by commonly used parametric classification systems, but they require as little as one-fourth the computer time for analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Software {{product line}} {{engineering}} is an efficient means {{to generate a}} set of tailored software products from a common implementa-tion. However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semiautomatic tool support—called variability mining—to support de-velopers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code. Variability mining combines prior work on concern location, reverse engineering, and variability-aware type systems, but is tailored specifically for the use in product lines. Our work pursues three technical goals: (1) we provide a consistency indicator based on a variability-aware type system, (2) we <b>mine</b> <b>features</b> at a fine level of granularity, and (3) we exploit domain knowledge {{about the relationship between}} features when available. With a quantitative study, we demonstrate that variability mining can efficiently support developers in locating features.

In this paper we present an extension to the Ondex data integration framework that uses text mining techniques over Medline abstracts as a method for accessing both these bodies of evidence in a consistent way. In an example use case, we apply our method to create a knowledge base of Arabidopsis proteins implicated in plant stress response and use various scoring metrics to identify key protein-stress associations.
