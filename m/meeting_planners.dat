A number of newly opened convention centers across the country had a cocktail lounge, which were in high demand by convention-goers and generated significant income.

DealCenter, LLC was established January 2008 though the online <b>meeting</b> <b>planner</b> has been designed and in use by Jaymie Scotto & Associates as an event planning product since 2005, pre-dating today’s social networking communities. The DealCenter platform is an easy and user-friendly way to see who else is attending or exhibiting an event, to search the list of attendees by relevant information (such as company name, product offering or area served etc.) and then to create one-on-one meetings that will be held on-site at the event. The DealCenter system is traditionally rolled out months before the show date, so attendees can pre-plan their meetings and attend the event with a scheduled timetable of targeted prospect, customer or partner meetings.|$|R
40|$|Just {{when many}} people thought they had become {{competent}} with creating presentations in MS PowerPoint, the rules are changing. This short paper looks {{at some of the}} important considerations that should be given to making virtual presentations using online conferencing applications. Pre-meeting testing is important as technical difficulties can still arise and waste meeting time. The absence of a face-to-face presenter means that lots of slides and movement within the presentation is recommended. Animation or the use of drawing tools can help to maintain the interest of participants. Meetings can easily cross multiple time zones adding to the difficulty of finding a mutually convenient time. A simple multi-time zone <b>meeting</b> <b>planner</b> is included. Online meetings and presentations often involve virtual teams. To be successful the special needs of virtual team members, particularly the need for a high level of trust in each other, needs to be recognised and addressed...|$|R
40|$|Generally people {{scheduling}} meetings {{can do so}} efficiently using software such as Lotus Notes or Microsoft Office, {{where the}} <b>meeting</b> <b>planner</b> has {{access to all the}} attendee’s free/busy information and can choose a time that accommodates the bulk of the attendees. This, however breaks down in situations where the planner needs to schedule multiple meetings with multiple groups of attendees with complex schedules. The traditional approach is to then just ignore existing schedules and force the attendees to deal with the consequences. An ideal system would try to minimize the impact of the new set of meetings on existing schedules taking into account a subset {{of a large number of}} possible constraints. The approach presented here assumes the model where most meetings are scheduled in the traditional manner, but a small subset of meetings would be computer scheduled, with explicit authorization to modify peoples schedule to achieve a solution that optimizes the objective, within the boundary of the constraints...|$|R

40|$|Grid {{cells in}} the entorhinal cortex encode the {{position}} of an animal in its environment using spatially periodic tuning curves of varying periodicity. Recent experiments established that these cells are functionally organized in discrete modules with uniform grid spacing. Here we develop a theory for efficient coding of position, which {{takes into account the}} temporal statistics of the animal's motion. The theory predicts a sharp decrease of module population sizes with grid spacing, in agreement with the trends seen in the experimental data. We identify a simple scheme for readout of the grid cell code by neural circuitry, that can match in accuracy the optimal Bayesian decoder of the spikes. This readout scheme requires persistence over varying timescales, ranging from ~ 1 ms to ~ 1 s, depending on the grid cell module. Our results suggest that the brain employs an efficient representation of position which takes advantage of the spatiotemporal statistics of the encoded variable, in similarity to the principles that govern early sensory coding.
