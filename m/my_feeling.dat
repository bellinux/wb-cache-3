Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|For her, {{feminism}} meant {{a completely}} new point of view: [...] "Feminism isn't an employment agency for women; it's an alternative way of ordering the social space, in which women are the prototype rather than men. It is based on collaboration rather than competition. As a youngster, I still remember <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> of joy that one could look at the earth differently. That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes." ...|$|E

One {{of them was}} a chapter that had been cut from the final draft of Women in the Shadows. She was invited to speak to the Mattachine Society in the early 1960s, but her husband's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll. She stated later, [...] "It began to be very painful. So every time I would start to reach out (to the lesbian/gay community), I would get struck down...In my own life, I couldn't operationalize (<b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> that gays should end the secrecy and take more pride in themselves and their lives).

500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all had gone by, but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because <b>my</b> <b>feeling</b> was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is a great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E

500|$|The Weinstein Company also heavily recast {{the film}} with bigger-name {{actors in the}} hopes of {{attracting}} a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly; and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much-smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy, and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed {{a large part of the}} film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting however, saying, [...] "At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. <b>My</b> <b>feeling</b> is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't think you need more than two, three celebrities– give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot." [...] Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors.|$|E
