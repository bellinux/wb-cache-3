40|$|From year 2015 on, Italian public {{universities}} will {{be obliged to}} prepare, approve and publish accrual financial statements. D. Lgs. 18 / 2012 and D. I. 19 / 2014, two Italian new laws, provide financial statement schemes, accounting postulates and valuation criteria, {{most of which are}} similar to those already being observed by private business entities. A material quantitative part of such financial statements assets is expected to match with properties and equipment figures, which, in turn, should determine significant amortization charges to the income account. The above new laws also provide for government grants to be accounted for as “deferred income” (whoever the supplier of the grants), that is in a way which is similar to the one prescribed by IAS 20 (par. 20. 24); one of the effects of this accounting standard being the one of sterilizing the economic impact of the amortization charges on the entity results. If such a consequence may be in line with the financial capital <b>maintenance</b> <b>principle</b> in the perspective of a business entity whose shareholders do not coincide with those who disbursed those grants, the same can’t be said for a public entity whose equity belongs to the same Government Institution from such grants come from.

40|$|Manufacturing {{industry}} spend a {{great deal}} of their capital on equipment maintenance for their production systems. Hence, the cost of improper maintenance management is something that the industry would like to avoid. Industrial maintenance activities are directly linked to the profitability of industries and affects the performance, dependability, and sustainability of production systems. Naturally, the equipment downtime directly affects the system performance, but the rippling effects (idle and blocked states of equipment) are also prime contributors to the inefficiency of production systems by constraining the flow of products in the production system. In addition to inefficiency, studies suggest that 30 % of the energy consumption in manufacturing industry is wasted on stand still equipment. Therefore, effective maintenance planning for the resources is an extremely important activity. The aim of this thesis is to create effective <b>maintenance</b> planning <b>principles</b> which will enable the production system to operate efficiently. Due to the discrete and complex nature of production systems, certain resources become critical that reduces system inefficiency the most. The focus of the thesis is to identify the critical resources and create continuous awareness of them in order to reduce its criticality through effective maintenance. The thesis identifies the critical resource of the production system that affects production efficiency the most. This criticality is identified by studying the gaps in current industrial state practices. Through this study, the purpose of establishing criticality from a holistic perspective is obtained to assist maintenance planning accordingly. The research methods performed include descriptive surveys, questionnaires, and structured and semi-structured interviews. Moreover, the gaps in current industrial state practices for maintenance planning of critical resources and the usage of criticality classification are also studied. In addition, solutions to reduce the criticality of these resources through maintenance planning are identified and tested using simulation studies of two automotive industrial cases. The reduction in criticality is shown by reducing the active period of critical resource and increasing its utilization. In order to achieve this solution, the <b>maintenance</b> planning <b>principles</b> used include throughput-critical resource identification, maintenance prioritization, and maintenance staff utilization. Reducing the criticality of these resources proved to increase the system throughput potential and further balance production lines. Applying these <b>maintenance</b> planning <b>principles</b> to industries has the potential for making production systems function more efficiently, which was shown through obtaining 5 % throughput increase on average in one of the case studies. However, effective maintenance planning requires continuous awareness of the critical resource, which requires robust decision support tools which constantly monitor the production system. Future work includes data-driven analysis for decision support tools for effective maintenance planning, which includes dynamic production system changes.

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} methodology for reviewing railway substation <b>maintenance</b> <b>principles</b> {{to determine their}} efficiency and optimization. Numerous maintenance methodologies are employed for different types of applications. Downtime of electrical equipment hinders rail operations and results in revenue loss. It is vital that maintenance departments of organizations participate {{in the development of}} the organization’s maintenance standards. Revenue loss due to downtime of machinery and equipment is undesirable for organizations seeking to advance financially. The proposed maintenance methodology utilizes lean <b>maintenance</b> <b>principles.</b> Lean maintenance aims to reduce time expended while conducting maintenance activities. This time expended is referred to as waste. The current maintenance approach is documented in order to determine which operations exhibit waste characteristics. Waste operations are reviewed with the main objective of eliminated non-value adding activities. These non-value adding activities are simplified or eliminated. This results in a shorter maintenance process. A shorter maintenance process allows the railway operator to increase the number of substation equipment maintained annually. This enhances operations as there is a reduction in downtime of operational equipment. The main objective of this research study is to find a simplified and defined maintenance approach which can be implemented by the railway operator and offer cost effective, time efficient and safety enhanced substation maintenance. This research explores the tools, techniques and philosophies implemented by Toyota and Ford in ensuring that the process does not exhibit waste. The results offer a recommendation on how to lean maintenance can be applied in South African traction substations in order to reduce the duration of maintenance...|$|E

With the aim to break the EV batteries’ bottleneck (e. g., cost, range anxiety, long waiting time) by focusing not on the battery but on the solution to charge it conveniently, different on-the-road-charging solutions have been found under active investigation. From a road infrastructure perspective, however, little attention has been given to the practical, physical roads where these charging solutions will be enabled. In reality, good performance of E-Road infrastructure in aspects such as robustness, durability, costeffectiveness will be crucial for the final success.

The Remaining Useful Lifetimes (RULs) of the components is frequently required to prognose systems. However, the availability of complex systems for productive tasks is often expressed in terms of RULs of functions and/or subsystems; those RULs have to bring information about the components. Indeed, the maintenance operators must know what components need maintenance actions in order to increase the RULs of the functions or subsystems, and consequently the availability of the complex systems for longer tasks or more productive tasks. This paper aims at defining a generic prognostic function of complex systems aiming at prognosing its functions and at enabling the isolation of components that needs maintenance actions. The proposed function requires knowledge about the system to be prognosed. The corresponding models are detailed.

40|$|The {{distribution}} by {{a company}} of its assets to its shareholders, whether they be {{in the form of}} cash or otherwise, ought to be carefully regulated by any legal system intent on protecting the interests of creditors and minority shareholders of the company. Until 1999 such protection was largely provided for by the <b>maintenance</b> of capital <b>principle.</b> This principle manifested itself in various ways, the most significant being that it was unlawful for a company to acquire its own shares or shares in its holding company, and the distribution of funds to shareholders other than those representing legally distributable profits usually required a court order. In 1999 this all changed with far-reaching amendments to the Companies Act 61 of 1973 (see the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999). The <b>maintenance</b> of capital <b>principle</b> was effectively abolished; companies were permitted to acquire their own shares and shares in their holding companies; and the distinction between profits and other funds of a company was removed.
