The usual searching protocols create huge burden on communications or cause long response time. Appropriate incentives are required to avoid free-riding and achieve e#cient cooperations in <b>message</b> <b>relaying.</b> We present an incentive mechanism that aims at solving both the e#ciency and incentive problems of <b>message</b> <b>relaying</b> for peer discovery.

Some analytical insights are given to the subgame perfect Nash equilibria (SPNE) and best response strategies of this game. An approximation approach is provided to calculate a symmetric SPNE. Experiments show that this incentive mechanism brings a system utility higher than in breadth-first search, and close to the optimal utility in a centralized system.

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to provide location-, topology-, and administrative-transparent grid computing for MPI applications, while hiding the physical details of computing platforms and heterogeneous networks from the application developers and users. To achieve this objective, we introduced a new resource allocation model, workflow structures to specify MPI applications involving multiple tasks, and <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> to enable communication across different networks. We developed the SGR framework, which integrates workflow scheduling, task grouping, and <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> services, while hiding resource allocation, heterogeneous networks, and decentralized resource management systems from application developers and users. The SGR system has been implemented on a Globus-enabled computing grid. We created a simulation environment to investigate our model and various schedulers. Using the findings from simulation, we implemented the SGR framework and tested the model’s implementation on a two-cluster grid. We observed that duplication can improve performance by more than 15 %, which matches our simulation results. Moreover, we evaluated our new <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> service for cross-site message passing. The test results indicate that although the SGR’s <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> service has some communication overhead, the system is scalable {{with respect to the}} number of processes and the message size.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the message {{delivery}} capacity problem in delay-constrained mobile sensor networks. The message delivery capacity specifies the maximum percentage of sensing messages {{that can be}} successfully delivered to sink nodes within a given time constraint. This captures the overall system capacity in terms of successful sensing message delivery. By taking full advantage of sensor mobility and rendezvous during senor node encounters, messages can be delivered to a sink node either directly or through relays by other sensor nodes. In this paper, for the first time, we present the delay-constrained message delivery capacity formulation in mobile sensor networks. The objective is to maximize the message delivery capacity subject to the delay and buffering constraints. We first identify a number of unique challenges involved in such systems including <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> and buffer replacement mechanisms, and we derive the capacity bound under perfect <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> and buffer replacement mechanisms. Due to an unrealistic assumption about the foreknowledge of sensor moving trajectories, we next proceed to propose a practical algorithm to approximate the maximal message delivery capacity based on current global network knowledge. Furthermore, a distributed algorithm is proposed to reduce the control overhead for information exchange. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms and examine their sensitivity with respect to delay constraints, buffer size and <b>message</b> <b>relay,</b> and replacement schemes...|$|E

40|$|Jump to: navigation, search Opportunities {{for digital}} {{communication}} are often limited due to impoverished resources or {{the expense of}} using established infrastructure. One possible solution {{involves the use of}} <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> over ad hoc, peer-to-peer communication channels. Wireless-enabled, mobile devices are quickly becoming commonplace, increasing the potential for interpersonal networking apart from infrastructure. In areas lacking infrastructure, mobile communication technologies can be affixed to vehicles and personnel. Such networks may never have a contemporaneous path between source and destination, instead making use of communication opportunities to form such paths asynchronously, one hop at a time. To minimize delay and enhance chances of delivery, routing techniques rely on mobility and <b>message</b> <b>relay</b> to move a message "closer " to its destination, with limited or no knowledge of global topology. Traditional network-layer protocols fail to accommodate such extreme conditions.
