25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

"Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me what you want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform".

[...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
