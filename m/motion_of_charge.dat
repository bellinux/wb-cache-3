5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
50|$|Johnson-Nyquist noise (sometimes thermal, Johnson or Nyquist noise) is unavoidable, and {{generated}} by the random thermal <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> carriers (usually electrons), inside an electrical conductor, which happens regardless of any applied voltage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> {{carriers}} in a superlattice {{is different}} from that in the individual layers: mobility of charge carriers can be enhanced, which is beneficial for high-frequency devices, and specific optical properties are used in semiconductor lasers.|$|E
50|$|Without any applied {{electric}} field, in a solid, electrons (or, in {{the case}} of semiconductors, both electrons and holes) move around randomly. Therefore, on average there will be no overall <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> carriers in any particular direction over time.|$|E

50|$|Charges (free or as a distribution) at {{rest will}} appear {{to remain at}} the same spatial {{position}} for some interval of time (as long as they're stationary). When they do move, this corresponds to changes in position, therefore the charges have velocity, and the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> constitutes an electric current. This means that charge density is related to time, while current density is related to space.|$|E
50|$|Diffusion {{current is}} a current in a {{semiconductor}} {{caused by the}} diffusion of charge carriers (holes and/or electrons). The drift current, by contrast, {{is due to the}} <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> carriers due to the force exerted on them by an electric field. Diffusion current can be in the same or opposite direction of a drift current. The diffusion current and drift current together are described by the drift-diffusion equation.|$|E

40|$|Different {{attempts}} have been made to explain the generation of the electric currents before an earthquake that take place in an earthquake preparation zone; in some of them the coseismic effects are also included. In this paper we discuss the possibility to construct a model of displacement current generation in an earthquake source zone which combines polarization processes and <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> dislocations. Such a process is associated with the transition from isotropic to stress-induced anisotropic properties in an earthquake source zone. Concurrently, we consider the conduction currents related to a high velocity <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charged</b> dislocations. Another approach related to an electrokinetic model of current generation is also briefly discussed...|$|R

50|$|In current, the {{positively}} charged particles called holes {{move with the}} electric field, whereas the negatively charged electrons move against the electric field. It is distinguished from diffusion current (manifested via thermal or density gradients), which results from the random Brownian <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> carriers independent of electrical stimulus.If an electric field is applied to an electron existing in free space, it will accelerate the electron {{in a straight line}} from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the applied voltage. But this does not happen in the case of electrons available in good conductors. Good conductors have plenty of free electrons moving randomly in between the fixed positive ion cores. This random movement of electrons in a straight line is known as drift current. Drift current also depends on the mobility of charge carriers in the respective conducting medium.|$|E

30|$|Equations (1) and (2) {{imply that}} {{understanding}} the ring current {{is equivalent to}} understand the phase space density of the charged particles.

30|$|In addition, it {{is worth}} to mention the current noise in {{solid-state}} nanopores, which involves the 1 /f-type excess noise and other contributions [45, 46]. The 1 /f-type noise {{is related to the}} fluctuation of charge carriers. As the voltage increases, the accelerated <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> carries will cause local ion aggregation in the nanopore, resulting in the increase of 1 /f-type excess noise.
