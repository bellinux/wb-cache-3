However, a general framework that allows us to quantify the benefit of PHM depending on these metrics is still lacking. We propose a general, time-variant, analytical model that conservatively evaluates the increase in system availability achievable when a component is equipped with a PHM system of known performance metrics. The availability model builds on metrics of literature and is applicable to different contexts. A simulated case study is presented concerning crack propagation in a mechanical component.

In this paper {{we present a}} two-phase control strategy for robust balance maintenance under a force disturbance. The first phase, called the reflex phase, is designed to withstand the immediate effect of the force. The second phase is the recovery phase where the system is steered back to a statically stable “home ” posture. The reflex control law employs angular momentum and is characterized by its counter-intuitive quality of “yielding ” to the disturbance. The recovery control employs a general scheme of seeking to maximize the potential energy and is robust to local ground surface feature.

40|$|Abstract — Sharing huge {{databases}} in {{distributed systems}} is inherently difficult. As {{the amount of}} stored data increases, data localization techniques become no longer sufficient. A practical approach is to rely on compact database summaries rather than raw database records, whose access is costly in large distributed systems. In this paper, we propose PeerSum, a new service for managing summaries over shared data in large P 2 P and Grid applications. Our summaries are synthetic, multidimensional views with two main virtues. First, they can be directly queried and used to approximately answer a query without exploring the original data. Second, as semantic indexes, they support locating relevant nodes based on data content. Our main contribution is to define a summary model for P 2 P systems, and the algorithms for summary management. Our performance evaluation shows {{that the cost of}} query routing is minimized, while incurring a low cost of summary <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Distributed systems, Database summarization I...|$|E

To define and know this characteristic of machine tools standard measuring procedures {{have been used}} for many years. Yet, others more advanced approaches and equipments, like laser measuring systems, are also available for measuring machine parameters like straightness of movements, repeatability, surfaces flatness, parallelism etc. This paper shows comparison of measuring results and measuring procedure between two different laser measuring systems, Damalini D 525 and Renishaw ML 10. Measurements are performed on DMU monoBlock 60, CNC universal milling machine. Same type of measurements, straightness measurement of main shaft movement in Y direction, is performed simultaneously by means of both of the laser systems. Results presented in this paper shows that there are differences in between measuring results as well as in between measuring procedures for selected lasers.

Resources, therefore, are allocated for operation and maintenance from commerical considerations rather than technical alone, necessitating the introduction of a commercial approach to analysis of reliabilty, efficiency, and maintenance criticality for power plants. These requirements suggest the need to introduce performance monitoring systems {{in the form of a}} single composite index encompassing the consequences of non-performance with respect to all these parameters and which can effectively respond to market demands. Such performance monitoring system is developed in the current paper.

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{fundamental}} operations in sensor net-works is convergecast which refers to the communication pattern in which data is collected from a set of sensor nodes and forwarded to a common end-point gateway, namely sink node, in the network. In case of multiple sinks within the network, the total load of the network has to be balanced among these sinks to minimize the problem of packet loss in the convergecast process in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) due to congestion and collisions near the sinks. In this paper, we present a novel cross-layered communication protocol for efficient data dissemination in multi-sink WSNs which is under consideration of SENSEI project. It basically combines network wide load balancing, clustering techniques and local routing optimizations with SENSEI architecture which make it efficient on both global and local level.

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose an {{operating}} conditions-based preventive maintenance (PM) approach for computer numerical control (CNC) turning machines. A CNC machine wears according to how much it is used and {{the conditions under which}} it is used. Higher power or production rates result in more wear and higher failure rates. This relationship between the operating conditions and maintenance requirements is usually overlooked in the literature. On CNC turning machines we can control the machining conditions such as cutting speed and feed rate, which in turn affect the PM requirements of the CNC machine. We provide a new model to link the PM decisions to the machining conditions selection decisions, so that these two decision-making problems can be solved together by considering their impact on each other. We establish that our proposed geometric programming model captures the related cost terms along with the technological restrictions of CNC machines. The proposed preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>index</b> function can be used to provide an intelligent CNC machine degradation assessment.

40|$|Abstract—To {{efficiently}} support tetherless {{applications in}} ad hoc wireless mobile computing networks, a judicious ad hoc routing protocol is needed. Much {{research has been}} done on designing ad hoc routing protocols and some well-known protocols are also being implemented in practical situations. However, one major imperfection in existing protocols is that the time-varying nature of the wireless channels among the mobile terminals is ignored, let alone exploited. This could be a severe design drawback because the varying channel quality can lead to very poor overall route quality in turn, resulting in low data throughput. Indeed, better performance could be achieved if a routing protocol dynamically changes the routes according to the channel conditions. In this paper, we first propose two channel adaptive routing protocols which work by using an adaptive channel coding and modulation scheme that allows a mobile terminal to dynamically adjust the data throughput via changing the amount of error protection incorporated. We then present a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the two classes of ad hoc routing protocols. Extensive simulation results indicate that channel adaptive ad hoc routing protocols are more efficient in that shorter delays and higher rates are achieved, at the expense of a higher overhead in route set-up and <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Mobile computing, ad hoc networks, routing protocols, on-demand routing, channel adaptation. ...|$|E

We empirically investigate the performance of data reduction on totally 600, 000 bug reports of two large open source projects, namely Eclipse and Mozilla.

We develop novel techniques for reducing <b>index</b> <b>maintenance</b> in multiversion databases, so that indexes can be used effectively for analytical queries over current data without being a heavy burden on transaction throughput. To achieve this end, we re-design persistent index data structures in the storage hierarchy to employ an extra level of indirection. The indirection level is stored on solid state disks that can support very fast random I/Os, so that traversing the extra level of indirection incurs a relatively small overhead. The extra level of indirection dramatically reduces the number of magnetic disk I/Os that are needed for index updates, and localizes <b>maintenance</b> to <b>indexes</b> on updated attributes. Further, we batch insertions within the indirection layer {{in order to reduce}} physical disk I/Os for indexing new records. By reducing the <b>index</b> <b>maintenance</b> overhead on transactions, we enable operational data stores to create more indexes to support queries. We have developed a prototype of our indirection proposal by extending the widely used Generalized Search Tree (GiST) open-source project, which is also employed in PostgreSQL.

40|$|Abstract- Throughout the years, the {{importance}} of the maintenance management system and their functions has grown rapidly. Cooling towers are used in many process applications in the various industries. Reliability of these towers is crucial. In many cases, redundant towers are installed to ensure a process will not have to be stopped due to a cooling tower failure. The most prevalent cause of cooling tower downtime is failure of bearings, improper water distribution by the nozzles, fan unbalance, failure of the gearbox or associated mechanical components, such as the driveshaft or disc couplings etc. Further, the elimination of these components reduces the losses in the drive system and offers the possibility for improved overall system efficiency. To succeed in the ever-growing competitive global marketplace, it is vital for modem industries to reduce costs related to asset maintenance, repair and replacement, which directly affects the cost of manufactured products. Unplanned downtime results in high maintenance costs. Consequently, improving maintenance efficiency provides substantial benefits to equipments. Cooling tower maintenance considering future uncertainties could improve the efficiencies of the heat transfer processes and as a result, improve the performance of the cooling tower. As a step towards incorporating uncertainties in the cooling tower consideration, this paper presents a cooling tower maintenance methodology including cooling tower trouble shooting with their causes and remedies, preventive maintenance schedule for cooling tower, optimization of cooling tower overhauling activity in maintenance and monitoring technologies. The methodology has been presented, allows the easy maintenance and monitoring of cooling tower with the use of new technology in drive assembly.

40|$|The private {{insurance}} industry recorded above-average premium growth rates in 1999. In contrast to previous years, all insurance lines {{contributed to the}} growth. Premiums grew by almost one fifth in the life sector. Projections by the Austrian Insurance Association indicate that the trend should continue in 2000. An expected total growth rate of premiums by 6. 6 percent will be mostly achieved by life insurance (+ 12. 8 percent), while the two other lines will only have increases of just below 2 percent. The projection reflects international trends which point at rising market concentration and competitive pressure for non-life insurance lines. The development of insurance prices within {{the consumer price index}} leads to the impression that the single market effect did not continue to work in 1999. Nevertheless, such a conclusion should be viewed with caution, considering the difficulties of properly measuring prices for services. The average premium for third-party automobile insurance declined by 22. 3 percent in the period from the launch of the single market in 1994 until 1999, {{in spite of the fact}} that the sum insured per car and the cost of repair and <b>maintenance</b> <b>index</b> published by the Austrian Insurance Association both rose substantially over the same period. The price effect between 1994 and 1999 is distorted by about 5 ½ percentage points, because of the higher proportion of bonus drivers. Accordingly, by a rough estimate some 17 percentage points of the premium reduction are due to the actual single market effect. As a consequence, the result from insurance activity in the property and liability line has deteriorated even further. Insurers have been able to compensate this only by an above-average financial result.

40|$|The widely {{application}} of XML has increasingly required high security. XML security confronts some challenges that are strong relating to its features. XML data integrity needs to protect element location information and contextreferential meaning {{as well as}} data content integrity under fine-grained security situations. XML data authentication must satisfy a signing process under a dependent and independent multi-signature generation scenario. When several different sections are encrypted within the XML data, it cannot query the encrypted contents without decrypting the encrypted portions. The technologies relating to XML security demand further development. This thesis aims to improve XML security relative technologies, and make them more practicable and secure. A novel revocation information validation approach for X. 509 certificate is proposed based on the XML digital signature technology. This approach reduces the complexity of XKMS or PKI systems because it eliminates the requirement for additional revocation checking from XKMS or CA. The communication burden between server and client could be alleviated. The thesis presents the context-referential integrity for XML data. An integrity solution for XML data is also proposed based on the concatenated hash function. The integrity model proposed not only ensures XML data content integrity, but also protects the structure integrity and elements’ context relationship within an XML data. If this model is integrated into XML signature technology, the signature cannot be copied to another document still keeping valid. A new series-parallel XML multi-signature scheme is proposed. The presented scheme is a mixed order specified XML multi-signature scheme according to a dependent and independent signing process. Using presented XML data integrity-checking pool to provide integrity-checking for decomposed XML data, it makes signing XPath expression practicable, rather than signing XML data itself. A new labeling scheme for encrypted XML data is presented to improve the efficiency of index information maintenance which is applied to support encrypted XML data query processing. The proposed labelling scheme makes <b>maintenance</b> <b>index</b> information more efficient, and {{it is easy to}} update XML data with decreasing the number of affected nodes to the lowest. In order to protect structural information for encrypted XML data, the encrypted nodes are removed from original XML data, and structural information is hidden.

It speaks, first of all, variations in EES: a lifetime of an appreciable unit of plants EES (50 ÷ 60) % exceeds rated, {{that has led to}} essential body height of working costs. It in turn has inevitably led to variation of the strategy of maintenance. If earlier, in conditions of the regulated scheduled <b>maintenance,</b> <b>indexes</b> of reliability were used mainly for a solution of design problems, and was to evaluate enough some averaged value of indexes of reliability and reparability today the principal direction of probing of reliability of plants EES has a little varied. The strategy of realization of scheduled maintenances more and more is guided by real availability index of product of particular plants. More and more actual the possibility becomes to sample most (least) safe plants. Alongside with indexes of reliability and reparability, the assessment of indexes of longevity since these indexes characterize availability index of product of the equipment is actual. The methodology of problem solving of an assessment and comparison o...|$|R
