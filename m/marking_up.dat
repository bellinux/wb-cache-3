25|$|<b>Marking</b> <b>Up</b> The Dream, Story Six in the How Democracy Works Now series, {{focuses on}} the heated 2003 markup in The Senate Judiciary Committee, {{contrasting}} optimistic supporters who viewed The DREAM Act as a small bi-partisan bill that would help children, with opponents who saw the legislation as thinly-veiled amnesty. Also presented in the film are the rallies and demonstrations from illegal immigrant students who would benefit from the DREAM Act. The film opens with demonstration by some illegal high-school students as they stage a mock graduation ceremony on the U.S. Capitol lawn.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} Brooks' own tradition, each ticket sold {{for the tour}} is the same price, {{regardless}} of location in the venue. An issue that arose beginning with the first concerts on the tour has been high ticket resale prices. For example, tickets for the seven-show residency in Dallas were being resold online for an average price 21% higher than face value. Because of Ticketmaster's anti-resale policies, Brooks chose the company to be the official ticket sales company for the tour. Despite the optimism {{for a lack of}} extreme resale prices, Ticketmaster's partner resale sites and services began allowing individuals to sell marked up tickets anyway. In the first weeks of the tour, Atlanta tickets were posted for sale on TicketsNow for as much as nearly 470% higher than face value (i.e. a $71.50 ticket being sold for $405). Brooks, a long-time proponent of banning increased price ticket resales, called out those <b>marking</b> <b>up</b> ticket prices, saying his ultimate goal is making concerts affordable regardless of seat location.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> tend to be pro {{cyclical}} in manufacturing and counter cyclical in market services. However, at the sectoral level value added <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> may be misinterpreted if intermediate input variations are ignored. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} the manufacturing sectors, although less so in that of market services. In fact, this is the main explanation for the (pro cyclical) behaviour of relative services manufacturing <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> which, in turn, play an important role in their relative price dynamics of these sectors. In addition, fluctuations in demand also play a role. In the case of services, <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend negatively on current output and positively on future output; hence in periods when demand is recovering (declining) <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> widen (narrow). By contrast, in the manufacturing sectors <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> depend positively on the current output gap and negatively on future expected demand, i. e. when demand is recovering (declining) current <b>mark</b> <b>ups</b> fall (rise). sectoral mark-ups, gross output, aggregation, intermediate inputs...|$|R

2500|$|And so the New Oxford English Dictionary (NOED) project began. In the United States, {{more than}} 120 typists of the International Computaprint Corporation (now Reed Tech) started keying in over 350,000,000 characters, their work checked by 55 proof-readers in England. Retyping the text alone was not sufficient; all the {{information}} represented by the complex typography of the original dictionary had to be retained, which was done by <b>marking</b> <b>up</b> the content in SGML. A specialized search engine and display software were also needed to access it. Under a 1985 agreement, some of this software work was done at the University of Waterloo, Canada, at the Centre for the New Oxford English Dictionary, led by Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet; this search technology {{went on to become}} the basis for the Open Text Corporation. Computer hardware, database and other software, development managers, and programmers for the project were donated by the British subsidiary of IBM; the colour syntax-directed editor for the project, , was written by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM. The University of Waterloo, in Canada, volunteered to design the database. A. Walton Litz, an English professor at Princeton University who served on the Oxford University Press advisory council, was quoted in Time as saying [...] "I've never been associated with a project, I've never even heard of a project, that was so incredibly complicated and that met every deadline." ...|$|E

Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was <b>marking</b> <b>up</b> that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open.|$|E

Under imperfect competition in the two sectors, relative prices depend on both productivity and mark-ups. We test this implication using a panel of sectors for the seven major OECD countries. The empirical evidence suggests that rela-tive price movements are well explained by relative productivity and variations in <b>mark</b> <b>ups.</b> Unlike the original Balassa-Samuelson model, aggregate demand could affect the real exchange rate by changing the <b>mark</b> <b>ups.</b> Empirical results show that aggregate demand fluctuations lead to changes on the <b>mark</b> <b>ups...</b>|$|R
