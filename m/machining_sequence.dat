40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an increasing demand of Top-Spinning (T-S) {{has resulted in}} the production of high quantity of T-S. Currently, the production of T-S is very low and not up to the required demand. This is due to the old machine used as well as an old method in the manufacturing of T-S, which lead to the longer time taken compared to the new technology found in this project. The cardinal purpose of this project is to identify the <b>machining</b> <b>sequence</b> with the selection of a suitable tool and reducing machining cycle time with the use of CNC Lathe for manufacturing T-S. In ensuring a successful and optimum result of the project, manufacturing T-S with CNC Lathe will be assisted by Mathematisch Technishe software Entwicklung (MTS) and Master CAM simulation to determine <b>machining</b> <b>sequence,</b> cutting tools, technology parameters and machining cycle time. The data extracted from MTS, and CAD/CAM simulation process will then be used for manufacturing T-S on CNC Lathe technology. This project emphasizes on the importance of determining <b>machining</b> <b>sequence,</b> cutting tools to manufacture T-S in any shape available and also resolving machining cycle time. The result from MTS and CAD/CAM with three analyses of <b>machining</b> <b>sequence,</b> cutting tool and technology parameters will be used to proceed on CNC Lathe. Finally, with the utilization of the data extracted from MTS software, and CAD/CAM simulation has successfully impacted the reduction on overall machining cycle time while producing T-S...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of single <b>machine</b> <b>sequencing</b> research has assumed {{that only one}} objective is to be minimized. The research involving multiple objectives has been limited. Recent studies have shown, however, that production managers often consider multiple objectives when making scheduling decisions. The primary reason {{for the lack of}} literature on multiple objective scheduling is the additional complexity encountered when determining the 'best' solution. Although a host of general multiple objective optimization procedures exists, the vast majority cannot be efficiently applied to the multiple objective single <b>machine</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem. Most procedures assume continuous decision variables, whereas the single <b>machine</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem requires integer variables. While some of these procedures could be altered to directly address integer models, the overall combinatorial nature of most sequencing problems limits the applicability to sequencing. A comprehensive review of the published literature on the multiple objective single <b>machine</b> <b>sequencing</b> problem is presented in this paper. A framework is presented to categorize each piece of research. Gaps in the body of research are indicated and recommendations are made for areas of future research. multi-criteria single machine production scheduling...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{manufacturing}} {{of aluminium}} alloy structural aerospace parts involves multiple steps, the principal ones being the forming (rolling, forging etc.), the heat treatments and the machining. During this last step, the final {{geometry of the}} part is obtained. Before machining, the workpiece has therefore undergone several manufacturing steps resulting in unequal plastic deformation and metallurgical changes which are both sources of residual stresses. On large and complex aluminium alloy aeronautical parts, up to 90 % of the initial workpiece volume can be removed by machining. During machining, the mechanical equilibrium of the part is in constant evolution due to the redistribution of the initial residual stresses. The residual stress redistribution is {{the main cause of}} workpiece deflections during machining as well as of post-machining distortion (after unclamping). Both can lead to the non-conformity of the part with the geometrical and dimensional tolerance specifications and therefore to a rejection of the part or to additional conforming steps. In order to improve the machining accuracy and the robustness of the process, the effect of the residual stresses has to be considered for the definition of the machining process plan. In this paper, a specific numerical tool [2] allowing to predict workpiece deflections during machining and post-machining distortion is used to study the influence of the <b>machining</b> <b>sequence</b> on the machining quality in taking into consideration the initial residual stresses. A first machining process plan defined as the reference case is simulated. Simulation results are then compared with experimental ones showing the feasibility to use the developed tool to predict the machining quality depending on the initial residual stresses, the fixture layout and the <b>machining</b> <b>sequence.</b> Using the computational tool, a method to optimise the machining quality depending on the initial workpiece and on the <b>machining</b> <b>sequence</b> is presented. A machining process plan allowing to respect the tolerance specifications is then defined. This demonstrates the feasibility to adapt and to optimise the machining process plan to ensure conformity of the part with the tolerance specifications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In a feature-based {{representation}} model, a set {{of features}} {{can be used in}} both design representation and process planning to integrate design and manufacturing. Process planning activities such as generation of machining tool path, planning of machining operations, sequencing of machining operations, and selection of machining machines can be executed using a feature-based approach. In a typical process planning scheme, the machining operations for producing a product are planned and arranged to be performed in a single manufacturing plant. However, in a multi-plant collaborative manufacturing environment in a global supply chain, a product can be designed and manufactured at different plants at multiple locations. In this research, a feature-based multi-plant process planning model is presented. A feature represents a machined volume that needs to be removed by certain machining operations to produce a portion of the product. A set of sequenced features represents a <b>machining</b> <b>sequence</b> for producing the part. A mathemati cal model is formulated to evaluate all the feasible machining sequences. The objective attempts to find the optimized multi-plant <b>machining</b> <b>sequence</b> with an aim of the minimizing the total manufacturing operation cost. As a result, the multiple machining sequences can be evaluated and the machining operations are assigned to the most suitable plants in a multi-plant collaborative manufacturing system...|$|E

The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic is demonstrated through the solutions of two typical layout design problems taken from the literature. Subsequently, a number of additional problems are solved and their results are compared with the results applying existing methods.

An approach based on CBR was applied during product development in [35], and it effectively reduced lead time and improved the problem-solving capabilities.

30|$|For {{thin-walled}} parts, uniform allowance to each machining {{surface is}} allocated {{by the traditional}} machining method. Considering the sequence of the adjacent machining features, it may cause poor stiffness for some side walls due to a minor wall thickness, which may cause the deformation of the final formed parts to be large, or deduce machining efficiency for some machining features due to too thick remains. In order to address this issue, a non-uniform allowance allocation method based on interim state stiffness of machining features for the finishing of thin-walled structural parts is proposed in this paper. In this method, the interim state model of machining features is constructed according to the <b>machining</b> <b>sequence</b> of the parts, and the stiffness of the side wall is taken as the evaluation index to allocate reasonable allowance value to the corresponding machining surface to ensure the stiffness requirement of the parts in the machining process.
