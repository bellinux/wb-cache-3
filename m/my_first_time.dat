Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird.

500|$|Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition {{received}} positive reviews. Game Informers Matt Helgeson {{considered the}} updated graphics at native 1080p resolution {{as a good}} addition to the core Tomb Raider experience. He cited mostly negligible {{differences between the two}} versions, but noted a smoother frame-rate on the PS4 version. The Escapist's Jim Sterling was less receptive to the Definitive Edition; he praised the visual improvements, but felt that nominal content additions to the single-player experience and the game's price point made it difficult to recommend to players outside of those who had not played the original version. GameZone's Matt Liebl gave Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition a 9/10, stating [...] "Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> playing Crystal Dynamics' reboot, so I can definitely recommend it for newcomers. As for whether or not it's worth paying full price for the same game with upgraded graphics, well that's something you need to decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Alaphilippe {{said after}} the race {{that he had not}} been {{intending}} to go for the sprint {{at the end of the}} race; the team's plan was to set up Kwiatkowski. He started sprinting only after his directeur sportif shouted [...] "go, go" [...] at him over the radio. Alaphilippe said that he had briefly thought that he was going to win the sprint; his second-place finish was, however, the most important result of his career so far. He said, [...] "For <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> performance here, I can't help but be pleased." [...] Albasini's third place was better than his team had expected: before the race, 's directeur sportif Matt White had not expected him to be as strong because of the addition of the extra climb. Albasini himself also described the race as [...] "a lot tenser"; he also said that Valverde was [...] "one of the strongest guys in those kinds of finishes".|$|E
500|$|All {{involved}} {{contend that}} the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, {{which led to a}} permanent divorce. [...] "I had no idea that I would be snapped out of the picture. I thought it was cruel and impersonal," [...] said Betts. Allman was finally sober and felt more miserable shows with Betts would be a waste of time. Betts later received a cash settlement, which is subject to a confidentiality agreement; he went on to record new music with a new band. Jimmy Herring joined the band for the summer tour, where the band fought negative press; fans contended that attending shows by an Allman Brothers Band without Betts was pointless. Herring exited shortly after the tour, as he felt guilty that he would replace Betts. That August, former bassist Allen Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York. Warren Haynes set up a benefit show for his former bandmate, which featured the Allman Brothers Band. With Derek Trucks unavailable, he sat in for the set. In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band for their Beacon run: [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> with the band in four years and it was very comfortable," [...] he remarked.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} October 2003, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York. It was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter, who revealed that the concept was setting Spears and Madonna apart, hence Spears wore a black outfit whereas Madonna sported a white suit. Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] It was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> doing a collaboration and I got Madonna. It's really interesting to see the two different styles together." [...] Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So {{it was a challenge}} to kind of bring both of the worlds together. I wanted it to {{be a bit of a}} cat-and-mouse sort of game and a little bit of a foreplay between Britney and Madonna and just sort of tease the audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 28, 2017 a {{deal was}} {{finalized}} for Ortiz's return bout against Mexican boxer Saul Corral (24-9, 15 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round fight {{to take place}} at the Rabobank Theater in Bakersfield, California on July 30 and would headline a Premier Boxing Champions card. Ortiz made a successful comeback with a fourth round stoppage win over Corral. Ortiz stalked Corral from the opening round landing straight lefts and hooks, although Corral fought back, Ortiz did enough to win the early rounds. In round 3, referee Jack Reiss docked a point of Corral after warning him for holding Ortiz's left arm. In round 4, Ortiz landed a left hand that sent Corral down. He beat the count, but Ortiz pounced, forcing the referee to stop the fight after 1 minute and 26 seconds. Ortiz kept his options open when speaking in the post fight, “There are a lot of names out there in the welterweight division. At this point I’m going to let my team guide me, because I’ll always be ready for anybody.” He also praised Corral, “Corral is a great fighter who hits hard and I definitely felt it.Top of the line boxers like myself, we hang in there and we perform {{to the best of our}} abilities. It was <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> back in a while and it’s just the beginning.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Boyzone manager Louis Walsh {{is quoted}} as saying: [...] "We're all {{absolutely}} devastated. I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's happened yet. I only heard after The X Factor (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other this week. He was a great man." [...] Walsh {{dropped out of the}} live results show of The X Factor on 11 October 2009 {{as a direct result of}} Gately's death. Simon Cowell addressed the issue at the start of the programme. He said: [...] "This is really, really tragic news I want to send out my condolences to the family, our thoughts are with Louis". That edition of the show attracted an [...] "absolutely huge" [...] audience which was said to have been seeking updates on the singer's death. Walsh also was absent from the second week of The X Factor which coincided with Gately's funeral,—later commenting: [...] "I never want to watch the show at home again. I've been shouting at the TV all night"—at which Walsh was too upset to speak. <b>My</b> <b>First</b> <b>Time,</b> a stage show which was set to star bandmember Keith Duffy, was cancelled entirely.

6000|$|In the {{assembly}} {{where he was}} one day to rank among the most powerful orators ever inscribed upon its golden roll, he first opened his lips in a few words on a Newark petition (April 30) and shortly after (May 21) he spoke {{two or three minutes}} on an Edinburgh petition. A little later the question of slavery, where he knew every inch of the ground, brought him to a serious ordeal. In May, Stanley as colonial secretary introduced the proposals of the government for the gradual abolition of colonial slavery. Abolition was to be preceded by an intermediate stage, designated as apprenticeship, to last for twelve years; and the planters were to be helped through the difficulties of the transition by a loan of fifteen millions. In the course of the proceedings, the intermediate period was shortened from twelve years to seven, and the loan of fifteen millions was transformed into a free gift of twenty. To this scheme John Gladstone, whose indomitable energy made him the leading spirit of the West Indian interest, was consistently opposed, and he naturally became the mark of abolitionist attack. The occasion of Mr. Gladstone's first speech was an attack by Lord Howick on the manager of John Gladstone's Demerara estates, whom he denounced as 'the murderer of slaves,'--an attack made without notice to the two sons of the incriminated proprietor sitting in front of him. He declared that the slaves on the Vreedenhoop sugar plantations were systematically worked to death in order to increase the crop. Mr. Gladstone tried in vain to catch the eye of the Chairman on May 30, and the next day he wished to speak but saw no good opportunity. 'The emotions through which one passes, at least through which I pass, in anticipating such an effort as this, are painful and humiliating. The utter prostration and depression of spirit; the deep sincerity, the burdensome and overpowering reality of the feeling of mere feebleness and incapacity, felt in the inmost heart, yet not to find relief by expression, because the expression of such things goes for affectation,--these things I am unequal to describe, yet I have experienced them now.' On June 3, the chance came. Here is his story of the day: 'Began le miei Prigioni. West India meeting of members at one at Lord Sandon's. Resolutions discussed and agreed upon; ... dined early. Re-arranged my notes for the debate. Rode. House 5 to 1. Spoke <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> for 50 minutes. My leading desire was to benefit the cause of those who are now so sorely beset. The House heard me very kindly, and my friends were satisfied. Tea afterwards at the Carlton.' The speech was an uncommon success. Stanley, the minister mainly concerned, congratulated him with more than those conventional compliments which the good nature of the House of Commons expects to be paid to any decent beginner. 'I never listened to any speech with greater pleasure,' said Stanley, himself the prince of debaters and then in the most brilliant part of his career; 'the member for Newark argued his case with a temper, an ability, and a fairness which may well be cited as a good model to many older members of this House.' His own leader, though he spoke later, said nothing in his speech about the new recruit, but two days after Mr. Gladstone mentioned that Sir R. Peel came up to him and praised Monday night's affair. King William wrote to Althorp: 'he rejoices that a young member has come forward in so promising a manner, as Viscount Althorp states Mr. W. E. Gladstone to have done.'[58] ...|$|E
