50|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>beauty</b> (Cryphia domestica) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is an {{abundant}} species throughout most of Europe east to the Urals, probably the commonest lichenivorous moth of the Palearctic region.|$|E
50|$|Lichens may {{be eaten}} by some animals, such as reindeer, living in arctic regions. The larvae {{of a number}} of Lepidoptera species feed {{exclusively}} on lichens. These include Common Footman and <b>Marbled</b> <b>Beauty.</b> However, lichens are very low in protein and high in carbohydrates, making them unsuitable for some animals. Lichens are also used by the Northern Flying Squirrel for nesting, food, and a water source during winter.|$|E
