40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. This {{research}} examined {{case studies}} of urban community gardens in seven different American states {{to determine whether the}} factors of sociability, participatory decision-making, leadership, and land tenure are likely to contribute to community garden success. The case studies included community gardens that have been in operation {{for at least five years}} (categorized in the successful group) and community gardens that have closed (categorized in the unsuccessful group). The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>qualitative,</b> and data <b>were</b> drawn from phone interviews and written responses from 34 individuals. Sociability and participatory decision-making were similarities across all groups and thus I concluded that they were not causal factors for community garden success. Land tenure and leadership were key differences between successful and unsuccessful gardens. Accordingly, it is plausible to conclude that these factors were critical for community garden success. Based on the above findings, I conclude with recommendations for local governments in the areas of land use policies and training/technical assistance. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{investigating}} Network-based Language Teaching (NBLT) seldom {{relate to}} Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), an important field in educational research which strongly stresses {{the value of}} group learning, adopting socio-cultural Vygotskian and Brunerian views. As a result, the concept of collaboration is scarcely deepened or problematized by NBLT researchers. However, choosing between collaborative or non collaborative learning settings when designing a distance learning course has a strong influence on tutor involvement. This paper explores the issue, thus attempting {{to bridge the gap}} between NBLT and CSCL. It does so by qualitatively analyzing online interactions in several distance learning courses (collaborative and non collaborative) and by examining these verbal exchanges in the light of collective activity, learners' social autonomy, and tutor role and involvement. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> and consists in analysing, a posteriori, online interactions between learners and tutors. After having defined the theoretical framework, the authors compare structures of online interaction in two pre-service teacher courses, focusing on the role of the tutor and on the issue of student autonomy. Finally, they examine more precisely some features of collaboration, analyzing tutor and student interactions in an online language course...|$|E

The first is related to financial conditions. They affirm that the courses are very expensive and their salaries are very low. The other {{is directly related to the}} nature of the teachers´ work itself and the school organization. The school is not structured to provide a continuing education based on teachers' interests and needs.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore the health professionals' {{experiences}} and gain a deeper understanding of interaction with families of critically ill or traumatized patients with severe brain injuries. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>qualitative</b> and phenomenological. Data were collected through participant observation and in-depth interviews with nurses, physicians, and chaplains working in two ICUs in a Norwegian university hospital. A thematic analysis was used for analyzing data. Two main themes emerged from analysis: Patient oriented even when present and Family oriented even when absent. Each main theme is divided into two sub-themes. The themes appeared as phases in an interaction process. In the two first phases the interaction may be characterized as Alternating between being absent and present and Following up and withholding information and in the two last phases as Turning point and changing focus and Partly present when waiting for death. The findings are in the discussion illuminated by the phenomenological concept of concern. Concern is visible as care, and the distinction in care between “leaps in” and “leaps ahead” and “ready-to-hand” and “unready-to-hand” are topics in the discussion. Because of the complexity of caring for both patient and family, the situation demands efforts to relieve nurses in particular, during the most demanding phases of the process...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{practitioner}} led research into collective worship in secondary, non-denominational, mixed state schools in England. It focuses upon {{a number of}} key questions: what are the functions of collective worship in the twenty first century? What were the functions of collective worship in the previous two centuries? How is it possible to explain why successive governments have not reworked the law on collective worship in non-denominational state schools? What is the future of collective worship? This research begins by identifying the issues underpinning the practice of collective worship, for example its history and the philosophical, sociological and spiritual aspects of it. These are then addressed in the two literature chapters – the first taking an historical approach tracing the legislation and the second exploring other angles but including an overview of collective worship in the light of Wright Mills’ (1959) analytical framework. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> using a combination of surveys, case study schools and a reflective journal. What emerges is a picture of teachers leading assemblies which hinge on what they consider to be a common morality, not necessarily religious and strong evidence of an ignoring of the ‘Christian worship’ dimension of the current legislation. Reasons for teachers’ non-compliance with the law, range from pupils’ largely secular backgrounds to compulsory worship not being intrinsically educational...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{phenomenon}} of trust as applied in urban planning processes. The study views this concept {{through the lens of}} “the opposition” – the dissenting voices to the official narratives of urban planning projects. The main focus in this context is Slussen in Stockholm, Sweden, which is a majorly important redevelopment project as well as a source of heated debate. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> research. The data collection relies on interviews and a discourse analysis of text and language. The interviewees are chosen based on their experience of, or participation in, opposition against the Slussen redevelopment project. The theoretical literature and the interviews are analysed through the theoretical framework of Erik Blennberger’s six analytical themes of trust. This enables a systematic detached approach to analysing the subjective interviews as well enabling a comparison between empirical evidence and relevant theoretical literature. This process resulted in seven categories of (dis) trust emerging from the interview material, which in turn resulted in the conclusion that, based on the study’s main findings three factors were the possible reasons behind the opposition of the Slussen redevelopment project: (1) Slussen as a unique space, (2) Debate character, (3) Authority. Based on these empirical findings and their comparison to the theoretical literature, the study concludes that trust depends on people’s perceptions of trustworthy actions of those who initiate change. That by exploring trust in the statements of oppositional networks over time it is possible to better understand issues regarding implementation of urban planning projects.   QC 20161129 </p...|$|E

40|$|There is {{international}} {{concern that}} the standard of mathematics education requires improvement. In order to facilitate this improvement, preservice teacher education needs {{to meet the demands}} of our technological age. As well, an international trend in mathematics curriculum development should focus on problem solving and modeling. This trend is evident in Australia, where the first national curriculum is currently being implemented. The need for attention to changing curriculum and introduction of reform-oriented pedagogies has ramifications for programs that provide preservice teacher education. New ways of thinking about mathematics and the teaching of mathematics is an important theme in such reforms. One offshoot of this development is focusing on teacher knowledge and its potential impact on students 2 ̆ 7 performance. Our research is set against this background and the aim of this exploratory study is to identify teacher knowledge that is activated in the context of designing mathematical problems. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative. The participants of the study are twenty-six preservice teachers at an Australian university. Findings show that having preservice teachers design rich learning activities which incorporate modeling of problems provides opportunities for them to demonstrate a rich repertoire of mathematical knowledge for teaching. This mathematical knowledge is complex and its development can be captured by mapping the trajectory of their learning. A key finding is that our approach provided opportunities for participants to construct subject-matter and pedagogicalcontent knowledge in a blended manner. An implication for preservice teacher education is that program coursework needs to support the development and activation of different types of knowledge for teaching...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to theorizing governance and state restructuring and assesses {{the effectiveness of}} the strategic transport governance arrangements in Scotland during the period 2006 - 2007 / 08.   The context is the seven Regional Transport Partnerships (RTPs) that were established to tackle cross-boundary and regional issues.   The ontology is broadly critical realist and the <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> utilising a modified grounded theory approach.   Fifty-four interviews were carried out and three RTPs used as case studies over the period 2005 / 06 - 2007 / 08. There are two conclusions.   First, progress in governing the development of strategic transport issues hinges on closer integration of spatial planning and transport planning strategy processes. Distinct professional spheres need to work more collaboratively.   Second, the concepts of ‘hollowing-out’ and ‘filling-in’ from governance literature need to be enhanced to reflect the nuances found in this empirical research. Drawing on a New State Spaces framework, the concepts of centrally-orchestrated regionalism/regionally-orchestrated centralism, and the process-oriented work on collaborative governance reveals a Collaborative Inertia in the current RTP structure that is founded on uncertainty.   It is proposed that two new processes have been identified: ‘over-stuffing’ as a useful perspective in explaining the structure and relations evident in Scottish transport governance and {{that there has been a}} process of ‘locally-orchestrated regionalism’ in the formation of voluntary RTPs, which has paradoxically led to a weak statutory regionalism. However, the regional dimension remains important and suggestions are made regarding strengthening integration between sectors at the same time as reducing the organisational complexity of governance.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the process of}} European Union funding programme and its implementation within a network context, and asks how institutional and network factors influence which organisations acquire funding. It is a case study which focuses on one European programme and one project partnership that was successful in gaining funds, and details the processes and influences that determined {{the way in which}} such programmes are developed and funds are distributed. Multi-Level Governance (MLG) is evident in the overarching structures supporting the interactions between Wales and the European Commission. The study critically analyses the significant pressures upon the development of funding instruments, and identifies the outcomes those pressures produce in terms of the focus and accessibility of programme fund ing. It demonstrates that in the implementation of such funding instruments, organisations that are structurally embedded with in a network and institutional environment will prove to be more successful in forming partnerships and gaining funding. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> and relies upon semi-structured interviews, documentary evidence and observations in offering an account of the process of funding development, implementation and distribution. This study rejects the use of a sing le theory in understanding resource distribution and demonstrates the need for a multi-faceted approach that encompasses the institutional environment in which funds originate. The process of programme development within the main governing institution demonstrates the pressures of institutional values and bureaucratic norms upon the frameworks, providing evidence for the perpetuation of norms and the need for legitimacy as stronger influences upon programme design than the achievement of policy goals. The implementation of programmes and subsequent development of projects demonstrates the structurally embedded nature of successful organisations and the influence of governing inst itutions in the development of successful project bids.

O artigo é o recorte de um estudo junto a trabalhadores de um abrigo localizado no sul do país. Trata-se de um levantamento de problemas enfrentados por trabalhadores em seu cotidiano junto a crianças abrigadas. A abordagem metodológica foi qualitativa, utilizando-se para coleta dos dados a metodologia do Círculo de Cultura proposto por Paulo Freire. A análise se deu a partir dos “temas geradores” levantados. Emergiram dois temas principais: as necessidades dos trabalhadores em relação ao processo de trabalho e como se sentem em relação ao trabalho com as crianças. Os resultados apontam aspectos do abandono do Estado e do abandono familiar.

In particular, this thesis explores the role of historical memory and discourse, taking up the AKP???s ???New Turkey??? and ak saray mega-palace to demonstrate the ways in which dominant political parties reconstruct and fuse seemingly opposed symbols (such as Ottomanism and Kemalism) to bolster its electoral appeal. The primary <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> the <b>qualitative</b> case study. Discourse analysis is employed to unpack and compare political party literature, campaign posters, slogans, and songs to explore the ways in which shifting discourses and memories offer new possibilities of Turkish identity, sideline opposition political parties, and furnish new modes of symbolic capital for the AKP. These factors compound conventional scholarly explanations of political party dominance and recommend expanded definitions of party dominance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} how the Arab {{and western}} media affected {{the staff and}} students of one Libyan university, Sebha University, through their presentation of the major Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisian, Egyptian, and Libyan. In particular, the research focused on the reporting by Al-Jazeera and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The study attempted to show how these two channels represented the main incidents of Arab Spring uprising and examined whether this representation was influenced by any ideology the channels attempted to propagate. It should be noted, however, that the researcher was not seeking to support any one ideological <b>approach</b> but <b>was,</b> rather, concerned with {{the ways in which}} such reporting impacted on the respondents of the study. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>qualitative</b> in nature and 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the staff (15 interviews) and students (15 interviews) of Sebha University, Libya. In order to gain further evidence about students’ and lecturers’ experiences and their views toward the two channels, 12 articles (6 from Al-Jazeera and 6 from the BBC), relating to the critical events of the three Arab Spring uprisings, were analysed using the main assumptions of Critical Discourse Analysis and Systemic Functional Linguistics. The study found that most of lecturers and students indicated that the two channels were, indeed, different in terms of their reporting of the events of the Arab Spring uprisings and, whilst the BBC was trusted for its dispassionate observations, Al-Jazeera was considered to be ideologically driven. This reporting caused a range of problems for the lecturers and students. Most notably, the students were concerned about the perceived lack of security, the reporting of which was a particular feature of the Al-Jazeera channel. On the other hand, both the students and the lecturers observed that the BBC was neutral and professional and without political propaganda. The main professional recommendations resulting from the study were that the university under scrutiny, and universities more widely, need to ensure that they have in place well developed systems for supporting both staff and students during times of stress, including during periods of national crisis. It is also suggested that national and international agencies and researchers must consider further the nature and impact of media reporting in an era of mass communication...|$|R
40|$|Production {{processes}} and work {{organization in the}} cultural industries have been little discussed. For this reason, the study focuses on the production phases and {{the division of labor}} in technical and artistic branches in Argentine soap operas. There are six branches: production, direction, photography, art, sound and edition. We explain the branches, the workers involved and their function and activities. This research is based on a communicational perspective, the Political Economy of Communication and recovers contributions of the Sociology of Labour. From this combination, we attempt to provide elements of analysis to understand the functioning and organisation of daily television series. In the same way, we examine the creative work, the types of work redundant or random, the division of labour and the economies of time. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative.</b> In this way, the examination is based on the production of interviews with key actors of the sector and the documentary and bibliographical survey so as to systematize the data for the research. Los procesos de organización productiva y del trabajo en las industrias culturales han sido poco abordados. Por este motivo, el estudio se centra en las fases productivas y la división del trabajo en ramas técnicas y artísticas dentro de las tiras diarias televisivas (telenovelas) en Argentina. En total contabilizamos seis ramas: producción, dirección, fotografía, arte, sonido y edición. Se explica cada una de ellas, el personal involucrado y las funciones que desempeñan. Se conjugan dos perspectivas teóricas, la economía política de la comunicación y la sociología del trabajo. En esta dirección, se hace hincapié en el trabajo creativo, los tipos de trabajos implicados redundante y/o aleatorio, la división del trabajo y las economías del tiempo. Metodológicamente, se efectuaron entrevistas a actores clave del sector, se procedió a la revisión documental y bibliográfica con el fin de sistematizar datos para el análisis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the Greeks in {{connection}} with the crisis in Greece is portrayed in Swedish newspapers, as well as the second generation Greeks in Sweden experiencing and interpreting the portraying and how it affects their everyday lives. The idea is to create an understanding of what happens when ethnic aspects is being portrayed in the media and how it is perceived and interpreted by second generation immigrants, and what this might mean for the impact of their daily life. The study is based, therefore on the following questions; how are the Greeks in connection with the crisis in Greece being portrayed in Swedish newspapers? How does second generations Greeks in Sweden perceive and interpret the portraying, and how it affects their everyday lives? The study's basic <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative</b> text analysis and qualitative interviews. Qualitative text analysis is to bring out the essential content through careful reading of the text parts and the context in which it is included. In text analysis, one can distinguish two main types of questions, namely questions relating to systematize the content of the texts, and those relating to critically examine the contents of the texts. This study also embodies the qualitative interviews to further answer the study's purpose and issues. Through qualitative interviews, the researcher insight into the events and the social world in which the interviewee present themselves in. By combining these two approaches, through the systematic text analysis clarify the given structure of the actors in one way or another which is important in the current economic crisis in Greece, but also in the portraying of it. The newspapers stigmatize second generation Greeks through discourse that is created, and the stereotypical notion that usually can be misinterpreted among its readers. The portraying and the stereotypical notions stigmatizes second generation Greeks because they interpret it as incompatible with reality and experiencing it all as strenuous, and the emotions of anger, irritation and sadness...|$|E

El contexto es la Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Carabobo, Venezuela. La aproximación metodológica es cualitativa. Es un estudio descriptivo-interpretativo de casos. Considerando el carácter social, retórico y argumentativo de las clases de ciencias, seleccionamos el referente teórico aportado por Perelman y Olbrechts-Tyteca (1989). El carácter social, didáctico, semiótico y comunicativo de las clases de ciencias se analiza tomando como referente teórico el aportado por Ogborn, Kress, Martins & McGillicuddy (1996). Incorporamos aportes de la investigación sobre la multimodalidad en la enseñanza de las ciencias (Lemke, 2002, 1999, 1998, 1997; Jewitt, Kress, Ogborn, Tsatsarelis, 2000; Kress, Ogborn, Jewitt y Tsatsarelis, 2001; Kress, Ogborn y Martins, 1998) para analizar los aspectos multimodales de las explicaciones. Los análisis y resultados destacan la contribución del uso de demostraciones y objetos materiales en relación a la construcción de significados y al convencimiento de los alumnos. Abstract:The {{research}} {{investigates the}} performance of experienced teachers {{from the study of}} their explanations in physics classes. The context is the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Carabobo, Venezuela. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>qualitative.</b> It is a descriptive and interpretative study of cases.

40|$|The central aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{mechanisms}} that teachers of professional practice use with their students to ease them into employment. In particular, it will concentrate on how teachers help students to prepare their CVs and portfolios in the subject of design. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> will <b>be</b> <b>qualitative</b> rather than quantitative. In addition to an analysis of appropriate literature on the CV and the current practice of portfolio preparation, this paper will employ evidence gathered from interviews with a number of individuals who teach professional practice to design students, but who also have a role in independently running their own design companies. Using a semi-structured format, interviews will be conducted with the design companies El Ultimo Grito and Design Direction, both of whose directors are also involved in the teaching of professional practice to students. The evidence from these interviews will be collected and used to suggest and consider developments in the teaching materials currently used to guide students on the production and design of their CVs and portfolios. The aim is to guarantee that students are then better able to project their skills to employers, and hence to ensure that the teaching of professional practice in design may help ease a greater number of design students into employment...|$|R
40|$|Corporate restructure is pivotal to the {{efficient}} operation of Australia’s economy, including {{the ability for}} companies {{to respond to a}} dynamic macro environment and the productive utilisation of market capital. The ability of a distressed company to effectively and efficiently restructure has significant implications for stakeholders, employment, productivity, enterprise value and the community. The present research attempted to understand {{the ways in which the}} current insolvency framework - and in particular the Part 5. 3 A voluntary administration legislation - is experienced by experts in the field, with a view to identifying ways in which it may <b>be</b> developed. The <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> a <b>qualitative</b> study utilising semi-structured interviews with 15 insolvency practitioners to gauge a deep understanding of the research questions. Findings indicated that there was broad based support for the effectiveness of the current legislative framework, however eight recommendations were drawn from the themes identified in the analysis to facilitate improved insolvency outcomes. These recommendations encompassed refinements to the existing legislation, reassessment of the policy and regulatory environment in which the legislation operates, and the broader development of a framework conducive to facilitating a corporate rescue culture. The present research reiterates the criticality of an effective corporate restructuring framework for {{the efficient}} operation of the Australian economy and to facilitate the rehabilitation of companies with viable underlying businesses as a matter of course...|$|R
40|$|Globally, in {{the last}} few decades, there have been massive {{cultural}} and structural changes in the workplace. These changes that have occurred to the labour process have been complex and varied. However, some general trends can be identified with regard to a neo liberal Australian workplace. This thesis is an exploration of the types of sociality that have arisen due to the present relationship between capital and labour. Through in depth semi-structured interviews with forty-seven people working in middle and working class occupations situated in a range of public and private sector workplaces, this study focuses on workers own interpretations of how cultural and structural practices have impacted on their social relationships in both the public and private spheres. This also involves a discussion of how workers experience and define intimacy and friendship in the first place. My <b>methodological</b> <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>qualitative</b> and situated in a critical social science perspective. I have therefore both theoretically and substantively placed the participants subjective experiences into the macro political and economic context in which they had occurred. I have done this with an awareness that while there have been macro influences on the relationship between capital and labour, this relationship is refined and shaped also by more micro work processes. The subject matter of this thesis was multi-layered and thus involved the generation of an eclectic theoretical framework using a number of sociological theoretical traditions. I have explored both the Sociology of friendship and Organisational Sociology. I have provided a critique of neo liberalism and considered concepts such as fordism and post- fordism. Theoretically I have examined how individualised and collectivised processes operating within the workplace have influenced types of sociality in the public and private spheres. An important part of this thesis involves a teasing out of the relationship between collectivism and individualism. I examine individual and collective processes in the workplaces with regard to human resources, industrial relations and forms of work organisation. Other concepts that I have also used for considering how workplace changes have impacted on types of sociality are hegemony, ideology and class. While a few middle class employees may have benefited from these changes, the reality for most is that these changes have meant the rise of precarious work, resulting in job insecurity, the intensification of work, the undermining of collective forms of solidarity and the increased blurring of the boundaries between home and the workplace. Some have argued that workplace changes resulting in teamwork and the increased reliance on more instrumental relationships, such as networking, have undermined more collective forms of worker generated solidarity and more genuine relationships in peoples working and private lives. Findings from this study suggest that genuine, more collective social relationships did exist but were severely undermined by the neo liberal structural and cultural changes that had occurred in most of the workplaces...|$|R
