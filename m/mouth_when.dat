5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis in {{the mouth}} is very rare, in {{contrast}} to lichen planus, another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> psoriasis involves the oral mucosa (the lining of the mouth), it may be asymptomatic, but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques. Fissured tongue {{is the most common}} finding in those with oral psoriasis and has been reported to occur in 6.5â€“20% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin. The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue (migratory stomatitis) is very similar to the appearance of psoriasis. However, modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E

5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E
5|$|After {{determining}} the ranges of {{motion in the}} joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal's own neck. Therefore, they were not {{likely to have been}} used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its <b>mouth</b> <b>when</b> hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. As the prey animal attempted to pull away, it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once the prey was trapped against the body, Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws.|$|E

5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close their <b>mouths</b> <b>when</b> {{they are not}} feeding, and {{the water in the}} digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon.

50|$|Further {{evidence}} suggests that gesture and language are linked. In humans, manually gesturing {{has an effect on}} concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their <b>mouths</b> <b>when</b> performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions.|$|R

25|$|Since Leptictidium young {{were very}} {{vulnerable}} to attacks of predators, {{it is probable}} that they were born quite developed and that they became independent when they were still quite young. From the behavior of today's elephant shrew, the possibility can be suggested that Leptictidium young went out to hunt with their mother, and that they learned to distinguish prey by licking their mother's <b>mouth</b> <b>when</b> she had just caught an animal, in order to know the flavor of food.|$|E
25|$|Furosemide, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lasix among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease.

Applications for medical gags include oral surgery and airway management. Gag designs, like other medical instrument designs, are often named after their inventors.

25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes from his <b>mouth</b> <b>when</b> in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue {{hanging out of}} the side of its mouth. Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.|$|E

Men and women enjoy chewing betel nut mixed with, betel leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells. They eat rice for meal, first they took a scoop of water and soak betel in their mouth, then wash their hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably coconut milk) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it in their <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> {{receiving}} guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the Chamber is hidden in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom on the second floor. One of the sink taps has a snake scratched into its side; when a command in Parseltongue is spoken, it opens to reveal {{the mouth of a}} dark, slimy chute, wide enough to slide down, that gives onto a stone tunnel. There are many skeletons of small animals littering the floor and even a gigantic skin shed by the Basilisk. The tunnel leads to a solid wall, carved with two entwined serpents with emeralds for eyes. At a command in Parseltongue, the wall opens to expose a long, dim corridor, lined with monumental statues of snakes, including two rows of towering stone pillars with more carved serpents that brace the ceiling. A colossal statue of Salazar Slytherin, looking ancient and monkey-like, is at the centre. The Basilisk rested inside the statue and emerged from its <b>mouth</b> <b>when</b> the Heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, summoned it.|$|E
50|$|It is {{uncommon}} to see very many hand gestures {{being used in}} Chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive.

It is also common to see Chinese women covering their <b>mouths</b> <b>when</b> they laugh. Traditionally, a woman who laughed too loudly was considered to be uncouth and ill bred.|$|R

60|$|In no {{case did}} any monkey keep its <b>mouth</b> open <b>when</b> it was astonished. Mr. Sutton {{observed}} {{for me a}} young orang and chimpanzee during a considerable length of time; and however much they were astonished, or whilst listening intently to some strange sound, they did not keep their mouths open. This fact is surprising, as with mankind hardly any expression is more general than a widely open mouth under the sense of astonishment. As far as I {{have been able to}} observe, monkeys breathe more freely through their nostrils than men do; and this may account for their not opening their <b>mouths</b> <b>when</b> they are astonished; for, as we shall see in a future chapter, man apparently acts in this manner when startled, at first for the sake of quickly drawing a full inspiration, and afterwards for the sake of breathing as quietly as possible.|$|R
25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are sucked up {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} two clocks at both mouths both {{showing the}} date as 2000. After being {{taken on a}} trip at relativistic velocities, the accelerated mouth is {{brought back to the}} same region as the stationary mouth with the accelerated mouth's clock reading 2004 while the stationary mouth's clock read 2012. A traveler who entered the accelerated mouth at this moment would exit the stationary <b>mouth</b> <b>when</b> its clock also read 2004, in the same region but now eight years in the past. Such a configuration of wormholes would allow for a particle's world line to form a closed loop in spacetime, known as a closed timelike curve. An object traveling through a wormhole could carry energy or charge from one time to another, but this would not violate conservation of energy or charge in each time, because the energy/charge of the wormhole mouth itself would change to compensate for the object that fell into it or emerged from it.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the <b>mouth.</b> <b>When</b> one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
