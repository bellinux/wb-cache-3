The song was {{released}} on May 9, 2011 as the album's third single. Initially released as one of two promotional singles for Born This Way, it shortly became a single following its success in digital outlets worldwide. The song was written and produced by Gaga and Fernando Garibay, and is a pop, electro-rock, and disco song that speaks of the very last <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> According to Gaga, lyrical inspiration came from {{the death of her}} grandfather, who died in September 2010. Alongside a saxophone solo played by the late Clarence Clemons, the melody of the song resembles much of the musical works of Bruce Springsteen, and contains several qualities similar to that of 1980s adult contemporary musical works.|$|E
500|$|In several Buddhist countries, it {{has been}} common to record merits done. In China, it was common for many centuries to keep record of someone's meritorious deeds in 'merit ledgers' (...) [...] Although a belief in merit and {{retribution}} had preceded the merit ledgers by many centuries, the ledgers established a practice of systematic merit accumulation for the first time. [...] The merit ledgers were lists of good deeds and bad deeds, organized {{in the form of}} a calendar for users to calculate to what extent they had been practicing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds every day. The ledgers also listed the exact retributions of every number of deeds done, to the detail. Through these ledgers it was believed someone could offset bad karma. In the fourth century CE, the Baopuzi, and in the twelfth century the Treatise On the Response of the Tao and the Ledger of Merit and Demerit of the Taiwei Immortal introduced the basics of the system of merit ledgers. In the fourteenth century CE, the Tao master Zhao Yizhen recommended the use of the ledgers to examine oneself, to bring emotion in harmony with reason. From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries, many types of ledgers were produced by Buddhist and Tao schools, and the usage of the ledgers grew widespread. The practice of recording merits has survived in China and Japan until the present day. In Theravāda countries, for example in Burma and Sri Lanka, similar customs have been observed. In Sri Lanka, a [...] ( [...] , [...] ) was sometimes kept by someone for years and read in the last <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> This practice was based on the story of King Duṭṭhagāmaṇi, and was mostly practiced by the royalty and rich during the period of the Mahāvaṁsa chronicle. More recent practice has also been observed, for example, as a form of terminal care. or as part of the activities of lay merit-making associations.|$|E

2500|$|According to critic Gabriela Glăvan, Bonciu's {{literature}} is [...] "hybrid" [...] and [...] "borderline" [...] {{in that it}} combines [...] "an Expressionism with avant-garde touches" [...] with [...] "slides into the oneiric and Surrealism. [...] His fragmentary poetic devices, alongside the uncertainty of his belonging to any literary genre, are sufficient elements for Bonciu's classification as an unusual author." [...] The same is noted by critic Florina Pîrjol, who reads in Bonciu [...] "a strange mix of the Expressionistic grotesque and the Surrealistic tenderness." [...] In his wartime biographical essay, George Călinescu further argues that Bonciu's overall contribution mixes together [...] "Neoromantic, Naturalistic and Expressionistic elements. The tendency of personifying the great laws of existence, such as death, the unexpected move [...] {{into the realm of}} hallucination, the sarcastic and extravagant [...] are all Romantic. The Expressionistic parts are the elevation of each moment into an idea, the obfuscation of things into symbolic smoke, the metaphysical interpretation of everyday tragedy. Beyond these, the habit of seeing dramas and issues in all <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> comes from the German-Jewish writers of the Werfel type." ...|$|E

The Face grants his helpless prisoner one last request and Adam asks to see Louise. But in his last <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> before being frozen, Adam learns to his horror that Louise had faked her kidnapping and had been working for the Face all along.|$|E
