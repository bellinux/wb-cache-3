5000|$|Denture wearing {{and poor}} denture hygiene, {{particularly}} wearing the denture continually rather than removing it during sleep, is another {{risk factor for}} both candidal carriage and oral candidiasis. Dentures provide a relative acidic, moist and anaerobic environment because the mucosa covered by the denture is sheltered from oxygen and saliva. Loose, poorly fitting dentures may also cause minor trauma to the mucosa, which is thought to increase the permeability of the mucosa and increase the ability of C. albicans to invade the tissues. These conditions all favor the growth of C. albicans. Sometimes dentures become very worn, or they have been constructed to allow insufficient lower facial height (occlusal vertical dimension), leading to over-closure of the mouth (an appearance sometimes described as [...] "collapse of the jaws"). This causes deepening of the skin folds {{at the corners of}} the mouth (nasolabial crease), in effect creating intertriginous areas where another form of candidiasis, angular cheilitis, can develop. Candida species are capable of adhering to the surface of dentures, most of which are made from polymethylacrylate. They exploit <b>micro-fissures</b> and cracks in the surface of dentures to aid their retention. Dentures may therefore become covered in a biofilm, and act as reservoirs of infection, continually re-infecting the mucosa. For this reason, disinfecting the denture is a vital part of treatment of oral candidiasis in persons who wear dentures, as well as correcting other factors like inadequate lower facial height and fit of the dentures.|$|E

The phase of calibration of the DE model intrinsic parameters governing the fiber and matrix behavior and the fiber/matrix interface is afterward retailed. At this stage, each constituent is assumed to be brittle elastic. Then, simulations of longitudinal and transversal tensions but also of in plane and out of plane shearing are performed on the REV using DEM.

40|$|The rapid {{degradation}} of the Thorn-sandstone {{could be explained by}} the presence of organics or minerals such as swelling glauconite, oxidized glauconite or non-swelling clays sensitive to hydric variations despite being non-swelling. A variety of tests and observations have been carried out to identify the most likely process of degradation. Conventional optical microscopic observations, XRF and XRD analyses, Methylene Blue tests on rock powder, Methylene Blue staining of thin-sections, and Loss-on-Ignition have been conducted as well as more advanced observations using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). The micro-CT scans allowed the visualization of the grain arrangement in 3 D along with the network of <b>micro-fissures</b> spread around within the material. The SEM combined with EDEX measurements allowed the visualization of grains in 2 D in great detail along with determining chemical elements at the sub-grain scale. Combined results showed that the Thorn-sandstone consists of quartz grains along with some grains of hematite, rutile or ilmenite. Porosity (excluding fissures) is very low. The grains are tightly packed and surrounded by a very heterogeneous fine-grained brown material. This brown material consists of a mixture of minerals, possibly clays, chlorite, micas, weathered glauconite and feldspar as well as small grains of rutile, hematite or ilmenite. The aforementioned <b>Micro-fissures</b> run through the brown material. The sensitivity of the brown clayey material to water, when exposed to wetting and drying cycles, is likely to explain the {{degradation of}} the Thorn-sandstone. Other hypotheses could be formulated to explain the rapid deterioration of the Thorn sandstone...|$|E
40|$|Solute {{transport}} in the {{saturated zone}} of a <b>micro-fissured,</b> fractured and even locally slightly karstified aquifer {{has been studied}} by multi-tracer tests in groundwater convergent flow conditions to pumping wells or towards a collecting gallery. Different behaviour has been detected that can be described by three kinds of typical breakthrough curves: (a) transport with a dominant advective component, producing narrow and symmetrical observed breakthrough curves, characteristic of solute transport in open fractures or conduits; (b) transport with significant advective and dispersive components exhibiting more spread-out breakthrough curves, with also non-symmetrical trends caused by retardation effects; (c) transport with a dominant dispersive component, showing mostly a flat breakthrough curve where dispersion and possible immobile water effects are difficult to be separated. These results were synthesized from thirty-five injections of tracers, distributed between 11 sites. Groundwater flow and solute transport are simulated and illustrated here for one example, employing the finite element code HYDROGEOSPHERE, and using two ways for representing the fracture zones: highly contrasting hydraulic conductivity zones with a classical REV approach and discrete fractures combined with a porous medium {{by the use of}} a dual approach.

40|$|Salt {{weathering}} can be {{a hazard}} with significant cultural and economic implications. Salt-induced deterioration of architectural heritage {{is considered to be}} accelerated drastically in marine environments. This article investigates the weathering mechanisms and weathering forms in two calcareous stone types used in monuments and buildings on the SW coast of France. The mineralogical, chemical, textural and pore-system characteristics of freshly quarried and decayed stones from quarry, monuments and buildings were determined, and salts loading identified. The stones' resistance against salt weathering was estimated by comparing calculated crystallisation pressures, which are function of the pore size distribution, with the tensile strengths measured by Auger [Alteration des roches sous influence marine; degradation des pierres en oeuvre et simulation acceleree en laboratoir. These Doctorat d'Etat es Siences. Universite de Poitiers, France (1987) ]. Results show that Crazannes sparite and La Pallice micrite behave differently with respect to water and salt-spray absorption and local salt precipitation since their pore networks, which control hydric properties, are different. Therefore, diverse weathering patterns due to salt crystallisation pressures were identified in the stones as influenced largely by their pore size distribution: alveolar weathering and granular disintegration in the sparite vs. flaking and <b>micro-fissuring</b> in the micrite. These mechanisms operate in response to salt inputs {{from a variety of sources}} - mainly marine aerosols and atmospheric pollution - as corroborated by the so-called enrichment factors (EFs). Wind is believed to trigger alveolar weathering in the heterogeneous sparite. Short-term observations in La Pallice micrite show rapid salt-induced breakdown through 'fatigue' effects. Determining factors involved in stone deterioration is important in the design of proper interventions for protecting historic buildings. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} controlling the advective movement {{of gas and}} its potential impact on a geological disposal facility (GDF) for radioactive waste is important to performance assessment. In a clay-based GDF, four primary phenomenological models can be defined to describe gas flow: (i) diffusion and/or solution within interstitial water; (ii) visco-capillary (or two-phase) flow in the original porosity of the fabric; (iii) flow along localized dilatant pathways (micro-fissuring); and (iv) gas fracturing of the rock. To investigate which mechanism(s) control the movement of gas, two independent experimental studies on Callovo-Oxfordian claystone (COx) have been undertaken at the British Geological Survey (BGS) and LAEGO–ENSG Nancy (LAEGO). The study conducted at BGS used a triaxial apparatus specifically designed to resolve very small volumetric (axial and radial) strains potentially associated {{with the onset of}} gas flow. The LAEGO study utilized a triaxial setup with axial and radial strains measured by strain gauges glued to the sample. Both studies were conducted on COx at in situ stresses representative of the Bure Underground Research Laboratory (URL), with flux and pressure of gas and water carefully monitored throughout long-duration experiments. A four-stage model has been postulated to explain the experimental results. Stage 1 : gas enters at the gas entry pressure. Gas propagation is along dilatant pathways that exploit the pore network of the material. Around each pathway the fabric compresses, which may lead to localized movement of water away from the pathways. Stage 2 : the dendriticflow path network has reached the mid-plane of the sample, resulting in acceleration of the observed radial strain. During this stage, outflow from the sample also develops. Stage 3 : gas has reached the backpressure end of the sample with end-to-end movement of gas. Dilation continues, indicating that gas pathway numbers have increased. Stage 4 : gas-fracturing occurs with a significant tensile fracture forming, resulting in failure of the sample. Both studies clearly showed that as gas started to move through the COx, the sample underwent mechanical dilation (i. e. an increase in sample volume). Under in situ conditions, the onset of dilation (<b>micro-fissuring)</b> is a necessary precursor for the advective movement of gas...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of sulphorhodamine B (SRB), a fluorescent hydrophilic model drug, {{was investigated in}} human skin after passive diffusion using four different topical delivery systems. The delivery vehicles applied were two bicontinuous lipid cubic systems, a commercial ointment and water. The lipid cubic systems consisted of either monoolein (MO) or phytantriol (PT) and water. The formulations were applied on full-thickness human skin during 24 h. Thereafter the samples were investigated using two-photon microscopy (TPM). The TPM system consisted of an inverted microscope with a 40 × water-immersion objective, laser scan-box, and a pulsed femtosecond titanium:sapphire laser operating at 780 nm. The fluorescence was detected using a 560 nm long-pass filter. Sequential optical sectioning was performed, resulting in images obtained at different tissue depths. TPM revealed that SRB mainly penetrates the skin via the intercellular lipid matrix. Samples exposed to the cubic phases showed a higher accumulation of SRB in <b>micro-fissures,</b> from which a fluorescent network of threadlike structures spread laterally in the tissue. These structures were also detected {{in some of the}} ointment samples, but not as frequent. The penetration of SRB into the stratum granulosum was deduced from the fluorescence of SRB present inside polygonal keratinocytes with cell nuclei. Higher SRB fluorescence was obtained in the outermost layer of the epidermis using the bicontinuous cubic phases, compared to when using the reference formulations. Thus, our results suggest that the dominating delivery route using the cubic phases is via <b>micro-fissures</b> caused by microscopic clustering of the keratinocytes in the skin. From these micro [...] fissures hydrophilic compounds, here modeled by SRB, can diffuse into the surrounding intercellular lipid matrix acting like a source for sustained release...|$|E

40|$|Flow and solute {{transport}} in the saturated zone of a <b>micro-fissured</b> and fractured chalk aquifer (Geer basin, Belgium) {{has been studied}} by more than 35 tracer tests in 11 sites. The tracer tests campaign was preceded by a morphostructural study associated to a geophysical survey including electrical resistivity and refraction seismic measurements. Results provided information on the main expected fracturation axis where a series of injection and monitoring wells were drilled. In each of the 11 sites, multi-tracer tests have been performed in groundwater convergent flow conditions to pumping wells or draining galleries (used for drinking water production). The analysis of the detailed quantitative breakthrough curves allowed identifying various transport behaviours, from rapid advective to dominant dispersive processes with immobile water effects. Groundwater flow and {{solute transport}} in such a fractured chalk can be simulated using different conceptual approaches. Using HYDROGEOSPHERE (Therrien and Sudicky, 1996), a comparison is made between two ways for representing the fracture zones: (1) high contrasted hydraulic conductivity zones with a classical REV approach and (2) the explicit representation of discrete fractures interacting with a porous medium. Promising results are found using the discrete approach for representing the fractures. In this last case, an aperture {{of the order of}} the millimetre is enough for creating, where it is needed, a fast advective peak combined with a long highly dispersive component due to the chalk matrix. The discrete fracture approach prevents the modeller from introducing unrealistic parameters values in the fracture zones as it is generally the case in the classical REV-based method where the fractured zones are simply represented by elongated REV. However, it is shown that the availability of field data, as multi-tracers test results, creates very high constraints {{to be taken into account}} in the calibration processes (i. e calibration on the measured groundwater flow and transport conditions). The detailed calibration on the different breakthrough curves is not an easy task and automatic calibration is not easy to organize. Results are particularly illustrative to show that a detailed parameterization and calibration of such a local situation remain difficult. Perspectives will be discussed about the potential use of automatic calibration tools as UCODE_ 2005 or PEST for solving such local situation models and the needed further steps for ‘upscaling’ local situation models at the scale of the whole aquifer or groundwater body.

40|$|Villars Cave is {{a typical}} shallow cave from South-West France (45. 44 °N; 0. 78 °E; 175 m asl) that has {{provided}} several speleothem palaeoclimatic records such as the millennial scale variability of the Last Glacial period and the Last Deglaciation. Monitoring the Villars cave environment over a 13 -year period has helped {{in the understanding of}} the stable isotopic speleothem content and in the hydrology. For example, it was demonstrated that most of the calcite CaCO 3 carbon comes from the soil CO 2, which explains the sensitivity of the δ 13 C to any vegetation and climatic changes. Drip rate monitoring, carried out under four stalactites from the lower and upper galleries, has shown a well marked seasonality of the seepage water with high flow rates during winter and spring. A time delay of about two months is observed between the water excess (estimated from outside meteorological stations) and the drip rate in the cave. A great heterogeneity in the flow rate amplitude variations and in the annual quantity of water between two nearby stalactites is observed, confirming the complexity of the <b>micro-fissure</b> network system in the unsaturated zone. At a daily scale, the air pressure and drip rates are anti-correlated probably because of pressure stress on the fissure network. Cave air CO 2 concentration follows soil CO 2 production and is correlated with its δ 13 C content. Since the beginning of the monitoring, the cave air temperature, in both lower and upper galleries, displays a warming trend of ~+ 0. 4 °C± 0. 1 / 10 yrs. This might be the consequence of the outside temperature increase that reaches the Villars Cave galleries through thermal wave conduction. Chemistry monitoring over a few years has shown that the seepage water of the lower gallery stations is significantly more concentrated in trace and minor elements (i. e. Sr, Mg, Ba, U) than the upper stations, probably due to the 10 - 20 m depth difference between these galleries, which implies a different seepage pathway and different water/rock interaction durations. There is also, in the elemental concentration (i. e. [Ca]), a seasonal signal which causes variation in the speleothem growth rates. Modern calcite deposit experiments conducted for several years have permitted the calculation of vertical growth rates, which are extremely high in Villars (i. e. 1. 0 to 1. 75 mm/ yr). Pollen filter experiments in the cave have demonstrated that most of the pollen grain found in the cave comes from the air and not from the water. The specificity of the Villars Cave records is that the climatic variations were well recorded in the calcite δ 13 C whereas the δ 18 O is usually used in such studies. Overall, these results are helpful for the interpretation of speleothem records for palaeoclimatic reconstructions, but more work is needed, especially numerical modelling of the temperature, chemistry and hydrology...|$|R
5000|$|For 2015, Contador {{announced}} that he would attempt to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, a feat that had not been done since Marco Pantani accomplished it in 1998. His debut race was the Vuelta an Andalucía in February. He took the race lead after the time trial on stage 1b, finishing fourth. Contador then won stage 3, a mountaintop finish, by attacking with 7.5 kilometers to go. He did however lose the race leader's jersey on the very next stage, another mountain affair, where eternal rival Chris Froome snatched both the stage win and the race lead. Froome did not relinquish his lead and Contador finished the race second in the overall classification, only 2 seconds behind. In mid-March, Contador finished fifth Overall at Tirreno-Adriatico, helping his teammate Peter Sagan win Stage 6 by accelerating on a climb and shedding the pure sprinters off the leading group. At {{the end of the month}} of March, Contador took the fourth place Overall in the Volta a Catalunya, where he crashed severely in the penultimate stage. Contador was able to remount and participate to the last stage, securing his general classification placing. At the end of April, and days before the start of the Giro d'Italia, Contador revealed that he was ready for the Grand Tour race. His injuries sustained in the Volta a Catalunya were healed and included a <b>micro-fissure</b> in his sacrum. He stated: [...] "I'm going very well, the big blocks of training here in the Canaries are all but finished and I'm now beginning to go through the recovery phase prior to the Giro. I've done a huge amount of climbing rides in these last three weeks and now what we've got to do is ease back before next week."At the Giro d'Italia, Contador's Tinkoff Saxo team performed well in the opening Team Time Trial, finishing 2nd to Orica Greenedge. He gained 6 seconds on Fabio Aru, 12 seconds on Rigoberto Uran, and 20 seconds on Richie Porte Contador took the Maglia Rosa on the summit finish on stage 5 to Abetone. However, the next day, Contador dislocated his shoulder after crashing on the finishing straight. He was able to finish but dislocated the shoulder again before the podium presentation.Despite this, Contador was able to continue in the race held on to the Maglia Rosa. However, on stage 13, on what most would have assumed was an [...] "easy day" [...] of racing, Contador crashed in a pile-up, 3.2 kilometers from the finish. Because of this, Contador crossed the line 42 seconds behind the finishers as well as his main rival Fabio Aru, thus losing his pink jersey, the first time he lost the leader's jersey in any Grand Tour up to that point in his career. However the next day, on a 59.3 kilometer time trial, Contador led the field, taking back the pink jersey and created a sizable time difference over the rest of the peloton. On stage 16, Contador suffered a mechanical problem on the descent of Apria and other teams including Astana tried to take advantage. Still, Contador made contact with Aru at the Passo del Mortirolo and put another two minutes into his rival as Mikel Landa became the second-placed rider on the general classification. On Stage 20, Contador lost some time to both Landa and Aru but retained his pink jersey. Eventually, he won the overall classification by 1:53 minutes over Aru. Despite being stripped of his 2011 title for a doping suspension, Contador insisted that this was his third Giro victory, therefore including the 2011 race in his count. With his second official Giro championship to go along with two official Tour de France championships and three Vuelta a España championships, Contador joined Bernard Hinault as the only cyclists to have achieved multiple victories at each one of the three Grand Tours.|$|R
3000|$|At present, {{shale gas}} {{exploration}} and production has attracted much attention. Given its accumulation characteristics, extended-reach horizontal wells and cluster horizontal wells were drilled to produce shale gas. Because {{of the existence of}} <b>micro-fissures</b> and strong water sensitivity in shale formations, severe wellbore instability often occurs in the long horizontal sections, which seriously restricts the process of shale gas exploration and development (Cui et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013). Shale formation is mainly composed of hard brittle shale, mainly of illite and mixed layer illite/smectite. For hard brittle shales, pore pressure transmission is the primary cause of wellbore instability. Therefore, the key to maintaining wellbore stability is to prevent pore pressure transmission. The effective sealing of micropores and <b>micro-fissures</b> is of great significance for preventing pore pressure transmission. Traditional plugging agents are difficult to form effective mud cake to prevent liquid penetration into shale matrix which has extremely low permeability and tiny pore throats. In recent years, nanoparticles are found to effectively plug shale pore throats to prevent liquid penetration into the formation, thus maintaining wellbore stability and protecting the reservoir (Roshan and Aghighi 2012; Rafieepour et al. 2013; Wen et al. 2014). According to previous experimental results, silica nanoparticles could significantly improve the densification of mud cakes, slow down pressure transmission and reduce shale permeability, while the rheology and lubrication of water-based drilling fluid were improved (Cai et al. 2012; Hoelscher et al. 2012; Al-Baghli et al. 2015). Bai and Pu (2010) synthesized PMMA latex nanoparticles with an average size of 73  nm, which {{can be used as a}} lubricant in drilling fluids based on their “ball bearing” function to prevent pipe sticking. They can also be used as a filtration reducer based on its deformability under temperature and pressure, forming a tough filter cake and sealing the <b>micro-fissures</b> in the formations drilled. Qu et al. (2007) synthesized intercalated or exfoliated nanocomposite poly(styrene-b-acrylamide)/bentonite using reversible addition-fragmented chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Experiments showed that these products had high-temperature tolerance and were good filtration control agents. In the last 20  years, the investigation into nanomaterials has greatly developed in many fields. Great progress has been made in basic theory and application of nanooptical materials, nanosemiconductor materials, nanobiomedical materials, nanoenhanced materials, nanomodified surface, etc. (Lin et al. 2012; Cormick and Hunter 2014; Kearnes et al. 2014). The combination of smart polymers with environmental response behavior (temperature, pH value, electrolyte concentration, magnetic field strength, electric field strength, etc.) and nanoparticles to realize the potential of nanoparticles is the most common research (Wu et al. 2013; Gulfam and Chung 2014; Lian et al. 2015). In this study, nanomaterials technology, smart polymers, and drilling fluid technology were combined. Emulsifier-free poly(methyl methacrylate–styrene) [P(MMA–St)] nanospheres [...] with an average particle size of about 100  nm were synthesized in an isopropyl alcohol–water medium by the solvothermal method. Then, the thermo-sensitive smart polymer P(NIPAm–AA) was modified onto the surface of P(MMA–St) nanospheres and thermo-sensitive smart nanoparticles were obtained. With the change in temperature, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of nanoparticle surface would change accordingly. Moreover, we would adjust the transformation temperature of NIPAm by an introduction of hydrophilic monomer or hydrophobic monomer, getting smart nanoparticles with different transformation temperatures to adapt to shale formations with different temperatures.|$|E

Designing methods for predicting the degree of ground improvement produced by this specific improving technology can be developed by theoretical approaches. A prevision method, based on finite cavity expansion in dilatants soil theory, has been developed and is presented in this paper. A comparison between theoretical data and on site tests results is also provided. Starting from specific laboratory tests carried out on resin samples, a modification was introduced to the previous works on cavity expansion, based on the experimental relationship between resin expansion pressure and confinement pressure offered by the treated soil. The different behaviour shown by cohesive and granular soils depends on their permeability to resin. The resin, in its liquid phase, expands in cohesive soils in a monolithical body and poorly permeates the soil by breaking it along <b>micro-fissures.</b> On the other side, after injection in granular soils, the liquid resin fills the soil voids and originates a composite hard material with a compressive strength comparable to concrete...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcoustic {{emission}} testing (AET) is {{a powerful}} non-destructive testing technique {{that can be used}} to detect and locate several types of damage mechanisms. High-temperature hydrogen attack (HTHA) is a concern in the oil refining industry because many old vintage C-Mo and Cr-Mo steels remain in operation well past their design lives. There are several documents providing refinery owners and users with guidance on operating high-temperature reactors in hydrogen environments. Nelson curves (API 971) also help determine the likelihood of damage. For this inspection technique to succeed, HTHA damage must be stressed to levels beyond those normally seen during steady-state operating conditions. Thermal gradients during the unit's cool-down offer such an opportunity because they are produced by a relatively rapid temperature reduction that induces considerable thermal stresses. These can cause HTHA (<b>micro-fissures)</b> to propagate, and therefore be detectable by AET. This paper discusses applications of the AET technique and provides an example of this type of inspection. 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|P-wave {{refraction}} seismics {{is a key}} {{method in}} permafrost research but its applicability to low-porosity rocks, that constitute alpine rock walls, has been denied in prior studies. These explain p-wave velocity changes in freezing rocks exclusively due to changing velocities of pore infill, i. e. water, air and ice. In existing models, no velocity increase is expected for low-porosity bedrock. We postulate, that mixing laws apply for high-porosity rocks, but freezing in confined space in low-porosity bedrock also alters physical rock matrix properties. In the laboratory, we measured p-wave velocities of 22 decimeter-large low-porosity ( 100 <b>micro-fissures)</b> from 25 °C to – 15 °C in 0. 3 °C increments close to the freezing point. P-wave velocity increases by 7 – 78 % when freezing parallel to cleavage/bedding and matrix velocity increases from 5 – 59 % coincident to an anisotropy decrease in most samples. The expansion of rigid bedrock upon freezing is restricted and ice pressure will increase matrix velocity and decrease anisotropy while changing velocities of the pore infill are insignificant. Here, we present a modified Timur's 2 -phase equation implementing changes in matrix velocity dependent on lithology and demonstrate the physical basis for refraction seismics in low-porosity bedrock...|$|E

Initially, we collected fragments countryside to determine the strewn field area and to perform spot chemical analyses by electron microprobe for the classification of the specimens (L 6 Chondrite). Furthermore, the hyperspectral Raman mapping allow us identify amorphous Maskelynite feldspar in plagioclase <b>micro-fissures</b> since it is a molecular technique. The spectra CL emission bands observed at circa 290, 340, 390, 440, 510, 640 and 780 nm are characteristic in aluminosilicate lattices providing additional data on H+, OH- and H 2 O and Na+ self-diffusion along interfaces (290 nm), on strained Si—O bonds (340 and 650 nm), on [AlO 4]° centers (380 - 390 nm and 420 - 440 nm), on O-—Si…M+ centers (510 nm) and on substitutional Fe 3 + in aluminum positions (740 — 800 nm broad band). The CL and hyperspectral Raman techniques coupling demonstrates that the Villalbeto meteorite was shock-metamorphosed from the amorphous Maskelynite presence in Plagioclase fissures and from the strained Si—O bonds at room temperature...|$|E

Despite {{a substantial amount}} of research on cut mark analysis and the influence of fire on bones (shrinkage, fracture pattern, recrystallisation), there is still a lack of knowledge in cut mark analysis on burnt remains. This study provides information about heat alteration of cut marks and whether consistent features can be observed that allow direct interpretation of the implemented tools used. In a controlled experiment, cut marks (n= 25) were inflicted on pig ribs (n= 7) with a kitchen knife and examined using micro-CT and digital microscopy. The methods were compared in terms of their efficacy in recording cut marks on native and heat-treated bones. Statistical analysis demonstrates that floor angles and the maximum slope height of cuts undergo significant alteration, whereas width, depth, floor radius, slope, and opening angle remain stable. Micro-CT and digital microscopy are both suitable methods for cut mark analysis. However, significant differences in measurements were detected between both methods, as micro-CT is less accurate due to the lower resolution. Moreover, stabbing led to <b>micro-fissures</b> surrounding the cuts, which might also influence the alteration of cut marks...|$|E
30|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that both the implant and bone should be stressed within a certain range for physiological homeostasis. This mechanical stress in turn causes strain in the bone tissue which {{is defined as a}} relative change in length, whether lengthening or shortening. The degree of the strain correlates with stress and the bone’s mechanical characteristics. According to Frost [16] (2003), the amount of strain can be divided into various ranges, permitting us to predict the effects on the bone. The lower limit of the bone’s equilibrium (i.e., of the load range within which, due to continuous bone remodeling processes, as much bone tissue is formed as is resorbed) is roughly 50 – 100  μStrain (1 - 2  MPa). Below this limit, (due to underuse), the result is bone resorption. The upper limit of this range is roughly 1000 – 1500  μStrain (20  MPa). Bone formation is the initial response above this limit. Additional strain, however, leads to <b>micro-fissures</b> and micro-fractures in the bone tissue, which, at roughly 3000  μStrain (60  MPa), surpasses ongoing repair processes leading to bone resorption. Therefore, if the mini-implant displacement exceeds the specified physiologic limit, it is likely to cause a micro-fracture of the bone trabecula and result in absorption, and necrosis of the osseous tissue in implant-bone interface ultimately leads to the failure of the mini-implant.|$|E

(1979) presented a calculation model for a semi-infinite slab cooled on its surface using liquid nitrogen and conducted experiment modelling limestone injected with liquid nitrogen. Grundmann et al. (1998) treated a Devonian shale well with cryogenic nitrogen and observed that the initial production rate increases by 8  % {{compared with that of}} a nearby offset well using traditional hydraulic fracturing. Liquid nitrogen has also been used for fracturing reconstruction of reservoirs with favorable stimulation effects (Mcdaniel et al. 1997). Ren et al. (2013) studied the effects of liquid nitrogen on coal-rock samples in thermal shock experiments and ultrasonic tests. The experimental results show that micro-fractures can be induced inside the coal-rock matrix due to liquid nitrogen shock. The dramatic reduction of sound velocity and amplitude implies that the liquid nitrogen treatment effectively affects the internal structure of the coal-rock samples. Cai et al. (2014 a, b) investigated the effects of liquid nitrogen cooling on rock pore structure. The results show that there are three major changes in the rock pore structure when the samples are cooled by liquid nitrogen: (1) a reduction in the number and volume of the pores; (2) an expansion of the <b>micro-fissures</b> (micro-pores); and (3) an increase in the pore scale.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3 a, {{the curves of}} the impact load and {{absorption}} energy for cross-laminated BLVL were both {{higher than those of}} the uniaxial-laminated board. These indicated that the impact properties of the 0 °/ 90 ° stacking type board were superior to those of uniaxial lamination. This is because the fibers could achieve balance at the 0 ° and 90 ° directions and could bear impact stresses by weaving together when adopting the cross-laminated type. At the same time, the pavement structure of the cross-laminated type increased the fracture toughness of the board. When the transverse stress wave acted on the thickness direction of plate, the cross-laminated structure could disperse stress effectively, inhibiting the development of micro-cracks in the interfacial and pavement layers. Therefore, the resistance impact capability of board was improved by the continuous accumulation of energy absorption. The board manufactured with all the fibers parallel in the length direction had a lower strength in the transverse direction {{due to the lack of}} reinforcement. Under the effect of the plane longitudinal stress wave, in the width direction of BLVL without enhanced fibers could be ruptured first and then the board was subjected to uniaxial load only in length direction, bringing about stress distribution imbalance. Once the micro-cracks developed, many <b>micro-fissures</b> extended and merged in laminated layers to form cracks along the fiber direction, leading to the fracture failure of the board.|$|E
30|$|The {{state of}} {{conservation}} of Crevoladossola {{is characterized by the}} presence of a diffused colour alteration which is responsible for the current dark to light grey appearance of the originally white stone blocks (Fig.  1 d). The altered blocks also show reduced granular cohesion so that mild mechanical actions on the surfaces result in grain detachments and powdering. The combined action of atmospheric corrosion and thermal weathering on the dolomitic matrix causes intergranular crack formation and enhanced chemical dissolution along the grain borders and the cleavage plane (Fig.  1 e) [1, 44]. These last appear deeply corroded forming fissures and micro-cracks which can cross the grains almost up to their entire thickness (Fig.  1 f). The cross-section observation (Fig.  1 f) does not show the presence of a continuous superficial deposition; on the other hand, the surface discontinuities and <b>micro-fissures</b> appear partly filled by soil dust and particulate matter which can be responsible for the observed colour alteration. Given the previously discussed conditions, the most external and altered stone material has to be considered unstable and loss of material occurs {{as a result of the}} rain wash. Where the erosive mechanism is particularly active, namely along the borders and edges of the blocks, a remarkable surface recession is observed. In such condition, the resulting surface still suffers from granular disaggregation and it is characterized by a lighter colour due to the removal of the superficial altered stone material (Fig.  1 d).|$|E
40|$|Knowing the {{processes}} {{that take place in}} the macromolecular and morphological structure following repeated mechanical stresses, during the technological processing of chemical fibres and yarns is mostly important for the specialists in the field. This aspect is also motivated by the fact that, due to the viscoelasticity of the thextile fibres, during stresses, especial the tensile ones, with small forces but repeated at short times, fatigue appears represented by structural changes, difficult to be noticed, and in the most severe cases of stress destruction occurs. During the fatigue process in the fibre there are several non homogeneous deformations especially in the microcavities and areas where the structure has imperfections. Thus, modified isolated structures will be obtained, representing the primary destruction of the fabric by forming <b>micro-fissures</b> that progress rapidly by propagation, affecting the fibre in several areas, and in the end it results in the tearing of the fibres. The action of the mechanical forces upon the fibre triggers several chemical reactions that result in the breaking of the chemical bonds and the birth of free macroradicals, the concentration of which will depend on the intensity of stresses. These aspects of the fatigue process will influence correspondingly the fibre's physicochemical and chemical properties. This paper reports the experimental results regarding the effect of some cyclical stresses with constant force on the main properties of the textured filament yarn made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) with a fibrillar matrix structure, of 110 / 32 dtex. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} {{effective}} stress is a well-established relationship where the stress {{acting on a}} rock {{can be viewed as}} the total stress minus the pore water pressure. In clay-rich rocks this relationship has been seen to be imperfect and a Biot coefficient is added to account for the material properties of the clay matrix. Large, stable pressure differentials and gradients were observed in several argillaceous materials during water and gas injection testing for a number of experimental geometries, including triaxial (Callovo-Oxfordian claystone), shear (kaolinite and Opalinus Clay) and full-scale testing (bentonite). Pore-pressure during water injection appeared to be evenly distributed on the sample scale, whereas in full-scale demonstration a complex distribution was seen, which may partly be due to hydraulic disequilibrium. During gas injection testing all observations suggested that transport was predominantly by dilatancy flow and the formation of <b>micro-fissures.</b> This led to localized pore pressure variations and a complex temporally and spatially varying pore pressure distribution. Isolated pockets of increased gas pressure could be seen to be stable. The nature of pore-pressure distribution, both hydraulic and gaseous, and the stability of pore pressure differentials means that the description of a meaningful average pore pressure was difficult and thus the use of effective stress with a single χ value might misrepresent local stresses within the rock. Localized deformation in the formation of dilatant pathways was dominated by the local gas pressure and not the bulk pore pressure. Therefore the law of effective stress on the micro-scale will be valid, whereas on a bulk scale could lead to errors in model predictions. This also has implications on the release of gas from shale due to the localized influence of stress around a fracture. Flow along fractures was localized with only a proportion of the fracture surface playing a part in both water and gas flow...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{drainage}} is {{an integrated}} strategy in gassy seams {{to establish a}} safe mining environment, extract coal seam gas and reduce fugitive gas emissions. Since conventional gas drainage techniques present poor performances in low permeability seams with longer drainage lead time, and therefore causing delays in mine development and mining schedules, a more promising technique of enhanced gas recovery was trialed and improved for better performance. Compared with nitrogen (N 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2) has a higher sorption capacity in coal seams and a large volume of anthropogenic CO 2 can be stored as a potential injectant in unminable coal seams and thus reduce the greenhouse gas effect. However, CO 2 injection maybe less favorable for gas management and safe mining of gassy coal seams in underground mines. A range of properties and operational conditions affect {{the performance of the}} enhanced gas drainage process. The micro-structure characteristics of a coal sample from an Australian gassy coal mine were analysed using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The results show that the <b>micro-fissures</b> between the matrixes are extremely narrow and tight {{which is one of the}} key intrinsic causes of low seam permeability. Coal permeability in relation to effective stress change and gas diffusion mechanism was analyzed and adopted in the gas reservoir simulator, SIMED II, which allows the investigation of enhanced gas drainage processes involving the injection of nitrogen into coal seams. Four key factors involved in this process, including injection bottom hole pressure (BHP), production hole pressure, borehole spacing and diameter, were studied to optimize the enhanced gas drainage parameters. The simulation results show that methane content was reduced from 11. 9 m 3 /t to less than 6. 6 m 3 /t, and the methane recovery rate was greater than 78 % within a gas drainage lead time of 180 days. It can be concluded that enhanced gas drainage with nitrogen injection is a prominent strategy for extracting methane resources and creating safe mining environment in low permeability gas reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{interaction}} between lipids, solvents and active substances in lipid based formulations have been studied and related to formulation structure or release behavior on human skin or a model thereof. For the different investigations, isotropic equilibrium lipid phases, i. e. bicontinuous cubic and sponge phases or water-in-oil microemulsions, were used. 	Bicontinuous liquid crystalline cubic phases formed of the polar lipids monoolein (MO) and phytantriol (PT) were used to deliver δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its methylester (m-ALA) in nude BALB/c mice in vivo and the fluorescent probe sulphorhodamine B (SRB) in full-thickness human skin in vitro. Fluorescence imaging and spectrophotometric measurements revealed that ALA and m-ALA delivered from the cubic phases induced an intense and homogenous fluorescence in mice. By using two-photon microscopy (TPM), {{it was revealed that}} the lipid cubic formulations penetrated into <b>micro-fissures</b> of the skin, thus, were acting as reservoirs for the active substance (SRB), which may explain the results in the former study. 	A detailed phase diagram was made for the propylene glycol (PG) -PT-water system to reveal the effect caused by the lipid- as well as water-miscible solvent, i. e. PG. The results showed that lower amounts of PG could be incorporated in the cubic phase, but larger amounts did not induce a sponge phase, which is possible in the corresponding MO system. MO contains an ester bond that is susceptible to hydrolysis and therefore the PT system is a good alternative when high and low pH is present. 	A characterization of the bicontinuous MO sponge phase with up to 16 % (w/w) of m-ALA was performed with polarized light, small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) and NMR diffusometry (NMRD). Additions over 4 % m-ALA, transformed the isotropic sponge phase into an anisotropic phase. Isotropic phases were re-formed with small additions of water to the anisotropic samples. All methods used indicated that a bicontinuous structure was present in the investigated samples. The sponge phase was also shown to be able to conduct electrical current and was therefore used in iontophoretic experiments. The MO sponge phase with 16 % m-ALA showed in combination with iontophoresis slightly lower fluxes than the clinically used references, while results from passive diffusion were similar to the references. 	The in vitro transport of benzophenone- 3 (BZ- 3) from a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) based microemulsion (ME) over silicone and human epidermal membrane was also investigated as the polarity of the hydrophobic domain was changed. The polarity change was done by an exchange of the slightly polar lipid MCT to the non-polar lipid isohexadecane. Passive diffusion experiments performed over the silicone membrane revealed an unexpected minimum in release rate as the polarity was changed into less polar. NMRD and SAXD were used to characterize the microstructures of the MEs, and revealed the presence of loosely held organizations in some of the investigated samples. However, a minimum in release was not found when using the human epidermal membrane instead of the silicone membrane...|$|E
40|$|Some {{properties}} of the ingot and especially of the steel forging ingots depend on the ratio of a columnar structure area to an equiaxed structure area created during solidification. The C-E transition is fundamental phenomenon {{that can be applied}} to characterize massive cast steel ingots produced by the casting house. The mentioned ratio is created spontaneously due to the rate of heat transfer towards the ceramic mould and then to the environment. The ceramic mould operates as an isolator. So that the thickness of the mould together with a growing solid fraction control the heat transfer and finally the ratio of the columnar structure area to the equiaxed structure area. At first the increase of heat accumulation within the ceramic mould is observed. Next the stationary state for heat transfer is created and finally a gentle abatement of the mould temperature associated with the heat output to the environment is expected. The steep thermal gradients correspond to the increase of heat accumulation in the ceramic mould. The steep thermal gradients are required to promote the columnar structure formation. The full heat accumulation in the mould corresponds well with the C-E transformation while the appearance of the moderate thermal gradients is referred to the gentle temperature abatement within the ceramic mould. The equiaxed structure is expected within this period of heat transfer behavior. The steep thermal gradients involve the activity of viscosity gradient in the liquid. As the result a sedimentary cones are formed {{at the bottom of the}} ingot. The C-E transformation is associated with competition between columnar and equaixed structure formation. At the end of competition a fully equiaxed structure is formed. The viscosity gradient is replaced by the thermophoresis which is the driving force for the deposition of some equiaxed grain layers onto the surface of C+E zone. The convection together with the gravity allow the layers to be uniform along the whole height of the ingot. Some equiaxed grain layers are also deposited at the bottom of ingot onto the surface of sedimentary cones due to activity of the gravity. Additionally, some macro-segregation effects are observed in the ingot. There are “A” – type macro-segregation phenomenon and „V” – type macro-segregation phenomenon. Both mentioned phenomena result from the so-called canal micro-segregation which appears due to the deposition of the equiaxed grains onto the bottom of ingot. <b>Micro-fissures,</b> porosity and micro-shrinkage are the result of the segregation phenomena occurring during the ingot solidification. Three ranges within the temperature filed created in the ceramic mould are to be distinguished:a/ for the formation of columnar structure (the C – zone) : (0 T and steep thermal gradients in the liquid),b/ for the EC transition (columnar to fully equiaxed structure) : (0 T and the so-called critical thermal gradient in the liquid),c/ for the formation of fully equiaxed structure (the E – zone) : (0 T and moderate thermal gradients in the liquid) ...|$|E
40|$|The Underground Research Laboratory at Bure (CMHM), {{operated}} by ANDRA, the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency, {{was developed for}} studying the disposal of radioactive waste in a deep clayey geologic repository. It comprises a network of underground galleries in a 130 m thick layer of Callovo Oxfordian clay rock (depths 400 – 600 m). This work focuses on hydraulic homogenization (permeability upscaling) of the Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) around a cylindrical drift, taking into account: (1) the permeability of the intact porous rock matrix; (2) the geometric structure of <b>micro-ﬁssures</b> and small fractures synthesized as a statistical set of planar discs; (3) the curved shapes of large ‘chevron’ fractures induced by excavation (periodically distributed). The method used for hydraulic homogenization (upscaling) of the 3 D porous and fractured rock {{is based on a}} ‘frozen gradient’ superposition of individual ﬂuxes pertaining to each fracture/matrix block, or ‘unit block’. Each unit block comprises a prismatic block of permeable matrix (intact rock) obeying Darcy’s law, crossed by a single piece of planar fracture obeying either Darcy or Poiseuille law. Polygonal as well as disc shaped fractures are accommodated. The result of upscaling is a tensorial Darcy law, with macro-permeability Kij(x) distributed over a grid of upscaling sub-domains, or ‘voxels’. Alternatively, Kij(x) can be calculated point-wise using a moving window, e. g., for obtaining permeability proﬁles along ‘numerical’ boreholes. Because the permeable matrix is taken into account, the upscaling procedure can be implemented sequentially, as we do here: ﬁrst, we embed the statistical ﬁssures in the matrix, and secondly, we embed the large curved chevron fractures. The results of hydraulic upscaling are expressed ﬁrst in terms of ‘equivalent’ macro-permeability tensors, Kij(x,y,z) distributed around the drift. The statistically isotropic ﬁssures are considered, ﬁrst, without chevron fractures. There are 10, 000 randomly isotropic ﬁssures distributed over a 20 m stretch of drift. The resulting spatially distributed K ij tensor is nearly isotropic (as expected). At the scale of the whole EDZ, the global K FISSURES is roughly 5000 times larger than permeability matrix KM. The detailed distribution of the equivalent K FISSURES (x, y, z) deﬁned on a grid of voxels is radially inhomogeneous, like the statistics of the disc ﬁssures. In addition, a moving window procedure is used to compute detailed radial proﬁles of K FISSURES versus distance (r) to drift wall, and the results compare favorably with in situ permeability proﬁles (numerical vs. experimental boreholes at Bure’s GMR drift). Finally, including the large curved chevron fractures in addition to the random ﬁssures, the resulting K ij (x, y, z) appears strongly anisotropic locally. Its principal directions are spatially variable, and they tend to be aligned with the tangent planes of the chevron fracture surfaces. The global equivalent Kij of the whole EDZ is also obtained: it is only weakly anisotropic, much less so than the local Kij’s. However, because of the radially divergent structure of the ‘chevrons’ (although not quite cylindrical in geometry), it is recognized that the global Kij due to chevrons lacks physical meaning as a tensor. Considering only the magnitude, it is found that the permeability due to ‘chevrons’ (K CHEVRONS) is about 4 orders of magnitude larger than that due to statistical ﬁssures (K FISSURES), assuming a hydraulic aperture a CHEVRON = 100 microns. By a simple argument, K CHEVRONS would be only one order of magnitude larger than K FISSURES with the choice a CHEVRON = 10 microns instead of 100 microns. This signiﬁcant sensitivity is due to several factors: the large extent of chevron fractures, the assumption of constant hydraulic aperture, and the cubic law behavior based on the assumption of Poiseuille ﬂow. The equivalent macro-permeabilities obtained in this work can be used for large scale ﬂow modeling using any simulation code that accommodates Darcy’s law with a full, spatially variable permeability tensor Kij(x) ...|$|E
