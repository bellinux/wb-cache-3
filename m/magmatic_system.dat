2500|$|The {{evolution}} of the IBM arc system is among {{the best known of}} any convergent margin. [...] Because IBM has always been an arc system under strong extension, its components encompass a broad area, from the Palau-Kyushu Ridge to the IBM trench (see first-right figure). [...] In general, the oldest components are farthest west, but a complete record of evolution is preserved in the forearc. The IBM subduction zone began as part of a hemispheric-scale foundering of old, dense lithosphere in the Western Pacific [...] [...] The beginning of true subduction localized the magmatic arc close to its present position, about 200km away from the trench, and allowed the sub-forearc mantle to stabilize and cool. [...] The arc stabilized until about 30Ma, when it began to rift to form the Parece Vela Basin. [...] Spreading also began in the northernmost part of the IBM arc about 25Ma and propagated south to form the Shikoku Basin. [...] Parece Vela and Shikoku basin spreading systems met about 20Ma and the combined Parece Vela Basin-Shikioku Basin continued widening until about 15Ma, ultimately producing Earth's largest back-arc basin. [...] The arc was disrupted during rifting but began to build again as a distinct <b>magmatic</b> <b>system</b> once seafloor spreading began. [...] Arc volcanism, especially explosive volcanism, waned during much of this episode, with a resurgence beginning about 20Ma in the south and about 17Ma in the north. [...] Tephra from northern and southern IBM show that strong compositional differences observed for the modern arc have existed over most of the arc's history, with northern IBM being more depleted and southern IBM being relatively enriched. About 15Ma, the northernmost IBM began to collide with Honshū, probably as a result of new subduction along the Nankai Trough.|$|E
40|$|Exactly 100 {{years ago}} the great Canadian-born petrologist N. L. Bowen {{published}} two seminal works on the chemical differentiation of magmas in which he posed {{the basis for a}} physicochemical understanding of the fractionation of crystals from melts in molten rock. A subsequent century of research and technological advances has enhanced our understanding of the physics and chemistry of <b>magmatic</b> <b>systems</b> and their temporal evolution. The image of sub-volcanic <b>magmatic</b> <b>systems</b> has evolved greatly in that time, from a simple ‘boiling vat’ concept of molten rock in which bubbles, crystals and melt separate gravitationally to a recognition that magma vats are relatively rare and that most <b>magmatic</b> <b>systems</b> spend much of their lifetime in a partially molten, or mushy, state. Real <b>magmatic</b> <b>systems</b> appear to be organized into a series of storage regions periodically connected by feeding structures transferring magma (and heat) at different fluxes. Magma fluxes between the different portions of this plumbing system, and the variation of the chemical and physical properties of magma as it rises through the crust, exert essential controls on the eruptive modalities of volcanoes and the geochemistry of their products.

50|$|Processes within magma {{chambers}} play {{an important}} role in the formation of the magmas erupted by volcanoes. The diversity of the petrographic patterns suggest that Parinacota did not have a single major magma chamber, but rather various magma reservoirs at various depths and with variable interconnection patterns.

Starting about 28,000 years ago however several different magma systems consolidated into one, probably as a result of more frequent injections of new magma and/or the accumulation of cumulates that insulated the <b>magmatic</b> <b>system.</b> The transit of the magmas through the conduit system probably takes several ten thousand years, and the residence time within magma chambers could be on the orders of 100,000 years.|$|E

Two sampling traverses from flow base to eroded top, over vertical sections of 245 and 300 m, show that the flow consists of a felsic lower unit (100 m thick) overlain sharply by a more mafic upper unit. The mafic upper unit is chemically zoned, becoming slightly more evolved upward; the lower unit is heterogeneous and unzoned. The lower unit is also more phenocryst-rich and locally contains inclusions of quenched basaltic andesite magma that are absent from the upper unit.

50|$|In {{the case}} of Parinacota, there is a {{noticeable}} difference between the pre-sector collapse and post-sector collapse magmas, indicating that a large turnover of the <b>magmatic</b> <b>system</b> was triggered by the landslide. More specifically, after the collapse erupted rocks became more mafic and their composition more influenced by fractional crystallization, while the preceding magmas were more strongly affected by mixing processes. Also, magma output increased significantly, while the resting time in the magma chambers decreased. Modelling indicates that over the short term, a collapse would cause activity to stop at a volcano of Parinacota's size, and {{over the long term}} the plumbing system would change and become shallower. Also, the plumbing system of the volcano would become more permissive to denser mafic magmas after a sector collapse, perhaps explaining why the Ajata vents were active after the collapse but the magma erupted through them influenced petrogenesis of main cone magmas much earlier. The magnitude of such changes is considerably larger than at neighbouring volcano Taapaca, where a sector collapse was not accompanied by changes in activity; presumably Parinacota's shallower magma supply system made it more susceptible to the effects of unloading.|$|E
5000|$|Simplifying, the {{solubility}} {{of water}} in rhyolite and basalt is function of pressure and depth below the surface in absence of other volatiles. Both basalt and rhyolite lose water with decreasing pressure as the magma rises to the surface. The solubility of water is higher in rhyolite than in basaltic magma. Knowledge of the solubility allows {{the determination of the}} maximum amount of water might dissolved in relation with pressure. If the magma contains less water that it could, it is undersaturated in water. Usually insufficient water and carbon dioxide exist in the deep crust and mantle, so magma is often undersaturated in these conditions. Magma becomes saturated when it reaches the maximum amount water that can be dissolved in it. If the magma continues to rise up to the surface and more water is dissolved in it becomes supersaturated. If more water is dissolved in magma, it can be ejected as bubbles or vapor water. This happens because pressure decreases in the process and velocity increases and the process has to balance also between decrease of solubility and pressure. Making a comparison with the solubility of carbon dioxide in magma, this is considerably less than water and it tends to exolve at greater depth. In this case water and carbon dioxide are considered independent. [...] What affects the behavior of the <b>magmatic</b> <b>system</b> is the depth at which carbon dioxide and water are released. Low solubility of carbon dioxide means that it starts to release bubbles before reaching the magma chamber. The magma is at this point already supersaturated. The magma enriched in carbon dioxide bubbles, rises up to the roof of the chamber and carbon dioxide tends to leak through cracks into the overlying caldera. Basically, during an eruption the magma looses more carbon dioxide than water, that in the chamber is already supersaturated. Overall, water is the main volatile during an eruption.|$|E

We here demonstrate that magmatic activity in each of the different segments of the SHV <b>magmatic</b> <b>system</b> (shallow dyke-conduit, upper and lower magma chambers) generates a characteristic strain pattern that allows the identification of operating sources in the plumbing system based on a simple scheme of amplitude ratios. We use this method to evaluate strain data from selected Vulcanian explosions and gas emission events that occurred at SHV between 2003 and 2012. Our results show that the events were initiated by a short phase of contraction of either one or both magma chambers and a simultaneous inflation of the shallow feeder system. The initial phase of the events usually lasted only tens to hundreds of seconds before the explosion/gas emission started and the syste m recovered. The short duration of this process points at rapid transport of fluids rather than magma ascent to generate the pressure changes. We suggest the propagation of tensile hydraulic fractures as viable mechanism to provide a pathway for fluid migration in the <b>magmatic</b> <b>system</b> at the observed time scale. Fluid mobilization was initiated by a sudden destabilization of large pockets of already segregated fluid in the magma chambers.
