5|$|Led by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was {{established}} on 27 June 1921 {{to look after}} the interests of refugees, including overseeing their repatriation and, when necessary, resettlement. At the end of the First World War, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission's foundation, it had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent disease and hunger. It also established the Nansen passport as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> for stateless people.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is {{typically}} a creamy white, {{with a slight}} salmon tinge, {{but it has been}} observed to vary from white to yellow depending on the density, meaning {{that it is not a}} useful <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> Individual spores are a buff-white, amyloid (staining blue in Melzer's reagent) and hyaline. In shape, the spores are elliptic, with a moderately well-developed network of ridges, measuring between 8 and 9.5 by 6.5 to 7.5 micrometres(μm). The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gills) are shaped like narrow spindles, typically measuring between 40 and 75μm long, but sometimes reaching 86μm in length, by 6 and 11μm wide at the widest point. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gills) are leaf or spindle shaped, measuring between 30 and 52μm long by 4 to 7μm wide. The basidia are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring between 36 and 42μm in length by 8 and 12μm wide.|$|E

40|$|Compressible Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of {{turbulent}} reacting flows potentially {{offers a}} realistic {{representation of the}} physical phenomena involved in thermoacoustic instabilities. Coupled with Helmholtz solvers, which provide a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the acoustic eigenmodes in complex geometries, that advanced numerical tool may provide a very powerful environment to assess the stability of real engine combustion chambers. The common use of a fully unstructured LES solver and a Helmholtz eigenmode tool proves here to be very useful to diagnose two operating points of a real gas turbine chamber which are known to operate with self-sustained oscillations. If the geometrical complexity and proper computational domain are chosen, the two thermo-acoustic instabilities are very well reproduced. Predictibility of LES for such problems is thus demonstrated provided that issues pertaining to the inlet acoustic impedances can be properly answered...|$|R

The species can then be distinguished by certain features, such as size and colour of head, neck, back and bill, but often reliable identification of wintering divers is difficult even for experts – particularly as the smaller immature birds look similar to winter-plumage adults, making size an unreliable <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b>|$|E
500|$|Members of Scottish clans {{show their}} {{allegiance}} to their clan and chief by wearing crest badges. These are usually worn on a bonnet. Crest badges are usually {{made up of}} the chief's heraldic crest surrounded by a strap and buckle with the chief's heraldic motto or slogan. The crest badge used by members of Clan Maclachlan contains the Latin motto FORTIS ET FIDUS, which translates to [...] "strong and faithful". The blazon of the crest within the badge is (Issuant from a crest coronet of four (three visible) strawberry leaves Or) a castle set upon a rock all Proper. Another clan symbol used to show a clan member's affiliation is a clan badge or plant badge. Consisting of a particular plant, these badges are sometimes said to be the original <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> used by Scottish clans. Clan Maclachlan has two clan badges attributed to it. These include: rowan (or mountain ash) and lesser periwinkle.|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} {{standalone}} spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. [...] FTIR is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light {{to identify a}} substance. [...] The attenuated total reflectance sampling technique {{eliminates the need for}} substances to be prepared before analysis. [...] The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. [...] To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. [...] FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. [...] When analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. [...] While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> [...] However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. [...] For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm−1).|$|E
