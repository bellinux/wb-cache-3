5|$|On the September 1 {{episode of}} Raw, Candice made her in-ring return match {{teaming up with}} Kelly Kelly and Mickie James to defeat Jillian Hall, Katie Lea Burchill and Beth Phoenix, with Candice pinning Phoenix. Candice {{received}} a push upon her return as she was named the number one contender for the Women's Championship, but lost to Beth Phoenix at No <b>Mercy.</b> <b>On</b> the February 2 episode of RAW, Candice unsuccessfully challenged Beth Phoenix for the Women's Title after the interference by Mendes and Marella. On the February 16 episode of RAW, Candice, James and Kelly stopped Marella and Mendes from interfering in the Women's Championship match between Melina and Phoenix, which was won by Melina.|$|E
5|$|Beth Phoenix {{became the}} number one {{contender}} for the Women's Title after winning a Diva battle royal at SummerSlam. At the Unforgiven pay-per-view, however, Candice successfully retained her title in their match by countering one of Phoenix's moves with a crucifix pin. Their feud continued when Phoenix pinned Candice during a non-title mixed tag team match on Raw on September 24. At No <b>Mercy</b> <b>on</b> October 7, Candice dropped the title to Phoenix, ending her reign as Women's Champion. On October 22, Candice legitimately cracked her clavicle during her rematch for the Women's Title against Phoenix in a {{two out of three}} falls match; Phoenix ran into the ropes, causing Candice to fall face-first off of the turnbuckle onto her face, neck, and shoulders necessitating a rushed finish and putting her out of action for 14 weeks.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, Triple H {{would begin}} a {{controversial}} feud with Kane, {{leading to a}} match at No <b>Mercy</b> <b>on</b> October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick {{was killed in a}} car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket; Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasized before the title match. Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy, unifying the two titles.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No <b>Mercy</b> <b>on</b> October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Kurt Angle and Cena ended {{shortly after}} No <b>Mercy.</b> <b>On</b> the November 6 episode of SmackDown, John Cena was offered an {{opportunity}} to become the final member of Team Lesnar for the traditional five-on-five elimination tag match at Survivor Series. Cena rejected the offer, however, causing A-Train to turn on him and reveal he was the final member of Team Lesnar. The members of Team Angle fought alongside Cena, and the following week on SmackDown, Cena turned into a fan favorite and joined Kurt Angle's Survivor Series team. The feud between the Big Show and Eddie Guerrero ended after No Mercy, with Guerrero going on {{to compete for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship with Chavo Guerrero. Guerrero went on to win a tag team title shot by defeating the Basham Brothers in a Handicap match, but he did not win the title.|$|E
5|$|After {{being drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as part of}} the 2016 WWE draft which took place on 19 July, Lynch made her first {{appearance}} for the brand on 26 July, defeating Natalya before being confronted by the brand female talents. On the 16 August episode of SmackDown Live, Lynch teamed with Carmella in a successful victory against Alexa Bliss and Natalya, after a distraction provided by Eva Marie and Naomi. It was later announced a six-woman tag team match for SummerSlam between Lynch, Carmella and Naomi against Bliss, Marie and Natalya, but following Marie's suspension on 18 August, her place was taken by the returning Nikki Bella, and Lynch's team would ultimately lose the match at evet on 21 August. At Backlash on 11 September, Lynch won a six-pack elimination challenge by last eliminating Carmella to become the inaugural SmackDown Women's Champion, marking her first title victory in WWE. Lynch's first title defense against Alexa Bliss was scheduled for No <b>Mercy</b> <b>on</b> 9 October, but the match was postponed due to Lynch suffering a legitimate out-of-ring injury. The match was rescheduled for the 8 November episode of SmackDown Live, where Lynch successfully defended the title, albeit in controversial fashion (the referee did not see Bliss' foot on the rope when she submitted to her finishing maneuver, the Dis-arm-her). Lynch was a part of Team SmackDown at Survivor Series on 20 November, where she was the last woman from the team to be eliminated during the traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar {{successfully}} {{defended his}} newly won title against the debuting Paul London on October 9 episode of SmackDown!. He returned to feud with The Undertaker, as Lesnar had previously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then champion Kurt Angle, which granted him {{a shot at}} Lesnar's title. At No <b>Mercy</b> <b>on</b> October 19, Lesnar defeated Undertaker in a Biker Chain match. After Paul Heyman returned to WWE as SmackDown! General Manager, Lesnar aligned himself with his former manager. With Survivor Series coming up, Lesnar decided to challenge Angle to a traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match. Lesnar chose Big Show as his first teammate, with Heyman adding a returning Nathan Jones and a debuting Matt Morgan to bring the team number to four. Angle chose Chris Benoit and The APA to join his team. However, Faarooq was injured during a match with Lesnar and Angle's team was forced to find a replacement for him. Lesnar's team picked A-Train to fill the fifth and final spot for them after he attacked John Cena, who refused to accept an invitation to join Lesnar's team. Cena instead joined Angle's team and Angle added Hardcore Holly as the fifth member (Lesnar had legitimately injured Holly the year before and he had not wrestled since). On November 16 at Survivor Series, Lesnar was eliminated after Benoit forced him to tap out to the Crippler Crossface. Lesnar defended the WWE Championship against Benoit on SmackDown!, where Lesnar won after Benoit passed out to Lesnar's debuting Brock Lock submission hold.|$|E
5|$|The three Kings of Arms {{have also}} been {{entitled}} to wear a crown since the 13th century. However, {{it was not until}} much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated. The silver-gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, inscribed with a line from Psalm 51 in Latin: Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam (translated: Have <b>mercy</b> <b>on</b> me O God according to Thy great mercy). Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet, lined with ermine, having at the top a large tuft of tassels, wrought in gold. In medieval times the king of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year: Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide and All Saint's Day. Today, the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions. The last time these crowns were worn was at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. At other times, kings of arms wear a black bicorne trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors, or a black velvet cap, depending on circumstances of occasion.|$|E
