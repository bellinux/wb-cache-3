40|$|In {{the early}} {{feasibility}} study stage, the {{information concerning the}} <b>target</b> <b>project</b> is very limited. It is very common in practice for a Quantity Surveyor (Q. S.) to use the mean value of the historical building price data (with similar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> to forecast the early construction cost for a <b>target</b> <b>project.</b> Most clients rely heavily on this early cost forecast, provided by the Q. S., {{and use it to}} make their investment decision and advance financial arrangement. The primary aim of this research is to develop a statistical model and demonstrate through this developed model how to measure the accuracy of mean value forecast. A secondary aim is to review the homogeneity of construction project cost. The third aim is to identify the best data pooling for mean value cost forecast in early construction stages by making the best use of the data available. Three types of mean value forecasts are considered: (1) the use of the target base group (relating to a source with similar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project),</b> (2) the use of a non-target base group (relating to sources with less or dissimilar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> and (3) the use of a combined target and non-target base group. A formulation of mean square error is derived for each to measure the forecasting accuracy. To accomplish the above research aims, this research uses cost data from 450 completed Hong Kong projects. The collected data is clustered into two levels as: (1) Level one - by project nature (i. e. Residential, Commercial centre, Car parking, Social community centre, School, Office, Hotel, Industrial, University and Hospital), (2) Level two -by project specification and construction floor area. In this research, the accuracy of mean value forecast (i. e. mean square error) for a total number of 10, 539 of combined data groups is measured. From their performance, it may reasonably be concluded that (1) the use of a non-target base group (relating to sources with less or dissimilar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> never improves the forecasting performance, (2) the use of a target base group (relating to a source with similar characteristics to the <b>target</b> <b>project)</b> cannot always provide the best forecasting performance, (3) the use of a combined target and non-target base group in some cases can furnish a better forecasting performance, and (4) when the cost data groups are clustered into a more detailed level, it can improve the forecasting performance...|$|R

30|$|Nam and Kim [80] {{proposed}} an HTL method called Heterogeneous Defect Prediction (HDP) for software defect prediction, {{though it can}} also be applied for other tasks. Most software defect prediction studies have been performed to train a model for a project and test it within the same project while using the same set of metrics/attributes. This is known as within-project defect prediction (WPDP). When a new project is developed, it contains little or no historical defect data. Therefore, one can use transfer learning techniques to apply data/models from other source projects and to detect defects in the new <b>target</b> <b>project.</b> This is otherwise known as cross-project defect prediction (CPDP). Most CPDP approaches require both source and <b>target</b> <b>projects</b> to be represented by the same set of metrics as for homogeneous transfer learning though this becomes a limitation as it may be challenging to find source projects which are characterized by the exact same set of metrics as one’s new <b>target</b> <b>project.</b> To address such limitation, the proposed method can accept heterogeneous metric sets to transfer knowledge from a source to a target software defect detection task.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the common}} {{problems}} in building an effort estimation model is that not all the effort factors are suitable as predictor variables. As a supplement of missing information in estimation models, this paper explores the project manager’s knowledge about the <b>target</b> <b>project.</b> We assume that the experts can judge the <b>target</b> <b>project’s</b> productivity level based on his/her own expert knowledge about the project. We also assume that this judgment can be further improved, because using the expert’s judgment solely could incur subjective perception. This paper proposes a regression model building/selection method to address this challenge. In the proposed method, a fit dataset for model building {{is divided into two}} or three subsets by project productivity, and an estimation model is built on each data subset. The expert judges the productivity level of the <b>target</b> <b>project</b> and selects one of the models to be used. In the experiment, we used three datasets to evaluate the produced effort estimation models. In the experiment, we adjusted the error rate of the judgment and analyzed the relationship between the error rate and the estimation accuracy. As a result, the judgment-incorporating models produced significantly higher estimation accuracy than the conventional linear regression model, where the expert’s error rate is less than 37 %...|$|R
