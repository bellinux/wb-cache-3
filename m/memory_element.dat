5000|$|For random-access type memories, a 1T1R (one transistor, one resistor) {{architecture}} is preferred because the transistor isolates current to {{cells that are}} selected from cells that are not. On the other hand, a cross-point {{architecture is}} more compact and may enable vertically stacking memory layers, ideally suited for mass-storage devices. However, {{in the absence of}} any transistors, isolation must be provided by a [...] "selector" [...] device, such as a diode, in series with the <b>memory</b> <b>element</b> or by the <b>memory</b> <b>element</b> itself. Such isolation capabilities are inferior to the use of transistors if the on/off ratio for the selector is not sufficient, limiting the ability to operate very large arrays in this architecture. Thin film based threshold switch can work as a selector for bipolar and unipolar RRAM. Threshold switch-based selector was demonstrated for 64 Mb array. However, One shouldn't forget that the cross-point architecture requires BEOL compatible two terminal selectors like punch-through diode for bipolar RRAM or PIN diode for unipolar RRAM.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{research}} has shown how chaotic computers can be recruited in Fault Tolerant applications, by introduction of dynamic based fault detection methods. Also it has been demonstrated that multidimensional dynamical states available in a single ChaoGate can be exploited to implement parallel chaos computing, and as an example, this parallel architecture can lead to constructing an SR like <b>memory</b> <b>element</b> through one ChaoGate. As another example, it has been proved that any logic function can be constructed directly from just one ChaoGate.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} flip-flop, exactly {{one of the}} two complementary outputs is high. This can be generalized to a <b>memory</b> <b>element</b> with N outputs, exactly one of which is high (alternatively, where exactly one of N is low). The output is therefore always a one-hot (respectively one-cold) representation. The construction is similar to {{a conventional}} cross-coupled flip-flop; each output, when high, inhibits all the other outputs. [...] Alternatively, more or less conventional flip-flops can be used, one per output, with additional circuitry to make sure only one at a time can be true.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} a {{sequential}} circuit or computer program {{at any time}} is completely determined by its current inputs and current state. Since each binary <b>memory</b> <b>element</b> has only two possible states, 0 or 1, {{the total number of}} different states a circuit can assume is finite, and fixed by the number of memory elements. If there are N binary memory elements, a digital circuit can have at most 2N distinct states. The concept of state is formalized in an abstract mathematical model of computation called a finite state machine, used to design both sequential digital circuits and computer programs.|$|E

40|$|Trellis-coded {{modulation}} (TCM) is {{a technique}} where forward error correction coding and modulation are treated {{in a single operation}} without increasing the channel bandwidth. In this thesis the performance of a variable data rate TCM waveform transmitted over a channel is investigated. In general, TCM systems with rate 1 / 2 and rate 2 / 3 convolutional codes and quadrature-shift keying (QPSK) and 8 -phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation, respectively, are considered. The data rate of the later TCM system is 50 % faster than that of the former. Two cases are considered. In the first case, the number of <b>memory</b> <b>elements</b> K remains constant as the code rate increases. In the second case, the number of <b>memory</b> <b>elements</b> increases linearly with code rate, so that the total number of <b>memory</b> <b>elements</b> for 8 -PSK, r= 2 / 3 TCM is given by 1 / 2 2 K K =, where 1 / 2 K is the number of <b>memory</b> <b>elements</b> for the QPSK, r= 1 / 2 convolutionally encoded TCM system. The effects of pulse-noise interference (PNI) in addition to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) are considered. It was found that both TCM systems have significant resistance to PNI when K is large enough. Hellenic Navy author...|$|R
