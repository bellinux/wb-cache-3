5|$|In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester Mauger {{attempted}} to investigate Norreis's conduct, {{but under the}} leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community refused to allow the bishop to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight. According to Thomas, Norreis offered to renounce the abbey's claim to exemption in return for money, but the bishop refused. Norries then fled the monastery, while the monks continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated, a sentence that Norreis was spared. Between early September and mid-October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals, Mauger was supported by Eustace, Bishop of Ely, and Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. The <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger. As well as these two cases, there was a dispute between the <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> the bishop over the ownership of some properties. The <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by papal judge-delegates, but Mauger objected {{to the fact that the}} appointed judges were all Benedictine <b>monks,</b> <b>and</b> travelled to Rome to appeal.|$|E
5|$|The monastery hosts an {{impressive}} festival, {{popularly known as}} the ‘Sera Bengqin Festival’, which is largely attended by <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> devotees. The festival is held some time in February as per the Gregorian calendar corresponding to specific date fixed by the monastery according to the Tibetan calendar. On the festival day, a Dorje Pestle is ceremoniously taken to the Potala Palace. The Dalai Lama offers prayers to the Buddha to bestow strength and blesses the Pestle. Thereafter, the pestle is briefly placed on {{the heads of the}} <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> disciples by the Khenpo (president) of the Ngaba Zhacang.|$|E

5|$|Symeon {{remained}} at the Saint Macrina monastery, where many close disciples, both <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> secular people, gathered around him. At Saint Macrina he was free of monks who were averse to his discipline and zeal, and free from direct conflict with church authorities. He continued to honor Symeon the Studite—most of the clergy from Constantinople, along with many <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> laymen, joined him during those celebrations. He also wrote during that time and made himself accessible to all who wanted to see him. Symeon spent the last thirteen {{years of his life}} in exile, dying from dysentery on March 12, 1022. According to his biographer and disciple, Nicetas, Symeon foretold his own death many years previously, and on his last day called together all the monks to sing the funeral hymns.|$|E

5|$|Walter {{revived the}} scheme of his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, to found a church in Canterbury that would be secular and not monastic. He promised that the new foundation's canons {{would not be allowed}} to vote in archiepiscopal {{elections}} nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy. The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with the papacy supporting the <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope Innocent III ruled for the <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern of}} the chronicle was the {{acquisition}} of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber {{was used by the}} monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.|$|E

2500|$|Most episodes {{feature a}} {{sequence}} in which Monk reveals how {{the crime was}} committed, almost always prefaced with the words [...] "Here's what happened" [...] (or a variation of that phrase) and shown in black and white. Most of these sequences are featured {{near the end of}} the episode, but have occasionally occurred at the beginning ("Mr. Monk Takes the Stand") or towards the middle. Some of these sequences are told in an unusual fashion, such as being told to a bear ("Mr. Monk Goes Camping"), in the form of a bedtime story ("Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Kid"), being chanted during a ritual at a monastery ("Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Miracle"), in a dream ("Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra" [...] <b>and</b> [...] "Mr. <b>Monk's</b> Favorite Show"), being told by someone other than Monk (by Sharona in [...] "Mr. Monk Goes To Jail", by Natalie in [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Birds and the Bees", and by Disher in [...] "Mr. Monk Visits a Farm"), being rapped out by a rapper (guest star Snoop Dogg in [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Rapper"), and being told in another language ("Mr. Monk Falls in Love"). Harold Krenshaw gives a fictitious summation about Monk in [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy". Monk states a summation twice, in flashback and in present, in [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> Little Monk" [...] as himself <b>and</b> as young <b>Monk.</b> In at least three episodes ("Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Garbage Strike", [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> Gets Hypnotized", <b>and</b> [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Lady Next Door"), Monk gives multiple versions of the same summation, but all except for the last one are false as a result of his being unable to concentrate. In [...] "Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever", <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> Disher give simultaneous summations of different crimes.|$|R

5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways of {{thinking}} about the church and its personnel, derived not only from contemporary continental movements but also from the rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between <b>monks</b> <b>and</b> clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E
5|$|Chief Guest L K Advani {{declared}} the Games open. Shooter Anjali Bhagwat took the Athlete's Oath. This {{was followed by}} a laser show, fireworks and a space cannon show.

2500|$|While {{solving a}} murder {{is the main}} plot for most episodes, {{there are a few}} episodes in which Monk helps {{investigate}} other crimes, such as kidnappings in the season two episode [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Missing Granny" [...] and the season three episode [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Kid", or a failed murder plot in the season six episode [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Daredevil". There are a number of times where the episode is not about the murder itself but about finding evidence to arrest the killer, e.g. [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert", or [...] "Mr. <b>Monk</b> <b>and</b> the Genius", and episodes where the murder is related to the main plot, e.g. in [...] "Mr. Monk on Wheels".|$|R

Within three years after moving to St. Mammas, Symeon was tonsured as a monk, ordained as a priest, and elected as the abbot of the monastery.

5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard.

Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
