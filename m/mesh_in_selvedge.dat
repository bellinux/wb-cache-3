40|$|The exposed <b>selvedge</b> layers <b>in</b> slabs {{cast by the}} {{continuous}} process should be free from surface defects, which in most cases appear {{in the form of}} cracks on the casting surface and run to its interior. In addition to the parameters of the casting process, the occurrence of such defects depends on the chemical composition of cast steel, on the segregation of surface active elements and formation of the precipitates of carbides, nitrides and other phases. Due to the frequent occurrence of defects in corners of the slabs, non-destructive testing was performed on the mechanically cleaned surfaces of slabs. The test material was low-carbon API(American Petroleum Institute API 5 L standard) steel micro alloyed with Nb and Ti designed for the production of pipes to handle gas, oil and other liquid and gaseous fuels. Despite the use of different methods of inspection, i. e. ultrasonic, magnetic particle and penetrant, cracks were not traced in the examined material. Then, from the corners of the examined slabs, specimens were cut out for metallographic examinations. The main purpose of these examinations was to disclose the presence of possible cracks and micro cracks on the surfaces transversal and longitudinal to the direction of casting. At the same time, studies were conducted to establish the number and morphology of non-metallic inclusions <b>in</b> <b>selvedge</b> layers of the slab corners and axis. Additionally, hardness of the slabs was measured. The conducted studies revealed only some minor differences in the slab hardness along its axis (130 ÷ 135 HB) and <b>in</b> <b>selvedge</b> layers (120 ÷ 123 HB) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Some {{remarkable}} new Lagrange interpolation functions on rectan-gular Cartesian <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> two dimensions, and rectangular hexahedral <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> three dimensions, are developed. The first {{examples are}} linearly-complete {{with a common}} (constant) divergence or a common (constant) curl on each element or subdomain of the mesh. These are extended to quadratic-complete functions, and then extended to orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems, and affine <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> those systems. After revisiting the equation of motion for incompressible flow, the functions, with suitable constraints, are used with the finite element method (FEM) to solve the incompressible Stokes equation. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRegridding methods {{has become}} an {{important}} tool in the integration of PDE systems whose solutions exhibit sharp transitions in spatial derivatives. This paper improves the results presented in an earlier contribution of the author and F. Oliveira (1988). Theoretical justifications of finite differences regridding criteria for the transport and heat equations are presented. The nonuniform <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> the physical space are generated {{by the use of}} coordinate transforms which map them into uniform <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> the computational space. After the two mesh systems have been generated two approaches are used for solving the PDE: to construct the approximations on the uniform <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> the computational space or to construct the finite-difference approximations on the nonuniform <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> the physical space. In this paper we are concerned with the question {{of the relationship between the}} two approaches, namely the characterization of the mesh density (coordinate transform) which improves the spatial accuracy of the approximation in the physical (computational) space...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> vaginal prolapse surgery amongst members of the Dutch Urogynaecologic Society. STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire evaluating the use of mesh vs. native tissue repair in vaginal prolapse surgery was sent out by email to all members. Some specific questions on standard measures of infection prevention were included. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three completed questionnaires were received. The response rate was 65 %. Seventy-one percent of respondents stated that they apply use synthetic <b>meshes</b> <b>in</b> their patients. The mean percentage of <b>mesh</b> use <b>in</b> overall vaginal pelvic organ prolapse surgery was 14 %. Most responders use <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> recurrent surgery only. Prolift is {{the most commonly used}} brand. All women received prophylactic antibiotics. Although only half of the respondents changed gloves.

A follow-up visit was made after 2  months after the operation and the subjective outcome was assessed with a postal questionnaire 1  year postoperatively. An anterior <b>mesh</b> was used <b>in</b> 48, posterior <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> 45, total <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> five and combined anterior and posterior <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> two patients. All patients had one or more subjective symptoms. Forty-seven percent of the patients had undergone prolapse surgery and 16 % an anti-incontinence operation previously. Two patients had peroperative bleeding of more than 1, 000  ml, antibiotic treatment was needed in 28 patients and two hematomas were evacuated. A total of 16 patients underwent an anti-incontinence operation for de novo stress urinary incontinence. Four patients needed cystocele repair after a posterior mesh and eight patients posterior repair after an anterior mesh. The mesh exposure was diagnosed in 14 patients. No serious complications occurred. Fifty-three (60 %) patients reported all preoperative symptoms cured, 27 (30 %) reported persistent symptoms and five patients were hesitant. Of the respondents, 63 (71 %) were satisfied with the operation. We found that the mesh procedures were associated with a quite high amount of minor postoperative problems.|$|R
