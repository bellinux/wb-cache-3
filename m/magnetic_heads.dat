25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads,</b> usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.|$|E
25|$|Maxtor's product {{architecture}} used eight disks; 15 surfaces recorded {{data and}} the final surface was where the servo track information was located. The company developed its own spindle motor, which was fitted within the casting containing the disks. This was a major departure as the spindle motor was usually mounted external to the disks. The first product was designed to provide 190MB of storage, but delays in getting <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> to the Maxtor design resulted in the company taking what was available, and the first drive—the XT-1140—was shipped with a capacity of only 140MB. The company received an additional round of financing of approximately $37 million in 1984 before going public in 1985, with Goldman Sachs as the prime underwriter.|$|E

50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> {{inside the}} POS Terminal is a fixed {{component}} {{and for this}} reason it only can be cleared by cleaning cards that are flexible enough to clean the leading, center and trailing edges of this round reader head. The cleaning of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> is very important because it's responsible for the reading of the card and so it decides acceptance or rejection of the inserted card.The cleaning card is not only cleaning the reading area of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> which is cleared. There is also a cleaning process within the device along the card path. The cleaning in these high dirt build-up areas is especially important and ensures efficient cleaning of the card reader.|$|R

5000|$|The {{pinch roller}} is a rubberized, free-spinning wheel {{typically}} used to press magnetic tape against a capstan shaft {{in order to}} create friction necessary to drive the tape along the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> (erase, write, read).|$|E
50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one pinch roller located after the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single capstan shaft, providing a more stable transport across two sets of <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads.</b> Dual pinch rollers are also used (along with dual capstans) in auto-reverse cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one pinch roller is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{hard disk}} drives (HDD) {{technology}} {{are being developed}} continuously {{in order to increase}} the capacity, and reduce the size of HDD to meet user requirements. To increase the capacity which is equivalent to increasing read/write ability, the flying clearance must be reduced. Current new HDD models show that the fly height is lower than 0. 3 µm. If the height of a particle or contamination is higher than 0. 3 µm, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> will scratch the magnetic disk surface. However the process of cleaning in the HDD industry cannot remove particles with size smaller than 0. 3 µm[1]. Therefore laser cleaning is selected first because this method can remove small particles [2]. and it does not damage the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b> This research compares the range of temperature needed for cleaning the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> between two types of heat source’s profile. The technique used is the heat transfer by finite element: FEM[3]. This technique provides an important factor of the laser cleaning method that increases the efficiency of particle removal. It is also a non-destructive method for cleaning the surface of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> slider...|$|R

50|$|Shingled {{magnetic}} recording (SMR) is a magnetic storage data recording technology used in hard disk drives (HDDs) to increase storage density and overall per-drive storage capacity. Conventional hard disk drives record data by writing non-overlapping magnetic tracks parallel {{to each other}} (perpendicular recording), while shingled recording writes new tracks that overlap part of the previously written magnetic track, leaving the previous track narrower and allowing for higher track density. Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to roof shingles. This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.|$|E
50|$|Motorized {{readers are}} built in, for example ATMs. The credit/debit-card is {{inserted}} into the card slot, where the first <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> is placed. If a magnetic stripe can be recognized, a shutter will be opened and the card will be transported to the second <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> by roles. The card is read, thereby the device knows whether the transaction goes over the micro chip or the magnetic stripe. If no micro chip {{is placed on the}} card, the transaction goes directly above the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b> If the data gives the order for a transaction over the micro chip, the card is placed on the chip reading contact and is stopped. The chip contacts, are fitted on the chip and now the transaction begins. If the reading of the magnetic stripe respectively by the micro chip is not possible, the card will be declined.A cleaning card for a motorized card reader will need a magnetic stripe built into it to activate the acceptance shutter.|$|R

50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> {{acts as a}} {{stimulus}} on the PUF and amplifies the random magnetic signal. Because of the complex interaction of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head,</b> influenced by speed, pressure, direction and acceleration, with the random components of the PUF, each swipe of the <b>head</b> over the <b>magnetic</b> PUF will yield a stochastic, but very distinctive signal.

The odds of the same notes recurring in an exact pattern from a single card swiped many times are 1 in 100 million, but overall the melody remains very recognizable.|$|R

A series of twelve movable <b>magnetic</b> <b>heads</b> (one each recording head and erasing head, and ten playback heads) were positioned around the disk, {{in contact with the}} tape. A sound up to four seconds long could be recorded on the looped tape and the ten playback heads would then read the information with different delays, according to their (adjustable) positions around the disk. A separate amplifier and band-pass filter for each head could modify the spectrum of the sound, and additional feedback loops could transmit the information to the recording head. The resulting repetitions of a sound occurred at different time intervals, and could be filtered or modified through feedback. This system was also easily capable of producing artificial reverberation or continuous sounds [...]|$|E
