50|$|Post Spacing: Intermediate posts are posts {{which provide}} {{mounting}} {{for the top}} rail and have a vertical row of holes to support the cable as it passes through them. Since the post to post spacing is a primary driver of cable rigidity, the post to post spacing is very important. It is generally recommended that post spacing {{be no more than}} 5 ft on center Some manufacturers require as little as no more than 3 ft on center. The reason for post spacing is more about the cable end fittings' <b>machine</b> <b>thread</b> loading capacity (how much tension can be put on the threads before they fail), than anything else. The more cable drop in the middle, the more weight on the tensioning device, ergo the more load on the threads. Proof strength must be greater than load.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} the evolution of a sequencer from a simple EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) based sequencer into a complex implementation designed utilizing UML (Unified Modeling Language) methodologies and a CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool approach. The main purpose of the sequencer (called the IF Sequencer) is to provide overall control of the Keck Interferometer to enable science operations be carried out by a single operator (and/or observer). The interferometer links the two 10 m telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The IF Sequencer is a high-level, multi-threaded, Hare 1 finite state machine, software program designed to orchestrate several lower-level hardware and software hard real time subsystems that must perform their work in a specific and sequential order. The sequencing need not be done in hard real-time. Each state <b>machine</b> <b>thread</b> commands either a high-speed real-time multiple mode embedded controller via CORB A, or slower controllers via EPICS Channel Access interfaces. The overall operation of the system is simplified by the automation. The UML is discussed and our use of it to implement the sequencer is presented. The decision to use the Rhapsody product as our CASE tool is explained and reflected upon. Most importantly, a section on lessons learned is presented and the difficulty of integrating CASE tool automatically generated C++ code into a large control system consisting of multiple infrastructures is presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThread milling is {{becoming}} more and more employed as a technique for producing thread, due to its advantages for industrial manufacturing sectors, such as the aeronautics, aerospace, and energy industries. The thread milling operation is atypical and several aspects have to be taken into account to perform it in good conditions. As for milling or grinding worms, grooves, thread or others sculptured surfaces, in thread milling, there exists a geometrical interference between the tool and the nominal surface which would be obtained. Thread mills have quite complex geometry and their profile has an effect on the <b>machined</b> <b>thread.</b> The present study details geometrical aspects of the thread milling process. This article deals with the link between thread mill geometry and nominal thread profile. An approach is proposed to analyze the thread profile generated by the thread mill envelope. It is deduced that thread milling produces interferences, i. e. the <b>machined</b> <b>thread</b> profile is affected by an overcut. A method is proposed to correct this geometrical error in order to produce accurate thread...|$|R

40|$|While {{there have}} been many studies of how to {{schedule}} applications to take advantage of increasing numbers of cores in modern-day multicore processors, few have focused on multi-threaded managed language applications which are prevalent from the embedded to the server domain. Managed languages complicate performance studies because they have additional virtual <b>machine</b> <b>threads</b> that collect garbage and dynamically compile, closely interacting with application threads. Further complexity is introduced as modern multicore machines have multiple sockets and dynamic frequency scaling options, broadening opportunities to reduce both power and running time. In this paper, we explore the performance of Java applications, studying how best to map application and virtual <b>machine</b> (JVM) <b>threads</b> to a multicore, multi-socket environment. We explore both the cost of separating JVM threads from application threads, and the opportunity to speed up or slow down the clock frequency of isolated threads. We perform experiments with the multi-threaded DaCapo benchmarks and pseudojbb 2005 running on the Jikes Research Virtual Machine, on a dual-socket, 8 -core Intel Nehalem machine to reveal several novel, and sometimes counterintuitive, findings. We believe these insights are a first but important step towards understanding and optimizing managed language performance on modern hardware...|$|R

Preface In practical production process, <b>machining</b> of internal <b>thread</b> for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for internal thread, but this method is difficult to <b>machine</b> internal <b>thread</b> of parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole of the <b>thread</b> after <b>machining</b> process, and then using tapper to obtain the internal thread manually or with machine.

It also lead to low efficiency, low accuracy of the perpendicularity error of thread. What’s more, tapper are always likely to break during tapping process, especially for parts with small diameter, and the depth of the thread is hard to control.
