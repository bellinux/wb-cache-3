With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E

500|$|Swedenborg's {{concepts}} are explored with relation to language, pain, memory, and dreams. When the students {{take a trip}} to the nearby Château de Rochambeau, for example, Lambert, who has never visited the château, nevertheless recalls vivid memories of the place from a dream. Believing his spirit visited the place while his body slept, he ascribes the experience to [...] "a complete severance of <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> my inner being" [...] and [...] "some inscrutable locomotive faculty in the spirit with effects resembling those of locomotion in the body".|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Tyler {{played the}} object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy One Night at McCool's.

Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough."

500|$|What I went through, only I {{will ever}} know. My knee cap {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> <b>And</b> the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E
500|$|The {{son of a}} {{landowner}} from Tanabe, Ueshiba {{studied a}} number of martial arts in his youth, and served in the Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War. After being discharged in 1907, he moved to Hokkaidō {{as the head of}} a pioneer settlement; here he met and studied with Takeda Sōkaku, the founder of Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu. On leaving Hokkaido in 1919, Ueshiba joined the Ōmoto-kyō movement, a Shinto sect, in Ayabe, where he served as a martial arts instructor and opened his first dojo. He accompanied the head of the Ōmoto-kyō group, Onisaburo Deguchi, on an expedition to Mongolia in 1924, where they were captured by Chinese troops and returned to Japan. The following year, he had a profound spiritual experience, stating that, [...] "a golden spirit sprang up from the ground, veiled <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> changed my body into a golden one." [...] After this experience, his martial arts skill appeared to be greatly increased.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} looked back on Neighborhoods more {{recently}} with a divided reaction. In 2012, DeLonge would {{concede that the}} recording method, originally his idea, led {{to a loss of}} unity, noting that e-mails dictated the majority of recording of the record, due to the hectic schedules of the band. [...] "There's some songs on there that I love, {{but for the most part}} it was disconnected," [...] Barker recalled. [...] "It was like, 'You do this part in your studio, and then you're gonna play on it and send it back to me.' When we're not in the studio together, you don't have the opportunity to gel off each other." [...] In addition, Barker was still recovering from his 2008 plane crash, which made things difficult in the studio. [...] "Dude, I was still healing," [...] he told Rolling Stone. [...] "I had scabs all over <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> was, like, a bloody mess. It was just way too soon." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{compilation}} album, {{the composition of}} its songs spans across a period of six years, charting {{the evolution of the}} band's alternative rock sound. The opening tracks on the album, which are from the band's first recording session, exhibit the band's early style, noted for its abrasive guitar work (heavily influenced by noise rock, grindcore, and no wave music) and literate, aggressive lyrics, many of which mix derogatory language with cryptic and religious themes. In particular, [...] "Retard Girl" [...] is a narrative of a girl being abused and made fun of on a playground. [...] "Turpentine", as well as [...] "Retard Girl", feature historical and religious references as well: [...] "Turpentine" [...] features lyrics alluding to Christianity ("I know all you devils by your Christian names / And I know all you bitches by your Christian names", [...] "Bless <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> bless my soul / Wrap it in turpentine"), while a line from [...] "Retard Girl", which reads: [...] "As shines the moon among the lesser fires", is directly referenced from Odes, a book of Latin poems by Roman poet Horace.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} The Night the Sun Came Up, Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani {{named the}} song the album's best track. He pointed out that, unlike {{the rest of}} the album, [...] "In the Dark" [...] avoids [...] "too-aggressive beats and chintzy synths" [...] and instead relies on Dev's [...] "ooh la la" [...] hook and the [...] "sleek" [...] saxophone line. Cinquemani concluded by writing that the song is [...] "almost enough to forgive [...] for 'Like a G6'." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger named [...] "In the Dark" [...] the [...] "Song of the Week" [...] and compared its saxophone line to Alexandra Stan's [...] "Mr. Saxobeat", and said that while the latter is [...] "total Euroschlock", [...] "In the Dark" [...] preserves [...] "some of the mechanized detachment" [...] of Dev's song [...] "Booty Bounce" [...] (2010). McCall was mixed regarding [...] "In the Dark"'s lyrical content and called the line [...] "do your work on me/Open up <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> do some surgery" [...] the [...] "grossest pillow talk" [...] since The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "My Humps". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Shahryar Rizvi was negative in his review of the song and criticized the [...] "cheesy" [...] saxophone sound, saying that it [...] "serves well to show just how mediocre this song is". LA Weekly writer Shea Serrano regarded the song as [...] "predictable" [...] and dismissed the metaphors, labeling them [...] "confusing".|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E
