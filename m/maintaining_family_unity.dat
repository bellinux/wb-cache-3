In the opening paragraphs of his memoir, he comments on his career in education: “I have learned much about the ways of immigrant peoples and their American-born children. I was an immigrant boy myself. I know what the American school can do to <b>maintain</b> <b>family</b> <b>unity.</b> I also know how the school can function as the integrating force in our democracy and in the molding of young citizens.” [...] As an educator and community leader, he was {{a firm believer in}} the power of the school in shaping neighborhoods and the lives of new immigrants to the United States.|$|R
40|$|Although {{immigration}} policies directly implicate the undocumented individual, {{it is important}} to note that generally undocumented immigrants are not living in the U. S. alone- they have a family. Therefore, when undocumented parents are faced with orders of deportation, not only are they the ones affected by it, but so are their U. S. citizen children. This report sheds light on the various ways current {{immigration policies}} negatively impact U. S. citizen children of undocumented parents. Through court cases, narratives and stories, I analyze how the constitutional rights of U. S. born children are violated when their undocumented parents are either (a) forced to relocate to their native country and decide to bring their children with them to <b>maintain</b> <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> or (b) when parents are detained and/or deported and forced to leave behind their children, which results in children being placed in foster care. Instead of protecting what the U. S. claims to value the most, immigration policies are destroying the family sanctity and violating constitutional rights of American citizens...|$|R
40|$|Leading {{civil rights}} advocates today lament {{the degree to}} which current {{immigration}} law fails to <b>maintain</b> <b>family</b> <b>unity.</b> The recent passage of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 is a rare bipartisan {{step in the right direction}} because it grants automatic citizenship to foreign-born children of U. S. citizens upon receipt of their permanent resident status and finalization of their adoption. Congress now has before it the Family Reunification Act of 2001, which aims to restore certain procedural safeguards relaxed in 1996 to ensure that foreign-born parents are not summarily separated from their children, many of whom may be U. S. citizens. Because it usually takes both children and parents to create a family, my hope is that Congress will look just as favorably upon the seemingly more complex, but actually less extraordinary, measures suggested in the Family Reunification Act as it did with the Child Citizenship Act of 2000. My fear, however, is that despite its promised gains, embedded within the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 are assumptions that will make passage of key parts of the Family Reunification Act difficult if not impossible. One of these assumptions is that criminal adult legal permanent residents (LPRs) are presumptively deportable unless they happen to be a citizen 2 ̆ 7 s adopted child...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to study}} the attitudes towards Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) {{in a group of}} Muslim immigrants. To this end, six focus-groups were {{conducted}} involving 42 first-generation Muslim immigrants (21 males and 21 females) from Pakistan, Egypt and Morocco. Focus groups transcripts were then analyzed using the software ATLAS. ti. Irrespectively of nationality, couples replicate relational models learnt in their country of origin, implying a rigid gender-based role division. Women are considered less socially competent if compared to men and therefore in need of protection. Divorce is possible only in case of severe danger: women have to stand beside their husbands and <b>maintain</b> <b>family</b> <b>unity.</b> Even though they are not directly related to IPV, these factors may be key in determining its onset and perpetration. With regards to ethnic background, Pakistani interviewees not only seem to acknowledge the possible occurrence of violence within couple relationships, they also accept it as a mean to regulate socially dysfunctional behaviors. Both Moroccan males and females denounce the impact of post migration stressors as potential triggers of IPV. The distance from one’s family of origin in migration is perceived as problematic by both men and women, however, while males’ distance from their kin might make them feel overwhelmed with family responsibilities and give way to deviant behaviors, women suffer from the lack of support and protection by their extended family. Implications for practice are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this ethnographic study is to {{describe}} and analyse professional and lay care in the Bena cultural context in the Tanzanian village of Ilembula. The study focuses on care as a cultural phenomenon. The structure {{of the study is}} based on M. M. Leininger's (1991) Culture Care Theory In {{the first phase of the}} study, care was described from a professional perspective. The data were collected by interviewing and observing trained nurses (n= 6) in the wards of Ilembula Lutheran Hospital. The study material was complemented with the data obtained from informants' diaries and institutional documents. The data were analysed by using qualitative ethnonursing analysis. In the second phase of the study, the focus was on lay care. The fieldwork was done in the Ilembula village and Ilembula Lutheran Hospital. The data were collected by interviewing villagers (n= 49) and relatives (n= 12) of patients admitted to Ilembula Lutheran Hospital, and by observing their care practices. The data were analysed by qualitative content analyses with regard to the cultural context. Curing and caring were the characteristics of professional care, as described by the nurse informants. Curing was linked to skills and knowledge obtained in nurse training and it was demonstrated through technical interventions, medication and health education. Caring referred to a natural mother-child relationship and reflected the traditional cultural knowledge. Caring was demonstrated in primary care, meaning a mother's responsibilities in taking care of a small baby, encouragement and comfort. The patient's recovery and maintenance of health were the goals of professional care. Respect and protection were the characteristics of lay care, reflecting the worldview and cultural values of the Bena. The aim of respect was to <b>maintain</b> <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> and to ensure wellbeing, while protection focused on the sensitive phases of the Bena life span. The main meaning of lay care for the informants was health maintenance and improvement of health. Health included physical, mental and reproductive aspects, and enabled them to respond to the culturally determined role expectations. The aim of this ethnographic study was to demonstrate that care is integral to much more comprehensive socio-cultural issues in the context of a Tanzanian village. The study demonstrates the meaning of cultural and social factors, such as cultural values and lifeways, kinship, economic, educational, and ethnohistory in both professional and lay care. The findings can be utilised in transcultural nursing education and in clinical nursing practice, especially in developing patient education from a transcultural perspective, not only in Tanzania, but internationally...|$|R

40|$|Competing values {{underlie}} U. S. {{immigration law}} and child welfare law. Immigration law often operates {{in ways that}} intentionally hinder <b>family</b> <b>unity,</b> which in the child welfare context enjoys tremendous constitutional protection. First, the operation of immigration law undermines <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> by failing to recognize the variety of family structures that exist, which has profound implications for millions of mixed status families, that is, families in which all family members do not hold the same immigration status. Second, immigration law hinders <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> {{because it does not}} recognize children 2 ̆ 7 s interests as a valid factor in immigration decisions, thereby failing {{to take into account the}} best interests of the child, a concept that otherwise is universally recognized in child welfare law. Despite the U. S. immigration system 2 ̆ 7 s exceptional disregard for <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> and the best interests of the child, immigration status can become an issue in many contexts outside of immigration proceedings, from state intervention through child protection agencies to state court decisions in parent custody disputes. Therefore, systems and policies that affect immigrant children and their families must recognize the competing values underlying immigration law and child welfare law or risk importing improperly the immigration systems’ values into other contexts in ways that discourage <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> and negatively impact children...|$|R

Chapter III will examine state practice in this area generally, legislation relating to and affecting the implementation of the rights to <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> and reunification, case law jurisprudence (where applicable), administrative and procedural challenges and how these impact on the implementation of these rights. The jurisprudence of the European Commission and Court as well as the framework of the European Union, the United States and Canada (which are major asylum countries in North America) and the regime under the African human rights system will be discussed. Chapter IV {{will examine the}} framework of specialised agencies, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nationas Office of the High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), in the implementation of these rights. The responsibility for realising family reunification for the unaccompanied refugee child rests on both the states and specialised agencies. This chapter will examine the various documents on the protection of the unaccompanied refugee child's rights to <b>family</b> <b>unity</b> and reunification by the UNHCR, ICRC and other specialized agencies and NGOs especially in the area of <b>family</b> tracing, <b>unity</b> and reunificaiton rights of the refugee child during the conflict. This chapter will also examine other alternatives to family reunification such as fostering, adoption and institutional care. The aims is to determine how successful these agencies have been in the realisation of their mandate as it related to the family rights of the unaccompanied refugee child. Chapter V will make recommendations on more effective ways for implementing the rights. " [...] Introduction.
