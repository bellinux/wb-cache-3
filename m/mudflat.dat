5|$|In 1985, Humphrey swam into San Francisco Bay {{and then}} up the Sacramento River towards Rio Vista. Five years later, Humphrey {{returned}} and became stuck on a <b>mudflat</b> in San Francisco Bay immediately north of Sierra Point below the view of onlookers from the upper floors of the Dakin Building.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{species of}} concern at the Darby Creek Mouth <b>Mudflat</b> include Amaranthus cannabinus, Baccharis halimifolia, Bidens bidentoides, Bidens laevis, Eleocharis obtusa, Eleocharis parvula, Heteranthera multiflora, Lycopus rubellus, Pluchea odorata, Sagittaria calycina, Sagittaria subulata, Schoenoplectus fluviatilis, and Zizania aquatica. Some, such as Eleocharis obtusa, Eleocharis parvula, and Heteranthera multiflora, {{have not been}} seen since 1994. However, four other species {{have been seen as}} {{recently}} as 2009.|$|E
5|$|The town of Milford Haven lies on {{the north}} bank of the Milford Haven waterway, which is a ria or drowned valley. This is a {{landscape}} of low-lying wooded shorelines, creeks and mudflats. There {{has been a great}} deal of loss and degradation of local <b>mudflat</b> habitat as a result of industrial and commercial development – one study indicated a 45 per cent loss in Hubberston Pill.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mudflats</b> contain organisms {{which are}} a major food source for worms and invertebrates. Fishes, sharks and rays would often come to the <b>mudflats</b> with the tides and feed on {{transient}} or permanent residing fish. Shorebirds also depend on preying invertebrates on the <b>mudflats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dyfi Estuary <b>Mudflats</b> are <b>mudflats</b> on the estuary of the River Dyfi in Ceredigion, Wales, and {{are part}} of the Dyfi National Nature Reserve.|$|R
50|$|The {{maintenance}} of <b>mudflats</b> {{is important in}} preventing coastal erosion. However, <b>mudflats</b> worldwide are under threat from predicted sea level rises, land claims for development, dredging due to shipping purposes, and chemical pollution. In {{some parts of the}} world, such as East and South-East Asia, <b>mudflats</b> have been reclaimed for aquaculture, agriculture, and industrial development. For example, around the Yellow Sea region of East Asia, more than 65% of <b>mudflats</b> present in the early 1950s had been destroyed by the late 2000s.|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal <b>mudflat</b> in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Lenni Lenape people {{inhabited}} {{the area in}} the vicinity of Darby Creek. By the 17th century, the Dutch and Swedish had arrived in the area, followed some years later by the English. Numerous mills of various types were eventually build along the creek and several railroads traversed the watershed. In modern times, grants by various organizations have been awarded to improve the creek and its watershed. The Darby Creek Valley Association operates within the watershed. Part of the creek's length is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, part is a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Various species of fish, including redbreast sunfish, eels, and trout, inhabit it. Several areas {{in the vicinity of the}} creek are listed on the Delaware County Natural Areas Inventory. These include the Darby Creek Mouth <b>Mudflat,</b> the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, and the Ithan-Darby Creek Wetlands. A reach of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|The Weald Clay {{formation}} {{consists of}} sediments of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) in age, about 130–125 million years old. The B.walkeri holotype {{was found in}} the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a fluvial or <b>mudflat</b> environment with shallow water, lagoons, and marsh. During the Early Cretaceous, the Weald area of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-brackish water Wealden Lake. Two large rivers drained the northern area (where London now stands), flowing into the lake through a river delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was sub-tropical, similar to the present Mediterranean region. Since the Smokejacks Pit consists of different stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the ornithopods Mantellisaurus, Iguanodon, and small sauropods. Other vertebrates include sharks (such as Hybodus), bony fishes (including Scheenstia), crocodiles, and pterosaurs. Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including Valditermes, Archisphex, and Pterinoblattina. Other invertebrates include ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants Weichselia and the aquatic, herbaceous Bevhalstia were common. Other plants found include ferns, horsetails, club mosses, and conifers.|$|E
50|$|As the Gatalympics became famous, the <b>mudflats</b> {{that had}} been {{neglected}} before were improved in condition and status. Under a new perspective, the <b>mudflats</b> became an important and valued symbol {{for the growth of}} the city as a whole. It was therefore natural that the <b>mudflats</b> became the central reason for which Kashima is now recognized for.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mudflats,</b> sand flats, swamps, {{beaches and}} rocky shores {{form part of}} the {{wetlands}} in Manila Bay. Found mostly {{along the coast of}} Bataan andPampanga, <b>mudflats</b> are suitable habitats for shellfish.|$|R
50|$|The {{receding}} shore - line form <b>mudflats</b> and mud spits from October onwards {{which provide}} organic matter, worms, insects and molluscs for wintering birds and plovers. Wagtails, sand larks and pipits {{also use the}} <b>mudflats.</b>|$|R

25|$|The North Sea Trail is {{a long-distance}} trail linking seven {{countries}} around the North Sea. Windsurfing and sailing are popular sports because of the strong winds. <b>Mudflat</b> hiking, recreational fishing and birdwatching are among other activities.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1957, a Douglas DC-3 {{registered}} AP-AJS, {{operating a}} domestic flight from Chittagong to Dhaka in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), crashed on a <b>mudflat</b> in the Bay of Bengal, killing all twenty passengers and four crew members on board.|$|E
50|$|On the Baltic Sea {{coast of}} Germany in places, <b>mudflats</b> are exposed not by tidal action, but by wind-action driving water {{away from the}} {{shallows}} into the sea. These wind-affected <b>mudflats</b> are called windwatts in German.|$|R
50|$|An area of <b>mudflats</b> 22 ha on the {{southern}} side of the river, near Iken, is managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust as their Alde <b>Mudflats</b> nature reserve however there is no public access to prevent a human disturbance.|$|R
50|$|The {{north end}} is {{dominated}} by shallow <b>mudflats.</b> An important stopover for migratory birds, the <b>mudflats</b> and marsh are {{the location of the}} Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge. The southern end is also shallow and often freezes during the winter.|$|R
25|$|Between 1989 and 1996, {{areas of}} {{cultivated}} shallow sea were increased from 25,200 to 114,200 hectares, areas of <b>mudflat</b> from 266,800 to 533,100 hectares, {{and areas of}} bay from 131,300 to 174,800 hectares. The 1979 production was 415,900 tonnes on 117,000 hectares, and the 1996 production was 4.38 million tonnes on 822,000 hectares.|$|E
25|$|In the San Francisco Bay Area, {{specific}} {{locations where}} {{one would expect}} to see this bird are Richardson Bay (especially, according to <b>mudflat</b> bird sightings, the mouth of Pickleweed Creek), mudflats of Belmont Slough, mudflats of Seal Slough in San Mateo, salt ponds in Hayward, California, exposed bay muds on the Burlingame estuarine shore, and Heron's Head Park at India Basin.|$|E
25|$|Another summer {{tradition}} in Büsum are Wattenlaufen mit Musik and Wattenpolonaise. It was first practiced in 1900 when spa guest Julius Scholz recognized the healing effects of <b>mudflat</b> hiking. To combine treatment with entertainment, spa guests can accompany a band marching {{out on the}} Wadden Sea to the water line during low tide, stopping at regular intervals for dancing and games.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mudflats</b> are {{typically}} important regions for wildlife, supporting a large population, although levels of biodiversity {{are not particularly}} high. They are of particular importance to migratory birds. In the United Kingdom <b>mudflats</b> have been classified as a Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitat.|$|R
5000|$|The Kilmaluag Formation is {{composed}} of limestones, fine grain sandstones, and mudstones, indicating that it alternated between a shallow marine environment, and lagoonal <b>mudflats,</b> as the basin subsided and rose causing sea levels to fluctuate. [...] These <b>mudflats</b> sometimes dried out to form desiccation cracks.|$|R
50|$|The Marion Bay Important Bird Area {{is on the}} {{south-western}} side of Marion Bay, south-eastern Tasmania, Australia. It {{includes two}} sandy, high-energy, oceanic beaches, Marion Bay Beach and North Bay Beach, encompasses the privately owned Long Spit Nature Reserve, and extends through the entrance of Blackman Bay to the intertidal <b>mudflats</b> within. The beaches and <b>mudflats</b> form a single system used by waders, or shorebirds; the storm-swept beaches of the outer bay contrast with and complement the sheltered <b>mudflats</b> and sand-bars of the inner bay.|$|R
25|$|Mammals {{such as the}} Harbor seal may use mudflats to {{haul out}} of estuary waters; however, larger mammals such as {{humpback}} whales may become accidentally stranded at low tides. Note that normally humpback whales do not frequent estuaries containing mudflats, {{but at least one}} errant whale, publicized by the media as Humphrey the humpback whale, became stuck on a <b>mudflat</b> in San Francisco Bay at Sierra Point in Brisbane, California.|$|E
25|$|On the island, {{the bicycle}} {{is the main}} means of {{transport}} next to cars; compared {{to other areas of}} Germany, Amrum provides an excellent network of bicycle routes. Numerous rental services may provide tourists with bicycles. A bus service connects Norddorf, Nebel and Wittdün on an hourly schedule (every 30 minutes even during the summer season). Like the ferries, the bus service is operated by W.D.R.. A less common form of transport is <b>mudflat</b> hiking between Amrum and Föhr.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in {{her only}} non-operatic acting role, as the Greek mythological {{character}} of Medea, in his film by that name. The production was grueling, {{and according to}} the account in Ardoin's Callas, the Art and the Life, Callas is said to have fainted after a day of strenuous running back and forth on a <b>mudflat</b> in the sun. The film was not a commercial success, but as Callas's only film appearance, it documents her stage presence.|$|E

25|$|San Francisco Bay's profile changed {{dramatically}} in the late 19th century and again with the initiation of dredging by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the 20th century. Before about 1860, most bay shores (with the exception of rocky shores, {{such as those in}} Carquinez Strait; along Marin shoreline; Point Richmond; Golden Gate area) contained extensive wetlands that graded nearly invisibly from freshwater wetlands to salt marsh and then tidal <b>mudflat.</b> A deep channel ran {{through the center of the}} bay, following the ancient drowned river valley.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic organisms {{spend all}} or part of their lives in the open water, where habitat is defined not by edges but by {{physiological}} tolerance to salinity and temperature. The Low Salinity Zone (LSZ) of the San Francisco Estuary constitutes a habitat for a suite of organisms that are specialized to survive in this unique confluence of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine influences. While there are many habitats with distinct ecologies {{that are part of the}} estuary (including marine, freshwater, intertidal marsh and benthic <b>mudflat</b> systems) each is linked to the LSZ by export and import of freshwater, nutrients, carbon, and organisms.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation of land {{upstream}} from the salt marsh can introduce increased silt inputs {{and raise the}} rate of primary sediment accretion on the tidal flats, so that pioneer species can spread further onto the flats and grow rapidly upwards out {{of the level of}} tidal inundation. As a result, marsh surfaces in this regime may have an extensive cliff at their seaward edge. At the Plum Island estuary, Massachusetts (U.S.A), stratigraphic cores revealed that during the 18th and 19th century the marsh prograded over subtidal and <b>mudflat</b> environments to increase in area from 6km2 to 9km2 after European settlers deforested the land uptream and increased the rate of sediment supply.|$|E
