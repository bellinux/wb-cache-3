The real field for Hungarian authors is the alternative market, where 31 different Hungarian comics were published in 2009.

25|$|Religious reformers {{played a}} large role in {{developing}} and disseminating ideas with <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodicals</b> like al-Imam published in Singapore by Tahir Jalaluddin between 1906 and 1908, and al-Munir published in Penang by Abdullah Ahmad between 1911 and 1916. These in turn were primarily influenced by the Egyptian Islamic reform magazine, al-Manar published in Cairo by Rashid Rida from 1898 to 1936. While these publications were primarily concerned with the Islamic religion, it also touched extensively on the social, political and economic conditions of the Malays.|$|E
500|$|As {{educational}} opportunities were made {{available in the}} 19th-century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, and some founded their own art associations. Artwork made by women {{was considered to be}} inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became, according to art historian Laura Prieto, [...] "increasingly vocal and confident" [...] in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern, and freer [...] "New Woman", a movement which O'Neill was heavily involved in. According to Prieto, artists [...] "played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives". [...] In the late 19th century and early 20th century, about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodicals</b> were women. As women entered the artist community, publishers hired women to create illustrations that depicted the world from a woman's perspective. Other successful illustrators were Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green, and Violet Oakley.|$|E

500|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1820s, Willis began {{contributing}} more frequently to <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodicals.</b> In 1829, he served as editor for the gift book The Token, making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, Samuel Griswold Goodrich. That year, Willis founded the American Monthly Magazine, which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831. He blamed its failure on the [...] "tight purses of Boston culture" [...] and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the New York Mirror. In 1832, while in Florence, Italy, he met Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of the writer. Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the Mirror, about half of which were later collected as Pencillings by the Way, printed in London in 1835. The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.|$|E

Smith preferred to create illustrations for covers and stories, and also illustrated advertisements, which bore her signature.

60|$|The chamber {{in which}} the bewildered Robert now found himself was more luxurious, if less rich, than any which he had yet seen. Low settees of claret-coloured plush were {{scattered}} in orderly disorder over a mossy Eastern carpet. Deep lounges, reclining sofas, American rocking-chairs, all were to be had for the choosing. One {{end of the room}} was walled by glass, and appeared to open upon a luxuriant hot-house. At the further end a double line of gilt rails supported a profusion of the most recent <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodicals.</b> A rack at each side of the inlaid fireplace sustained a long line of the pipes of all places and nations--English cherrywoods, French briars, German china-bowls, carved meerschaums, scented cedar and myall-wood, with Eastern narghiles, Turkish chibooques, and two great golden-topped hookahs. To right and left were a series of small lockers, extending in a treble row for the whole length of the room, with the names of the various brands of tobacco scrolled in ivory work across them. Above were other larger tiers of polished oak, which held cigars and cigarettes.|$|E
6000|$|SCENE: [...] The {{library of}} ASHER PINDAR'S house in Foxon Falls, a New England [...] village of some three {{thousand}} souls, over the destinies of which [...] the Pindars for three generations have presided. It is a large, [...] dignified room, built {{early in the}} nineteenth century, with white [...] doors and gloss woodwork. At {{the rear of the}} stage,--which is the [...] front of the house,--are three high windows with small, square panes [...] of glass, and embrasures into which are fitted white inside [...] shutters. These windows reach to within a foot or so of the floor; [...] a person walking on the lawn or the sidewalk just beyond it may be [...] seen through them. The trees bordering the Common are also seen [...] through these windows, and through a gap in the foliage a glimpse of [...] the terraced steeple of the Pindar Church, the architecture of which [...] is of the same period as the house. Upper right, {{at the end of the}} [...] wall, is a glass door looking out on the lawn. There is another [...] door, lower right, and a door, lower left, leading into ASHER [...] PINDAR'S study. A marble mantel, which holds a clock and certain [...] ornaments, is just beyond this door. The wall spaces on the right [...] and left are occupied by high bookcases filled with respectable [...] volumes in calf and dark cloth bindings. Over the mantel is an [...] oil painting of the Bierstadt school, cherished by ASHER as an [...] inheritance from his father, a huge landscape with a self-conscious [...] sky, mountains, plains, rivers and waterfalls, and two small figures [...] of Indians--who seem to have been talking to a missionary. In the [...] spaces between the windows are two steel engravings, [...] "The Death of [...] Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham" [...] and [...] "Washington Crossing the [...] Delaware!" [...] The furniture, with the exception of a few heirlooms, [...] such as the stiff sofa, is mostly of the Richardson period of the [...] '80s and '90s. On a table, middle rear, are neatly spread out [...] several conservative <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodicals,</b> including a [...] religious publication.|$|E
