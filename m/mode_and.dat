It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative <b>mode</b> <b>and</b> traditional deathmatch settings. Perfect Dark was developed {{over the course of}} three years and is technically one of the most advanced games for the Nintendo 64, offering an optional high resolution graphics mode, widescreen support, and Dolby's surround sound.

30|$|In this study, a power {{consumption}} model {{as a function}} of the traffic is developed for macrocell base stations based on measurements on an actual base station. This model allows us to develop energy-efficient wireless access networks by combining the Green radio access network design (GRAND) tool designed by the authors, which develops an always-on network with a minimal {{power consumption}} for a predefined area, and an algorithm that introduces power reducing techniques in the network such as sleep <b>modes</b> <b>and</b> cell zooming. Green-field deployments and optimization of existing networks are investigated. For a green-field deployment, it was found that introducing sleep <b>modes</b> <b>and</b> cell zooming in the network can reduce the power consumption by up to 14.4 % compared to the network without sleep <b>modes</b> <b>and</b> cell zooming. Optimizing existing networks by applying GRAND (without sleep <b>modes</b> <b>and</b> cell zooming) results in a power consumption reduction of 34.5 % compared to the original network. A careful selection of base station locations already results in a significant energy saving. Introducing sleep <b>modes</b> <b>and</b> cell zooming to the current networks results in a saving of 8 %. Sleep <b>modes</b> <b>and</b> cell zooming are promising energy-saving techniques for future wireless networks.|$|R

Guilty Gear Isuka received mixed critical reviews. It was praised for its visual, music and customization features. However, although some aspects of the new gameplay—such as the two fighting planes and the turn button—were praised as original, their implementation was criticized.
