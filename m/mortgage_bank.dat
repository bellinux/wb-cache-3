The Bank in Winterthur, founded in 1862 {{with an initial}} share capital of CHF 5million, focused on {{providing}} financing for industry and other companies, and had profited considerably from its close railroad connections and large warehousing facilities during the American Civil War when cotton prices rose dramatically. The Toggenburger Bank was founded in 1863 with an initial share capital of CHF 1.5million, and specialized as a savings and <b>mortgage</b> <b>bank</b> for individual customers, maintaining a branch office network in eastern Switzerland.|$|E

25|$|Perón's {{government}} is remembered for its record social investments. He introduced a Ministry of Health to the cabinet; its first head, the neurologist Ramón Carrillo, oversaw {{the completion of}} over 4,200 health care facilities. Related works included construction of more than 1,000 kindergartens and over 8,000 schools, including several hundred technological, nursing and teachers' schools, among an array of other public investments. The new Minister of Public Works, General Juan Pistarini, oversaw the construction of 650,000 new, public sector homes, {{as well as of}} the international airport, one of the largest in the world at the time. The reactivation of the dormant National <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bank</b> spurred private-sector housing development: averaging over 8 units per 1,000 inhabitants (150,000 a year), the pace was, at the time, at par with that of the United States and one of the highest rates of residential construction in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} decrease {{resulted in a}} labor shortage in the agriculture, which again resulted in increased use of machinery and thus capital. The government stimulated the process {{through the creation of}} the <b>Mortgage</b> <b>Bank</b> in 1851 and the State Agricultural College eight years later. The 19th century saw a large increase of road construction and steamship services commenced along the coast. The first railway, the Trunk Line between Christiania and Eidsvoll opened in 1854, followed a year later by the first telegraph line. Export industry commenced with steam-powered sawmills in the 1860s, followed by canned herring, wood pulp and cellulose. From 1850 to 1880 the Norwegian shipping industry enjoyed a large boom, stimulated by the abolishing of the British Navigation Acts. By 1880 there were 60,000 Norwegian seamen and the country had the world's third-largest merchant marine. As the first coast-to-coast railway, the Røros Line connected the capital to Trondheim in 1877. Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union in 1875 and introduced the Norwegian krone with a gold standard, along with the metric system being introduced.|$|E

2500|$|Vilnius Land Bank ( [...] , , [...] ) was {{the first}} bank {{established}} in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno), present-day Lithuania. It was a private joint-stock <b>mortgage</b> <b>bank</b> serving the Northwestern Krai of the Russian Empire. Its mission was to provide loans collateralized by real estate to manor owners (agriculture) and city residents (industry). As it could not accept deposits, the bank issued mortgage bonds {{to raise funds for}} the loans. The bank was established in 1872 after a banking reform.

Despite several economic crises, particularly the one caused by the Russian Revolution of 1905, the outstanding loans grew from 5 million rubles in 1874 to 148.8 million in 1912. Both Lithuanians and Russians complained that the bank was controlled by and served the Polish interests. During World War I, the bank was evacuated to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg). After the war, in 1920, it returned to Vilnius, which became part of the Second Polish Republic. It continued to operate at diminished volumes until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939.|$|E
