50|$|Often, the {{uncertainty}} of a measurement is found by repeating the measurement enough times {{to get a good}} estimate of the standard deviation of the values. Then, any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation.

In such cases a single-blind experimental protocol is required; if the human observer does not know the sidereal time of the measurements, then even though the round-off is non-random it cannot introduce a spurious sidereal variation.|$|E

50|$|Along with Zurek’s related {{theory of}} envariance, quantum Darwinism seeks {{to explain how}} the {{classical}} world emerges from the quantum world and proposes to answer the quantum measurement problem, the main interpretational challenge for quantum theory. The measurement problem arises because the quantum state vector, the source of all knowledge concerning quantum systems, evolves according to the Schrödinger equation into a linear superposition of different states, predicting paradoxical situations such as “Schrödinger's cat”; situations never experienced in our classical world. Quantum theory has traditionally treated this problem as being resolved by a non-unitary transformation of the state vector at the time of measurement into a definite state. It provides an extremely accurate means of predicting the value of the definite state that will be measured {{in the form of a}} probability for each possible <b>measurement</b> <b>value.</b> The physical nature of the transition from the quantum superposition of states to the definite classical state measured is not explained by the traditional theory but is usually assumed as an axiom and was at the basis of the debate between Bohr and Einstein concerning the completeness of quantum theory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the domain}} of {{environmental}} sciences, measurement is the process that maps some observed phenomenon to a formal <b>measurement</b> <b>value,</b> the latter being {{the result of a}} measurement process. The measurement process relies on data representing physical quantities of possibly continuously changing phenomena. Because of the inherent imprecision of this source data and interpretations made within the measurement process itself, the measurement processes and their measurement values are plagued with quality issues. Many of these quality issues may be parameterised and provided as metadata of the <b>measurement</b> <b>value,</b> e. g. precision, resolution, trustworthiness. Of these, the trustworthiness quality parameter is evaluated by the consumer of the measurement value; this evaluation is a subjective perception of the level of momentary reliance justifiably placed on the <b>measurement</b> <b>value</b> and possible quality parameters. Initially the level of trustworthiness is thus vacuous with the consumer’s trustworthiness building up by gained evidence in the provider in providing this type of a <b>measurement</b> <b>value.</b> In this paper we define a method for representing, calculating and monitoring the trustworthiness parameter placed on a provider providing measurement values. The inherent imprecision of any <b>measurement</b> <b>value</b> is considered as a level of (un) certainty with a three-valued representation. The presented method is based on Dempster-Shafe...|$|E

This paper analyses fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> requirements in a controversial scenario, namely when a control premium exists. The analyses of the paper show that, while measurement rules around control premiums could have a material impact on fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> and the financial statements as a whole, significant fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> issues remain unresolved. The conclusion is that fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> should include or exclude control premiums consistently. It is argued that including control premiums for all fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> is the most faithful representation of the underlying economic phenomenon. This paper contributes to the fair <b>value</b> <b>measurement</b> debate by comparing the merits of alternative fair <b>value</b> <b>measurements</b> for control premiums and highlights an area where researchers, investors and other users should exercise caution when evaluating financial statements...|$|R
