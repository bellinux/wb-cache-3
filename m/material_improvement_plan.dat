40|$|Some {{manufacturing}} firms, {{particularly in}} the high-technology sector, have production processes which are characterized by very low initial yields followed by steady "experience" based yield <b>improvement.</b> <b>Material</b> Requirements <b>Planning</b> literature reveals that MRP implementations are seldom adjusted in any systematic way to account for such yield improvement. A single product, single stage MRP model is developed which incorporates learning curve behavior into conventional MRP logic. A series of experiments systematically examine the impact on mean inventory level of various combinations of environmental conditions and managerial policies. The research demonstrates that substantial reductions in mean inventory levels can be realized in low yield environments if learning is properly included in the order release logic. This finding proves to be robust with respect to modest errors in the estimation of learning rate. material requirements planning, experience curve, learning curve, production yield, scrap rate, lot sizing...|$|R

It embodies a collaborative commitment to the rigorous, systematic investigation of specific improvement strategies.

40|$|PROBLEM: Many {{patients}} are {{not satisfied with}} the accessibility and availability of general practice, and {{they would like to see}} improvement. DESIGN: Quality-improvement study with pre-intervention and post-intervention data collection in 36 general practices. SETTING: General practices located in the south of The Netherlands. KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Patient satisfaction, experiences and awareness; practice information; and experiences of a mystery patient. STRATEGY FOR CHANGE: The practices received feedback about their accessibility and availability compared with data from practices of colleagues. The practices developed practice-based <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> using these feedback results. EFFECTS OF CHANGE: Eighty per cent of the <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> were completed or almost completed in 5 months. After the intervention, the accessibility by phone within 2 min increased significantly (10 % improvement). The practices that designed an <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> showed a larger increase (25 % improvement) than practices that did not. Patient awareness of an information leaflet and a separate telephone number for emergency calls also significantly increased (29 % improvement and 12 % improvement) in practices that designed <b>improvement</b> <b>plans.</b> LESSONS LEARNED: Feedback and practice-based <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> were a stimulus to work on and to improve accessibility and availability. All practices started <b>improvement</b> <b>plans,</b> but the overall effect of the changes was modest. This may be due to acceptable accessibility and availability before the intervention was introduced and to the time period of 5 months, which seemed to be too short to complete all practice-based <b>improvement</b> <b>plans.</b> The mystery patient was more satisfied with the accessibility than the real patients. This may be related to our concept of accessibility. We learned that adding a mystery patient for data collection can contribute to more objective measurements of practice accessibility than patient questionnaires alone...|$|R

40|$|This article explores school <b>improvement</b> <b>planning</b> under {{conditions}} of high-stakes accountability {{by means of a}} content analysis of school <b>improvement</b> <b>plans.</b> The schools examined here were identified by their accountability agencies as low performing and were put on probation to reverse their decline. Schools in three accountability systems are compared. Content analyses indicated that school <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> across the three jurisdictions were very similar, suggesting institutional isomorphism. However, certain policy design features prompted variation in the levels of internalization of exter-nal demands by school sites. School <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> (SIPs) are a widespread feature in high-stakes accountability systems. SIPs are often a mandatory feature for schools put on probation by their accountability agency for persistently low performance. In many accountability systems, accountability agencies treat SIPs as central to a school’s path back to healthy performance. Often, SIPs are extensive docu-ments subject to official review and approval. Whether they are hastily thrown together or carefully crafted, these SIPs are vivid testimony to the way schools (and districts) think about the task of school improvement unde...|$|R

40|$|The first {{cycle of}} quality {{assurance}} (QA) was conceptualised and developed between 2001 and 2004 {{as reflected in}} the policy documents of the Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC). The HEQC as the national QA agency was created as the permanent sub-committee of the Council on Higher Education (CHE) {{to take care of the}} QA responsibility in 2001. The national QA agency had to operate within the divisions created in higher education under apartheid, which often created perceptions based on prejudice about the distribution of quality. The South African higher education landscape has been exposed to the first cycle of the Higher Education Quality Committee QA cycle during which conducted 34 institutional audits, accredited approximately 5000 new programmes, subjected 85 programmes to national reviews, trained approximately 550 institutional auditors and 1500 programme evaluators and conducted many workshops and training opportunities for higher education institutions (HEIs). The main aim posed by this study was to determine the response of HEIs to the recommendations in the HEQC audit reports. The sub-questions of the research are (i) What process was followed to develop the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan?</b> (ii) Who were the role-players in the development of the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan?</b> (iii) What influenced their actions in the development of the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan?</b> (iv) What value did the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> development have for the institution? (v) How does the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> fit into the comprehensive quality management system of the institution? To answer the research questions, interviews were carried out on six participants. The findings were that the primary research question has been addressed conclusively by the three institutions through the experience of participants. The responses indicate how they have embraced improvement at the respective institutions which in turn have grown as a result of the HEQC audit process. The conclusion was an in depth response to the recommendations in the audit reports, illustrating ownership of quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> processes within the institutions. From the results of the secondary research questions it is concluded that the participants’ responses provided the richness of the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> process in the audit process. The responses reflected and confirmed the processes followed in developing the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> and the role and influence of role- players in the quality <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> process. The responses reflected the value of this process and revealed how it had been incorporated into the comprehensive annual planning processes of the institutions. The study concludes that the participating institutions responded differently and effectively to the recommendations in the HEQC audit reports, with the improvement reflected in the manner and approach institutions displayed when responding to recommendations, reflecting systematic processes.
