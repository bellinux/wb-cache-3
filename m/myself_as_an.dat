500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{said that}} during this period, {{with all the}} changes on the team and with players {{returning}} from the war he had to [...] "re-establish <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> NHLer." [...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy {{was going to turn}} out to be just a [...] "wartime flash in the pan". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!" [...] was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, a howl that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984. Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] {{wanted me to be}} the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, {{she entered}} private practice, joining the {{commercial}} litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate. One of 30 attorneys {{in the law}} firm, she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration. [...] She later said, [...] "I wanted to complete <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attorney." [...] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job. [...] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than {{be part of a}} larger law firm. Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States; much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods. In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle. She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run [...] "much like a drug operation", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by [...] "Fendi Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green. At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes. In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college. [...] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm; she was paid well but not extravagantly. She left in 1992 when she became a judge.|$|E
2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it. I prefer to think of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> antenna. There's only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hard rock {{musician}} Lemmy of {{the band}} Motörhead gained a lot from his tenure in Hawkwind. He has remarked, [...] "I really found <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> instrumentalist in Hawkwind. Before that I was just a guitar player who was pretending to be good, when actually I was no good at all. In Hawkwind I became a good bass player. It was where I learned I was good at something." ...|$|E

So it was quite hard {{to try to keep}} the idea of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> batting all-rounder in my own mind." ...|$|R

I still see <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> soldier first and foremost." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a February 2007 web chat on her web site, Grant {{discussed}} a book {{she was working}} on titled , saying, [...] "It's not an autobiography, but more a collection of memories, song lyrics, poetry and a few pictures." [...] The book was released on October 16, 2007. In November, it debuted at No. 35 on the New York Times Best Seller list. In the same web chat, Grant noted that she is [...] "anxious {{to get back in the}} studio after the book is finished, and reinvent <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> almost-50 performing woman".|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{has been}} {{referred}} to, along with Dan Dennett, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens, {{as one of}} the [...] "new atheists", but he considers the term [...] "atheist" [...] to be problematic. He said, [...] "while I am now one of the public voices of atheism, I never thought of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> atheist before being inducted to speak as one [...] I think that 'atheist' is a term that we do not need, {{in the same way that}} we don't need a word for someone who rejects astrology." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a press release, Fiona {{explained}} the album's title, [...] "the ‘MF’ in the album title represents my initials, {{but it also}} gets at the many facets of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist and a young woman. It {{can be viewed as}} the ‘Mighty Fine Life’ in times of triumph and success, but also the ‘Mother-F-ing Life’ when I’m dealing with frustration or misfortune. I celebrate both. I feel it would be dishonest if everything was all about glitz and glamour. It’s about the balance of life, the yin and the yang, the good and the bad, all of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{returned}} to Chicago {{to live with}} her parents and started dancing at the Club Rendevouz in Calumet City, Illinois, where she was known as Galatea, [...] "the Statue that Came to Life." [...] She was offered a raise to become a stripper. [...] After singer Elvis Presley saw her perform at Chicago's Follies Theater, the two began a romantic relationship that some reports say ended in a marriage proposal she declined. She eventually became a successful exotic dancer, traveling from city to city. She credited Lloyd with giving her the confidence to pursue a career in show business: [...] "I saw <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ugly child. Mr. Lloyd said, 'You have such a symmetrical face. The camera loves your face...You should be seen.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tracks on}} I Need You {{were taken from}} various studio tracks {{released}} between 1999 and 2001, as well as B-sides tracks to help satisfy Rimes' recording contract obligations during litigation with the label and her management. During the litigation with her label, Rimes asked [...] "that Curb give Rimes the rights to all past recordings and videos, give up all publishing interests in her compositions and destroy all currently available recordings." [...] The album was publicly disowned by Rimes four days after its 2001 release, with Rimes stating that: [...] "his album was made without my creative input, it consists largely of unfinished material and songs that didn't make other albums ... I want to make abundantly clear to you that this album is not a reflection of <b>myself</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artist but is solely the conception of Curb Records, and for that I am truly and deeply sorry." ...|$|E
