40|$|The {{concept for}} using a duplex {{connector}} for the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (F'DDI) was formalized in late 1983. The duplex requirements were driven by both the token ring topology and {{by the need to}} simplify connectivity between stations. Though most users speak in terms of a duplex connector or <b>Medium</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Connector</b> (MIC), the FDDI Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) document only defines the physical parameters for a duplex receptacle. The receptacle is the boundary between the station and the cable plant of an FDDI network and hence the only location at which station conformance can be verified. The duplex connector or plug is therefore part of the FDDI cable plant. Because the main ring of an FDDI network is composed of a primary and secondary ring the fiber optic cable connecting two stations must have two fibers, connected at each end by a duplex connec-tor. Each station on the ring therefore requires two duplex receptacles, to connect the stations on each side to make up that portion of the link. The first receptacle adopted by the FDDI was larger and more cumbersome than the present design. The original concept was to use fiber to replace larger copper bus- and-tag cables at large mainframes ' I/O ports. This application typically has less of a space constraint compared to a per...|$|E

50|$|Reverse-polarity BNC (RP-BNC) is a {{variation}} of the BNC specification which reverses the polarity of the <b>interface.</b> In a <b>connector</b> of this type, the female contact normally found in a jack is usually in the plug, while the male contact normally found in a plug is in the jack. This ensures that reverse polarity <b>interface</b> <b>connectors</b> do not mate with standard <b>interface</b> <b>connectors.</b> The SHV connector is a high-voltage BNC variant that uses this reverse polarity configuration.|$|R
