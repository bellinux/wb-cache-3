50|$|Generally speaking, internalist {{conceptions of}} epistemic {{justification}} require that one’s justification for a belief be internal to the believer in some way. Two main varieties of epistemic internalism about justification are access internalism and ontological internalism. Access internalists require that a believer must have internal {{access to the}} justifier(s) of her belief p {{in order to be}} justified in believing p. For the access internalist, justification amounts to something like the believer being aware (or capable of being aware) of certain facts that make her belief in p rational, or her being able to give reasons for her belief in p. At <b>minimum,</b> <b>access</b> internalism requires that the believer have some kind of reflective access or awareness to whatever justifies her belief. Ontological internalism is the view that justification for a belief is established by one’s mental states. Ontological internalism can be distinct from access internalism, but the two are often thought to go together since we are generally considered to be capable of having reflective access to mental states.|$|E

Trade of the processed good is restricted through a Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) and domestic processors operate in an imperfectly competitive industry. Under a fixed proportions technology, an increase in the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> commitment of the TRQ will generally lower the domestic retail price to consumers if the marketing agency is a profit-maximizing monopolist.

40|$|A major {{objective}} of the Uruguay Round negotiation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is to bring agricultural commodities under general GATT rules and disciplines. The United States and the Cairns Group countries (with the exception of Canada) are insisting on tariffication of all nontariff barriers (NTBs) to trade without exception. On the other hand, the European Community (EC) and Japan are reluctant to open their respective domestic markets for certain agricultural commodities. To break the negotiation deadlock, Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the GATT, put forward a compromise proposal (the Dunkel proposal) which has become {{the basis for the}} final round of talks currently in progress. Among other things, the Dunkel proposal (1991) calls for countries to replace all existing nontariff barriers to trade by tariffs and to ensure <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> to their domestic markets if imports have been less than 5 percent of domestic consumption. Specifically, the Dunkel proposal calls for importing countries in the 1993 starting period to provide a <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> of 3 percent of the domestic consumption in the base period (average of 1986 through 1988 consumption). They will gradually increase the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> level to 5 percent of the base period domestic consumption by 1999, if base period imports are below these thresholds. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{bilateral}} dumping model in which the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> level is endogenous. Regions compete with one another using Cournot conjectures and engage in interregional dumping as in Brander and Krugman’s (1983) reciprocal dumping model. International trade is hindered by restrictive Tariff rate Quota (TRQs). The model features two regions and one product. We derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to observe interregional trade and those under which trade does not exist. The results show that the world price and the difference in production costs between regions {{play an important role in}} determining whether bilateral trade exists. In the presence of bilateral trade, the region with the largest market size will obtain the largest share of import volumes permitted under the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> system while in the absence of interregional trade, the distribution of import permits between regions will also depends on the product cost asymmetry. When only the most efficient region exports to the least efficient region, production costs asymmetry, transaction costs and world price level determine whether the smaller or larger region obtains the larger share of product import allowed under <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> commitment. In all cases, we show that in a country like Canada, creation of “artificial barriers” to interprovincial trade of products under supply management system lowers the welfare of at least one of the regions, along with the global welfare...|$|E

40|$|The {{interdependence}} {{of the concept}} of allostery and enzymatic catalysis, and they being guided by conformational mobility is gaining increased prominence. However, to gain a molecular level understanding of llostery and hence of enzymatic catalysis, it is of utter importance that the networks of amino acids participating in allostery be deciphered. Our lab has been exploring the methods of network analysis combined with molecular dynamics simulations to understand allostery at molecular level. Earlier we had outlined methods to obtain communication paths and then to map the rigid/flexible regions of proteins through network parameters like the shortest correlated paths, cliques, and communities. In this article, we advance the methodology to estimate the conformational populations in terms of cliques/communities formed by interactions including the side-chains and then to compute the ligand-induced population shift.

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture. Following the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade liberalization all nontariff barriers to trade were converted, through the process of tariffication, into tariffs. However, in the dairy sector, the border measure most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of tariff rate quotas. Tariff rate quotas are two-tiered tariffs which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive tariffs. Tariff rate quotas cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> amount.

Using a world reference price based on the 1986 - 88 average levels, internal supports as measured by an aggregate measure of support (AMS) are to be reduced by 20 percent from 1986 levels. Credit will be given for support reductions made since 1986. 3) Market Access. Import restrictions are to be converted to tariffs and reduced across the board by a simple average of 36 percent. Tariffs on individual commodities are to be reduced by at least 15 percent. Where import barriers are in place, either <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> of 3 percent of domestic consumption in 1993, rising to 5 percent in 1999, or <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> of 1986 - 88 average import levels is to be provided, whichever is greater. ...|$|E

All countries were expected to allow access to their domestic markets for imports equivalent to at least 3 % of domestic consumption in the 1986 - 1988 base period. This proportion was to rise to 5 % {{at the end of the}} implementation period (i. e. in year 2001 in the European Union). These provi-sions are referred to as “minimum access. ” In ad-dition, the URAA agreed that preexisting market access had to be preserved. That is, access condi-tions for historically established import quantities would be maintained (a provision referred to as “current access”). In the beginning of the implementation period (i. e. 1995), EU bound tariffs were too high for the EU to meet <b>minimum</b> <b>access</b> commitments without specific instruments.
