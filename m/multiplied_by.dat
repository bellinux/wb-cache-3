5|$|The {{basic unit}} in the Maya {{calendar}} was one day, or k'in, and 20 k'in grouped to form a winal. The next unit, instead of being <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> 18 {{in order to provide}} a rough approximation of the solar year (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a tun. Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1996–97 season, European Sports Media have {{awarded the}} Golden Shoe {{based on a}} points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. The {{weightings}} {{are determined by the}} league's ranking on the UEFA coefficients, which in turn depend on the results of each league's clubs in European competition over the previous five seasons. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients list are <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> a factor of two, goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> a factor of 1.5, and goals scored in leagues ranked 22 and below are <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> a factor of 1. Thus, goals scored in higher ranked leagues will count for more than those scored in weaker leagues. Since this change, there was only been one winner was not playing in one of the top five leagues (Henrik Larsson, 2000–01 Scottish Premier League).|$|E

5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004.

An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

While most of the pesticide use data incorporated in the model were originally reported by U.S. government agencies in pounds of active ingredient, and/or pounds of a.i./acre, results are reported herein in SI units (kilograms of active ingredient and kg/ha).

5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion.

The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed.
