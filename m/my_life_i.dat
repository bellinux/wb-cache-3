25|$|Horthy's {{personal}} views on Jews {{and their role}} in Hungarian society {{are the subject of}} some debate. In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister Pál Teleki, Horthy echoed a widespread national sentiment: that Jews enjoyed too much success in commerce, the professions, and industry – success that needed to be curtailed:As regards the Jewish problem, I have been an anti-Semite throughout <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. Since, however, {{one of the most important}} tasks of the government is to raise the standard of living, i.e., we have to acquire wealth, it is impossible, in a year or two, to replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands, and to replace them with incompetent, unworthy, mostly big-mouthed elements, for we should become bankrupt. This requires a generation at least.|$|E
25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

[...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> had to acknowledge and correct the lies in <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>I</b> saw that the lies that I told about others — my wanting my family, or Ellen (his second wife), or anyone else, {{to be different from}} the way that they are -- came from lies that I told about myself -- my wanting to be different from the way that I was." ...|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E
