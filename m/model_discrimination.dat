40|$|<b>Model</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{deals with}} {{situations}} {{where there are}} several candidate models available to represent a system. The objective {{is to find the}} “best” model among rival models with respect to prediction of system behavior. Empirical and mechanistic models are two important categories of models. Mechanistic models are developed based on physical mechanisms. These types of models can be applied for prediction purposes, but they are also developed to gain improved understanding of the underlying physical mechanism or to estimate physico-chemical parameters of interest. When <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> is applied to mechanistic models, the main goal is typically to determine the “correct” underlying physical mechanism. This study focuses on mechanistic models and presents a <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> procedure which is applicable to mechanistic models for the purpose of studying the underlying physical mechanism. Obtaining the data needed from the real system is one of the challenges particularly in applications where experiments are expensive or time consuming. Therefore, it is beneficial to get the maximum information possible from the real system using the least possible number of experiments. In this research a new approach to <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> is presented that takes advantage of Monte Carlo (MC) methods. It combines a design of experiments (DOE) method with an adaptation of MC model selection methods to obtain a sequential Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> framework which is general and usable {{for a wide range of}} <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> problems. The procedure has been applied to chemical engineering case studies and the promising results have been discussed. Four case studies, order of reaction, rate of FeIII formation, copolymerization, and RAFT polymerization, are presented in this study. The first three benchmark problems allowed us to refine the proposed approach. Moreover, applying the Sequential Bayesian Monte Carlo <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> framework in the RAFT problem made a contribution to the polymer community by recommending analysis an approach to selecting the correct mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate through simulation the possible presence of the incidental parameters problem when performing frequentist <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> with stratified data. In this context, <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> amounts to considering a structural parameter taking values in a finite space, with k points, k ≥ 2. This setting seems to have not yet been considered in the literature about the Neyman–Scott phenomenon. Here we provide Monte Carlo evidence of the severity of the incidental parameters problem also in the <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> setting and propose a remedy for a special class of models. In particular, we focus on models that are scale families in each stratum. We consider traditional model selection procedures, such as theAkaike andTakeuchi information criteria, together with the best frequentist selection procedure based on maximization of the marginal likelihood induced by the maximal invariant, or of its Laplace approximation. Results of two Monte Carlo experiments indicate that when the sample size in each stratum is fixed and the number of strata increases, correct selection probabilities for traditional model selection criteria may approach zero, unlike what happens for <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on exact or approximate marginal likelihoods.

40|$|Object {{detection}} involves {{looking for}} one of a large set of object sub-images in a large set of background images. Image <b>discrimination</b> <b>models</b> only predict the probability that an observer will detect a difference between two images. In a recent study based on only six different images, we found that <b>discrimination</b> <b>models</b> can predict the relative detectability of objects in those images, suggesting that these simpler models {{may be useful in}} some object detection applications. Here we replicate this result using a new, larger set of images. Fifteen images of a vehicle in an other-wise natural setting were altered to remove the vehicle and mixed with the original image in a proportion chosen to make the target neither perfectly recognizable nor unrecognizable. The target was also rotated about a vertical axis through its center and mixed with the background. Sixteen observers rated these 30 target images and the 15 background-only images for the presence of a vehicle. The likelihoods of the observer responses were computed from a Thurstone scaling model with the assumption that the detectabilities are proportional to the predictions of an image <b>discrimination</b> <b>model.</b> Three image <b>discrimination</b> <b>models</b> were used: a cortex transform model, a single channel model with a contrast sensitivity function filter, and the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) difference of the digital target and background-only images.

40|$|This thesis investigates robust {{strategies}} of optimal experimental design for discrimination between several nonlinear regression models. It develops novel theory, efficient algorithms, and implementations of such strategies, {{and provides a}} framework for assessing and comparing their practical performance. The framework is employed to perform extensive case studies. Their results demonstrate {{the success of the}} novel strategies. The thesis contributes advances over existing theory and techniques in various fields as follows: The thesis proposes novel “misspecification-robust” data-based approximation formulas for the covariances of maximum-likelihood estimators and of Bayesian posterior distributions of parameters in nonlinear incorrect models. The formulas adequately quantify parameter uncertainty even if the model is both nonlinear and systematically incorrect. The thesis develops a framework of novel statistical measures and tailored efficient algorithms for the simulation-based assessment of covariance approximations for maximum-likelihood estimator for parameters. Fully parallelized variants of the algorithms are implemented in the software package DoeSim. Using DoeSim, the misspecification-robust covariance formula for maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs) and its “classic” alternative are compared in an extensive numerical case study. The results demonstrate the superiority of the misspecification-robust formula. Two novel sequential design criteria for <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> are proposed. They take into account parameter uncertainty with the new misspecification-robust posterior covariance formula. It is shown that both design criteria constitute an improvement over a popular approximation of the Box-Hill-Hunter-criterion. In contrast to the latter, they avoid to overestimate the expected amount of information provided by an experiment. The thesis clarifies that the popular Gauss-Newton method is generally not appropriate for finding least-squares parameter estimates in the context of <b>model</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Furthermore, it demonstrates that a large class of optimal experimental design optimization problems for <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> is intrinsically non-convex even under strong simplifying assumptions. Such problems are NP-hard and particularly difficult to solve numerically. 	 A framework is developed for the quantitative assessment and comparison of sequential optimal experimental design strategies for <b>model</b> <b>discrimination.</b> It consists of new statistical measures of their practical performance and problem-adapted algorithms to compute these measures. A state-of-the-art modular and parallelized implementation is provided in the software package DoeSim. The framework permits quantitative analyses of the broad range of behaviour that a design strategy shows under fluctuating data. The practical performance of four established and three novel sequential design criteria for <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> is examined in an extensive simulation study. The study is performed with DoeSim and comprises a large number of <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> problems. The behaviour of the design criteria is examined under different magnitudes of measurement error and for different number of rival models. Central results from the study are that a popular approximation of the Box-Hill-Hunter-criterion is surprisingly inefficient, particularly in problems with three or more models, that all parameter-robust design criteria in fact outperform the basic Hunter-Reiner-strategy, and that the newly proposed novel design criteria are among the most efficient ones. The latter show particularly strong advantages over their alternatives when facing demanding <b>model</b> <b>discrimination</b> problems with many rival model and large measurement errors...|$|E
