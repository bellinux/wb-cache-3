Speculation was on the rise, Brooks noted, made easier by the new casino mentality. Writer <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> noted that Brooks's outrage at the new speculative excesses of the 1960s marked the end of an era.|$|E

25|$|In reply, Durham {{trailed by}} 108 with four wickets in hand, but a seventh-wicket stand worth 126 between Gareth Breese and Philip Mustard lifted Durham to 316. With a 62-run deficit on first innings, Yorkshire lost their first seven wickets for 128 runs, but Anthony McGrath hit 133 not out - his second century {{of the season}} thus far, {{following}} his 165 not out against Leicestershire a week earlier. He was supported by Chris Silverwood, who hit 80 off 66 balls before eventually being bowled by <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis,</b> who removed the five last batsmen to end with figures of five for 80.|$|E
25|$|Three {{of their}} four {{starters}} in the defensive secondary were {{named to the}} Pro Bowl: Cornerback Lito Sheppard (1 sack, 5 interceptions, 172 return yards and 2 touchdowns), safety <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> (88 tackles, 2 forced fumbles, 1 sack, and 1 interception) and safety Brian Dawkins (3 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 1 fumble recovery, and 4 interceptions for 40 return yards), while their fourth starter, cornerback Sheldon Brown, also enjoyed a solid year (89 tackles, 3 sacks, 1 forced fumble, and 2 interceptions). Their defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive tackle Corey Simon (5.5 sacks) and defensive ends Jevon Kearse (7.5 sacks, Pro Bowl) and Derrick Burgess. Pro Bowl middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, who only started 9 games, recorded 69 tackles and 1 sack.|$|E
25|$|Durham won the toss at Southend-on-Sea, {{and their}} first innings lasted two {{sessions}} for 196, New Zealander Andre Adams taking five for 60 while Danish Kaneria took three for 30 for Essex. Essex also lost five wickets {{on the first}} day, to trail by 89, and as Tony Palladino and James Middlebrook were dismissed in quick succession Durham were 62 behind with three wickets in hand, with Australian <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> having taken four for 69. However, opener Alastair Cook was still there, and he was eventually last out after batting for {{four and a half}} hours, crafting 107 as Essex made it to 245 and a lead of 49. Adams dug out both openers when Durham returned to bat, but four partnerships of more than 40 - the highest between Dale Benkenstein and Gareth Breese, who added 92 - saw Durham to a first-innings total of 347, as captain Benkenstein top-scored with 124.|$|E

25|$|Three plays {{after the}} kickoff, Eagles quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 75-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Donté Stallworth to give his team a 7–6 lead. The Saints responded with a 78-yard drive, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown run by Bush to retake the lead at 13–7. However, the Eagles stormed right back, driving 80 yards in 11 plays. On third down and goal, running back Brian Westbrook took a handoff and jumped over top of the defensive line and fell {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown, giving them a 14–13 lead with 50 seconds left in the half. New Orleans returner <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> returned the kickoff 25 yards to their 35-yard line. With two seconds left, quarterback Drew Brees threw a Hail Mary pass to the end zone. Wide receiver Marques Colston initially caught the ball, but it squirted out of his arms as he fell to the ground, and was ruled an incompletion.|$|E
25|$|The {{authenticity}} of Philo's {{description of a}} cardan suspension has been doubted by some authors {{on the ground that}} the part of Philo's Pneumatica which describes the use of the gimbal survived only in an Arabic translation of the early 9th century. Thus, the sinologist Joseph Needham suspected Arab interpolation as late as 1965. However, Carra de Vaux, author of the French translation which still provides the basis for modern scholars, regards the Pneumatics as essentially genuine. The historian of technology George Sarton (1959) also asserts that it is safe to assume the Arabic version is a faithful copying of Philo's original, and credits Philon explicitly with the invention. So does his colleague <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> (2001). In fact, research by the latter scholar (1997) demonstrates that the Arab copy contains sequences of Greek letters which fell out of use after the 1st century, thereby strengthening the case that it is a faithful copy of the Hellenistic original, a view recently also shared by the classicist Andrew Wilson (2002).|$|E
25|$|Durham {{continued}} their march through Division Two of the County Championship, recording their sixth win {{of the season}} thanks mainly to Paul Collingwood and spineless batting from Somerset. Collingwood made 181, for his second successive match with a century, and along with half-centuries from Mike Hussey, Gordon Muchall and Gareth Breese it lifted Durham to 476 for 9 declared seven overs into day three after the second day had been broken up by the rain. Jamaican spinner Gareth Breese then snared five for 83 as Somerset {{made their way to}} 303 in 68 overs, while Durham got to 208 for 1 in reply before declaring {{for the second time in}} the match - only Graeme Smith getting a wicket for Somerset. Smith started positively with fellow opener James Francis, adding 56 for the first wicket, but Breese added another four to his tally as he finished with match figures of nine for 138. Ian Blackwell played an unusually cautious knock of 8 off 62 balls, but he was eventually lbw to <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis,</b> and Somerset subsided for 174 to lose by 207 runs.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, Elmore, Duncan, Valenti, Freiberg and Cipollina {{recorded}} a reunion album, Solid Silver, on Capitol Records. The album also included contributions {{from a variety}} of Bay Area musicians, including former keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, session vocalist Kathi McDonald and Jefferson Starship multi-instrumentalist Pete Sears. Freiberg had initially replaced Marty Balin in Jefferson Airplane following his release from prison in 1972 and remained with the group as they evolved into the mammothly successful Jefferson Starship. Released in November 1975, it fared better from a commercial and critical standpoint than the preceding two albums but only managed to peak at No. 89. While Freiberg elected not to rejoin the live group {{as a result of his}} Jefferson Starship commitments, Cipollina, keyboardist <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> and bassist Skip Olsen toured with the returning trio for a handful of concerts in 1975, culminating in an appearance at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom on December 28. Shortly thereafter, Cipollina departed once again and the remaining quintet continued to tour clubs intermittently until finally dissolving in 1979.|$|E
25|$|With 5:28 {{remaining}} in the first quarter, Bears defensive back Nathan Vasher recovered a fumble from Marques Colston and returned it 14 yards to the Saints' 36-yard line. Several plays later, Robbie Gould kicked a 19-yard field goal to give the Bears a 3–0 lead. Then, Chicago's Danieal Manning recovered a fumble from <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis</b> on the ensuing kickoff, setting up Gould's second field goal to increase the lead to 6–0. New Orleans was forced to punt on their next possession, and Devin Hester gave his team good field position with a 10-yard return to the Saints' 49-yard line. Two plays later, tight end Desmond Clark's 30-yard reception moved {{the ball to the}} 19. Once again, New Orleans kept Chicago's offense out of the end zone, but Gould kicked his third field goal to give the Bears a 9–0 lead. Then, after forcing another punt, Chicago stormed down the field on a drive in which running back Thomas Jones carried the ball on eight consecutive plays, gaining 69 yards and finishing it off with a 2-yard touchdown run. This time, New Orleans managed to respond, with Brees completing five passes for 73 yards on their ensuing possession, the last one a 13-yard touchdown pass to Colston, to cut their deficit to 16–7 by halftime.|$|E
25|$|Durham {{recorded}} their {{sixth and}} last Championship win {{of the season}} after Paul Collingwood made two centuries, while Somerset lost nine men in single figures, including their batsmen from four to seven in the second innings. Collingwood made 181, for his second successive match with a century, and as Mike Hussey, Gordon Muchall and Gareth Breese made half-centuries Durham declared on 476 for 9 seven overs into day three after the second day had been shortened from 104 to 32 overs by the rain. Jamaican spinner Gareth Breese then snared five for 83 as Somerset {{made their way to}} 303 in 68 overs, while Durham got to 208 for 1 in reply before declaring {{for the second time in}} the match - with only Graeme Smith getting a wicket for Somerset. Once again, Collingwood made a century, this time an unbeaten 105, to have a July batting average of 162.66. Smith started by adding 56 with fellow opener James Francis, but Breese dismissed Smith and a further three to his tally as he finished with match figures of nine for 138. Ian Blackwell scored 8 at a strike rate of just under 13, compared to his average strike rate of nearly 80 for the season -, but he was eventually lbw to <b>Michael</b> <b>Lewis,</b> and Somerset were bowled out 41 overs into the fourth day to lose by 207 runs.|$|E
