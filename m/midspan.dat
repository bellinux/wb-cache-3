5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at <b>midspan</b> on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E

25|$|Building on {{his first}} {{guardrail}} designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating light trucks and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and light trucks increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the <b>midspan,</b> and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E

40|$|In particular, he criticizes {{that the}} shear strengths' {{equations}} in these sources {{do not include}} n. The design steps in practice are: select {{the thickness of the}} flat plate as a ratio of the span to avoid excessive deflection; determine n values at <b>midspans</b> and at the supports, to resist the bending moments obtained by elastic analyses for the loading cases that produce maximum positive and maximum negative values due to factored loads; check the punching shear strength to ensure that it exceeds the maximum demand with the appropriate loading case; and provide shear reinforcing means if necessary.

40|$|During the 20 th century it {{was very}} common in Italy to {{substitute}} masonry buildings' timber floors and roofs, which were considered inadequate, by reinforced concrete or reinforced clay diaphragms. Such interventions, especially if belonging to the early stage of reinforced concrete spreading, emphasize new conservation problems. Whereas {{on the one hand}} such structural elements are testimony of the construction practice of one era, a practice frequently not in use anymore, on the other they are also commonly inadequate to carry the loads currently specified by the building codes. Two such examples are to be found at Villa Borghese's Casino dell'Orologio, in Rome (Italy). One consists of reinforced clay unit beams, and the other of a thin ribbed reinforced concrete slab. The two have been strengthened in different ways as follows: 1) the first by replacing a few of the clay beams with reinforced concrete beams, 2) the second by adding an elastic support at the ribs' <b>midspans.</b> However, the intervention attitude is the same: preserving historical examples of construction techniques. Such attitude, as well as the structural calculation formulation, the construction details, and the approach when the knowledge of the existing structure is not complete are useful for other similar cases. © 2008 Taylor& Francis Group, London...|$|R

2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at <b>midspan</b> but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about <b>midspan</b> provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1950, as many as 200 men were {{involved}} in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. [...] On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings on the sidewalks were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the stiffening truss. The bridge received its first coat of [...] "Narrows Green" [...] paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing sheetrock and plumbing. The <b>midspan</b> and tower hydraulic damping mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} construction of a bridge across a pond and a local road on the road I/ 35 Bílý Kostel - Hradek nad Nisou. The bridge comprises 5 spans with lenghts of 40, 00 + 3 x 50, 00 + 40, 00 m. Total length of the bridge is 247 m. The substructure of the bridge consists of concrete abutments and four intermediate concrete piers. Abutment foundations are supported on bored piles and intermediate pillars on spread foundations. Two pillar foundations have been constructed on the lake bed which required sheet pile cofferdam. The superstructure was manufactured by sections in a dedicated area and launched using the incremental launching method. The continuous steel-concrete composite superstructure {{was designed as a}} twin steel plate girder with steel bracings and a top flange connected to a composite concrete haunch slab. Plate girders both of which rest upon a set of pot bearings are 2, 5 m high and 7, 0 m apart. The fabrication yard was stationary and located behind the abutment. A lightweight nose was fitted to the cantilever end of the superstructure to reduce the cantilever deformations during launching. The bridge supports were equipped with special teflon sliding bearings and friction was recorded at each jacking operation. Temporary support was incorporated between the abutment and the pier. The reinforced concrete composite haunch slab was cast on travelling formwork primarily at the <b>midspans</b> and subsequently above the piers. The construction was accomplished rapidly without any complications in the difficult access terrain. This proved the chosen steel concrete composite superstructure tangible, especially for the case of segmental launching construction...|$|R
