Among these students, some of the risk factors for misusing ADHD stimulants recreationally include: possessing deviant personality characteristics (i.e., exhibiting delinquent or deviant behavior), inadequate accommodation of special needs, basing one's self-worth on external validation, low self-efficacy, earning poor grades, and suffering from an untreated <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in older}} adults are common, their {{relationship}} with chronic disease {{and the influence of}} chronic disease on the development of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> over time is not well understood. This longitudinal study investigated the change in status of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> and chronic disease, as well as their interrelationships, over time. METHODS: Participants included community-dwelling older adults living in Taiwan, aged 65 [*]years or older, who completed six waves of survey interviews. <b>Mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> were scored using the Short Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule, and chronic disease(s) status was recorded during consecutive biennial data collection waves. The autoregressive latent trajectory model and parallel latent growth curve model were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The study findings suggest that in older people pre-existing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> and/or chronic disease(s) will predispose them to developing significantly more <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> and/or chronic diseases respectively. The study findings also suggest that pre-existing <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> can significantly {{contribute to the development of}} chronic disease over time, and that pre-existing chronic disease(s) significantly can contribute to the development of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> over time, indicating a reciprocal interrelationship. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings suggest that it in addition to monitoring and treating chronic disease(s) in older people, it is also important to monitor and treat their <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders.</b> Doing so will result in overall better health outcomes and will facilitate a better quality of life as they age...|$|R
40|$|Substance use <b>disorders</b> (SUD) and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{significant}} public health issues that co-occur and {{are associated with}} high risk for suicide attempts. SUD and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> are more prevalent among offenders (i. e., prisoners or inmates) than the non-imprisoned population, raising concerns {{about the risk of}} self-harm. This cross-sectional study examined the population of a state prison system (10, 988 out of 13, 079) to identify associations among SUD (alcohol, cannabis, intravenous drugs, narcotics, and tobacco smoking), <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> (anxiety, bipolar, depression, and psychotic disorders), and suicide attempts. The primary aim was to determine which groups (SUD, <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders,</b> and co-occurrences) were strongly association with suicide attempts. Groups with a documented SUD or <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> compared to peers without these issues had 2. 0 and 9. 2 greater odds, respectively, for attempting suicide, which was significant at p < 0. 0001 for both conditions. There were also significant differences within SUD and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorders</b> groups in regard to suicide attempts. Groups with the greatest odds for suicide attempts were offenders with comorbid bipolar comorbid and anxiety, alcohol combined with depression, and cannabis co-occurring with depression. Documentation of suicide attempts during imprisonment indicates awareness, but also suggest a need to continue enhancing screening and evaluating environmental settings...|$|R

500|$|Nonsuicidal self injury {{has been}} {{listed as a}} new {{disorder}} in the DSM-5 under the category [...] "Conditions for Further Study". This disorder occurs {{when a person is}} deliberately harming themselves in a physical way without the intent of committing suicide. Self-harm without suicidal intent can be seen on a spectrum, just like many other disorders (substance abuse, gambling addiction). Just like these other disorders, once the self harming behaviours cross a certain threshold, it then becomes classified as a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disorder.</b> Criteria for NSSI include five or more days of self-inflicted harm over the course of one year without suicidal intent, and the individual must have been motivated by seeking relief from a negative state, resolving an interpersonal difficulty, or achieving a positive state.|$|E
