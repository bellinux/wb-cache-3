Many smaller beef producers {{do not have access}} to mixing equipment to produce mixtures of wet distillers’ grains and forages. This study measured the variation in feed mixtures mixed with a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> or a front end loader. Variation was reduced by approximately one half by mixing though a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon.</b> Using the front end loader to mix the feeds resulted in variation that would be considered acceptable for many production situations...|$|E
40|$|Anionic salts {{can have}} a {{beneficial}} effect on calcium homeostasis by inducing a mild metabolic acidosis. This causes a fall in urine pH {{which can be used}} to monitor the effects of the salts. In a pilot study, 20 cows in the last 3 weeks of gestation were matched according to parity and previous yield into anionic salt supplemented and control groups. Individual urine pHs fell within 2 days in the supplemented group but a consistent group response took approximately 7 days. In the main study, 38 cows were similarly matched but a 2 kg premix was used to incorporate the anionic salts instead of a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon.</b> The larger variability of urinary pH in the main study compared with the pilot study was consistent with a greater variation in anionic salt intake in the main study, probably due to the use of a premix rather than a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> to administer the salts. The conclusions of the study highlighted important practical points concerning the feeding of anionic salts. Firstly, the salts need to be fed for at least 7 days for a consistent urinary pH response in a group. Secondly, the use of a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> to incorporate the salts into the ration reduces variability in anionic salt intake and consequently urinary pH variability...|$|E
40|$|Investment {{costs for}} eight {{different}} type housing systems for dairy cows has been calculated {{in order to}} compare the building costs {{as a function of}} herd size, shelter type and automatization. A commercial calculation programme for building was used and complemented with prices of equipments specific for dairy cow building. Herd sizes were 120, 250 and 400 cows. The milking equipments were automatic milking system (AMS), parallel parlour with 32 stalls (2 x 16) and rotary parlour with 24 stalls. Shelter was either insulated equipped with automatic cable driven scrapers on solid alleys, automatic feed wagon on rails, or uninsulated with manual manure handling and a tractor driven mobile <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> on a drive-through feeding table. Building cost per cow or per kg milk was calculated using an average life time and 6...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate long term storage options for wet distillers’ grains including storage losses and performance of backgrounding calves. Thirty six tons of wet distillers’ grains were mixed by <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> with 9 tons of tub ground fescue hay in August of 2007. This mixture packed and stored in a bunker silo, covered with plastic and stored until December at the ISU Beef Nutrition Farm. The mixture was fed to growing cattle and compared to the same feeds mixed daily, and also conventional feeds for a 112 day trial. Performance of all treatments exceeded projections, averaging approximately 3 pounds per day. There were no differences in daily gain or feed conversion among treatments, although cattle fed WDG consumed less feed. Sulfur content of the WDG containing diets exceeded. 5 % of the diet dry matter. Storage losses were 10. 9 % for the bunker-stored mixture...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} methods for preparing TMR [Keenan MechFiber (KMF) technology vs. vertical auger (VA) mixer] would alter physical form of the TMR and affect utilization of modified wet distillers grains with solubles (MWDGS). Holstein cows (n = 24 with 12 ruminally cannulated; 144 DIM ?? 31 d at start) were used in a split-plot design with mixer type as the whole plot and MWDGS concentrations as subplots in a 3 x 3 Latin square arrangement with 35 -d periods. Inclusion rates of MWDGS were 10, 20, and 30 % of dietary DM, primarily replacing corn, SBM, and whole cottonseed. Feed DMI was less for KMF (P = 0. 05), but was unaffected by MWDGS concentration (P = 0. 39). Milk production did not differ (P = 0. 75) by concentration of MWDGS or by interaction of MWDGS ?? mixer (P = 0. 18). Milk protein content tended (P = 0. 09) to decrease linearly with increasing MWDGS. Milk fat percentage declined with increasing MWDGS (P = 0. 003) but the interaction between <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> and MWDGS (P = 0. 006) showed that decreases were larger with VA mixing. Cows fed the diet containing 30 % MWDGS mixed with KMF averaged 3. 45 % (1. 24 kg/d) milk fat; whereas, cows fed the same diet mixed with VA averaged 2. 81 % (1. 10 kg/d) fat. Concentrations of CLA trans- 10, cis- 12 in milk likely explain the differences in milk fat; the concentration of CLA t- 10, c- 12 increased as MWDGS was increased (P < 0. 0001) and the MWDGS ?? mixer interaction (P = 0. 03) showed that VA had greater concentrations. Greater mean particle size and variation with VA may partially explain differences in milk fat via increased sorting that allowed for an altered rumen environment and favored alternative biohydrogenation pathways. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE; energy-corrected milk/DMI) decreased linearly (P = 0. 007) as MWDGS increased, but FCE tended to be maintained when higher MWDGS diets were mixed using KMF rather than VA (mixer, P = 0. 12). Ruminal pH (P = 0. 05) and ammonia concentration (P < 0. 001) decreased linearly as MWDGS increased. Using the KMF <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> resulted in better FCE when higher amounts of MWDGS were fed, primarily because milk fat content and yield were not as depressed and DMI was lower...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Avian {{influenza}} (AI) is a {{viral disease}} {{that caused the}} largest animal disease outbreak in the history of US agriculture. There are several disposal methods of AI infected poultry carcasses available in the US, which include on-site burial, landfill, incineration, rendering, and composting. Of these methods, composting is the most environmentally friendly and poses a low risk for biosecurity. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed a comprehensive plan for composting AI infected carcasses. The current protocols have the potential for areas of anaerobic pockets within the windrow due to inadequate mixing and the large carcass size of whole birds. This could lead to ineffective virus neutralization or prolonged composting times and higher resource costs. The purpose of this project was to determine if using a horizontal mixer (HM) wagon to mix composting ingredients or a vertical mixer (VM) wagon to mix and cut up the compositing ingredients is an economical and timely means to accelerate the tissue break-down and obtain optimal temperatures for poultry carcass composting during an AI outbreak. Materials and Methods: A replicated trial with three treatments, HM, conventional layering (CL) and VM, and three replications was initiated at the Compost Research and Education Center part of the University of Maine Forest and Agricultural Experimental Station called High Moor Farm. Daily temperatures and screened core sample weights (screen weights) on day 0, 16, and 30 were recorded for each of the compost piles. The time to build each replication was recorded and used to help calculate the cost of each method. Data on equipment, carbon material and labor costs were collected from private contractors from the 2014 to 2016 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) outbreak and used to compare costs between methods. Results: All treatment methods reached USDA protocol temperatures to neutralize the HPAI virus. Screen weights for both the VM and HM treatments were lower than the CL treatment. Screen weights decreased significantly from day 0 to day 16 for the VM and HM treatments with no significant change from day 16 to day 30. When comparing costs, the <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> methods were the more cost effective than the CL method when using high volume equipment. Conclusion: The data from this study support the use of a <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> to reduce particle size and mix ingredients for more timely and effective composting of poultry carcasses...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The agri-energetic chain project, {{financed by}} the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, {{concerns}} the realization of a pilot plant for energy recovering of vineyards pruning residues near an important wine viticulture company in Umbria (Cantine G. Lungarotti). The chain is divided in the following phases: grapes pruning harvesting and storage by a round-baler; chipping cylindrical bales to obtain a biochips whose size {{is consistent with the}} biomass boiler; chemical-physical characterization of the biochips; biomass energy conversion in the diathermic oil boiler. Grapes pruning round-baling reached an average productivity of 0, 70 tons/ha dry basis. Chipping of cylindrical bales, because of the huge dimensions of bales not compatible with mouth opening width of a common chipper, has been realised by means of a special <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon.</b> Energetic conversion phase will be executed by a diathermic oil boiler with useful thermal power 400 kW. The innovative aspect is burning residual vineyard pruning in a boiler to heat diathermic oil up to + 300 °C; diathermic oil allows the energy production in four different shapes: hot water for rooms heating; cool water up to- 10 °C for vinification processes; cool water up to + 7 °C for summer conditioning of company rooms; steam production for bottles sterilization processes...|$|E
40|$|In {{constructing}} or rebuilding a dairy barn, it’s normally {{only the}} cost of investment for the building (climatic barrier, foundation, floor and installations) that is evaluated in the capital investment estimate. Indirect costs as labour, forage, maintenance or animal health that occur because of differences in the building function are not considered. A simple and cheap building may lead to higher operating costs. Low costs for mechanization may lead to high labour costs and that’s why it’s important to include all building related costs when comparing construction and installations alternatives. This report shows results from manual work time studies from 13 farms with dairy cows in loose housing, representing different herd sizes (80 to 450 cows) and levels of mechanization (Automatic milking system, AMS, fixed and rotary parlour and level of mechanisation of feed distribution). The farms were visited both afternoon and morning during season with no grazing. The farmers and the cattle employees answered a questionnaire about work routines and herd information. Following type of work procedures were investigated: dairy cows (milking cleaning of parlour, feeding, littering, and cleaning of cubicles and other work), heifers (feeding, littering, cleaning and other work) and calves (milk feeding, feeding, littering, cleaning and other work). All figures are given as minutes per milking cow and day. There were big time differences between equal milking systems. The AMS barns had the shortest work time for milking (0. 27 to 0. 80 min/cow and day). The various milking time in the AMS stables depended on the numbers of alarms and cows needed to be caught for milking. Work time in the milking parlours (1. 84 to 3. 96 min/cow and day) depended on use of automatic cow gate or herd dog that pushed the cows. For calves, work time varied from 0 min (suckling cows) to 0. 57 min/cow and day. Work time for the young stock varied considerable (0. 32 to 1. 05 min/cow and day). Five model farms were constructed to show the effect of number of cows {{and the level of}} mechanization on the working time. With AMS in a 140 head herd and {{with a high degree of}} mechanization, the work time became 2. 1 min/cow and day. The work time became three times higher (6. 28 min/cow and day) in a herd of the same size using 2 x 8 herringbone parlour and with a low tech mechanisation. The effect of both herd size and level of mechanization was shown in the 400 head herd with a rotary parlour and a mobile <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon</b> where the work time became 3. 87 min/cow and day...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Zootécnica - Produção Animal - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / Faculdade de Medicina VeterináriaThe feed {{management}} {{is very important}} in animal nutrition, specifically in farm animals. The diet supplements usually associated with high milk yield of cows is often used also by the ease of their management. This work studied the homogeneity of the TMR designed for Holstein dairy cows using an horizontal <b>mixer</b> <b>wagon,</b> by chemical composition (DM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL) and particle size (sieve with 19, 8, 1 mm and bottom) to ensure that meets their nutritional needs. Also the nutritional parameters (DM, CP, NDF, ADF and ADL) were studied for the feed constituents in the diet: corn silage, alfalfa hay, tomato pomace and compound feed. For this study feed from 3 pens which contain the same diet consisting for 226 cows was analyzed. Samples of the diet were taken in for 4 days (not consecutive) in {{the beginning and end of}} each pen, while in the pen 2 and 3 were also sampled in the middle, after distribution of the morning diet. On the chemical composition of the diet, there are only significant variations in levels of DM and ADL, taking into account the day of trial, without these differences result in bad diets formulated or processed. These changes may be due to the quantity of tomato incorporated in the diet (high moisture). Compared to the previously formulated diet, the results indicate that the DM and CP are slightly lower; the values proposed by NRC (2001) for NDF are below the values obtained, while the percentage of ADF is in agreement with the expected. On the study of the ingredients of the diet, there are specific nutritional differences compared with reference values, but in a general rule, feeds in the diet for the parameters under study are within the specified limits. The results of the particle size of the diet showed significant differences in all size classes for the days of testing, including also the particles between 1 to 8 mm in view of the pens of the test. In D 1, the percentage of particles between 1 to 8 mm is higher than expected, with other classes within the size limits. The reduction of particles retained in sieve of 8 mm, and an increase in the sieve of 1 mm in D 2, can be explain by the mixing time practiced. Overall, the proportion of particles 8 - 19 mm were under and particles 1 - 8 mm were above the recommended values. In the last day of testing, the higher processing time of the forage may have led to reduction of particles with size > 19 mm, leading to only the particles < 1 mm were in appropriate proportions. The differences occurred between pens were small and could be a consequence of the distance between pens and the path irregular used by SRMDR. On average the size fractions ranging from 1 to 8 mm to 19 mm and 8 are not inagreement with the expected. The particles retained in sieve of 1 mm are at higher percentage, whereas fractions retained in the sieve with 8 mm are lower. [...] -A dieta completa (MS= 53, 3 %, PB= 27, 4 %) foi formulada de modo a cobrir as exigências nutricionais de vacas Holstein que produzem em média 25, 8 kg de leite por dia. Com o objectivo de avaliar a homogeneidade da dieta completa, quer em termos de composição química quer de granulometria, foram recolhidas 8 amostras de alimento ao longo das manjedouras em 4 dias, perfazendo na totalidade 32 amostras. Cada amostra foi sujeita à determinação da composição química (MS, PB, NDF, ADF e ADL) e à avaliação da granulometria usando um ‘Penn State Particle Separator’ (PSPS) composto por 3 crivos (diâmetro com 19, 8 e 1 mm) e um fundo. Foi também analisado cada alimento da dieta individualmente (MS, PB, NDF, ADF e ADL). A composição química verificou-se homogénea ao longo do ensaio, apesar das pequenas alterações no teor de MS e de ADL, para os dias de ensaio, embora irrelevantes. Verificouse um efeito importante do dia de recolha na granulometria da dieta, mas a diferença entre parques foi pequena...|$|E
