500|$|Halo Wars was {{originally}} not a Halo series title. Ensemble spent 12 to 18 months {{working on the}} control scheme, using the Age of Mythology engine. The development team hacked an Age of Mythology expansion, , and {{used it as a}} prototype for control experiments. Ensemble found that managing Age of Mythologys resources, units, and buildings was too difficult with the console's controller. [...] "The answer [...] is actually hidden in the question," [...] Jason Pace, Microsoft Game Studio's lead producer, told The New Zealand Herald. [...] "It's something we believe has held strategy games back from succeeding on the console: you can't effectively bring a PC-style strategy game to the console because the fundamental game mechanic is tied to the mouse and keyboard input devices. It's not a question of just changing the control scheme to be gamepad friendly—you need to adapt the underlying strategy mechanic to make sense with the new input device." [...] Senior designer Justin Rouse said that the team kept the controls from the research they had conducted, but scrapped the rest in favor of [...] "build from the floor up what we need: the basics, the core of a strategy game." [...] With the goal of making [...] "the first great strategy game on the console", Ensemble streamlined gameplay mechanics; the game's single resource is produced at each base site, which allows players to quickly cycle through their bases instead of micromanaging <b>multiple</b> <b>resources</b> at many locations.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2008 {{paper by}} Westley Wiemer and George Necula, the syntax of the try...finally blocks in Java is a {{contributing}} factor to software defects. When a method needs to handle the acquisition and release of 3–5 resources, programmers are apparently unwilling to nest enough blocks due to readability concerns, even when {{this would be a}} correct solution. It is possible to use a single try...finally block even when dealing with <b>multiple</b> <b>resources,</b> but that requires a correct use of sentinel values, which is another common source of bugs for this type of problem. Regarding the semantics of the try...catch...finally construct in general, Wiemer and Necula write that [...] "While try-catch-finally is conceptually simple, it has the most complicated execution description in the language specification [...] and requires four levels of nested “if”s in its official English description. In short, it contains a large number of corner cases that programmers often overlook." ...|$|E
