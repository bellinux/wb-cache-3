60|$|Although it is {{probable}} that pollen was aboriginally the sole attraction to insects, and although many plants now exist whose flowers are frequented exclusively by pollen-devouring insects, yet the great majority secrete nectar as the chief attraction. Many years ago I suggested that primarily the saccharine matter in nectar was excreted as a waste product of chemical changes in the sap; and that when the excretion happened to occur within the envelopes of a flower, it was utilised for the important object of cross-fertilisation, being subsequently much increased in quantity and stored in various ways. (10/45. Nectar was regarded by De Candolle and Dunal as an excretion, as stated by Martinet in 'Annal des Sc. Nat.' 1872 tome 14 page 211.) This view is rendered probable by the leaves of some trees excreting, under certain climatic conditions, without the aid of special glands, a saccharine fluid, often called honey-dew. This is the case with the leaves of the lime; for although some authors have disputed the fact, a most capable judge, Dr. Maxwell Masters, informs me that, after having heard the discussions on this subject before the Horticultural Society, he feels no doubt on this head. The leaves, as well as the cut stems, of the <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus) secrete in a like manner saccharine matter. (10/46. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1876 page 242.) According to Treviranus, so do the upper surfaces of the leaves of Carduus arctioides during hot weather. Many analogous facts could be given. (10/47. Kurr 'Untersuchungen uber die Bedeutung der Nektarien' 1833 page 115.) There are, however, a considerable number of plants which bear small glands on their leaves, petioles, phyllodia, stipules, bracteae, or flower peduncles, or on the outside of their calyx, and these glands secrete minute drops of a sweet fluid, which is eagerly sought by sugar-loving insects, such as ants, hive-bees, and wasps. (10/48. A large number of cases are given by Delpino in the 'Bulletino Entomologico' Anno 6 1874. To these may be added those given in my text, as well as the excretion of saccharine matter from the calyx of two species of Iris, and from the bracteae of certain Orchideae: see Kurr 'Bedeutung der Nektarien' 1833 pages 25, 28. Belt 'Nicaragua' page 224, also refers to a similar excretion by many epiphytal orchids and passion-flowers. Mr. Rodgers has seen much nectar secreted from the bases of the flower-peduncles of Vanilla. Link says that the only example of a hypopetalous nectary known to him is externally {{at the base of the}} flowers of Chironia decussata: see 'Reports on Botany, Ray Society' 1846 page 355. An important memoir bearing on this subject has lately appeared by Reinke 'Gottingen Nachrichten' 1873 page 825, who shows that in many plants the tips of the serrations on the leaves in the bud bear glands which secrete only at a very early age, and which have the same morphological structure as true nectar-secreting glands. He further shows that the nectar-secreting glands on the petioles of Prunus avium are not developed at a very early age, yet wither away on the old leaves. They are homologous with those on the serrations of the blades of the same leaves, as shown by their structure and by transition-forms; for the lowest serrations on the blades of most of the leaves secrete nectar instead of resin (harz).) In the case of the glands on the stipules of Vicia sativa, the excretion manifestly depends on changes in the sap, consequent on the sun shining brightly; for I repeatedly observed that as soon as the sun was hidden behind clouds the secretion ceased, and the hive-bees left the field; but as soon as the sun broke out again, they returned to their feast. (10/49. I published a brief notice of this case in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1855 July 21 page 487, and afterwards made further observations. Besides the hive-bee, another species of bee, a moth, ants, and two kinds of flies sucked the drops of fluid on the stipules. The larger drops tasted sweet. The hive-bees never even looked at the flowers which were open at the same time; whilst two species of humble-bees neglected the stipules and visited only the flowers.) I have observed an analogous fact with the secretion of true nectar in the flowers of Lobelia erinus.|$|E

40|$|Known as <b>manna</b> <b>ashes,</b> {{some local}} {{varieties}} of Fraxinus ornus L. and F. angustifolia Vahl (Oleaceae) are cultivated for extracting the manna, a product rich in mannose which is useful under both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical aspects. As wild plants in Sicily these ashes participate in diversifying evergreen and deciduous oak woods {{as well as}} other forest communities at the watercourse borders, together with several species of Salix, Populus and Ulmus, particularly in the hills. Cultivation of manna dates back to ancient times in Sicily and elsewhere and ash groves were increasingly spread up to the half of last century. Then, the culture had a progressive decline due to the abandonment of land and its gradual replacement by other crops. Most of the surface formerly occupied by ashes is now uncultivated and therefore also exposed to recurrent fires. As a consequence even the rich varietal heritage, documented by detailed monographs, went partially lost, although recently have not missed a revival of the local scientific community. In the face of the many thousands hectares occupied by these crops in the past, now residual plantations are confined in just a few hundred hectares in the territories of Castelbuono and Pollina (province of Palermo), in the northern side of the Madonie mountains. In this area the plant landscape had been strongly characterized by the ash groves, that besides acted an efficacious hydrogeological protection. At present, despite the progressive loss, the cultivation of <b>manna</b> <b>ashes</b> could still {{play an important role in}} the local economy. Therefore, in order to preserve all social, cultural and even biological values as well the landscape, it was proposed to establish a natural reserve of the <b>manna</b> <b>ashes</b> some decades ago; but that suggestion was later abandoned after the Madonie natural Park was estasblished. Nevertheless the Park has not, over the years, affected concretely the further abandonment of ash groves and the protection and conservation of the related landscape. Recently, the Sicilian Regional government has adopted some measures aimed at supporting farmers for replanting ash groves: these are active conservation initiatives for the produc- tion of manna. Here we find it useful to propose even passive measures such as reforestation like those implemented elsewhere in the province of Palermo with good results for the envi- ronment and landscape. Other initiatives, that could not be postponed, concern vocational training as well as research and conservation of ash varieties germplasm to be grown in specific arboretums such as those already implanted in the fields of the agricultural schools at Castelbuono (Palermo) and Mussomeli (Caltanissetta) and in the experimental plantations at Sparacia (Caltanissetta), SAF Department of the Palermo University...|$|R

50|$|Since 2010, the Karaburun Peninsula {{is part of}} the Karaburun-Sazan National Marine Park. The {{climate is}} mediterranean, having hot summers and {{generally}} warm to cool, dry winters. Due to its climatic, hydrological and geological conditions, the area is characterized by its unique biodiversity. Most of the territory consists of forests and is relatively well preserved, it include many types of trees, such as Mediterranean oak, <b>Manna</b> <b>ash,</b> Kermes oak and the Field maple.|$|E
50|$|One of the park's {{most notable}} natural {{features}} is the extensive forest of beech trees found only at 1500 m and above. These {{are the most}} southerly beech forests in Europe. Lower down, below 1600 m, there are large forests of holm oak, downy oak and cork oak, and around Castebouono and Pollina the rare <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> is still farmed. The mountains contain some 1500 species and sub-species of plants, around 60% of all those found in Sicily. These include more than 70 different species of orchid.|$|E
50|$|On the {{territory}} of the protected area it has been identified several species of flora with European elements, Central European and Euro-Asian.Vegetation of forests consists of trees and shrubs: English Oak (Quercus robur), Common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea), Black Alder (Alnus glutinosa), European yew (Taxus baccata), <b>Manna</b> <b>Ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus), Turkish Hazel (Corylus colurna), European Cornel (Cornus mas), Eurasian smoketree (Cotynus coggygria), Ruscus (species of: Ruscus aculeatus or Ruscus hypogllosum) or Lilac (Syringa vulgaris).|$|E
50|$|Oaks and the {{accompanying}} silver leafed lime, <b>manna</b> <b>ash,</b> yoke elm, and field maple occupy the hilly area in {{the centre of the}} park. These forests include almost all tree species typical for the local lower forest layer (up to 1000 m above sea level) and some of them (limes, elms) are over 100 years old. A two-hundred-year-old sycamore with circumference of the trunk 4 m is among the landmarks of the park. Among the rich variety of grassy species most typical are the common mullein, toad flax, and ribwort.|$|E
50|$|So far {{the fungus}} has mainly {{affected}} the European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and its cultivars, {{but it is}} also known to attack the Narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia). The <b>Manna</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus) is also a known host, although it is less susceptible than the other European ash species. Experiments in Estonia have shown that several North American ash species are susceptible, especially the Black ash (Fraxinus nigra), {{and to a lesser extent}} the Green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). The White ash (Fraxinus americana) and the Asian species known as Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandschurica) showed only minor symptoms in the study.|$|E

Woods cover about 70% of the surface of the park; the rest consists of meadows, vineyard and olive plantations. The most common plants in the park are hop-hornbeam, downy oak, sweet chestnut, <b>manna</b> <b>ash,</b> but there is also the presence of Mediterranean species such as terebinth, tree heath, bay laurel and holm oak. The fauna of the park includes foxes, European badgers, wild boars and other mammals, while the most common birds are robins, blackbirds, blackcaps and wrens.|$|E

The waterfall is 98 metres high and placed in the landscape of exceptional beauty. The surroundings are one of the most heterogenic areas in that region dominated by spruce and fir and beech and fir forests with spruce on more pronounced slopes. On shallow carbon grounds in the vicinity of the waterfall, there are termofil forests and underbrushes of eastern hornbeam and autumn locust as well as eastern hornbeam and <b>manna</b> <b>ash.</b> The rocks surrounding the waterfall have a very interesting vegetation dominated by endemic and relic types. The waterfall at Skakavac is for more than one reason, one of the most attractive tourist sites in the vicinity of Sarajevo.|$|E
50|$|Τhe {{black pine}} dominates {{on the eastern}} and {{northern}} side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and Bosnian pine. In this zone there is also beech. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there elm, cherry plum, European yew, hazel, holly, cornus mas, <b>manna</b> <b>ash,</b> maple and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants.

Taking into account that most of the ash crops are presently abandoned or under agricultural replacement, the need of conserving such unique landscape is pointed out here (Raimondo 1980) ...|$|E
40|$|The forest {{vegetation}} of Istria {{is considered one}} of the most interesting vegetation types in the Republic of Croatia. This is confirmed by the presence of a large number of highly diverse forest communities occurring on the border between two completely different plant-geographical regions: the Mediterranean region and the Euro-Siberian – North American region. As climazonal vegetation, forests of holm oak in the Eu-Mediterranean represent special value and a particular asset. Owing to systematic research during the past fifty or more years, the general distribution of holm oak in Istria is well known; however, data on forest communities of holm oak and their phytocoenologcal characteristics are much less known. This means that until the present research, only about forty phytocoenological relevés of the forest stands of holm oak in Istria had been released, which clearly demonstrates that these stands have been insufficiently studied and that further detailed research is required. Synecological-vegetation research was undertaken in 12 localities in the coastal part of Istria, starting with the surroundings of Poreč in the north-west, across the western and southern parts, to the surroundings of Pula (Fig. 1). Phytocoenological research of {{forest vegetation}} was based on the principles of the Zurich-Montpellier School (Braun-Blanquet 1964). Our own phytocoenological relevés were entered into the Turboveg database (Hennekens and Schaminee 2001), together with 30 published phytocoenological relevés of forests of holm oak and <b>manna</b> <b>ash,</b> taken in a broader research area and described as the subassociations typicum and cotinetosum. A total of 42 phytocoenological relevés were statistically processed. In addition to classical analysis, numerical analysis by means of SYN-TAX 2000 (Podani 2001) software was also conducted. Eco-indicator values according to Pignatti (2005) were applied to describe the ecological conditions using the floral composition, while the mean values for particular relevés and forest communities were calculated by means of the JUICE 6. 3 programme (Tischy 2002). The applied cluster methods showed very similar results and the same general patterns. Accordingly, the majority of the relevés are clearly divided into three groups, while only three relevés make up a separate group (Fig. 2). Further detailed analysis of the floral composition showed that the studied forest stands of holm oak belong to the first group of relevés, typical stands of holm oak and <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> to the second group, while stands of holm oak and <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> with smoke tree (Table 1) belong to the third group, and so do the three separate relevés. The analysis also showed that all the analyzed phytocoenological relevés belong to the same association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis (Horvatić (1956) 1958, with all the floristic and ecological differences that indicate the affiliation to the three subassociations. Thus, the first group of relevés is represented by stands of holm oak and <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> with a significant amount of deciduous elements, the second group is represented by typical stands of holm oak and <b>manna</b> <b>ash,</b> and the third includes stands in the form of maquis and less well developed forests, containing, apart from the species Cotinus coggygria, species of more open sites. This is presented in more detail in Table 1. Based on the comparisons of the floral composition in our own relevés with the stands of holm oak and <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> in the Republic of Croatia described earlier, it can be concluded that our stands, in addition to the characteristic and differentiating species of the association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis and the appertaining alliance, order and class, are strongly characterized by the elements from the neighbouring forests of pubescent oak with oriental hornbeam (Querco-Carpinetum orientalis Horvatić 1939). In the tree and shrub layers, these include the deciduous Quercus pubescens, Carpinus orientalis, Quercus cerris, Acer monspessulanum, Coronilla emerus ssp. emeroides, Ligustrum vulgare, Cornus mas, Ulmus minor, Sorbus domestica, Euonymus europaea and others, and in the ground layer the grasses Sesleria autumnalis, Carex halleriana, Brachypodium sylvaticum and Carex flacca. Such a large participation of these species, as well as the affiliation of our relevés to the association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis, indicate the different nature and specific features that place it into a separate subassociation. Differences in the floral composition in relation to the subassociations typicum and cotinetosum can primarily be attributed to different synecological growth conditions, as seen from the analysis of ecoindicator values according to Pignatti (2005) (Table 2). The studied holm oak forests are characterized by the best synecological conditions and by species that indicate more sciophylic, colder, more continental, more humid and richer sites than those of typical holm oak forests. It should be pointed out that, in relation to the previously described subassociation typicum, our phytocoenological relevés differ statistically in all ecological indicators, whereas in relation to the relevés of the subassociation cotinetosum, they differ in most of the ecological indicators. These results confirm the earlier understanding on the need to form a special, new subassociation within the forest of holm oak with <b>manna</b> <b>ash.</b> In order to make the final decision on the accurate nomination and systematic affiliation of the analyzed stands of holm oak, in addition to the conducted analyses, we should also take into account past descriptions of holm oak forests both from the area of Istria and from the entire distribution range of this species. As evident from all these works, only the subassociations typicum and cotinetosum are accompanied by phytocoenological relevés, whereas the others are only furnished with textual descriptions without any concrete phytocoenological relevés or a list of differentiating species. This prevented us from making a more accurate and better comparison and clear determination. However, taking into consideration the floral composition, the synecological conditions of its occurrence and past descriptions of the subassociations, variants and facies of the association Fraxino orni-Quercetum ilicis, it may be claimed that the studied stands belong to the subassociation carpinetosum orientalis subass. nova hoc loco. This is in accordance with the valid Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (see article 7). Hence, relevé 4 in Table 1 is taken as the nomenclatural type. Species Carpinus orientalis, Quercus pubescens, Acer monspessulanum, Ligustrum vulgare, Cornus mas, Celtis australis, Carex flacca i Carex halleriana have been determined as differentiating species. In order to reach the final solution to the problem of forests of holm oak with <b>manna</b> <b>ash,</b> both in Istria and in the overall distribution range of this community, we should conduct our own research over a broader area. By doing so we would obtain more comparable data and more specific conclusions on the systematic classification of this association into lower systematic units. Moreover, the newly studied sites provide an excellent basis for further monitoring of syndynamic processes in holm oak forests in Istria...|$|E

Slijedom toga obavljena su sinekološko-vegetacijska terenska istraživanja crnikovih šuma na 12 lokaliteta u obalnom dijelu Istre od okolice Poreča na sjeverozapadu, preko zapadnih do južnih dijelova u okolici Pule te su analizirane i uspoređene sa sličnim crnikovim sastojinama u sjeverojadranskom primorju. Fitocenološka istraživanja provedena su prema klasičnim principima, a ukupno su klasično i pomoću multivarijantne analize obrađena 42 fitocenološka snimka. Također su za opis ekoloških uvjeta i razlika korištene ekoindikacijske vrijednosti prema Pignattiju (2005).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{work was}} mapping and {{evaluation}} of rarer kinds of woody plants occuring in National natural reservation Devinska Kobyla with an area of 101, 11 ha, which {{is a part of}} CHKO Malé Karpaty. It was declared as a reservation in 1964. The subject of protection are rare thermophilic kinds of plants, xerothermophilous steppe communities and a significant paleontological locality Sandberg. The mapped woody plants were brekyn rowan (Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz) and <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus L.). The dendrometric data and location data, GPS coordinates were examined. The final data were arranged to charts and graphs, the output are maps processed in GIS. The acquired results can be used as details by working out of a care program and these results can also bring the new insight into protected territory...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} leaf visible {{injury and}} physiological responses (gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence) to high O 3 exposure (150 nmol mol– 1 h, 8 h day– 1, 35 – 40 days) of two woody {{species of the}} same genus with different ecological features: the mesophilic green ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and the xerotolerant <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> (F. ornus). We also studied how provenances from northern (Piedmont) and central (Tuscany) Italy, within the two species, responded to O 3 exposure. Onset and extent of visible foliar injury suggested that F. excelsior was more O 3 sensitive than F. ornus. The higher stomatal conductance in F. ornus than in F. excelsior suggested a larger potential O 3 uptake, in disagreement to lower visible foliar injury. The higher carbon assimilation in F. ornus suggested a higher potential of O 3 detoxification and/or repair. Contrasting geographical variations of ash sensitivity to O 3 were recorded, as Piedmont provenances reduced gas exchange less than Tuscan provenances in F. excelsior and more in F. ornus. Visible injury was earlier and more severe in F. excelsior from Piedmont than from Tuscany, while the provenance did not affect visible injury onset and extent in F. ornus...|$|E
40|$|Ethylenediurea (EDU) is a {{synthetic}} chemical known to protect plants from the phytotoxic effects of tropospheric ozone (O 3). Although {{many studies have}} proposed the use of EDU for studying the O 3 effects under field conditions, its mechanism of action is not fully understood, and {{it is unclear whether}} it exerts a specific antiozonant action, or if it may also interact with other oxidative stresses. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of EDU on forest species in a Mediterranean environment where, during summer, vegetation is exposed to multiple oxidative stresses, such as O 3 and drought. The experiment was conducted on Fraxinus ornus L. (<b>Manna</b> <b>ash)</b> plants growing in six mesocosms, three maintained under full irrigation, while the other three were subjected to drought for 84 days. In each mesocosm, three plants were sprayed every 15 days with 450 ppm EDU. Gas exchange and chlorophyll "a" fluorescence measurements carried out through the experimental period highlighted that EDU did not affect stomatal conductance and had an ameliorative effect on the functionality of drought-stressed plants, thus suggesting that it may act as a generic antioxidant. The implications of these findings for the applicability of EDU in field studies are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In December 2015 {{the next}} part of the {{research}} population yew (Taxus baccata) took place in NPR Chlumská stráň. The specimens exceeding 4 meters at height at which the sex is possible to determine were selected from the total population. And from this group 50 individuals were randomly selected and the following characteristics were measured height, breast-height diameter, girth, height deployment of the first green branches, distances ends of the branches from the trunk, a distance of 5 nearest trees, their height and azimuth, also was intended sexes and crown shape. Volume and height of the crown were calculated. The aim is {{to determine how the}} surrounding tree species affect mensurational characteristics of the yew not only basic characteristics such as thickness at breast height and tree height, crown but also the crown characteristics and health status. The average diameter of the examined yews is 41, 53 cm and a height of 13, 66 m. The yew crowns were investigated in detail. The most important and interesting data are the yew crown projection and distances of competing species. The average crown projection yew is 79, 25 square meters, the average height of the crown is 12, 26 m, the surface of the crown is 2531, 46 square meters, the average crown width is 10, 36 m and the average volume of 429, 80 cubic meters. 95 % of all surveyed yew has asymmetric crown, making it likely the high impact of competitive species. The most abundand species of competitors is hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) with a total of 60 individuals, an average height of 13, 6 meters and an average distance of 5, 79 meters, followed by lime(Tilia cordata) and <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus). Crown yew are deflected to the north, northwest and west direction because of terrain conditions and competing trees. Research in the future should be also focused to the marginal tree species and for yew it should be very appropriate to establish permanent sample plots and to use collected information for return of yew to our forests...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean area in Croatia is characterised by geomorphological, relief, climatic, pedological and vegetational synecological factors. Apart from {{autochthonous}} (climatozonal) species, a {{large number}} of alochthonous (foreign) species were introduced for the purpose of carrying out ameliorative operations in degraded sites and meeting the horticultural and landscape objectives. Unfortunately, unfamiliarity with biological-ecological properties of foreign species gave rise to a number of mistakes in terms of the choice of species. Horticulturally, the introduced species frequently failed to fulfil the desired aesthetic and composition effects. However, there were also situations in which the newly introduced species adapted exceptionally well to the new conditions and developed far beyond expectations, suppressing the autochthonous vegetation from its original areas. Wherever possible, autochthonous vegetation should be favoured over aloththonous vegetation because the former is already well adapted to the environmental and habitat conditions. The possibilities and quality of autochthonous species as elements of urban vegetation in the Mediterranean are still insufficiently utilised. The auto-chthonous floral elements have, apart from their decorative-aesthetic values (the qualities shared with the alochthonous species), a historical-traditional value. For this reason old plantations of autochthonous species in urban areas should be replaced with the same (or similar) autochthonous ones. The Croatian insular, coastal and hinterland areas are inhabited by {{a large number}} of mainly evergreen autochthonous species. The warmer eu-Mediterranean belt is characterised by the following interesting species: holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), laurustinus (Viburnum tinus L.), privet (Phillyrea latifolia L., Phillyrea media L.), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis L.), common myrtle (Myrtus communis L.), Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus L.), cyprus (Cupressus sempervirens L.), juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus L.), Juniperus macrocarpa Sibth. Et Sm., creeping juniper (Juniperus horizontalis Moench.), curry plant (Helichrysum angustifolium D. C.), tree purslane (Atriplex halimus L.) and others. From an ecological-aesthetic standpoint, the colder, sub-Mediterranean area is characterised by the following species: pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.), <b>manna</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus L.), Montpelier maple (Acer monspessulanum L.), terebinth tree (Pistacia terebinthus L.), smoke tree (Cotinus coggygria Scop.), hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis Mill.), whitebeam (Sorbus aria L.), wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis Crantz), Bosnian maple (Acer obtusatum Kit.), common juniper (Juniperus communis), winter savory (Satureia montana L.) and others...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Spotted ash looper (Abraxas pantaria) is {{a forest}} present in Krka National Park, Croatia with {{occasional}} mass occurrence. The caterpillars of this pest have completely defoliated leaves of Narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) {{in the upper}} flow of river Krka in the period from 2008 – 2010. We have researched the biology of spotted ash looper which is first comprehensive study of this pest in Croatia. Materials and Methods: The research of spotted ash looper included field trials through all the years and laboratory experiments. Caterpillars were reared and daily weighted in laboratory. Fresh and dry Narrow-leafed ash leaves have beenweighted and factor of drymatter in leaves defined. For each individual sex, moment of onset of particular larval instar, prepupa, pupa and butterfly was noted {{in order to identify}} the duration of each stage and possible differences. Duration of larval stages and consummation of food were analysed separately by gender. A total of 200 pupae of spotted ash looperwere transferred to the laboratory for the identification of natural enemies. Each pupa was placed in a separate glass tube and incubated in laboratory. Results and Conclusions: Our results show biology of this pest in Croatia. Caterpillars feed on Narrow-leafed ash and have not been found on <b>Manna</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus). They have moulted only 3 times and pass through 4 larval instars in laboratory conditions. Average caterpillars of 4 th larval instar gained their maximum growth on the 4 th day from the beginning of that stage andmaximumweight on the 8 th day, three days before entering the prepupal stage. The difference betweenmales and females starts to develop during the 4 th larval instar when females consume significantly more food, gain significantly more weight and form significantly heavier pupae. The average 4 th larval instar consumes between 0. 3329 and 0. 3673 g of fresh leaf. Research shows that number of pupae diapauses during the winter,while some of themhave no diapause. This indicates that the pest has at least two generations a year, which was also shown by observations in the field. Pathogen fungus Beauveria bassiana, parasitoids Pales pavida, Cratichneumon cf. fabricator F. and unidentified species from the genus Coelichneumon were natural enemies found in pupae. Beauveria bassiana as a pupal pathogen plays an important role as the most important natural enemy and the existence of its alternative host, ash weevil (Stereonychus fraxini) which occupies the same overwintering niche is also important...|$|E
