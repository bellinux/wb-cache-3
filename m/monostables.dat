5000|$|The KG-13 {{employed}} [...] "FLYBALL" [...] modules. These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, <b>monostables,</b> multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor <b>monostables</b> were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|E
40|$|This book adopts an {{integrated}} approach to {{hardware and software}} for logic-circuit design. It has been developed from the author's experience in lecturing to first-year undergraduate students of electronics and software engineering. Modern programming logic is used and the author describes how the basic programmable devices work, {{as well as how}} to write the software to make them work. The book starts off with the basics of combinatorial design: how to specify logic circuits, how to minimise them and how to implement them. Sequential logic design is presented using the algorithmic state machine (ASM) approach with reference to Moore and Mealy design. These are implemented in programmable logic, using a software specification to drive established programmable logic, using a software specification to drive established programmable array lgoic (PAL) architectures; the software uses the popular PALASM and PLPL specification languages with worked design examples programming standard PAL chips. Later chapters also cover arithmetic circuits and their implementation, data conversion which is used to interface digital circuits to the outside world, and practical aspects of building digital circuits. Solutions are provided for the end of chapter questions. Sections 1. Introduction 1. 1 Introducing digital electronics 1. 2 Organisation of this book 1. 3 Preliminaries 2.

Unlike convectionless problems, the equations studied here lack symmetry between increasing and decreasing travelling waves, which affects the choice of sub and supersolutions used. Our entire solutions include both those that behave like two fronts coming together and annihilating as time increases, and, for bistable equations, those that behave like two fronts merging to propagate like a single front. We also characterise the long-time behaviour of each family of entire solutions, which {{in the case of}} solutions constructed from a <b>monostable</b> front merging with a bistable front answers a question that was open even for reaction–diffusion equations without convection...|$|R
