50|$|A faucet aerator can be {{classified}} {{on the basis of}} its flow rate and the type of water stream (aerated, non-aerated, spray) it produces.In general, standard-sized aerators are available with female (M22x1) or <b>male</b> <b>threading</b> (M24x1). Bathtub spouts often have a bigger diameter with a <b>male</b> M28x1 <b>thread.</b> The United States use different thread sizes: 15/16"-27 for standard-sized male and 55/64"-27 for standard-sized female threads.|$|R
50|$|Every {{matched pair}} of threads, {{external}} and internal, {{can be described}} as male and female. For example, a screw has <b>male</b> <b>threads,</b> while its matching hole (whether in nut or substrate) has female threads. This property is called gender.|$|R
50|$|A screw {{is a type}} of fastener, {{sometimes}} {{similar to}} a bolt (see Differentiation between bolt and screw below), typically made of metal, and characterized by a helical ridge, known as a <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> (external thread) or just thread.|$|E
5000|$|Jointing threads: These are {{pipe threads}} where pressure-tightness is made through the mating of two threads together. They always use a taper <b>male</b> <b>thread,</b> but can have either {{parallel}} or taper female threads. (International standards require all female threads to be parallel.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Longscrew threads: These are {{parallel}} pipe threads used where a pressure-tight joint {{is achieved by}} the compression of a soft material (such as an o-ring seal or a washer) between the end face of the <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> and a socket or nipple face, with the tightening of a backnut.|$|E

50|$|A plug fits {{inside the}} pipe segment or fitting {{to which it}} is mated. In a {{threaded}} plumbing system, plugs have <b>male</b> <b>threads.</b> There are a number of plug types: mechanical, pneumatic-disk, single-size pneumatic rubber, multi-size pneumatic and flow-through, and high-pressure. Special temporary plugs, usually made of flexible rubber, may be installed into a plumbing system to allow pressure testing for leakage.|$|R

50|$|A double-tapped bushing is {{more compact}} than a reducer, {{but not as}} flexible. While a double-tapped bushing has a smaller female thread {{concentric}} to a larger <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> (and thus couples a smaller male end to a larger female), a reducer may have large and small ends of either gender. If both ends are the same gender, it is a gender-changing reducer.|$|E
50|$|In an {{external}} (<b>male)</b> <b>thread</b> (e.g., on a bolt), the major diameter Dmaj and the minor diameter Dmin define maximum {{dimensions of the}} thread. This means that the external thread must end flat at Dmaj, but can be rounded out below the minor diameter Dmin. Conversely, in an internal (female) thread (e.g., in a nut), the major and minor diameters are minimum dimensions, therefore the thread profile must end flat at Dmin but may be rounded out beyond Dmaj.|$|E
5000|$|A {{split nut}} is a nut that is split {{lengthwise}} into two pieces (opposed halves) {{so that its}} female thread may be opened and closed over the <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> of a bolt or leadscrew. This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the screw turning (or, vice versa, to allow the screw {{to pass through the}} nut without turning). Then, when the nut is closed, it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw (in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel) ...|$|E
25|$|Inspection of the {{finished}} screw threads can be achieved in various ways, with {{the expense of the}} method tailored to the requirements of the product application. Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a nut onto it (for <b>male</b> <b>threads)</b> or a bolt into it (for female threads). This is plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although it is not good enough for most commercial manufacturing. Higher-precision methods are discussed below.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{standardized}} methods in use to attach the hose or tube to the component. Some are intended for ease of use and service, others are better for higher system pressures or control of leakage. The most common method, in general, is to provide in each component a female-threaded port, on each hose or tube a female-threaded captive nut, and use a separate adapter fitting with matching <b>male</b> <b>threads</b> to connect the two. This is functional, economical to manufacture, and easy to service.|$|R
50|$|The {{tool joints}} (connectors) are also {{received}} by the manufacturer as green tubes. After a quench and temper heat treat, the tool joints are cut into box (female) and pin (<b>male)</b> <b>threads.</b> Tool joints are commonly 120 ksi SMYS, rather than the 135 ksi of the tube. They generally are stiffer than the tube, increasing {{the likelihood of a}} fatigue failure at the junction. The lower SMYS on the connection increases the fatigue resistance. Higher strength steels are typically harder and more brittle, making them more susceptible to cracking and subsequent stress crack propagation.|$|R
50|$|Usually the {{standoff}} has a #6-32 UNC <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> {{on one end}} which screws into a threaded hole in the case or motherboard backplate, and a #6-32 UNC female thread in the other end which accepts a screw to retain the motherboard. Less often, {{the standoff}} has a female thread in both ends and a second screw is used to attach it to the case. Some standoffs use the M3 female thread (which faces the motherboard) instead of #6-32 UNC, and on a rare occasion a mixture of types {{can be used in}} the same case.|$|E

In this paper, main technical parameters of <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> casting in screw expansion power machine were compared and analyzed with simulation analysis method and an applicable speed and temperature for <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> casting was obtained by mainly considering the entrapped air and the surface defect density. In general, the analysis methods provided herein, offers a viable way to optimize the quality of large machine components while casting. This can benefit the productivity and cost saving...|$|E
40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces male screw and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces <b>male</b> <b>thread</b> pitch diameter control...|$|E
