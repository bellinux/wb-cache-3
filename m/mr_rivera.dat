5000|$|In 2015, {{a federal}} judge ordered DNA testing to {{investigate}} the allegations of evidence tampering.

During this interview, detectives suggested details such as, [...] "She had a multi-colored shirt on, right, Juan?" [...] He had previously misidentified her clothing. The confession that was eventually settled on was closer to the known facts about the crime, but still contained a number of inconsistencies with the crime scene.|$|E

5000|$|In 1785, {{the estate}} was {{acquired}} by the enabler of mine, Antonio Velasco de la Torre, while in 1801 it was inherited by his son, Antonio Velasco de la Torre, with whom he began a period of expansion. Velasco obtained a loan of 30,000 pesos for improvements to the property and {{in the year of}} 1823 introduced coffee cultivation. Known as the [...] "coffee Velasco", would be very well accepted in the region and Mexico City itself.On the death of Antonio, the estate was inherited by his three daughters, Margaret, Josefa and Guadalupe, who nevertheless fail to have the success that his father had made and end up losing the property for debt, fronts the landowner of the region John Goribar, who is in turn the owner of the neighboring ranch Casasano.It is at this time that the estate is visited by Frances Inglis Elskine Calderon de la Barca, who makes an interesting description of it.After the death of John Goribar, the estate was inherited by his son Jesus Goribar, who in 1875 sold it to Isidoro de la Torre, who in turn was the owner of the neighboring estates of St. Charles Borromeo and St. Nicholas Pantitlán. Years later, the property would be inherited by his son Tomas de la Torre, who must suffer the dissolution and disappearance of the Treasury, before the land redistribution that takes place {{as a result of the}} Mexican Revoludón, which will enable the creation of 13 ejidos.As was common in these cases, following the implementation of agrarian reform, the hull of the property was abandoned, until 1957, when a real estate entrepreneur, <b>Mr.</b> Paulino <b>Rivera</b> Torres, acquired, starting from the time its restoration and empowerment, with a view to creating an original farm was to be resort that opened in 1967 and remains offering this served to date.|$|R
5000|$|A scientist, Richard Bellero (Landau), {{builds a}} {{powerful}} laser device that he shoots {{into the sky}} from a laboratory {{on the top floor}} of his home, but the invention is not practical enough to satisfy his demanding father, Richard Sr. (Hamilton), who views his son as a failure and has made plans to hand control of the Bellero company to someone outside the family, to the great chagrin of Richard's ruthlessly ambitious wife Judith (Kellerman). One night after Richard has left the lab, a peaceful bioluminescent extraterrestrial from a world which [...] "hovers just above the ceiling of your universe" [...] rides the laser down to earth. Judith tries to shoot the alien with a laser gun, but the alien protects himself by using a small device in his hand that instantly raises a powerful shield around him. Recognizing that this technology would bring her husband great acclaim and fortune, Judith gets Richard to leave the house by persuading him to go fetch his father. She then tries to coax the alien into giving her his shield's control device, but he disagrees, fearing his technology would fall in the wrong hands. Judith then tricks him into lowering his shield and shoots him, stealing his shield control device. Judith and her maid <b>Mrs.</b> Dame (<b>Rivera)</b> secretly drag the apparently-dead alien's body to the cellar. During a demonstration in front of Richard and his father, who do not know that the alien has been shot, Judith raises the shield but is unable to take it down and becomes trapped inside it. Mrs. Dame, desperate to save Judith from death by asphyxiation, goes to the cellar and is startled to find the alien still alive but very weak. The maid begs him [...] "Can you help?" [...] The alien replies, [...] "Can I not?" [...] Just before dying, the alien lowers the shield by using his own glowing blood, the substance that powers the control device. Despite her being rescued, however, Judith insists that she is still trapped by the shield—the imagined shield, perhaps, of her own guilt over killing an alien that thought only of helping her. As the episode ends, she places her hands helplessly on the [...] "shield" [...] that is no longer there. On one hand is a spot: a glowing drop of the murdered alien's blood that presumably will stain her palm forever.|$|R
