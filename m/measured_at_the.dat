40|$|AbstractFor {{sustainability}} to {{be realized}} the automotive companies need to cascade down their strategies to all business functions, including maintenance. Maintenance objectives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> operational level shall be aligned with business strategies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corporate level by defining key performance <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> each level. This paper developed the initial framework for measuring sustainable maintenance performance (SMP) where 15 <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corporate level, 20 <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tactical level and 43 <b>measures</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> functional level, are identified. In sequence, this paper established the importance level of these measures through a pilot survey in Malaysian automotive companies. The {{findings of this study}} are concluded by recommending all proposed measures as important. The total of lubricants consumption has been considered as <b>the</b> most crucial <b>measure</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> functional level, while learning and growth is the most vital perspective, and furthermore, social factor is becoming a more important in measuring SMP...|$|R

5|$|The ancient {{historian}} Tacitus describes Domitian's first {{speech in}} the Senate as brief and <b>measured,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely , however, foreshadowing {{what was to be}} his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable men such as Arrecinus Clemens.|$|E

25|$|Rømer then {{applies the}} same logic to {{observations}} around the first quadrature (pointG), when Earth is moving towards Jupiter. The time difference between an immersion seen from pointF and the next immersion seen from pointG should be 3½minutes shorter than the true orbital period of Io. Hence, {{there should be a}} difference of about 7minutes between the periods of Io <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first quadrature and those <b>measured</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> second quadrature. In practice, no difference is observed at all, from which Rømer concludes that the speed of light must be very much greater than one Earth-diameter per second.|$|E

The average temperature in the Danubian Plain is 11.4°C, in the Upper Thracian Plain— 13.9°C, in the lower mountains— 8.1°C and in the higher mountains— 2.4°C.

The highest temperature in the lowlands and the hilly regions is in June, while in the higher mountains the warmest month is August. The lowest temperature is measured in January and February, respectively. Many valleys experience regular temperature inversions and fogs in winter. The country's lowest absolute temperature was measured during an inversion in the Tran valley.|$|E
