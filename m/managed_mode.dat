However, during the cruise stage of the flight, First Officer Davtyan stated: [...] "**** it.. who {{operates}} such flights with the jitter and not enough sleep". This may indicate that he didn't have adequate sleeping hours, meaning he was fatigued at the time. The BEA also noted that neither pilot understood how the autopilot of an Airbus A320 works. Analysis of the internal communications {{at this stage of}} the flight shows that Captain Grigoryan was annoyed by the fact that in DESCENT mode (<b>MANAGED</b> <b>MODE)</b> the descent rate was not as high as he expected. BEA noted that in this mode, the descent rate is calculated automatically, depending on a number of parameters describing the descent, e.g. the aircraft attitude in relation to the preset profile and so on. This fact shows that either the Captain did not fully understand the autopilot work algorithm in the DESCENT mode, or was in a state of high psycho-emotional strain with an imperative to land at Sochi as soon as possible.|$|E

Under the current training systems for university teachers, efficient management of teacher’s individual knowledge is restricted by two elements: First, consciousness absence for {{knowledge management}}, and seriously monopolistic consciousness of individual knowledge. Second, absence of platforms or conditions for equal communications and knowledge sharing. The efficient individual management of university teacher could be realized by common efforts from university organization systems and teacher himself. Teacher’s individual knowledge management refers to the systematic procedures which rely on the power for save and use of team knowledge and wisdoms, which spur growth of individual professions, and which promote development of professions and qualities from the teach-area which combined with information technology.

Security researchers embraced virtual machine monitors (VMMs) as a new mechanism to guarantee deep isola-tion of untrusted software components.

40|$|With {{the rapidly}} falling price of hardware, and {{increasingly}} available bandwidth, storage technology is seeing {{a paradigm shift}} from centralized and <b>managed</b> <b>mode</b> to distributed and unmanaged configurations. The key issues in designing such systems include scalability, extensibility and robustness to name a few. This paper describes e-SAFE, a scalable distributed storage system that deploys a pastiche of theoretical and practical techniques, providing tolerance of malicious faults, reduced management overhead such as periodic repairs, and very high availability at an archival scale. e-SAFE {{is designed to provide}} a storage utility for environments such as large-scale data centers in enterprise networks where the servers experience high loads and thus show temporary unavailability (as opposed to P 2 P systems, where servers disappear over the long run). Consequently, the design goal of e-SAFE is to provide high load resilience in a seamlessly extensible way. e-SAFE is based on the simple principle: efficiently sprinkle data all over a distributed storage and robustly reconstruct even when many of them are unavailable under high loads. The performance gears used in e-SAFE are: (i) Task parallelization over multiple file segments that can take advantage of an SMP architecture, (ii) Erasure codes with very fast encoding and decoding algorithms as opposed to naive replications and (iii) A back-ground replication mechanism hiding the cost of replication and dissemination from the user, yet guaranteeing high durability...|$|E

The former is a Windows console application "Shogi Program", a kind of game program which the author developed as one of teaching materials for the freshmen course "Algorithms and Data Structures". And the structure of it is very simple, because it has no components to be connected with it and users of it always use it alone. This program looks like a program with high quality, because it has showed no defect since the first print on the text of the course and while the author developed its network versions (Web application and C/S (Client-Server) system application) for the 2004 university campus festival (2004 TUST campus festival). But, in order to improve its quality moreover, object oriented developing method is worth considering.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{performance}} of our A 320 during novel advanced required navigation performance (RNP) procedures which contain a fixed radius turn that delivers the aircraft onto a short ILS precision final. The approaches were flown automatically with guidance and autothrust as computed by the flight management system. Main areas of interest of these flight trials were the impact of the use of the described ARINC 424 coding options onto (a) the performance of the speed profile for arrival time optimization (b) the vertical path during the RNP part of the procedure and (c) the performance of the autoland capability after a curved transition onto an ILS final. Most recently, the aviation community recognized the potential for exploiting additional benefits from precise area navigations systems and introduced Performance Based Navigation (PBN) through ICAO Doc 9613 for new kinds of en-route, departure and approach procedures. RNP is part of the PBN concept. Within the PBN concept exists the possibility to incorporate turns with a precise ground track. These turns are called fixed radius transitions and are coded as radius-to-fix (RF) path terminators in the ARINC 424 database. They offer the advantage of repeatable ground tracks during the turn and thus more freedom for the procedure designer when route planning in dense traffic, high terrain or environments witch obstacles. Moreover, socio-economic factors can be included - such as circumnavigating noise sensitive areas with guaranteed track keeping performance precluding stray aircraft. Additionally, ARINC 424 allows specifying altitude constraints at waypoints and vertical path angles for each RNP segment terminating at such a waypoint. Whilst offering these benefits, such advanced RNP approach operations are still non-precision procedures and automatic landings cannot be performed after their successful completion. Hence, to enable automatic landings and to extract maximum benefits from RNP operations, they must transition into a precision final approach segment provided by any precision landing system (ILS, GLS, MLS). This is often called RNP to xLS (or RNP 2 xLS). Moreover, the vertical path angle feature is currently largely unused and unexplored, except for the final approach segment of an RNP approach. The approaches were entirely flown using the auto flight guidance in <b>managed</b> <b>mode</b> and with auto-thrust activated. We show supporting evidence that RNP 2 ILS approaches can be safely flown all the way to an automatic landing using the flight management guidance computer and the auto flight control system. In order to fly the desired path with vertical path angle during the RNP initial and intermediate approach, a separate mode (such as LNAV/VNAV) different from the singular approach mode would need to be implemented in the aircraft. Additionally, operators currently apply stabilization criteria following which the aircraft must be established on a straight final with the correct sink rate, fully configured at 1000 ft above aerodrome level. For landings in low visibility conditions, more stringent criteria are often applied. An operational implementation of RNP 2 ILS approaches with a curved final intercept would require a rephrasing of the criteria to include a concept, such as RNP established...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} 30 years options for {{collecting}} self-reported data in health surveys and questionnaires have increased with technological advances. However, mode {{of data collection}} such as face-to-face interview or telephone interview can affect how individuals respond to questionnaires. This paper adapts a framework for understanding mode effects on response quality and applies it to a health research context. Discussion Data collection modes are distinguished by key features (whether the survey is self- or interviewer-administered, {{whether or not it}} is conducted by telephone, {{whether or not it is}} computerised, whether it is presented visually or aurally). Psychological appraisal of the survey request will initially entail factors such as the cognitive burden upon the respondent as well as more general considerations about participation. Subsequent psychological response processes will further determine how features of the data collection mode impact upon the quality of response provided. Additional antecedent factors which may further interact with the response generation process are also discussed. These include features of the construct being measured such as sensitivity, and of the respondent themselves (e. g. their socio-demographic characteristics). How features of this framework relate to health research is illustrated by example. Summary Mode features can affect response quality. Much existing evidence has a broad social sciences research base but is of importance to health research. Approaches to <b>managing</b> <b>mode</b> feature effects are discussed. Greater consideration must be given to how features of different data collection approaches affect response from participants in studies. Study reports should better clarify such features rather than rely upon global descriptions of data collection mode. </p...|$|R
