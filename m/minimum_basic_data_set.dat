40|$|Background: The {{indicators}} for adverse events screening, developed by Wolff in Australia, use ready available data in or-der to identify “red flag ” cases that {{might need to}} be reviewed by clinicians in terms of medical documentation. Methods: In this study, the 8 indicators developed by Wolff {{were used in the}} process of screening the electronic patient records from the 41 district hospitals in Romania. Data used is the Romanian <b>Minimum</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> for 2006 collected at the National School of Public Health and Health Services Management, the institution in charge with data collection and processing. From the 8 indicators selected by Wolff, only one could not be used due to lack of data in the Romanian Mini-mum Basic Data Set. Results: The distribution of these indicators in the 41 district hospitals shows wide differences among hospitals. This could represent an indication of higher clinical risk at some hospitals, but they can mean as well errors in the collection and man-agement of data from the electronic patient records. Conclusion: The study shows that the indicators can be used by hospitals for benchmarking clinical risk, although a better standardization and monitoring of data reporting is necessary in order to increase their validity. The <b>Minimum</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> represents an accessible instrument for identification and measuring of clinical risk, but for purpose of utilization at na-tional level we recommend at first the validation of data used to build the indicators, followed by the testing of the sensibil-ity, specificity, and the positive and negative predictive values...|$|E

30|$|A {{method to}} quickly {{supplement}} the sample data is proposed {{to deal with}} some samples lost in the way to CC while maintaining a high lifetime. In loss and delay sensitive sensor-based networks, packets can be lost in random along the long way to CC. Thus, if only the minimum number of data packets are collected, due to packet loss, the data packets received by the CC can be less than the minimum amount for data recovery, causing failure for recovering the data. However, collecting more data packets may cause a large amount of redundancy and reducing network lifetime. Therefore, LRDC scheme proposes a novel solution for quickly supplementing sample data. The main idea of this method is when the process of collecting data, the amount of data collected must be greater than the amount of data required by the matrix completion technique to present for the loss of data in the route. The data that is more than the requirement of matrix completion technique is called the backup <b>data</b> <b>set,</b> while the <b>data</b> needed for matrix completion technique is called the <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>set.</b> When the <b>data</b> of the <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> is lost in the route and the CC does not receive it completely, the data of the backup <b>data</b> <b>set</b> can be used to supplement the data lost in the <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>set.</b> The strategy of this paper {{is not the same as}} the previous strategy. Due to the amount of data forwarded by sensor nodes in the far CC area is small and there is residual energy, in LRDC scheme, the <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> is directly routed to the CC, while the backup <b>data</b> <b>set</b> is routed to the nodes with a certain distance to CC. When the <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> is lost due to the unreliability of the network transmission, the supplementary data can be quickly acquired by CC, so LRDC scheme has low delay characteristics while maintaining a very high network lifetime.|$|R

40|$|Psychiatric {{patients}} and psychiatric care {{are more difficult}} to measure than acute care patients. The classification schemes are always multi-variate and the measurement highly subjective. Wide ranges of problem severity and intensity of care prevail. Highly skewed distributions are common. Once the data are in, the issue becomes how to use that data to manage the care of psychiatric patients. This paper investigates and illustrates how both problems can be dealt with. The paper first concentrates on the measurement problems and indicates how good scales can be differentiated from bad scales. Reliable scales allow in a second step to trace precisely the evolution of the patient during his care process. This provides an opportunity to manage the care programme of those patients more accurately than possible so far. The case-study concerns a group of 113 patients in one psychiatric ward of a general hospital. Depression is the patient problem of choice. The methodology involves multi-variate data analysis and multi-dimensional scaling approaches. The approach is highly visual. This improves access to information, enables insight and shortens the feedback loop. These foster the exchange of information and facilitate communication about the patients within the therapeutic team. Unfortunately, understanding and experience is necessary.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the variability in caesarean rates in the public hospitals in the Valencia Region, Spain, and to analyse the association between caesarean sections and clinical and extra-clinical factors.  METHODS—Analysis of data contained in the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> (MBDS) compiled for all births in 11  public hospitals in Valencia during 1994 - 1995 (n= 36   819). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between caesarean section rates and specific risk factors. The multivariate model was used to construct predictions about caesarean rates for each hospital, for comparison with rates observed.  RESULTS—Caesarean rates were 17. 6 % (inter-hospital range: 14. 7 % to 25. 0 %), with ample variability between hospitals in the diagnosis of maternal-fetal risk factors (particularly dystocia and fetal distress), and the indication for caesarean in the presence of these factors. Multivariate analysis showed that maternal-fetal risk factors correlated strongly with caesarean section, although extra-clinical factors, such as the day of the week, also correlated positively. After adjusting for the risk factors, the inter-hospital variation in caesarean rates persisted.  CONCLUSIONS—Although certain limitations (imprecision of some diagnoses and information biases in the MBDS) make it impossible to establish unequivocal conclusions, results show a high degree of variability among hospitals when opting for caesarean section. This variability cannot be justified by differences in obstetric risks.    Keywords: hospital utilisation; medical practice variation; caesarean section; administrative database...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{increasing}} use {{of medical}} administrative databases in hospital financing means more attention is being paid to their quality. The object {{of this study is}} to compare diagnoses found in the medical database to treatments mentioned in the billing database and to identify hospital stays with discrepancies. METHOD: The analysis is performed for the diagnoses of heart failure, hypertension, and pneumonia. Data were extracted from the 2000 National Medical <b>Minimum</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> (MBDS) database and from the 2000 National bill summary database. The in-hospital stays were split into four analysis groups: patients with the selected disease and a corresponding treatment, patients with the selected disease but without a corresponding treatment, patients with a treatment, without the selected disease, but with another pathology requiring the same treatment, and patients with a treatment, without the selected disease and without any other pathology requiring the same treatment. RESULTS: The proportion of in-hospital stays with the disease in the medical database but without a corresponding treatment mentioned in the billing database was 1. 1 % for heart failure, 12. 0 % for hypertension, and 5. 1 % for pneumonia. Under-reporting (patient with a treatment but without any corresponding disease) concerned a high proportion of stays for heart failure and for hypertension (29. 6 % and 26. 8 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This database comparison identified hospital stays with discrepancies between the medical database and the billing database. This method allows a better focus on the medical MBDS to be reviewed but must be completed by a thorough analysis of the medical chart. An extension of this methodology to other pathology would be useful to assess the quality of administrative data...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is no {{consensus}} about the possible relation between in-hospital mortality in surgery for gastric cancer and the hospital annual volume of interventions. The objectives were to identify factors associated to greater in-hospital mortality for surgery in gastric cancer and to analyze the possible independent relation between hospital annual volume and in-hospital mortality. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients discharged after surgery for stomach cancer during 2001 – 2002 in four regions of Spain using the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> for Hospital Discharges. The overall and specific in-hospital mortality rates were estimated according to patient and hospital characteristics. We adjusted a logistic regression model in order to calculate the in-hospital mortality according to hospital volume. Results: There were 3241 discharges in 144 hospitals. In-hospital mortality was 10. 3 % (95 % CI 9. 3 – 11. 4). A statistically significant relation was observed among age, type of admission, volume, and mortality, as well as diverse secondary diagnoses or the type of intervention. Hospital annual volume was associated to Charlson score, type of admission, region, length of stay and number of secondary diagnoses registered at discharge. In the adjusted model, increased age and urgent admission were associated to increased in-hospital mortality. Likewise, partial gastrectomy (Billroth I and II) and simple excision of lymphatic structure were associated with a lower probability of inhospital mortality. No independent association was found between hospital volume and in-hospital mortality Conclusion: Despite the limitations of our study, our results corroborate the existence of patient, clinical, and intervention factors associated to greater hospital mortality, although we found no clear association between the volume of cases treated at a centre and hospital mortality...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} trends of incidence of hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality (IHM) in HIV-infected patients with COPD in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era in Spain (1997 - 2012). A retrospective study with data from nationwide population-based COPD diagnoses in the Spanish <b>Minimum</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Set</b> (MBDS) was performed. We established groups according to their HIV and HCV infections: 1) HIV-uninfected patients; 2) HIV-infected patients (with or without HCV coinfection). 1, 580, 207 patients discharge with a COPD diagnosis were included in the study, 8902 of them were HIV-infected patients (5000 HIV-monoinfected patients and 3902 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients). The HIV-infected patients had higher incidence rates of hospital admissions for COPD than the HIV-uninfected patients during the study period. The HIV-monoinfected patients had higher rates of hospitalizations for COPD than the HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in the early-period cART (1997 - 1999), but these rates decreased in the first group and increased in the second, being even similar in both groups in the late-period cART (2004 - 2011). On the other hand, the HIV-infected patients with COPD had higher IHM than the HIV-uninfected patients with COPD. The mortality rates were higher in the HIV-monoinfected patients with COPD than in the HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with COPD in the early-period cART; however, in the late-period cART, the mortality rates trends seems higher in the HIV/HCV group. The likelihood of death in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with COPD was similar to than in HIV-monoinfected patients with COPD. Incidence of hospital admissions for COPD and IHM have decreased among HIV-monoinfected individuals but have increased steadily among HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals in the cART era...|$|E
40|$|The Process Thresholds Working Group {{concerned}} {{itself with}} whether a geomorphic process {{to be monitored}} on satellite imagery must be global, regional, or local in {{its effect on the}} landscape. It was pointed out that major changes in types and magnitudes of processes operating in an area are needed to be detectable on a global scale. It was concluded from a review of geomorphic studies which used satellite images that they do record change in landscape over time (on a time-lapse basis) as a result of one or more processes. In fact, this {{may be one of the}} most important attributes of space imagery, in that one can document land form changes in the form of a permanent historical record. The group also discussed the important subject of the acquisition of <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>sets</b> by different satellite imaging systems. Geomorphologists already have available one near-global basis <b>data</b> <b>set</b> resulting from the early LANDSAT program, especially images acquired by LANDSATs 1 and 2. Such historic <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>sets</b> can serve as a benchmark for comparison with landscape changes that take place in the future. They can also serve as a benchmark for comparison with landscape changes that have occurred in the past (as recorded) by images, photography and maps...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the changes {{made to the}} international spinal cord injury (SCI) skin and thermoregulation function <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> in version 1. 1. Setting: International. Methods: An international working group reviewed suggested changes to the international SCI skin and thermoregulation function <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> <b>set</b> version 1. 0. These changes were discussed and the agreed changes were made. Subsequently, the recommended adjustments were circulated for review to the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) Executive and Scientific Committees, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Board, around 40 national and international societies, and to interested individuals who had signed up wishing {{to have the opportunity}} to review. In addition, the suggested changes were displayed at the ISCoS and ASIA websites for at least a month for possible comments. Results: The recommendation ` largest diameter, including undermining' is changed to: 'Largest undermining', and a description of how to measure this is inserted. The 'smallest opening diameter' is changed to: 'Width' as the maximum dimension perpendicular to the length axis. In the literature, there is a tendency to replace 'grades' or 'stages' with 'categories'; therefore, the word category' is used instead of 'grade' or 'stage'. Conclusions: Impracticable measurements have been adjusted and new terminology adopted. All are to be found on ISCoS website: [URL]...|$|R
