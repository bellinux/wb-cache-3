40|$|Snags are {{a natural}} {{component}} of forest ecosystems {{and provide a}} variety of functions and values to forests and their constituents. Snags provide important feeding substrates, nesting sites, and habitat {{for a variety of}} invertebrates and vertebrates, and many of these functions continue after the snag eventually falls and becomes a log (coarse woody debris). Some forest landscapes are thought to be “snag deficient ” for wildlife needs because of the direct action of forest managers or because of natural events such as winter storms or fire. Therefore, {{it is not unusual for}} forest managers to desire to create snags by various means. In this study we compared snags created by <b>mechanical</b> <b>girdling</b> (chainsaw) and bark beetle (western pine beetle aggregation pheromone) attack to determine acceptability and suitability to cavity dependent species, tree decomposition characteristics, and insect diversity. After 6 years we have found differences in the rate of deterioration (tree fading rates, branchlet retention, bole failure, top breakage, bark sloughing), woodpecker feeding activity, cavity excavation, and insect diversity. Our data indicate that bark beetle-killed trees provide a more biologically rich snag that is both suitable and acceptable to cavity dependent species...|$|E
40|$|Diurnal {{changes in}} {{percentage}} loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC), with recorded values being higher at midday {{than on the}} following morning, have been interpreted as evidence for the occurrence of cycles of xylem conduits' embolism and repair. Recent reports have suggested that diurnal PLC changes might arise {{as a consequence of}} an experimental artefact, that is, air entry into xylem conduits upon cutting stems, even if under water, while under substantial tension generated by transpiration. Rehydration procedures prior to hydraulic measurements have been recommended to avoid this artefact. In the present study, we show that xylem rehydration prior to hydraulic measurements might favour xylem refilling and embolism repair, thus leading to PLC values erroneously lower than those actually experienced by transpiring plants. When xylem tension relaxation procedures were performed on stems where refilling mechanisms had been previously inhibited by <b>mechanical</b> (<b>girdling)</b> or chemical (orthovanadate) treatment, PLC values measured in stems cut under native tension were the same as those measured after sample rehydration/relaxation. Our data call for renewed attention to the procedures of sample collection in the field and transport to the laboratory, and suggest that girdling might be a recommendable treatment prior to sample collection for PLC measurements...|$|E
