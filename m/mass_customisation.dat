The paper argues that a craft-based methodology of designing through making that integrates digital design and production methods, is highly relevant to a 21 st century post-industrial culture of product customisation that is emerging through the capabilities of information communication technologies. The paper notes the historical incompatibility of a methodology of designing through making with the economic constraints imposed by the mass manufacturing technologies of 20 th century industrial production, and highlights that in this <b>mass</b> production context <b>customisation</b> and individuality were largely the territory of crafts based production. The paper makes new connections between the historical and philosophical relationships of craft and technology (Heidegger, Borgman, Kellner) and contemporary research concerned with a re-evaluation of the crafts in 21 st century culture (Cusworth & Press). It identifies a group of contemporary craft practitioners who have embraced digital design and production technologies (Computer Aided Design software, Computer Aided Manufacturing hardware, Rapid Prototyping and other Information Communication Technologies) as part of their creative practice. Through these examples the paper illustrates the potential for innovative digital craft production and the particular capabilities of makers to develop economically viable one-off, small or large scale production methods in relation to specific market needs. The paper concludes that in order to fully exploit the creative potential of craft practices with 21 st century design culture, {{there is a need for}} practice-centred research that focuses on the particular relationships between a craft based methodology and the capabilities of digital design and production technologies...|$|R
40|$|Fashioning Fabrics is a {{visually}} led thematic {{exposition of}} the importance of fabric innovation in influencing the direction of contemporary fashion design. Fashion books tend to focus on silhouette, cut, concept and trends, whereas traditional textile books have little focus on fashion. Previous publications Extreme Textiles (2005) and Techno Textiles 2 (2005) cover applications from aerospace and interiors to medical uses, in addition to fashion. In contrast, Fashioning Fabrics highlights the experimental craft-based approaches which mark out a hybrid territory, bridging fashion and textiles. It addresses the inter-dependence of textiles and fashion, making a new intervention in the literature, from a textile design perspective. As editor, I shaped the content into four key areas: Embellished, Sculpted, Constructed and Imprinted, covering a range of key fabrications. From my personal knowledge, and new fieldwork including designer interviews, I selected a mix of established and emerging designers for each section. The selection and editing of the visuals was a key contribution to the entire work. Close-up details and work-in-progress images reveal the links between concept, processes and techniques of textile development for fashion, beyond the catwalk image, to create a new visual narrative. This imagery, in conjunction with analytical profiles of the designers’ methods and motivation, conveyed signature elements of their textiles work in context. My introductory chapter ‘The hidden art of fashion’ discusses the historical development and role of the textile designer, and the hidden aspects of collaborative working within fashion. It contextualises contemporary work within a historical framework of 19 th and 20 th century Europe, from the development of schools of art and design, early couturiers, the Utility scheme’s ‘good design’ and the post-war surge in new fashion, to the current rejection of <b>mass</b> production for <b>customisation</b> and individuation. This chapter was illustrated with images from my personal collection of fashion textiles...|$|R

They were not among the first to apply the concept of mass customization to food but they were the first to be successful. Several other companies tried to copy the <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> model that is already very popular in many other industries. It is where you can pick your own combination of preset ingredients (ex: for a car it would be the color, the interior, the sports or luxury package, etc.) to have it fit more closely to your needs. Almost all car and computer companies such as Dell or BMW have applied this concept for a long time. What is special about this case is that it {{is the first}} time a food company using mass customization was successful. General Mills also tried to set up a custom cereal website but it failed mainly due to its very high cost and a nonreceptive public. This is one of the advantages of mass customization and their business model, customization with very low cost. Many companies have copied the business model very closely in America and across Europe such as Chocomize, Chocri or MixMyOwn.

Nevertheless, {{it is important to}} gain a better understanding of the ways in which <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> performance may be enhanced, in the light of the number of reported failures of <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> ventures. This thesis explores the use of collaboration in product development processes as a means of increasing <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> operational performance. The two collaborative partners of interest are suppliers and lead users ― a specialised subset of users. The effects of lead users in the product development processes of <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> have not previously been evaluated, nor has their value been compared to that of suppliers. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to investigate the relative effects of collaborating with suppliers and lead users in the product development processes on <b>mass</b> <b>customisation.</b> This is achieved by measuring <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> operational performance in terms of four attributes derived from the literature: development cost, development time, customer influence and product scope. Hierachical regression analysis of survey data collected from two hundred and fifty-one UK consumer products manufacturers revealed a significant positive relationship between lead user collaboration and all four <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> operational performance attributes, while supplier collaboration was found to positively affect three of the four attributes, with the exception of customer influence. In addition, analysis revealed that lead user collaboration had a greater effect on the operational performance than supplier collaboration.

The aim of this study is to examine how far customers are ¿ready¿ for mass-customised products, using the UK new car market as its basis for analysis. A framework is developed and results presented which suggest that a sizeable section of the market is ready to accept the ¿inconveniences¿ of mass-customised products. However, the main inconvenience of <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> is identified as increased price, even for ¿ready¿ customers.

40|$|This paper uses an ‘extended {{resource}} based {{view of the}} firm’ {{to establish}} the benefits of inter-firm collaboration {{within the context of}} <b>mass</b> <b>customisation.</b> We extend the traditional resource based view beyond the boundaries of the firm, moving away from the atomistic view of ‘the firm as an island’ to a more extended understanding, in which a firm’s resources and competitive advantage are embedded in the wider network. Within the context of <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> we propose that inter-firm collaboration may extend a firm’s capabilities in three significant areas: flexibility and responsiveness in supply, and modularisation in production...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>customisation</b> is a {{well-known}} strategy in manufacturing and service industries but {{still has to be}} investigated in the built environment, architecture, and construction with reference to the specifics of those disciplines. The two mainstreams - the manufacture/service industries and the building industry - are fundamentally different in terms of the final product, the production process, the cash flow, and the value chain amongst many other aspects. Building upon the existing literature of <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> in the pioneering industries this chapter investigates those achievements with an aim to facilitate their transfer and employment in the construction industry. It draws a comparative analysis between the two sectors to point out similarities and differences. This helps show the way forward if any attempt towards <b>mass</b> <b>customisation</b> and personalisation is to be successfully made in the building industry. It subsequently outlines the feasibilities and obstacles on the way of application of those strategies in the built environment. Finally the chapter concludes with some practical guidelines for successful employment of customisation and personalisation strategies in the built environment in the future...|$|E
