An accurate, straightforward method of rover mast calibration is achieved by using a total station, a camera calibration target, and four prism targets mounted on the rover. The method was applied to Rocky 8 rover mast calibration and yielded a 1. 1 -pixel rms residual error. Camera pointing requires inverse kinematic solutions for mast pan and tilt angles such that the target image appears right {{at the center of the}} camera image. Two issues were raised. <b>Mast</b> camera <b>frames</b> are in general not parallel to the masthead base frame. Further, the optical axis of the camera model in general does not pass through the center of the image. Despite these issues, we managed to derive non-iterative closed-form exact solutions, which were verified with Matlab routines. Actual camera pointing experiments over 50 random target image points yielded less than 1. 3 -pixel rms pointing error. Finally, a purely geometric method for camera handoff using stereo views of the target has been developed. Experimental test runs show less than 2. 5 pixels error on high-resolution Navcam for Pancam-to-Navcam handoff, and less than 4 pixels error on lower-resolution Hazcam for Navcam-to-Hazcam handoff.

50|$|Buchen has a correspondent's {{office of}} South-West Broadcasting (Südwestrundfunk) and since 1951 {{there has been}} a {{transmitter}} for the company (the Buchen-Walldürn transmitter) in the north-west of the city, in Walldürne Strasse. Until 1993, the first station of South-West Broadcasting was being broadcast over this transmitter on the middle-wave frequency 1485 kHz, although the support for the antenna was a 60 metre high unharnessed, steel <b>framed</b> <b>mast,</b> that served as a self-beaming mast fed from the nadir and insulated against earthing. 1993 the medium wave service was tweaked and the ultra short wave antenna on its tip was expanded. As a result, it was not only increased in height but also made to cover a greater area. Since there were no more plans to receive the medium wave transmissions, the guy-wires of the uppermost level were not provided with isolators.|$|R
40|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{studies are}} presented {{for a variety}} of structural analysis problems. Included are the substructure planar analysis of rectangular panels with and without a hole, the static analysis of space mast, using NICE/SPAR and FORCE, and substructure analysis of plane rigid-jointed frames using FORCE. The computations are carried out on the Flex/ 32 MultiComputer using one to eighteen processors. The NICE/SPAR runstream samples are documented for the panel problem. For the substructure analysis of plane frames, a computer program is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a substructuring technique when FORCE is enforced. Ongoing research activities for an elasto-plastic stability analysis problem using FORCE, and stability analysis of the focus problem using NICE/SPAR are briefly summarized. Speedup curves for the panel, the <b>mast,</b> and the <b>frame</b> problems provide a basic understanding of the effectiveness of parallel computing procedures utilized or developed, within the domain of the parameters considered. Although the speedup curves obtained exhibit various levels of computational efficiency, they clearly demonstrate the excellent promise which parallel computing holds for the structural analysis problem. Source code is given for the elasto-plastic stability problem and the FORCE program...|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} damage detection method that uses changes in natural frequencies to detect damage has advantages over conventional nondestructive tests in detecting {{various types of}} damage using minimum measurement data. Two major challenges associated with the applications of the vibration-based damage detection method to practical engineering structures are addressed: accurate modeling of test structures {{and the development of}} a robust inverse algorithm to identify damage, which are defined as the forward and inverse problems associated with the damage detection method, respectively. To resolve the forward problem, new physics-based finite element (FE) modeling techniques for fillets in thin-walled beams and bolted joints are developed, so that complex structures with thin-walled beams and/or bolted joints can be accurately modeled with a reasonable model size. To resolve the inverse problem, a robust iterative algorithm using a trust-region method, called the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method is developed to accurately detect the locations and extent of damage using a minimum number of measured natural frequencies. The LM method can ensure global convergence of the iterations in solving severely underdetermined systems and deal with damage detection problems with relatively large modeling error and measurement noise. The vibration-based damage detection method developed is applied to various structures including lightning <b>masts,</b> a space <b>frame</b> structure and one of its components, and a pipeline. The locations and extent of damage can be successfully detected in experimental damage detection. In the numerical simulation where there is no modeling error and measurement noise, the exact locations and extent of damage can be detected...|$|R

Archaeologists from the Nautical Archaeology Program at Texas A&M University, the Jamaican National Heritage Trust and the Maritime History Program at East Carolina University excavated the remains of an eighteenth-century merchant sloop in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica in 1994. Excavators removed overburden and the ballast pile, recovering over 600 artifacts associated with the vessel-After exposing well-preserved hull remains, divers recorded the ship's structure. The vessel is preserved {{from the base of the}} apron 'in the bow to its eroded stem knee, and an intact 'mast step evidence for a sloop rig. Portions of the vessel were disassembled mast step prove to expose the sloop's bow construction, <b>mast</b> step and <b>framing</b> pattern. Archaeologists then reburied the remains under sediment and ballast stone. The hull remains are preserved to a length of 56 feet, 6 inches (17. 22 meters) and a maximum beam of 14 feet, 4 inches (4. 34 meters). Shipwrights built the vessel predominantly out of white oak (Quercus sp.), and the keel is maple (A cer sp.), suggesting constriction in the northeastern American colonies. The vessel was a derelict at the time of its sinking. Nearly all artifacts associated with the ship were found broken and discarded within the ballast pile or hull structure. No evidence of the deck structure, bilge pumps or mast survives in the archaeological record. Numerous repairs suggest that the vessel saw long service as a merchant trader. Exhaustive searches of historic documents at the Jamaican Archives in Spanish Town, Jamaica and the National Library of Jamaica in Kingston failed to produce any records identifying the sloop. Regardless, contemporary documents at these locations provided relevant historic data relating to the use of sloops in maritime commerce during the later eighteenth century. Analysis of the Readers Point vessel and its artifact assemblage suggests that the sloop traded among the Caribbean islands and North American colonies. This study concentrates on the hull analysis of the first eighteenth-century vessel to be excavated in the West Indies...|$|R
