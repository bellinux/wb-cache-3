2500|$|The IFE {{was built}} in two primary parts. One warhead was mounted {{directly}} {{to the front of}} the second stage, as had been the case for all three warheads in the original Polaris. The second part was the [...] "penetration aid carrier", or PAC, which carried the second warhead along with the various penetration aids. The PAC dispensed one RV but the principal purpose of its manoeuvring capability was to dispense the 27 decoys into a 'threat tube' surrounding the RVs, which also had a 'disguise' to match their radar appearance to the decoys. The system was not a <b>MIRVing</b> system because the target of both warheads was one location, about which the two warheads were spread, as in the earlier MRV system of Polaris A3T.|$|E
