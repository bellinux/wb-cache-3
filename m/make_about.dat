5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they <b>make</b> <b>about</b> the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
5|$|This {{variation}} {{is named after}} Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926). White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn center and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ {{to be a bad}} move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3, but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4Nec6 6.Be3. After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe55.f4 when Black has an important choice to <b>make</b> <b>about</b> where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best, while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.|$|E

As a part of the Dalstroy fleet, the ships «Ягода» (later renamed «Дальстрой»), «Кулу», «Джурма» transported prisoners from Vladivostok, endpoint of the Transsiberian railway, across the Sea of Okhotsk to Kolyma via Nagayevo port, which was the port of Magadan city. Travel time to Magadan was about 6 to 14 days; trips to the Arctic were seasonal as during the winter the sea froze over. A steamer would <b>make</b> <b>about</b> ten trips a year. Conditions were horrendous, and many people did not survive the trip.|$|E

Vaughan had been captain of the Test team before Moores had taken over, and his {{resignation}} left Moores with a decision to <b>make</b> <b>about</b> who succeeded him. Although it was Collingwood who had previously succeeded Vaughan as captain as the ODI Team, Kevin Pietersen was asked to step in as Captain for the final match of the series. Pietersen had been in good form with the bat and was seen by many as the obvious choice. England {{went on to win the}} final Test by 6 wickets, with Pietersen making a hundred on his first game as captain.|$|E
25|$|An October 2012 {{study by}} the American Association of University Women found that {{over the course of}} a 35-year career, an American woman with a college degree will <b>make</b> <b>about</b> $1.2million less than a man with the same education. Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a {{stimulus}} effect that would grow the U.S. economy by at least 3% to 4%. Women currently make up 70 percent of Medicaid recipients and 80 percent of welfare recipients. Increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the U.S. could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the U.S. economy.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{the main}} cities of Poland are linked by railway {{transport}} reaching 160km/h. On 14 December 2014, Polish State Railways started passenger service trains PKP Pendolino ED250 operating 200km/h speed on 80km line Olszamowice-Zawiercie (part of railway line called Central Trunk Line (CMK) from Warsaw to Katowice). Currently {{it is the}} line with highest railway speed in Poland. Several other sections of the Central Trunk Line will soon allow speeds of 200km/h (with a current speed record set up by Pendolino Train on 21 November 2013 in Poland of 293km/h). According to recent plans of PKP-PLK, sections of CMK between Warsaw and Gdańsk (145km) and Warsaw-Kraków (additional 80km) {{will be added to}} present section from no later than December 2015. That will <b>make</b> <b>about</b> 300km of railways available for speed of 200km/h. Other sections will start operating at 200km/h in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is a part}} of {{the male}} reproductive system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The prostate contains many small glands which <b>make</b> <b>about</b> 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E

25|$|Schweitzer quickly sought other {{financial}} backers. By September, he {{had signed a}} deal (backdated to June to hide Albert's involvement) with Richard Kny, a relative of the Heyden plant's manager. This allowed the phenol plot to continue {{for a short while}} longer. By the time the plot was discontinued, it had succeeded in diverting enough phenol, according to Albert, to <b>make</b> <b>about</b> 4.5 million pounds of explosives. Schweitzer defended his actions, arguing that making medicine and disinfectants was a better use of the phenol than making weapons. The public pressure soon forced Schweitzer and Edison to end the phenol deal, with the embarrassed Edison subsequently sending his excess phenol to the U.S. military, but by that time the deal had netted the plotters over two million dollars and there was already enough phenol to keep Bayer's aspirin plant running. Bayer's reputation took a large hit, however, just as the company was preparing to launch an advertising campaign to secure the connection between aspirin and the Bayer brand.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Dover Area School District reports {{employing}} 351 {{teachers and}} administrators with a salary range of $39,277 to $135,200. Teachers earn extra pay for duties such as advising the clubs, writing curriculum or coaching athletics teams. That amount ranges from several hundred dollars a year to a few thousand. When a team progresses past the regular season the coaches are paid additional dollars for each week the teams continues to play. All of this is stipulated in the teachers' union contract at each district. Additionally, the district's teacher union contract includes seven levels, from a bachelor's degree to a doctorate. A teacher with five years of experience and a doctorate would <b>make</b> <b>about</b> $7,500 more than one with the same experience and a master's degree. A teacher who achieves {{a higher level of}} education receives a raise in step pay and then the annual raise, as well. The school contract year is 190 days. In addition to salary, the teachers receive an extensive benefits package which includes: health insurance, life insurance, vision insurance, dental insurance, a defined benefit pension, 10 paid sick and 2-3 paid personal days, reimbursement for college courses and more.|$|E
25|$|Wegner {{has applied}} this {{principle}} to the inferences people <b>make</b> <b>about</b> their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought {{that is consistent}} with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference. Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused – and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, priming subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause. The implication for such work is that the perception of conscious will (which he says might be more accurately labelled as 'the emotion of authorship') is not tethered to the execution of actual behaviors, but is inferred from various cues through an intricate mental process, authorship processing. Although many interpret this work as a blow against the argument for free will, both psychologists and philosophers have criticized Wegner's theories.|$|E

25|$|Terms such as 'hard-working,' 'reliable,' and 'persevering' {{describe}} desirable {{aspects of}} character. Because {{it was once}} {{believed to be a}} moral evaluation, conscientiousness was overlooked as a real psychological attribute. The reality of individual differences in conscientiousness has now been clearly established by studies of cross-observer agreement. Peer and expert ratings confirm the self-reports that people <b>make</b> <b>about</b> their degrees of conscientiousness. Furthermore, both self-reports and observer ratings of conscientiousness predict real-life outcomes such as academic success. During most of the 20th century, psychologists believed that personality traits could be divided into two categories: temperament and character. Temperament traits were thought to be biologically based, whereas character traits were thought to be learned either during childhood or throughout life. With the advent of the FFM (Five-Factor Model), behavior geneticists began systematic studies of the full range of personality traits, and {{it soon became clear that}} all five factors are substantially heritable. Identical twins showed very similar personality traits even when they had been separated at birth and raised apart, and this was equally true for both character traits and temperament traits. Parents and communities influence the ways in which conscientiousness is expressed, but they apparently do not influence its level.|$|E
