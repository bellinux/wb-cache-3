5000|$|On a {{vertical}} band <b>knife</b> <b>machine</b> usually a narrow width band knife blade is used, {{the most common}} width being 10mm. The length of the band knife blade depends on the supplier of the band <b>knife</b> <b>machine.</b> The dimensions are indicated on a small metal tag pasted or riveted on the machine. The vertical <b>machine</b> band <b>knife</b> blade is most commonly a [...] "double bevel, double edge DBDE" [...] execution to enable cutting while advancing the table and also while retracting the work table, while as the [...] "double bevel, single edge DBSE" [...] execution cuts only in one direction. Productivity is enhanced when the operator cuts both while advancing and also while retracting the work table after adjusting the foam block after each pass for cutting. The DBDE execution blade can have a parallel or twisted 180 degrees welding. The twisted welding execution saves a grinding unit, as both edges pass the same grinding unit after two turns.

Firstly, an automated treatment planning framework is developed for the Gamma <b>Knife</b> <b>machine,</b> a specialized unit for the radiation treatment of brain tumors. Nonlinear programs and a mixed integer program are presented to obtain treatment plans. Since nonconvex nonlinear programs do not guarantee global optimality, two techniques are developed to enhance the perfor-mance of the optimization models by generating initial starting points. The first technique is a heuristic-based approach to find an initial {{starting point for the}} discrete variables of the nonlinear program (the isocenters of radiation doses and the collimator sizes.) This technique uses a variant of a sphere packing approach combined with a Medial Axis Transformation, often used in computer graphics. A linear program is then solved to find the initial radiation exposure time by fixing the values of the discrete variables generated by the above heuristic. Since the amount of data used in the optimization is very large, an iterativ...|$|R

Likewise I discern that the butterflies are not true butterflies, but wooden shavings, which, being spirted up from the wood by the violence of the machinery, and kept in rapid and not equal movement by the impulse of its rotation on the air, flutter and play, and rise and fall, and conduct themselves as like butterflies as heart could wish.

5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into narrower rolls. There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the <b>machine,</b> passing through <b>knives</b> or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form narrower rolls. The multiple narrower strips of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For rewind slitting the machine used is called a slitter rewinder, a slitter or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|R
