500|$|One raging {{public debate}} {{involving}} language went unmentioned in The Language Instinct: the [...] "reading wars," [...] or dispute over whether {{children should be}} explicitly taught to read by decoding the sounds of words from their spelling (loosely known as [...] "phonics") or whether they can develop it instinctively by being immersed in a text-rich environment (often called [...] "whole language"). I tipped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the paragraph in [...] which said that language is an instinct but reading is not. Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it's essential for children to be taught {{to become aware of}} speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters.|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{that for}} some time many persons {{have had to do}} with the art [...] who have greatly lowered it... the desire came upon me to try if I might imitate, after some fashion, some one among those who honourably busied {{themselves}} with the art, [...] I hear regretted every day ... and inasmuch as I could not accomplish this design for lack of types which I needed... would not, and others could not furnish me with what I lacked [...] I resolved, about six years ago, to turn <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> good earnest to the making of punches, matrices and moulds for all sorts of characters, for the accommodation both of the public and of myself.|$|E
500|$|Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote {{a letter}} to Johannes Stricker, one which he {{described}} to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his [...] "persistence is disgusting". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: [...] "Let me see her for as long as I can keep <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> the flame." [...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E
60|$|Some impulse {{brought her}} forward, {{and she took}} both <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> her own.|$|R

500|$|On October 31, 2003 SciFi Channel aired the one-hour special Supernatural {{starring}} Angel. Kate O'Hare said of {{the special}} that, [...] "Filmed in part at Universal Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., [...] "Supernatural" [...] finds Angel crawling up buildings, passing a quarter through his skin, spontaneously combusting and having otherworldly creatures burst from his chest." [...] When asked about his process in creating television specials, Angel said that, [...] "I like to have <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> everything on my TV specials. I'm the executive producer; I direct it; I create it. I write all the music for my TV specials and my live performances. It's on my label. I write it; I produce it." [...] During the special Angel performed stunts including lighting himself on fire and making a tarantula emerge from a pedestrian's soda can. In 2003, Angel was also featured in the two-hour TBS special Made in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
2500|$|... “After {{finishing}} {{my work in}} the north, I {{returned to}} Pine Ridge, and Blue Horse hastened to visit me as before. I became very much attached to him. When I left he held <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> both his and shook it warmly. His heart was too full of emotion to speak a word. He realized that the chances were we would never see each other again. He died several years ago.” ...|$|E
60|$|I wrung <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> agony. Leo was drowned, and I {{was left}} alive to mourn him.|$|R
60|$|I put <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> trowsis-pocket {{and looked}} at 'im. Then I walked very slow, towards the gate.|$|R
60|$|I folded <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap and I {{never took}} {{my eyes off}} Jemmy as he went running on.|$|R
2500|$|Vandersloot {{became a}} {{basketball}} star at Kentwood High School in her hometown. Her coach, Keith Hennig, a former player at Central Washington University who is 6inches taller than Vandersloot, regularly played one-on-one against her either {{before or after}} the team's practice. He would later say, [...] "I did not take it easy on her at all. I was more physical than anything she's ever been used to. At times, I wasn't too nice. I would ride her and foul her. I'd put <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> her face and she would whine and complain about fouls. I'd say, 'There's no fouls out here.' [...] " [...] She eventually reached the point where she regularly beat her coach off the dribble.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Iommi {{lost the}} tips of the middle and ring finger of his right hand in an {{industrial}} accident on his last day of work in a sheet metal factory. Iommi described how he [...] "... was told 'you'll never play again. [...] It was just unbelievable. I sat in the hospital with <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> this bag and I thought 'that's it – I'm finished. [...] But eventually I thought 'I'm not going to accept that. There must be a way I can play'." [...] After the injury Iommi considered abandoning the guitar entirely. However, his factory foreman played him a recording of famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, which encouraged him to continue as a musician. As Iommi would later write: ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E

60|$|So saying, I clasped <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> {{the manner}} of one in prayer, setting all my soul into my speech, as a man desperate.|$|R
60|$|I re-entered, with <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> my pocket--and--and {{my heart}} in my mouth.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a grasp {{cold and}} listless, and smiled from mirthless eyes.|$|E
60|$|He grasped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a {{very large}} and heavy glove, with which he then wiped his perspiring brow.|$|E
60|$|I am {{not ashamed}} to say that I, Etienne Gerard, sat upon my dead horse and sank <b>my</b> face <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{have made}} you a little--a little less unhappy?" [...] I asked him, and hid <b>my</b> face <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> a desolate peace and solitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fasser," [...] shouted {{a silvery}} {{voice from the}} same region, [...] "'Tumps is naughty. I wants to wass <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> de soup, an' he won't let me." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{saying he}} turned his back to the sea, and, still {{retaining}} <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his, led me into the forest.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated, {{awkward and}} bashful, {{shifted his weight}} from one leg to the other, then blunderingly gripped <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a hearty shake.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Emma drew nearer {{and took}} <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hers. At the same time, {{she held up}} the other scarred and lacerated palm.|$|E
60|$|I put <b>my</b> <b>'and</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket. Then I {{put it in}} {{the other}} one, and arter that I stood staring at George Tebb and shaking all over.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What!' I cried, {{uncertain}} whether to regard {{him as a}} worldly visitor, and I raised <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> amazement. 'What! you come back? Is it really you? Is it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the girl}} said, [...] "if I {{put one foot}} on yours I could {{certainly}} hold on. I could twist one of <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> the horse's mane." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the thought}} struck {{me to try}} a bit of deception. I put <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> my pocket and drew out the empty envelope.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sat down}} beside me, and took <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his, and with very gentle words began to reason and argue with me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'After this, Lois,' he said, taking <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his--and I {{was weak}} enough, for a moment, {{to let it}} lie there--'you cannot say No to me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you any {{objection}} to <b>my</b> putting <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> breeches pockets?" [...] I inquired. [...] "Excuse me mentioning it, but you showed yourself so extremely nervous a moment back." ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} on {{his side of the}} bargain. Now came mine. I folded tight <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap, glanced up at the flaming lamp. How much would he pay me? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} not so clear as the {{preceding}} one, {{and the air was}} chilly, with a little moisture in it. I buttoned up my jacket, and thrust <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pockets.|$|R
