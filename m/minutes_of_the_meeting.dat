25|$|Instead, Tufte {{argues that}} the most {{effective}} way of presenting information in a technical setting, such as an academic seminar or a meeting of industry experts, is by distributing a brief written report that can be read by all participants in the first 5 to 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting.</b> Tufte believes that this is the most efficient method of transferring knowledge from the presenter to the audience and then the rest of the meeting is devoted to discussion and debate.|$|E
25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{in each state}} vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official – often that state's secretary of state or equivalent – who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is {{the selection of a}} president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting.</b> In many states, political officials give short speeches {{at this point in the}} proceedings.|$|E

25|$|On December 31, Bonifacio and the Magdalo and Magdiwang leaders held {{a meeting}} in Imus, ostensibly to {{determine}} the leadership of Cavite in order to end the rivalry between the two factions. The issue of whether the Katipunan should {{be replaced by a}} revolutionary government was brought up by the Magdalo, and this eclipsed the rivalry issue. The Magdalo argued that the Katipunan, as a secret society, should have ceased to exist once the Revolution was underway. They also held that Cavite should not be divided. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang contended that the Katipunan served as their revolutionary government since it had its own constitution, laws, and provincial and municipal governments. Edilberto Evangelista presented a draft constitution for the proposed government to Bonifacio but he rejected it as it was too similar to the Spanish Maura Law. Upon the event of restructuring, Bonifacio was given carte blanche to appoint a committee tasked with setting up a new government; he would also be in charge of this committee. He tasked Emilio Aguinaldo to record the <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> and requested for it to establish this authority, but these were never done and never provided.|$|E

Cricket administrators were called to testify about the matter and more details became public. According to cricket historian Gideon Haigh, [...] "it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock".|$|E

500|$|The Board of Control had granted {{themselves}} {{the power to}} exclude a player from the national team [...] "on grounds other than cricket ability" [...] following the poor behaviour of {{some members of the}} 1912 team that toured England. They had a secret dossier, compiled during the season, documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> at which they discussed his selection. Publicly, the Board remained silent on their policy and how it related to Barnes. On the field, Barnes responded with an innings of 128 in three hours against Queensland; off the field, he sought answers from the administrators, but was frustrated by their evasiveness. His form tapered off during the closing stages of the season and he finished with 433 first-class runs at an average of 39.36.|$|E
500|$|One {{former police}} detective, Frank Chauvin, {{along with a}} Catholic anti-abortion activist, filed suit against the Order of Canada Advisory Council, {{demanding}} that the <b>minutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> relating to Morgentaler be made public. The appointment of Morgentaler prompted former Liberal Member of Parliament Clifford Lincoln to write that {{the workings of the}} Advisory Council were [...] "mysterious", citing what he theorized to be inbuilt partiality and conflict of interest as reasons why Margaret Somerville, whom Lincoln had twice nominated to the Advisory Council, was turned down for appointment, yet Morgentaler was accepted. Journalist Henry Aubin in the Montreal Gazette opined that the council's rejection of Somerville, her personal opposition to same-sex marriage, and the acceptance of Brent Hawkes, Jane Rule, and Jean Chrétien, all regarded as supporting same-sex unions, as well as the appointment of a controversial figure such as Morgentaler, were all signs that the Advisory Council operated with partisan bias. Aubin also pointed to the presence on the council of members of the Royal Society of Canada, an organization into which Somerville was received.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the many}} heated debates {{that took place}} during the meeting, all {{governors}} except Augustus Bradford of Maryland consented to the final address.

[...] With Blair's name, a total of twelve signatures were included on the address to be presented to the president.
