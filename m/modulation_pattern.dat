40|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} (AM) {{and frequency}} modulation (FM) in speech signals {{are believed to}} reflect various non-linear phenomena during the speech production process. In this paper, the amplitude and frequency <b>modulation</b> <b>patterns</b> are analyzed {{for the first three}} speech resonances in relation to the fundamental frequency (F 0). The formant tracks are estimated, and the resonant signals are extracted and demodulated. The Amplitude Modulation Index (AMI) and Frequency Modulation Index (FMI) are computed, and examined in relation to the F 0 value, as well as the relation between F 0 and the first formant value (F 1). Both AMI and FMI are significantly affected by pitch, with modulations being more frequently present in low F 0 conditions. Evidence of non-linear interaction between the glottal source and the vocal tract is found in the dependence of the <b>modulation</b> <b>patterns</b> on the ratio of F 1 over F 0.

50|$|Olfactory sensory neurons project axons to {{the brain}} within the {{olfactory}} nerve, (cranial nerveI). These nerve fibers, lacking myelin sheaths, pass to the olfactory bulb of the brain through perforations in the cribriform plate, which in turn projects olfactory information to the olfactory cortex and other areas. The axons from the olfactory receptors converge in the outer layer of the olfactory bulb within small (≈50 micrometers in diameter) structures called glomeruli. Mitral cells, located in the inner layer of the olfactory bulb, form synapses with the axons of the sensory neurons within glomeruli and send {{the information about the}} odor {{to other parts of the}} olfactory system, where multiple signals may be processed to form a synthesized olfactory perception. A large degree of convergence occurs, with 25,000 axons synapsing on 25 or so mitral cells, and with each of these mitral cells projecting to multiple glomeruli. Mitral cells also project to periglomerular cells and granular cells that inhibit the mitral cells surrounding it (lateral inhibition). Granular cells also mediate inhibition and excitation of mitral cells through pathways from centrifugal fibers and the anterior olfactory nuclei. Neuromodulators like acetylcholine, serotonin and norepinephrine all send axons to the olfactory bulb and have been implicated in gain <b>modulation,</b> <b>pattern</b> separation, and memory functions, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Since X-rays are {{not easily}} {{reflected}} or refracted, imaging in X-rays is difficult. One {{solution to this problem}} is to selectively block the X-rays. If the X-rays are blocked in a way that depends on the direction of the incoming photons, then {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct an image. The imaging capability of RHESSI is based on a Fourier-transform technique using a set of 9 Rotational Modulation Collimators (RMCs) as opposed to mirrors and lenses. Each RMC consist of two sets of widely spaced, fine-scale linear grids. As the spacecraft rotates, these grids block and unblock any X-rays which may be coming from the Sun modulating the photon signal in time. The modulation can be measured with a detector having no spatial resolution placed behind the RMC since the spatial information is now stored in the time domain. The <b>modulation</b> <b>pattern</b> over half a rotation for a single RMC provides the amplitude and phase of many spatial Fourier components over a full range of angular orientations but for a small range of spatial source dimensions. Multiple RMCs, each with different slit widths, provide coverage over a full range of flare source sizes.

By contrast, whereas the maximum modulation depth and modulation frequency influences the range of accessible linewidths, they do not significantly alter the threshold for a given linewidth.
