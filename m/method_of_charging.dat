500|$|At the 1934 party, Tesla {{told reporters}} he had {{designed}} a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He {{would call it}} [...] "teleforce", but was usually referred to as his death ray. Tesla {{described it as a}} defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country to be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.|$|E

In North America, adapters for 120-volt NEMA 5-15 and 240-volt NEMA 14-50 outlets, as well as an adapter for SAE J1772 charging stations, are included.

50|$|After {{the initial}} {{invention}} {{in the late}} 1830s of a needle-fire rifle, a revolver was soon developed. This type of firearm used a paper cartridge. It used a long, thin, needle-like firing pin that passed through a small hole {{at the rear of}} the cylinder, through the powder, and struck a disposable primer cap that was set behind the bullet. The revolverâ€™s cylinder simply had a small hole drilled at the rear of each chamber.

40|$|In {{connection}} with existing theoretical concepts, {{it was difficult}} to explain the negative potentials found in sunlight, first on Applied Technology Satellite- 5 (ATS- 5) and then on ATS- 6. The problem became important when an association between spacecraft charging and anomalies in spacecraft behavior was observed. A study <b>of</b> daylight <b>charging</b> phenomena on ATS- 6 was conducted, and an investigation was performed with the objective to determine effective <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> control, taking into account the feasibility to utilize the ATS- 5 and ATS- 6 ion engines as current sources. In the present paper, data and analysis for the ion engine experiments on ATS- 5 and ATS- 6 are presented.

50|$|As a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} {{is incapable of}} natural aspiration as defined above, some <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> the cylinders with scavenging air must {{be integrated into the}} engine design. This is usually achieved with a positive displacement blower driven by the crankshaft. The blower does not act as a supercharger in this application, as it is sized to produce a volume of air flow that is in direct proportion to engine's requirement for combustion, at a given power and speed. By the Society of Automotive Engineer's definition, a mechanically scavenged two-stroke diesel engine is considered to be naturally aspirated.|$|E

50|$|The Persians {{deployed}} their cataphracts {{in mixed}} formations with light archers {{in the rear}} ranks, supporting the charge with arrows. Mongolian heavy cavalry improved upon the charging effect by attaching hooks to their lances to take enemies down when bypassing. Usually, employed a two-ranks deep formation of heavy cavalry charging the enemy. They were supported by three ranks of light cavalry, delivering rapid closeup shots with heavy armour-breaking arrows. Chinese cavalry and samurai often used polearms.
