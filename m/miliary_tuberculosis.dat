40|$|Introduction. Tuberculous otitis is a {{diagnostic}} problem {{due to the}} difficulty to obtain microbiological, histomorphological and cytological confirmation of the disease. Objective. Our objective was to compare clinical and radiological characteristic and development of otogenic complications in patients with tuberculous otitis and otitis with cholesteatoma as the most destructive form of chronic nonspecific otitis in the purpose of establishing the diagnostic criteria for tuberculous otitis. Methods. Medical records of 12 patients with tuberculous otitis and 163 patients with cholesteatoma treated at the Institute of Otorhinolaryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery in Belgrade during the eight-year period were analyzed. All of the patients underwent otomicroscopic, audiological and radiological examination of the thorax and temporal bone, microbiological examination of the secretion and histomorphological examination of the tissue taken during middle ear surgery. Statistical analysis was done using χ 2 test with Yates correction. Results. Otogenic complication as facial palsy and sensorineural hearing loss were more frequent in tuberculous otitis patients, than in cholesteatoma. Also, fistulas of the labyrinth and facial canal bone destruction were also more frequent in tuberculous otitis than in cholesteatoma. A larger extent of temporal bone destruction was noticed on CT scans {{of the temporal bone}} in half of the patents with tuberculous otitis. Coexistence with <b>miliary</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> was detected in one third of the patients. There were no microbiological or histomorphological confirmations of the disease, except in one case with positive Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Conclusion. Tuberculous otitis media should be considered in patients with serious otogenic complications and with shorter duration of ear discharge, and in association with diagnosed <b>miliary</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and extensive temporal bone destruction. Polymerase chain reaction still is not reliable for diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Computer Tomography (CT) is {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} assessing the morphological changes of lung parenchyma. Although novel CT techniques have substantially decreased the radiation dose, radiation exposure is still high. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been established as a radiation- free alternative to CT for several lung diseases, but its role in infectious diseases still needs to be explored further. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to compare MRI with high resolution CT (HRCT) for assessing pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods 50 patients with culture-proven pulmonary tuberculosis underwent chest HRCT as the standard of reference and were evaluated by MRI within 24 h after HRCT. Altogether we performed 60 CT and MRI examinations, because 10 patients were also examined by CT and MRI at follow- up. Pulmonary abnormalities, their characteristics, location and distribution were analyzed by two readers who were blinded to the HRCT results. Results Artifacts did not interfere with the diagnostic value of MRI. Both HRCT and MRI correctly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis and identified pulmonary abnormalities in all patients. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two techniques in terms of identifying the location and distribution of the lung lesions, though the higher resolution of MRI did allow for better identification of parenchymal dishomogeneity, caseosis, and pleural or nodal involvement. Conclusion Technical developments and the refinement of pulse sequences have improved the quality and speed of MRI. Our data indicate that in terms of identifying lung lesions in non-AIDS patients with non- <b>miliary</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis,</b> MRI achieves diagnostic performances comparable to those obtained by HRCT but with better and more rapid identification of pulmonary tissue abnormalities due to the excellent contrast resolution. </p...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study is to amplify the {{knowledge}} base of the epidemiology, symptoms, and signs of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in Afghanistan. MethodsThis is a retrospective review of EPTB diagnosed at CURE International Hospital and CURE Family Health Center (FHC) in Kabul, Afghanistan during a recent 20 -month period. ResultsOne hundred eighteen cases were identified from patients presenting to the hospital and FHC. This group represents the spectrum of EPTB seen at a single referral center in Kabul. The ratio of females to males was 2. 03 : 1. Lymph node tuberculosis comprised the greatest number of EPTB cases (37. 3 %, n= 44). The central nervous system was the next most frequent site of EPTB involvement (20. 3 %, n= 24), followed in descending order by skeletal, pleural, abdominal, cutaneous, genitourinary, pericardial, <b>miliary,</b> and breast <b>tuberculosis.</b> ConclusionsThe 2 : 1 ratio of female to male EPTB cases coincides with the unusual epidemiologic pattern seen in smear-positive pulmonary TB in Afghanistan.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the role of TNF-alpha in pulmonary tuberculosis, we determined the TNF-alpha productivity of alveolar macrophages(AMs) obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage(BAL), along {{with the level of}} TNF-alpha in the serum of patients with <b>tuberculosis</b> including pulmonary, <b>miliary,</b> and endobronchial <b>tuberculosis,</b> healthy controls, and pulmonary diseases such as diffuse interstitial lung disease (DILD) and pneumonia. AMs from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis did not produce a larger amount of TNF-alpha than did those from the healthy control subjects. However, among the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the AMs from the fresh and reactivated groups produced a larger amount of TNF-alpha than those from the inactive group. AMs from patients showing positivity in culture produced a larger amount of TNF-alpha than those showing negativity. The average level of serum TNF-alpha in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was slightly higher than that of the healthy control group. Among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, significantly increased levels of serum TNF-alpha were noted in the reactivated group compared to those of the fresh and inactive group. Patients with moderate to far-advanced infiltration on their chest X-rays, showed a significantly higher level of serum TNF-alpha than those with minimal involvement on the chest X-ray. Smokers from the healthy control group showed a significantly higher level of serum TNF-alpha than non-smokers from the same group. These results suggest that an increase in the production of TNF-alpha may correspond with the severity of pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|Opinion {{appears to}} differ {{regarding}} the pathology of the vessels in lungs affected by <b>miliary</b> and chronic <b>tuberculosis.</b> Kaufmann (1929) emphasized obliterative {{changes in the}} pulmonary arteries. Boyd (1950) speaks of an endarteritis obliterans in vessels without specifying their origin. Cahnette (1923) mentioned the formation of small pedun-culated, pear-shaped " aneurysms of Rasmussen " in branches of the pulmonary artery which traverse the walls of tuberculous cavities. The same aneurysmal dilatations were also pointed out by Kaufmann. Pagel (Kayne, Pagel, and O'Shaugh-nessy, 1948), on the other hand, believes that younger tubercles, and even older foci, contain blood vessels. He contends that the cells par-ticipating {{in the formation of}} the tubercle are generally derived from elements of connective tissue " which have an inherent tendency to vessel for-mation. " Thus young tuberculous tissue is rich in capillaries and older foci are vascularized at the periphery. Coryllos (1933) speculated on the possible clinical significance ofendarteritis in the pulmonary arteries, and thought that this was probably beneficial in controlling the activity of tubercle bacilli. He considered that collapse therapy accomplished the same purpose by reducing the pulmonary artery bed and resting the lung. The oxygen requirements of the tubercle bacillus would thus be interfered with and its activity curtailed. Cournand and Richards (1941) also attribute the benefits ofcollapse therapy to the reduction of oxygen and blood available to the tubercle bacilli in the affected lungs. Rich (1944) thinks it reasonable to presume that the exacting oxygen requirements of the tubercle bacillus play some part in limiting its multiplication in vivo, and particularly within tuberculous lesions. Although little is known of the rate at which oxygen diffuses into areas o...|$|R
