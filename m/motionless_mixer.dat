50|$|The {{static mixer}} traces its origins to an {{invention}} for a mixing device filed on Nov. 29, 1965 by the Arthur D. Little Company. This device was the housed-elements type and was licensed to the Kenics Corporation and marketed as the Kenics <b>Motionless</b> <b>Mixer.</b> Today, the Kenics brand {{is owned by}} National Oilwell Varco. The plate type static mixer patent was issued on November 24, 1998 to Robert W. Glanville of Westfall Manufacturing; however, there are also other suppliers of static mixers, Fluitec Georg AG, including Sulzer Chemtech Ltd, Verdermix, Koflo Corporation, Statiflo, KOMAX Systems Inc., and MVV srl.|$|E
50|$|Liquids and gases are {{typically}} mixed w mass transfer to occur. For instance, {{in the case}} of air stripping, gas is used to remove volatiles from a liquid. Typically, a packed column is used for this purpose, with the packing acting as a <b>motionless</b> <b>mixer</b> and the air pump providing the driving force. When a tank and impeller are used, the objective is typically to ensure that the gas bubbles remain in contact with the liquid for as long as possible. This is especially important if the gas is expensive, such as pure oxygen, or diffuses slowly into the liquid. Mixing in a tank is also useful when a (relatively) slow chemical reaction is occurring in the liquid phase, and so the concentration difference in the thin layer near the bubble is close to that of the bulk. This reduces the driving force for mass transfer. If there is a (relatively) fast chemical reaction in the liquid phase, it is sometimes advantageous to disperse but not recirculate the gas bubbles, ensuring that they are in plug flow and can transfer mass more efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Using the Mapping Method {{different}} {{designs of}} SMX <b>motionless</b> <b>mixers</b> are analyzed and optimized. The three design parameters that constitute a specific SMX design are: The number of cross-bars over {{the width of}} channel, Nx, the number of parallel cross-bars per element, Np, and the angle between opposite cross-bars. Optimizing Nx, somewhat surprisingly reveals that in the standard design with Np = 3, Nx = 6 is the optimum using both energy efficiency as well as compactness as criteria. Increasing Nx results in under-stretching and decreasing Nx leads to over-stretching of the interface. Increasing Np makes interfacial stretching more effective by co-operating vortices. Comparing realized to optimal stretching, we find the optimum series for all possible SMX(n) designs to obey the universal design rule Np = (2 / 3) Nx- 1, for Nx = 3, 6, 9, 12,...|$|R

40|$|Static mixers, {{also known}} as {{motionless}} or in-line mixers, constitutea low-cost option for mixing in the chemical process industry. Static mixers offer attractive features such as closed-loop operation and no moving parts, in contrast to continuously-stirred tank reactors (for example, Streiff and Rogers, 1994). The static mixer {{is a collection of}} blades which fits inside a pipe carrying the fluids to be blended. The two liquids to be mixed (typically a polymer melt and an additive) are forced through the mixer under high pressure, and they are cut and folded repeatedly as they negotiate the bends and openings within the mixer. The scale of segregation between the liquids is greatly reduced by this process such that eventually diffusion can complete the mixing process. The reduction in the scale of segregation is dependent on the liquid properties and the number and type of mixing elements. Our goal at present has been to investigate the effectiveness of static mixing in an SMX mixer between two miscible liquid streams as a function of viscosity ratio (m) and Reynolds number (Re) in the laminar flow regime. The current study concerns the mixing of viscous fluids in the SMX geometry <b>motionless</b> <b>mixer</b> (Figure 1). The SMX is a common industrial mixer with many advantages. Numerical simulations for six common static mixer types indicate the superior overall performance of the SMX mixer (Rauline et al., 1998) and the greater efficiency of the SMX as compare...|$|E

A range of experimental technique ¬ _ ` _, 'id to {{study the effects of}} flow parameters and liquid viscosity on gas-liquid mixing and mass transfer within a 6 element Kenics mixer (manufactured by Chemineer) operating in a vertical downflow mode. Four major experimental techniques were developed: a bre-optic probe technique for determining flow pattern; a gamma-ray transmission and a, conductivity technique for measuring liquid residence times to obtain local and average holdup respectively; and a photographic technique for measuring bubble size. New data is presented on performance parameters such as the flow pattern, pressure drop, bubble size and gas holdup at a range of gas and liquid flow conditions up to 4 1 s' 1 each, at viscosities up to 32 mPas and their effect on the mass transfer rate within the mixer is discussed. Experimental results show that viscosity does not appear to affect holdup for liquid superficial velocities {{less than or equal to}} 1. 52 m s' 1, and flow pattern is affected only slightly. Pressure drop increases as viscosity is increased up to 12 mPas but is increased very little above 12 mPas.

40|$|Mixing {{of fluids}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} industrial operations. Static mixers, also known as <b>motionless</b> <b>mixers,</b> are very efficient devices used for mixing of both single phase and multiphase fluids. With a gradual increase in the usage of static mixers in various industrial operations, it is necessary to achieve higher mixing efficiency at the cost of minimum energy consumption. Mixing performance can be improved either by designing new internal geometry or by modifying an existing static mixer geometry. The objective of this research is to improve the mixing performance of static mixers by incorporating design modifications to the internal geometry. For that purpose, a static mixer with an open blade internal structure (such as SMX) was selected because of its complexed geometry and industrially proven mixing abilities. As a part of design modifications in the SMX mixer, perforations of varying sizes and different shapes of serrations were introduced to the static mixer blades using AutoCAD software. These modified static mixer geometries include perforated SMX with 2 holes of D/ 20 size on each blade, perforated SMX with 4 holes of D/ 20 size on each blade, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 20 holes, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 30 holes, perforated SMX with maximum number of D/ 40 holes, SMX with circular serrations, SMX with triangular serrations and lastly SMX with square shaped serrations. In order to select the best modified static mixer in terms of mixing performance, CFD simulations are performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software and the mixing performance of each modified static mixer geometry was compared with the standard SMX mixer. The mixing performance of each static mixer was compared on the basis of dispersive mixing and distributive mixing parameters. For laminar flow regime and incompressible fluid, simulation results for all the static mixers are first characterized in terms of pressure and velocity field, which showed good agreement with the literature data. For the comparison of dispersive mixing, shear rates and extensional efficiency of each static mixer is compared with that of a standard SMX mixer. Further, binary cluster particle tracer is injected in the flow domain to compute the distributive mixing capacity of static mixers. Distributive mixing of each mixer is quantified in terms of standard deviation. Based on the comparison of the simulation results for the dispersive and distributive mixing, the most efficient static mixer is targeted for its use in polymerization processes. Synthesis of polyacrylamide using a static mixer is explored in this research work. SMX mixer and the most efficient modified static mixer based on the overall mixing performance are chosen to carry out the homopolymerization of acrylamide using CFD simulations. It is observed that the modified static mixer performs better than the SMX mixer in terms of monomer conversion, reaction rate and polymer concentration...|$|R

Conversion of triglycerides to methyl esters in excess of 98 % was achieved. Larger excess amounts of alcohol favored higher conversions. The <b>motionless</b> and high-shear <b>mixers</b> each provided adequate mixing for the process.

40|$|Currently, unless {{aided by}} {{subsidies}} or {{some form of}} government directive, biodiesel cannot compete against regular petro diesel because of lower pump costs. Attempting to lower production costs of biodiesel would be helpful in narrowing the price gap between these two competing fuels. The production of biodiesel involves mixing organic oil and a short chain alcohol which are not miscible {{in the early stages}} of reaction. The interfacial area between the two phases is believed to strongly affect the reaction rate leading to the development of numerous methods for the dispersion of short chain alcohol in organic oil. One such method is through the use of a static mixer which is a <b>motionless</b> inline pipe <b>mixer</b> with specially shaped baffles used to promote mixing. This study investigated the effectiveness of a Kenics static mixer as a dispersion tool in biodiesel production with methanol as the short chain alcohol and palm oil as the organic oil. This was performed by measuring the droplet sizes of methanol dispersed in palm oil for different flow parameters, namely the mixer length and flow rate. The moderately high concentration of methanol (20 % volume fraction) presented an additional level of complexity in the experimental investigation and necessitated the development of a suitable droplet measurement technique which consisted of a modified borescope attached to a digital camera and coupled with a strobe light source. Experimental results showed that the static mixer was certainly an effective mixer, outperforming the conventional agitated vessel design seen in most biodiesel production plants but was not as effective as ultrasonic emulsifiers although this method requires the highest energy input. The experimental study was complemented by a parallel numerical investigation which was performed using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-FLUENT. To account for the droplet size evolution, the CFD simulations were coupled to a population balance model with the appropriate droplet breakage and coalescence models. There was reasonable agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations. In addition, numerical simulations predicted that the static mixer was the most efficient mixer when accounting both droplet size reduction and energy requirements. The findings of this study suggest that the Kenics static mixer is an efficient mixer. It is, therefore, worth investigating the use of the Kenics static mixer as a continuous reactor for the production of biodiesel without any rotating parts and possibly at room temperature. This would present a novel design which could be attractive in achieving quality product at low operating cost...|$|R
