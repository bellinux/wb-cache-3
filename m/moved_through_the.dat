5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on July 19, 1970. As the depression <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Yucatán Channel, the convective cloud system became better organized. On July 20, {{in light of}} data from a Reconnaissance Aircraft flight, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Becky.|$|E

The higher the column temperature, the faster <b>the</b> sample <b>moves</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> column. However, the faster a sample <b>moves</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Flora passed Barbados a {{few days}} after Hurricane Edith <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area. The two hurricanes {{resulted}} in about $65,000 in damage (1963USD), primarily to fishing interests.|$|E

5|$|Later, the {{remnants}} of Mireille <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Aleutian Islands {{toward the end of}} September, bringing strong winds to the islands, including gusts over 112km/h (70mph) at Amchitka.|$|E
5|$|The {{most active}} Western Pacific typhoon season was in 1964, when 39storms of {{tropical}} storm strength formed. Only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began. The least activity {{seen in the}} northwest Pacific Ocean was during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season, when only 14tropical storms and seven typhoons formed. In the Philippines, the most active season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> country. There was only one tropical cyclone that <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Philippines in 1958. The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957. Within Guangdong in southern China, during the past thousand years, the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670s.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Roy, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Asiang, was the second-most intense January {{tropical}} cyclone on record in the Western Pacific basin. Forming out of an area of disturbed weather on January 7, 1988, Roy quickly intensified as it <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Marshall Islands. By January 9, the storm intensified into a typhoon and attained its peak intensity the following day. At its peak, sustained winds reached 215km/h (135mph). Slight weakening took place before the storm <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Mariana Islands. Continuing westward, the system eventually struck the Philippines as a minimal typhoon before dissipating over the South China Sea on January 19.|$|E
5|$|As Bonnie <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas, {{residents}} stocked up on {{food and}} water as a precautionary measure; however, no major preparations took place. Most businesses remained open during the system's passage and schools were already closed for the summer. Throughout the islands, the effects from Bonnie were relatively minimal. Heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported. No known damage or loss of life took place.|$|E

5|$|Before Iris <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Lesser Antilles, {{tropical}} storm watches, and later warnings, were issued from Barbados through the British Virgin Islands. The storm produced {{tropical storm}} force winds across the eastern Caribbean, although the primary meteorological event occurred from heavy rainfall. Flooding prompted evacuations in communities in Saint Lucia, Dominica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Iris {{was the first}} of three storms in a three-week period to affect the region, preceding the more destructive hurricanes Luis and Marilyn.|$|E
5|$|In November 1866, Levski visited Rakovski in Iaşi. Two revolutionary bands led by Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu {{had been}} inciting the Bulgarian {{diaspora}} community in Romania to invade Bulgaria and organise anti-Ottoman resistance. On {{the recommendation of}} Rakovski, Vasil Levski {{was selected as the}} standard-bearer of Hitov's detachment. In April 1867, the band crossed the Danube at Tutrakan, <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Ludogorie region and reached the Balkan Mountains. After skirmishing, the band fled to Serbia through Pirot in August.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas, {{officials}} closed schools, {{and many}} businesses closed {{early on the}} day the storm <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> country. The storm's stationary motion caused several days of high tides and heavy rains. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported on Andros Island, and gusts peaked at 75mph (120km/h) on Golden Cay. Gilda's passage left crop damage on several islands, although monetary losses in the country were minor.|$|E

5|$|Jerry caused minimal damage as it <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Windward Islands and Lesser Antilles. A {{station at}} Martinique {{reported}} sustained one-minute winds of 44mph (72km/h) on October 8. The outer bands of Jerry delivered light rainfall to Grenada on October 8, but no damage was reported. Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.|$|E
5|$|Later as the {{hurricane}} <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas, it produced winds of 100mph (161km/h) at Hope Town and 91mph (146km/h) at Millville, both on Abaco. The outer {{periphery of the}} storm brushed Nantucket to the west with winds of 39mph (63km/h) and Bermuda to the east with 46mph (75km/h).|$|E
5|$|The British advance resumed at 05:30, and {{at about}} 08:30 {{the vanguard of}} the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered the west end of Villers-Bocage. A {{squadron}} of the 4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), <b>moved</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town and occupied Point 213, an area of high ground to the east on the Caen road. The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry occupied the eastern end of the town along the main road.|$|E
