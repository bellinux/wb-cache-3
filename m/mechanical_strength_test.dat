One of the promising methods used for bioethanol purification is pervaporation membrane. This research is aimed to prepare and characterize zeolite membranes for pervaporation membrane. The membrane preparation consisted of two stages, namely support preparation and zeolite deposition on the support. In support preparation, α- alumina and kaolin with specific composition (50 : 30; 40 : 40; 50 : 30) was mixed with additives and water. After pugging and aging process, the mixture became paste and extruded into tubular shape. The tube was then calcined at temperature of 1250 °C for 3 hours. After that, zeolite 4 A was deposited on the tubes using clear solution made of 10 %wt zeolite and 90 %wt water and heated at temperature of 80 °C for 3 hours. Furthermore, the resulting zeolite membranes was washed with deionized water for 5 minutes and dried in oven at temperature of 100 °C for 24 hours. Characterization of zeolite membranes included <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> XRD, and SEM. In the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> the membrane sample with α- alumina:kaolin = 50 : 30 (membrane A) has the highest mechanical strength of 46. 65 N/mm 2. Result of XRD analysis for the membrane A indicated that mullite and corundum phases were formed, which mullite phase was more dominant. Meanwhile the result of SEM analysis shows that zeolite crystals have been formed and covered the pores support, but the deposition of zeolite has not been optimal yet.

30|$|On this point, it is {{important}} to understand the purpose for immobilizing the catalyst to floating support, such as pumice, was not to increase the photocatalytic activity of catalyst, but to overcome the regeneration problem of nanosized catalyst. Therefore, especially for field application, the value of photocatalyst is not only determined by its performance to eliminate pollutant but also its ability to be regenerated and used for repeated time. As explained before on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> section, immobilized TiNT had been proven to have good mechanical quality. Hence, it has rather great potential for the field application. Another point to be noted is that the photodegradation performance of immobilized titania might be enhanced by giving certain treatments, like aeration, pH adjustment, and controlling catalyst loading [1, 43]. For example, an aeration treatment will provide a better mixing condition for the photocatalytic system, hence more contact between immobilized catalyst and the pollutants will likely occur [43]. In addition, it might supply sufficient amount of dissolved oxygen needed for the photodegradation reaction, thus increasing the photocatalytic activity of immobilized titania [43].|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the effect of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) on mandibular distraction at routine and rapid distraction rates. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were assigned to 2 groups, 1 treated at a routine distraction rate (0. 9 mm/d) and the other at a rapid distraction rate (2. 7 mm/d). rhBMP- 2 was injected into 1 side of the distraction regenerate {{at the end of}} the active distraction period; the contralateral side was used as a control. The distraction regenerates were analyzed by plain radiography, microcomputed tomography, and histologic examination. The results showed that rhBMP- 2 can promote bone formation at both rapid and routine distraction rates, but no statistically significant difference was observed between the bone morphogenetic protein injection sides of the rapid and routine distraction groups. In conclusion, the study indicates that rhBMP- 2 can enhance bone ossification at both routine and rapid distraction rates. The addition of rhBMP- 2 seems to be able to compensate for the rapid distraction rate in mandibular distraction osteogenesis.

40|$|Few {{scientific}} works {{deal with}} size effect on mechanical {{resistance in the}} case of stone, meanwhile for the concrete, Weibull law has been widely verified. In fact, the stone size effect is not always ruled by well known laws as Weibull because of the intrinsic complex structure and features of the materials analysed. Concerning the mechanical behaviour, flexural strength is used to assess the mechanical resistance of stone and, if performed after accelerating tests, its durability. Besides, the results of flexural strength are well correlated with petrographic properties of stone. For this reason, to further investigate the size effect, this research analyses the variation of mechanical resistance with the shape and/or dimensions of the specimens taking into account the petrographic characteristics of different kinds of rock (voids, porosity, cracks, crystal contacts).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify possible test procedures for the evaluation of the strength of chewable tablets with respect to prevention of damage to teeth or mandibular joints when tablets are consumed. Diametral compression and flexure tests were employed to evaluate the strength of commercial samples from five manufacturers of chewable vitamin C tablets. Weibull analysis was used to assess the brittleness of these tablets. The tablets had a lower tensile strength value when determined by the diametral compression test compared to the flexure test ratio which ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 4. The value for the Weibull modulus ranged from 5 to 16, indicating an appreciable degree of brittleness of the samples. Relating the values for the mechanical strength to suggested practical values for the prevention of damage to the teeth or the mandibular joints indicated that most tablets exceeded these values. The flexure test reflects the practical situation closest, and a limiting tensile strength value of 2 MPa should not be exceeded for chewable tablets. The tablet batches tested were also characterized by a large batch-to-batch variability, suggesting uncontrolled manufacturing procedures. Commercially distributed chewable vitamin C tablets could provide a possible health hazard to teeth and mandibular joints.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to clarify the effects of the shape of the {{zirconium}} framework of implant-supported, all-ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs) on the fracture strength and fracture mode. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study consisted of mechanical strength testing and 3 D finite element analysis (FEA). The three framework shapes used in this study were: (1) conventional shape (control); (2) convex shape: 1. 0 -mm curve in the direction of the occlusal surface; and (3) concave shape: 1. 0 -mm curve in the direction of the gingival surface. Five frameworks were made for each condition (total: 15). A load (N) was applied until the FPD fractured. For FEA, a 3 D model consisting of cortical bone, cancellous bone, implant bodies, and superstructure was constructed. RESULTS: The results of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> showed that fracture load was 916. 0 +/- 150. 1 N for the conventional shape, 1690. 5 +/- 205. 3 N for the convex shape, and 1515. 5 +/- 137. 0 N for the concave shape. The mean final fracture load for the FPDs with frameworks was the highest for the convex shape; however, a critical crack in the veneer porcelain (736. 5 +/- 145. 2 N) was confirmed during loading for the convex shape. Stress distribution maps for all conditions showed that tensile stress was generated at the veneer porcelain on the gingival side of the mesial and distal connectors of the pontic; however, there were differences in the maximum value and stress distribution within the framework. CONCLUSION: The shape of the framework, particularly the shape of the pontic-connector interface, affects the stress distribution, fracture strength, and fracture mode of all-ceramic FPDs, and stress concentration inside a framework may induce cracking of layering porcelain...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} numerical modeling of formability and instabilities in aluminum {{with a focus on}} the bending loading condition. A three-dimensional (3 D) finite element analysis based on rate-dependent crystal plasticity theory has been employed to investigate non-uniform deformation in aluminum alloys during bending. The model can incorporate electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps into finite element analyses. The numerical analysis not only accounts for crystallographic texture (and its evolution) but also accounts for 3 D grain morphologies, because a 3 D microstructure (constructed from two-dimensional EBSD data) can be employed in the simulations. The first part of the research concentrates on the effect of individual aluminum grain orientations on the developed surface roughness during bending. The standard orientations found within aluminum are combined in a systematic way to investigate their interactions and sensitivity to loading direction. The end objective of the study is to identify orientations that promote more pronounced surface roughness so that future material processes can be developed to reduce the occurrence of these orientations and improve the bending response of the material. It was identified that Goss and Brass textures have the largest negative impact on bendability of the aluminum, with Goss being the most dependent on loading direction and Brass being detrimental in all loading directions. The second part of the {{research focuses on}} the representation of grain boundaries within the models. A new modeling approach of adding 20 μm wide grain boundary zones in conjunction with using single crystal material properties was developed and validated. Large columnar grain samples of aluminum were produced at McMaster University and analysed with Electron Back Scatter Diffraction to identify the grain structure prior to destructive testing. In-situ Digital Image Correlation strain measurements were taken during a <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> The combination of initial microstructure information as well as in-situ strain distributions allowed for a study analysing the effect of adding grain boundary zones into the models. The results showed that the error in predicted strain distribution could be reduced by 60 % by the addition of hard grain boundary zones. During bending simulations using the grain boundary zone modelling approach, {{it was found that the}} network of hard grain boundary zones worked to distribute the applied bending load over more of the sample as opposed to the historic approach of representing grain boundaries as neighbouring regions with different orientations. The addition of grain boundary zones into the models can improve the accuracy of future studies...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Substrateless Packaging process was developed at Loughborough University as an alternative method of manufacturing electronics with an improved end-of-life materials recovery profile. The process involves injection moulding to overmould electronic components in thermoplastic polymers. Initial prototype samples manufactured in previous work exhibited undesirable small gaps around the embedded components after solidification and which {{were thought to be}} the result of adhesion problems between the thermoplastic overmould and components. The study reported here had the aims of determining quantitatively what factors affect adhesion, and to identify which thermoplastic polymers are most suitable for the process. Following a literature survey, six engineering thermoplastics, PC, PBT, PS, ABS, PA 6 and PMMA were chosen for study as overmoulding materials, and tin as the solid adherend. The literature survey also identified the mechanisms contributing to adhesion at the metal-thermoplastic interface in insert moulding as material properties, interfacial forces between the materials, wetting at the interface, temperature of the insert (consequently temperature at the interface) and insert moulding parameters. A methodology was designed to allow investigation of all these factors, with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) force-distance measurements being used to measure room temperature interfacial forces, high temperature contact angle for wetting, and pull-out strength tests on overmoulded tin-coated wire for overall system adhesion. Excellent repeatability was seen in the measurements obtained with all three experimental methods. Moldflow finite element simulations of the insert moulding process were also undertaken. For the AFM measurements tin particles were adhered to the probe with the aid of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) apparatus. PA and PMMA interatomic interactions with tin were found to be noticeably stronger than the other polymers. From consideration of the different possible contributions to the measured forces, it was concluded that the trend of interatomic interactions obtained is due to a combination of electrostatic forces, capillary forces and dispersion forces acting between the materials tested. In the high temperature contact angle measurements it was observed that the contact angles for all the materials producing drops in equilibrium reduce monotonically with rise in temperature at the interface. The work of adhesion was calculated from the contact angles for PMMA using the Young-Dupre equation and values of surface tension from the literature. It was found that it does not increase monotonically with temperature as might be expected from the contact angles. The works of adhesion at 240 °C for all the materials were also calculated and it was found that the materials ranking for expected adhesive strength changed significantly from that expected from consideration of contact angle alone. In the pull out tests, except for PC, the breaking loads for the materials tested rise then fall with rise in temperature of the insert. It was observed that peak breaking load for the amorphous polymers ABS, PS and PMMA occurred for insert temperature just below Tg of the polymer, and for semi-crystalline polymers PA 6 and PBT it was just above Tg. The ranking of materials by maximum pull out strength was found to be consistent with the ranking by mechanical strength (tensile strength at yield) of the thermoplastics. The Moldflow simulations yielded the significant results that the thermoplastic melt comes in contact with the insert at relatively low pressure (less than 0. 6 MPa), and that the temperature of the melt near the insert drops to the temperature of the insert almost instantaneously on contact. Therefore it was concluded that the efficacy of holding pressure on assisting wetting of the insert by the thermoplastic melt may depend on the temperature of the insert interface. The results in terms of material rankings from both the material level tests (AFM force distance experiment and wetting at high temperature) did not correspond to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> results. It was therefore concluded that the choice of material for thermoplastic overmould cannot be made purely based on the material interactions at interface between tin and thermoplastics in solid or melt phase. It was also concluded that the observed variation in the pull-out strengths with temperature of the insert maintained during overmoulding, must be largely due to the thermo-mechanical properties of the material at the interface. Based on the results of the study, PC, PBT and PMMA were recommended as being likely to give superior performance to the ABS which was used in early trials of the substrateless packaging process. Of these, from a process economics point of view, PBT would be the most suitable...|$|E

Therefore it was concluded that the efficacy of holding pressure on assisting wetting of the insert by the thermoplastic melt may depend on the temperature of the insert interface. The results in terms of material rankings from both the material level tests (AFM force distance experiment and wetting at high temperature) did not correspond to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> results. It was therefore concluded that the choice of material for thermoplastic overmould cannot be made purely based on the material interactions at interface between tin and thermoplastics in solid or melt phase. It was also concluded that the observed variation in the pull-out strengths with temperature of the insert maintained during overmoulding, must be largely due to the thermo-mechanical properties of the material at the interface. Based on the results of the study, PC, PBT and PMMA were recommended as being likely to give superior performance to the ABS which was used in early trials of the substrateless packaging process. Of these, from a process economics point of view, PBT would be the most suitable. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Porous Ni-Al alloys with {{different}} nominal compositions ranging from Ni- 10 wt. % Al to Ni- 40 wt. % Al were fabricated through reactive synthesis of Ni and Al elemental powders. It {{had been found}} that the volume expansion, maximum pore size and permeability of porous Ni-Al alloys increased with increasing the Al content, indicating {{that the nature of}} the pores can be manipulated through changing the Al content. In addition, detailed structural characterizations showed that the fabricated porous Ni-Al alloys can have three crystalline phases (i. e., Ni 3 Al, NiAl, and Ni 2 Al 3) when using different compositions, in good agreement with the Ni-Al phase diagram. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> of the fabricated porous Ni-Al alloys were also performed. Both of the bending strength and tensile strength of porous Ni-Al alloys were in the range of 5 - 80 MPa, and decreased with increasing the Al content. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract. Conventionally, {{the bonding}} {{strength}} of bone-cement interface is obtained by <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> {{which tends to}} produce large variability between specimens and test methods. In this work, interfacial fracture toughness of synthetic bone-cement interface has been determined using sandwiched Brazilian disk specimens. Experiments were carried out under selected loading angles from 0 to 25 degrees to achieve full loading conditions from mode I to mode II. Solutions for complex stress intensity factors as well as strain energy release rates were obtained for a sandwich disk with a finite interlayer using the finite element method. Phase angles were obtained at a fixed distance to the crack tip. The fracture loads {{were obtained from the}} load displacement curves and the values of interfacial fracture toughness were calculated from the fracture loads and the finite element J-integral solutions. The implication of this information on the assessment of fixation in acetabular replacements was discussed in the light of in-vitro fatigue testing of implanted acetabula...|$|R

40|$|This work uses multivariate {{statistics}} {{in an attempt}} to classify historical mortars in more or less distinct groups, depending on their physicochemical characteristics. Four types of mortars are studied: ""typical lime,"" ""cementitious,"" ""crushed brick"" and Portland cement. Fifty samples in total were analysed by thermal analyses (differential thermal analysis [DTA] and thermogravimetric analysis [TGA]), mercury intrusion porosimetry and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> The results give us useful information on the understanding of the technology of historical mortars and planning syntheses for restoration ones. The inverse hydraulicity ratio (CO 2 /structurally bound water, SBW) is correlated to CO 2 content (%) as measured by thermal analysis. The tensile strength increases with the amount of hydrated phases and the mechanical properties of the aggregate and the binder. Medians, ranges and extremely rare values were determined for each property showing compact groups. These groups were discriminated by principal component analysis (PCA) giving a tool for characterisation of historical mortars. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Three novel {{polymers}} were synthesized {{by introducing}} hexyl, dodecyl, and octadecyl groups {{to the side}} chains of poly (2, 5 -benzimidazole) (ABPBI). Fourier transform infrared, thermal stability, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> were applied to characterize the three polymers. Elemental analysis was also carried out to determine the degree of substitution. Gas permeation behavior of the three derivative membranes was investigated with pure gas, including hydrogen (H- 2), nitrogen (N- 2), oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The results show that except the hexyl-substituted ABPBI the other two polymers are reverse selective because in both polymers CO 2 has a higher permeability than H- 2. Among the three derivatives, octadecyl-modified ABPBI shows the best permselectivity of gas pairs, such as CO 2 /N- 2 (approximately 13) and CO 2 /H- 2 (approximately 2. 8), with a quite high CO 2 permeability (approximately 100 barrer) at 35 degrees C and 3. 0 atm...|$|R
