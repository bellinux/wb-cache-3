40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} properties, {{wear and}} corrosion behavior of copper matrix composites reinforced with steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> {{was investigated in}} this research. Steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> with chip size range of 105 μm and below were utilized to develop stir cast copper matrix composites having 5, 7. 5 and 10 wt% of the chips as reinforcement. Unreinforced copper and 10 wt% alumina reinforced copper matrix composites were also prepared for control experimentation. Hardness and tensile properties evaluation, wear test, potentiodynamic polarization corrosion tests, and optical microscopy; were used as basis to characterize the composites produced. The {{results show that the}} addition of steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> in copper resulted in significantly low porosity levels in the copper matrix composites compared with the use of alumina as reinforcement. The mechanical properties (hardness and tensile properties) and wear resistance were also observed to improve {{with the use of the}} steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> as reinforcement. The corrosion susceptibility in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution were observed to be more intense for the unreinforced copper and the alumina reinforced composite grade compared with the steel chips reinforced copper matrix composites. But in 0. 3 M H 2 SO 4 solution, no consistent corrosion trend was observed although the corrosion resistances of all the composite grades produced were superior to the unreinforced copper. The results demonstrate the capacity of steel <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> to serve as a reliable cost effective and technically efficient reinforcement material for the development of copper matrix composites...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was {{recycled}} from <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> by using equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). Samples were pressed through a die up to 8 passes at moderate {{temperatures in the}} range of 400 - 500 °C. The ECAP process was accomplished with back-pressures ranging from 50 to 250. MPa. The results demonstrate that ECAP with back-pressures allows the consolidation of <b>machining</b> <b>chips</b> to near fully dense (~ 99. 9 %) recycled products. The relative density of the as-recycled samples increased with the applied back-pressure and number of passes. The average hardness and homogeneity were improved as the number of passes increased. The transmission electron microscopy reveals a combination of equiaxed and elongated α grains after the first pass. With subsequent pressing, the samples were dominated by nano-equiaxed α grains with diameters of ~ 70 nm.

40|$|A direct {{consolidation}} of brass <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> wastes has been attempted from a viewpoint of energy-saving and recyclability. A direct consolidation process from <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> wastes has successfully {{been developed in}} our laboratory. So a free-cutting brass without Pb has been developed using this consolidation process in our laboratory by adding graphite powder and Cu 2 S powder as a substitution for Pb. However, ZnS formed during the extrusion processing disturbs the improvement of machinability of the extruded rod to which Cu 2 S is added. In this study, therefore, a surface of 6 - 4 brass <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> was oxidized and dezincificated by heating in air in order to suppress the formation of ZnS. After extruding, the density and mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile strength and elongation of extruded rods decreased with an increment of Cu 2 S addition while an application of heat-treatment to <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> suppressed a degree of drop in density and mechanical properties of extruded rods. Moreover, a machinability of extruded rods improved with increasing Cu 2 S addition and more obviously by heat-treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{most popular}} recycle process of brass <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> wastes is {{remelting}} process. However, {{this process is}} much energy consumption. On the other hand, lead has been added conventionally {{in order to improve}} the machinability of metallic materials.

In this study, MnS was applied to a substitutional material of lead to improve machinability and a direct consolidation process from <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> of 60 / 40 brass has been developed.

And tensile strength of the extruded specimen with MnS particles of 106 µm in diameter was slightly higher than that of 45 µm in diameter.

40|$|Abstract. The {{rotary swaging}} process for {{producing}} solid bars, tubes or wires {{is often used}} to obtain the chipless forming process compared with the conventional process such as the machining and welding operation. Furthermore, <b>machined</b> <b>chip,</b> dust particles, harmful gas, and surface contamination to be commonly generated at hot working during the conventional process could be eliminated as the swaging process is applied and conducted at room temperature. Experiments for swaged product were performed to analyze the influence of the swaging process on the mechanical properties and dimensional precision in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness, and deviation of formed dimension. The changes of dimensional precision in swaged product are also checked out and considered for various process parameters such as the forming speed and the reduction in the outer diameter. Based on the experimental results, the surface roughness is improved under the swaging process. The weight of rod shift is reduced by about 15 % from 223. 5 g to 190. 2 g. Thus the number of operations to produce the final product under the conventional process is larger than that under the swaging process to be able to omit the machining and welding operation, etc. This paper demonstrates that a rotary swaging process turns out to be an environment-friendly forming process or chipless forming process without the <b>machined</b> <b>chip...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) in grinding {{has emerged as}} an alternative for reducing the abundant flow of cutting fluids, thus achieving cleaner production. Although considered an innovative technique in grinding operations, its widespread application is hindered due primarily to the high heat generation and wheel pore clogging caused by <b>machined</b> <b>chips,</b> harming the final product quality and increasing tool wear on the machine. This study sought to improve MQL use in grinding. In addition to the conventional MQL injected at the wheel/workpiece interface, a compressed air jet was used to clean the mixture of MQL oil and <b>machined</b> <b>chips</b> from clogged wheel pores. Experiments were conducted using external cylindrical plunge grinding on AISI 4340 quenched and tempered steel, and a vitrified cubic boron nitrite (CBN) wheel. The cooling-lubrication methods employed were the conventional flood coolant application, MQL (without cleaning), and MQL with a cleaning jet directed at the wheel surface at different angles of incidence. The main goal of these experiments was to verify the viability of replacing the traditional abundant flow of cutting fluid with MQL and wheel cleaning. The analyses were conducted by measuring the following output variables of the process: workpiece surface roughness and roundness errors, diametrical wheel wear, acoustic emission generated by the process, and metallographic images of the ground surface and subsurface.
