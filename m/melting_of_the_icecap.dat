The only thing that makes life possible over much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet is the enormous canal system. Built long ago before Martians became decadent and weak, the canal system is an amazing feat <b>of</b> engineering. Criss-crossing <b>the</b> globe, the canals bring water from <b>the</b> annual <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polar <b>icecaps.</b> Powerful pumps lift water over mountains, huge bridges span valleys, and other devices link the canals to make them avenues of commerce, all powered by mysterious sources of energy beyond current human understanding.|$|R
40|$|This book {{argues that}} climate change has a devastating effect on how {{we think about the}} future. Once several {{positive}} feedback loops in Earth’s dynamic systems, such as <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>icecap</b> or <b>the</b> drying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amazon, cross <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> no return, <b>the</b> biosphere is likely to undergo severe and irreversible warming. Nearly everything we do is premised {{on the assumption that the}} world we know will endure into the future and provide a sustaining context for our activities. But today <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> a viable biosphere, and thus <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> our present activities, is put into question. A disappearing future leads to a broken present, a strange incoherence in <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> everyday life. We thus face <b>the</b> unprecedented challenge <b>of</b> salvaging a basis for our lives today. That basis, this book argues, may be found in our capacity to assume an infinite responsibility for ecological disaster and, like the biblical Job, to respond with awe to the alien voice that speaks from the whirlwind. By owning disaster and accepting our small place within <b>the</b> inhuman forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biosphere, we may discover how to live with responsibility and serenity whatever may come...|$|R
50|$|Periglacial (glacial) loess {{is derived}} from <b>the</b> {{floodplains}} <b>of</b> glacial braided rivers that carried large volumes of glacial meltwater and sediments from <b>the</b> annual <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> continental icesheets and mountain <b>icecaps</b> during <b>the</b> spring and summer. During the autumn and winter, when <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> icesheets and <b>icecaps</b> ceased, <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and {{were exposed to the}} wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like silt and clay, they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and clays by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind. The loess deposits found along both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River Alluvial Valley are a classic example of periglacial loess.|$|R
40|$|While many {{geological}} and geophysical {{processes such as}} <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>icecaps,</b> <b>the</b> magnetic expression <b>of</b> bodies emplaced in the Earth's crust, or {{the surface}} displacement remaining after large earthquakes are spatially localized, many of these naturally admit spectral representations, or they {{may need to be}} extracted from data collected globally, e. g. by satellites that circumnavigate the Earth. Wavelets are often used to study such nonstationary processes. On the sphere, however, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known constructions are somewhat limited. And in particular, <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> `dilation' is hard to reconcile with <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a geological region with fixed boundaries being responsible for generating the signals to be analyzed. Here, we build on our previous work on localized spherical analysis using an approach that is firmly rooted in spherical harmonics. We construct, by quadratic optimization, a set of bandlimited functions that have <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> their energy concentrated in an arbitrary subdomain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit sphere. The `spherical Slepian basis' that results provides a convenient way for the analysis and representation of geophysical signals, as we show by example. We highlight the connections to sparsity by showing that many geophysical processes are sparse in the Slepian basis.

40|$|The {{capability}} {{approach is}} a broad, normative framework for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> well-being’(p. 94) [1], which has attracted growing interest in health and health economics research. A broader measure of well-being may more accurately capture <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> some interventions, than traditional health-related quality <b>of</b> life measures. <b>The</b> ICECAP-A and ICECAP-O are two measures of a person’s well-being, with a theoretical grounding in the capability approach, designed for use in health and social care research. This thesis reports qualitative and quantitative investigations into the validity and responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICECAP</b> measures. A methodological review of existing validation studies was completed. Seventeen semi-structured interviews with health research professionals were carried out and an iterative, constant comparative, thematic analysis was completed to assess <b>the</b> content validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICECAP-A. The construct validity and responsiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measures were assessed using two randomised controlled trials: the BEEP trial (ISRCTN 93634563) and the Past BP trial (ISRCTN 29062286). Qualitative and quantitative results provide positive indications <b>of</b> validity. <b>The</b> qualitative work showed that research professionals viewed the ICECAP-A as a relevant and feasible measure for use in health research. The quantitative results confirmed <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> a priori hypotheses in the validity analyses, while longitudinal data provided evidence that the measures are responsive to self-reported changes in health status. In conclusion, this thesis reports <b>the</b> first assessment <b>of</b> validity in a randomised controlled trial setting and <b>the</b> first analysis <b>of</b> responsiveness. While further testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ICECAP</b> measures is required, {{results indicate that the}} measures are appropriate for use in health research. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>The</b> <b>melting</b> {{behavior}} <b>of</b> syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) after isothermal crystallization {{from the}} melt state was studied using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) techniques. Three melting endotherms were observed for isothermal crystallization at high degrees <b>of</b> undercooling. <b>The</b> minor endotherm, located closed to the corresponding crystallization temperature, was pos-tulated to be <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary crystallites formed at the crystallization temperature. The low-temperature melting peak {{was found to be}} <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary crystallites formed, and the high-temperature melting peak was a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crystallites recrystallized during a heating scan. The triple-melting behavior observed in subsequent <b>melting</b> endotherms <b>of</b> s-PP was therefore described as contributions from <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secondary crystallites and their recrystallization, partial <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less stable fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary crystallites and their recrys-tallization, <b>melting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary crystallites, and remelting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recrystallized crystallites formed during the heating scan.
