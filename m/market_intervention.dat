5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative <b>market</b> <b>intervention</b> marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

Schiller called for legislation that would provide both his ministry and the federal government with greater authority to guide economic policy. In 1967, Schiller introduced the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth, which was subsequently passed by the Bundestag. Regarded as the Magna Carta of medium-term economic management, the legislation provided for coordination of federal, Lander, and local budget plans in order to give fiscal policy a stronger impact. It also set a number of optimistic targets for four basic standards by which West German economic success would henceforth be measured, which included trade balance, employment levels, economic growth, and currency stability.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{effectiveness}} of social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions</b> designed to improve diet, increase physical activity, and tackle substance misuse. Study design and methods: This article describes three reviews of systematic reviews and primary studies that evaluate social marketing effectiveness. All three reviews used pre-defined search and inclusion criteria and defined social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions</b> as those which adopted six key social marketing principles. Results: The reviews provide evidence that social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions</b> can be effective in improving diet, increasing exercise, and tackling the misuse of substances like alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. There is evidence that social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions</b> can work {{with a range of}} target groups, in different settings, and can work upstream as well as with individuals. Conclusions: Social marketing provides a very promising framework for improving health both at the individual level and at wider environmental and policy-levels. Problems with research design, lack of conceptual understanding or implementation are valid research concerns. 7 page(s...|$|R

Thus, the study was conducted to clarify the relationship between theory and practice in the field. Furthermore, the need for the marketing mix, the so-called 4 Ps, as one of the benchmarks for social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions</b> was to be analyzed. Summary The interviewees were familiar with frameworks similar to the one by Andreasen and reported that academic knowledge about the ideal social marketing process helped them to achieve the goals of their interventions. The ambiguous nature of the field highlighted the need for academic models which were considered as efficient tools for organizations to further develop their social marketing activities. According to the interviewees, many benchmarks of the Andreasen model were relevant to social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions.</b> Conclusions In general there was widespread consensus among the interviewees on the usefulness of theoretical frameworks to structure the planning and implementation of social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions.</b> Regardless {{of the quality of the}} benchmarks by Andreasen (2002), the social marketers interviewed for the research were not using this particular framework in the interventions they conducted in Finland.

40|$|In Ghana, data on HIV {{prevalence}} {{in the ten}} regions indicates that, {{the country}} has failed to realise a consistent decline of HIV new infections. This has resulted in Government spending huge sums of money on HIV/AIDS-related activities instead of the other productive sectors of the economy. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research sought to understand how theories of behaviour change could be employed to design effective social <b>marketing</b> <b>intervention</b> programmes for HIV/AIDS preventions in Ghana. The study employs both qualitative and quantitative research approaches and a stratified sampling method to achieve the aims and objectives of the study. A total of 487 respondents provided information for both qualitative and quantitative studies. The results reveal among others that implementers of social <b>marketing</b> <b>intervention</b> programmes on HIV/AIDS in Ghana do not utilise behavioural change theories/models in planning their interventions and the main challenges facing implementers include inadequate financing, health system barriers, procurement delays and lack of human resources. The research further found that majority of Ghanaians have seen or heard social <b>marketing</b> <b>interventions</b> on HIV/AIDS, know what they can do to prevent HIV/AIDS new infection, and have seen or heard interventions on HIV/AIDS {{for a long period of}} time. However, social <b>marketing</b> <b>intervention</b> programmes designed to change HIV/AIDS related behaviours of Ghanaians have, generally, been ineffective. Therefore, the study recommends that, implementers of social <b>marketing</b> <b>intervention</b> programmes on HIV/AIDS in Ghana should ascertain why most Ghanaians have not adopted HIV/AIDS protective behaviours. This can be done by utilising research findings and application of an integrative behaviour model to design intervention programmes on HIV/AIDS to convert increased awareness and attitude change into behaviour change.
