500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E

"After the war I {{always knew}} that nothing, nothing, could ever be as bad ..... but nothing could frighten <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more,</b> I mean, no man could frighten <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more,</b> no Director ..... nothing could {{be as bad as}} the war, or the things I saw in the war." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, Jon Bon Jovi told a {{reporter}} that Richie Sambora had officially left the band, saying [...] "He's quit. He's gone. No hard feelings." [...] That November, he also revealed that he was finishing writing songs for the band's next studio album, their first without Sambora, who was unofficially replaced by touring guitarist Phil X. Sambora has since stated that [...] "There's no bad blood with <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> I love Jon, and I still see {{the possibility of a}} return." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alan Border {{praised the}} {{contribution}} to the side made by the return of veterans Bright and David Hookes. [...] "Now there's a lot more experience in the side with Hookes and Bright," [...] he said. [...] "It's a lot easier on me. With the side in England {{and even in the}} first Test against New Zealand there was basically only me that would say anything of a stern nature or a congratulatory nature. But we've got Hookesy now walk ing around and really giving Craig McDcrmott a big rocket or a positive word. The way Ray and David keep an eye on things, it's not just <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> The feeling {{over the past few weeks}} has been great but now there's a greater commitment." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler {{filed a lawsuit against}} his former Guns N' Roses band mates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox {{interfered}} with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, [...] "I was told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> and just wanted me gone." [...] The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a back-payment check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure.|$|E
60|$|No. You've told me {{you don't}} want <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> I shall go my own way.|$|E
6000|$|He {{poured out}} a dram into the metal cup. [...] "Try that," [...] he said, [...] "and don't let <b>me</b> hear <b>any</b> <b>more</b> about the housekeeper's physic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to badger <b>me</b> with <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of your infernal scruples," [...] he said, [...] "I for one won't hear them. I want my lunch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Voluntary {{disappearance}} be damned!" [...] Dredlinton interrupted. [...] "Don't let <b>me</b> hear <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of such rubbish! I {{can assure}} you that such a supposition is absolutely out of the question." ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. No, dear; {{never speak}} {{of that to}} <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> (In woe.) I let him kiss me.|$|E
60|$|BARBARA. Yes: I did {{not want}} you to sell your soul for <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> than for this inheritance.|$|E
60|$|There's a saucy {{speech for}} Susie's friend. You won't like <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> if I begin {{to talk like}} that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Philip. If 'it' {{heard you}} talk like that, you would join Grumps. Don't let <b>me</b> hear <b>any</b> <b>more</b> such stuff," [...] but, though she spoke sharply, somehow {{she did not}} look displeased.|$|R
6000|$|... "You fence skilfully," [...] said he, sneering, [...] "too skilfully for {{an honest}} man. Will you now tell <b>me</b> without <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of this, {{precisely}} what the Princess Sophia was doing here with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let <b>me</b> hear <b>any</b> <b>more</b> impudence, prisoners!" [...] {{called the}} Boolooroo sternly. [...] "You are already {{condemned}} to severe punishment, and if I have any further trouble with you, you {{are liable to}} be patched." ...|$|R
60|$|It's no good; I can't help myself. I've {{gone back}} to him. Don't trouble about <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> It's quite hopeless and useless.|$|E

60|$|You will excuse <b>me</b> {{from taking}} <b>any</b> <b>more</b> chances on those beds. The railroads are {{good enough for}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear girl, I {{will hear}} you no more. You are doing him no service," [...] said Lady Belamour kindly. [...] "You {{had better be}} {{convinced}} {{that it is a}} sacrifice, or an unwilling one, before you treat <b>me</b> to <b>any</b> <b>more</b> heroics." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{he could}} do it; he could even go on: [...] "And it is {{satisfactory}} that you have thought me out so thoroughly, because you will not need to think <b>me</b> out <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> You know <b>me</b> now, Grizel, and can have no more fear of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bring {{a couple}} of {{sandwiches}} and a syphon,' {{he said to the}} man, 'and then don't trouble <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> tonight--or let anybody else.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{neither of}} them minded <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> than if I had been a fly who buzzed between them. Their eyes were locked together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, it won't! I hate you, and I'll go on hating you. Mr. Torpenhow won't {{speak to}} <b>me</b> <b>any</b> <b>more.</b> He's always looking at maps.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Upon my word!" [...] {{broke out}} General D'Hubert, {{speaking}} through his teeth, [...] "if your Excellency deigns to favour <b>me</b> with <b>any</b> <b>more</b> confidential information I don't know what I will do.

6000|$|... "Now, see here, Glo," [...] {{continued}} the parent, rather sternly, [...] "don't let <b>me</b> hear <b>any</b> <b>more</b> about 'aspirations'-which are always adulterated with terra alba-nor 'aims'-which {{will give you}} the gripes like anything.
