5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to develop ambivalent attachments.

5|$|Women were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to self-identify {{as being}} feminists than men {{in every country}} except Poland, where men (21%) were four points <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than women (17%) to agree very much with the statement. In South Korea, there was no {{difference}} between men and women (7%) on this measure.|$|E

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5|$|In a 2013 study, Yule et al. {{looked into}} mental health variances between Caucasian heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and asexuals. The results of 203 male and 603 female {{participants}} {{were included in}} the findings. Yule et al. found that asexual male participants were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report having a mood disorder than other males, particularly in comparison to the heterosexual participants. The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E
5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to fail because less plant cover made them <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.|$|E

5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|When compared, Black signers were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{than were}} White signers to produce signs {{outside of the}} typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs {{are most likely to}} use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive sleep apnea, {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black people are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be obese than American whites, and are therefore <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to develop OHS, but obese Asians are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
