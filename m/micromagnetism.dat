40|$|It {{has been}} proposed, that {{unconventional}} density waves (UDW) are possible candidates for systems with hidden order parameter.

40|$|<b>Micromagnetism</b> is {{the study}} of {{magnetic}} materials on the microscopic length scale (of nano to micrometers), this scale does not take quantum mechanical effects into account, but is small enough to neglect certain macroscopic effects of magnetism in a material. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation is used within <b>micromagnetism</b> to determine the time evolution of the magnetisation vector field in a ferromagnetic solid. It is a partial differential equation with high non linearity, which makes it very difficult so solve analytically. Thus numerical methods have been developed for approximating the solution using computers. In this report we compare the performance of three different numerical methods for the LLG equation, the implicit midpoint method (IMP), the midpoint with extrapolation method (MPE), and the Gauss-Seidel Projection method (GSPM). It was found that all methods have convergence rates as expected; second order for IMP and MPE, and first order for GSPM. Energy conserving properties of the schemes were analysed and neither MPE or GSPM conserve energy. The computational time required for each method was determined to be very large for the IMP method in comparison to the other two.

30|$|Fine {{ferromagnetic}} {{particles of}} a nanometer-scale size have important applications in various fields of modern nanotechnology, such as magnetic recording, permanent magnet industry, biomedical applications, etc. [1]. The continuum theory of <b>micromagnetism,</b> which {{was developed in}} the 1930 s and 1940 s, was intended {{to bridge the gap between}} the phenomenological Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic fields and quantum theory based on atomic backgrounds. In Maxwell's theory, material properties are described using global permeabilities and susceptibilities valid for macroscopic dimensions. On the other hand, quantum theory allows a description of magnetic properties on the atomistic level. A modern theory of <b>micromagnetism</b> has been born by Brown's attempt to explain the so far unexplained 1 /H term in the law of approach to ferromagnetic saturation. The breakthrough toward a continuum theory of magnetism is due to Landau and Lifshitz (1935), who derived a continuum expression for the exchange energy and gave a first interpretation of domain patterns [2]. Ferromagnetic materials consist of small volumes of solid called magnetic domains in which atomic magnetic dipole moments of about 1012 to 1015 atoms align parallel to each other spontaneously. The emergence of magnetization M may be due to a change in magnetic field strength H. Hysteresis loop proceeds in three main stages: initial reversible magnetization, rapid irreversible magnetization, and the slow approach to saturation, which they related, respectively, to the reversible shifts of domain walls, irreversible rotation and shift processes, and the reversible rotation of domains [3].|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about <b>micromagnetism</b> in {{confined}} magnetic microstructures. The field-driven magnetization dynamics of nanoparticles and nanowires is systematically discussed following a clear thread of thought: from “macrospin” to “microspin”. At the same time, four topics are raised and investigated. First, {{inspired by the}} traditional ferromagnetic resonance technique, two strategies for measuring the Gilbert damping coefficient using the magnetic circular dichroism effect are presented and discussed. The investigation is performed within a framework of the linear response of the macrospin in 2 -D magnetic films to external time-dependent fields. The object of the study then turns to Stoner particles, which are single-domain magnetic nanoparticles, that are quasi 0 -D systems and still assumed to be macrospins. The field-driven magnetization reversal in multi-axial Stoner particles is investigated and the corresponding Eular equations are presented. The Eular equations provide a unified framework for research of this kind. After that, the macrospin assumption itself is examined. The study of when and how it fails results in the famous “nucleation problem” in <b>micromagnetism,</b> thus the discussion then moves into the microspin category. The nucleation problem of single-domain cuboid permalloy nanowires, which are quasi 1 -D systems, is investigated and a magnetization reversal mode named “domain formation and domain wall propagation” is revealed. Field-driven magnetic domain wall propagation {{is an excellent example}} of microspin behavior, and has been a hot issue in recent spintronic research. The effects of transverse magnetic anisotropies on field-driven transverse wall propagation in narrow magnetic nanowires are systematically investigated. These results should not only deepen the understanding of the domain wall dynamics in magnetic nanowires, but also offer inspiration for further developments of ultrafast nano-devices with higher integration levels...|$|E
