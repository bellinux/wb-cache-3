Cosmetic changes include a new spoiler and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds. The HSV E Series 3 introduced the new HSV Enhanced Driver Interface; {{it has the same}} interface as the Holden IQ (found in VE Series II Commodores) but with added function. The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The <b>model</b> <b>changes</b> its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

The model companies were often pressed to get sales, display, paint and promotional details correct in order to offer the models to the “Big Three” before the real vehicles hit the market. Detroit's annual <b>model</b> <b>changes</b> required last minute alterations in model details and showroom displays had to be finished {{in advance of the}} actual cars reaching the dealerships (Anderson 2003). One interesting example was AMT’s 1968 Chevy hardtop kit. AMT did not have access to GM’s 1968 details, so the resulting model was not correct (Doty 2000a, p88). Another example was the 1960 Ford Falcon promo that was offered in a hardtop, which was not available on the actual car (Doty 2002a, p88). Limitations of models offered also sometimes had interesting results. The 1966 Mercury Comet promo only came in a hardtop and that year a convertible paced the Indianapolis 500, so the 500 promo came in any style desired {{as long as it was}} a hardtop (Doty 2001, p89).|$|E
