I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.'

Now David Cameron is no different from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown is no different from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same guy gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at <b>me,</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what I {{really want to do}} to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. [...] For instance, in the episode [...] "House Fancy", television personality Alton Brown guest starred as the character of Nicholas Whithers, the host and judge of a show of the same name. In an interview, Brown described the work as [...] "a blast." [...] He said [...] "I {{came up with this}} voice that didn't sound anything like me. I channeled this very strange person. Only three people I know figured out it was even <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> saw it." [...] Actor and musician Johnny Depp guest starred in the episode [...] "SpongeBob vs. The Big One" [...] as the voice of Jack Kahuna Laguna, a surf guru that taught SpongeBob how to surf. According to Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, Depp accepted the role because he and his kids are fans of the show. The episode was also guest starred by musician and The Monkees' Davy Jones who starred in the episode as himself, appearing {{at the bottom of the}} sea with his locker, and Bruce Brown providing vocal cameo as the episode's narrator. Brian Doyle-Murray also reprised his role as the Flying Dutchman for the episode. In [...] "The Card", Ernest Borgnine returned, reprising his role as Mermaid Man. Borgnine later reappeared in the episodes [...] "Ditchin'" [...] and [...] "Shuffleboarding", voicing his recurring role, with Tim Conway as Barnacle Boy. In [...] "Dear Vikings", English actor Ian McShane voiced Gordon, the leader of the large group of Vikings outside of Bikini Bottom. Dennis Quaid also appeared in the [...] "Grandpappy the Pirate" [...] as Grandpa Redbeard, Mr. Krabs' grandfather. Furthermore, Dee Snider, the frontman of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, guest starred in [...] "Shell Shocked" [...] as Angry Jack. Snider said [...] "I knew they must be fans [...] because in the SpongeBob movie, they took my song 'I Wanna Rock' and changed it to 'Goofy Goober Rock.' I flipped at the opportunity to be in the show. I have four kids, and everybody loved SpongeBob." [...] In the entry [...] "The Clash of Triton", English singer Victoria Beckham guest starred in the episode as the wife of King Neptune, Queen Amphitrite. The writers created the role of a Queen Amphitrite especially for Beckham. The former Spice Girl accepted the role because her sons, Brooklyn, Romeo, and Cruz, love the show, were excited when their mother told them of the role, and looked forward to watching the episode with her. Beckham recorded the voice-over in late-2008 in a day, and claimed that she was [...] "thrilled" [...] to provide the vocal cameo. Other guests in the episode included Seinfeld actor John O'Hurley as King Neptune and Skid Row heavy metal vocalist Sebastian Bach as the voice of Triton.|$|E

"Reading the {{statements}} from last weekend's sessions {{reminded me that}} it was probably the senior warden, not the girl's mother, who in 1975 reported John's abuse, after which I immediately told him to leave the parish, and that {{in order to maintain the}} confidentiality of both John and the girl, I did not tell the parents, who nonetheless confronted <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had found out four years later. Until reading {{the statements}} I had never before known that John's destructive behavior did not stop, but rather increased, in the parish to which he went after leaving my parish. That I could have prevented that from happening had I known to act differently is extremely grievous to me. My efforts to maintain confidentiality and prevent scandal were very misguided." ...|$|E

After the production's principal photography had been completed, the film's producer, Claudio Argento, asked if McCloskey {{would be willing to}} perform the stuntwork himself, as the stuntman hired for the job had broken his leg. The producer assured the actor: [...] "It'll be absolutely safe". The actor agreed, and when he walked onto the set the following day he observed [...] "three rows of flexiglass in front of everything and everyone is wearing hard hats.

40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that significant energy saving can be achieved in wireless sensor networks by using mobile elements (MEs) capable of carrying data mechanically. However, the low movement speed of MEs hinders their use in data-intensive sensing applications with temporal constraints. To address this issue, we propose a rendezvousbased approach in which a subset of nodes serve as the rendezvous points (RPs) that buffer data originated from sources and transfer to <b>MEs</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> arrive. RPs enable MEs to collect a large volume of data at a time without traveling long distances, which can achieve a desirable balance between network energy saving and data collection delay. We develop two rendezvous planning algorithms, RP-CP and RP-UG. RP-CP finds the optimal RPs <b>when</b> <b>MEs</b> mov...|$|R
