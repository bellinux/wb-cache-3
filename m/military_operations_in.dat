5|$|Meanwhile, {{disagreements}} between King Constantine I and Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos {{over whether}} Greece should enter World War I, lead to political instability and the National Schism (1914–1916). Greece officially joined the Triple Entente at June 1917, however the anti-royalist {{party of the}} country {{under the leadership of}} Venizelos formed a Movement of National Defence that supported the Allied <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the region from December 1916.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{could not}} rely on his limited funds to make a {{successful}} entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy. After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium, Octavian demanded {{a portion of the}} funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against Parthia in the Middle East. This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the east.|$|E
5|$|Since 1894, the Naval War College {{had been}} formulating plans for war with Spain. By 1896, the Office of Naval Intelligence had {{prepared}} a plan which included <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Puerto Rican waters. Not only was Puerto Rico considered valuable as a naval station, Puerto Rico and Cuba were also abundant in a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked: sugar.|$|E

5|$|With {{the start}} of <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Croatia, Croats {{and a number of}} Serbian conscripts started to desert the JNA en masse, similar to what had {{happened}} in Slovenia. Albanians and Macedonians started to search for a way to legally leave the JNA or serve their conscription term in Macedonia; these moves further homogenized the ethnic composition of JNA troops in or near Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> India and China, was {{probably}} {{attracted by the}} news of the annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|By 2002 Sarumpaet had {{returned}} to Indonesia, where she debuted a stageplay entitled Alia, Luka Serambi Mekah (Alia, Wound of Serambi Mekah) at Ismail Marzuki Park in Jakarta; it was her first stageplay {{since the fall of}} Suharto. Dealing with Indonesian <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Aceh, the play was later performed in five other cities. In December 2002 it was scheduled to be broadcast on TVRI in commemoration of Human Rights Day, but pulled at the last minute due to intervention from the military. In 2001, she and her troupe put on Dalam Kegelapan Panjang (In a Long Darkness), which dealt with the children of victims of the anti-communist purges of 1965–1966.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Iraq in December 2011, several Apache {{helicopters}} {{had been}} shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Sicily. This was probably chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, the Ministry of the Interior {{established}} the Special Police Department to facilitate efficient {{command and control}} of the special police. It was reorganised into the Special Police Sector of the ministry in 1994 due to the expanding scope of its operations, including planning and oversight of training processes. The Joint Special Police Force framework was set up by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia to integrate the special police into <b>military</b> <b>operations.</b> <b>In</b> major offensives, such as Operation Storm, when the force fielded 3,100 troops, the special police was directly subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces.|$|E

5|$|The Port Said Sector was an {{independent}} military command in the Egyptian Military, unattached to the Second Army. It incorporated Port Said, Port Fouad and their vicinity. The sector contained two infantry brigades. <b>Military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> this area were directed against three fortifications: Budapest, Orkal and Lahtzanit. As {{with the rest}} of the front, the offensive here began with a fire preparation. However, high trajectory weapons were not employed because Egyptian aircraft were flying through the sector's airspace, hence only direct fire guns were used to bombard Israeli positions.|$|E
5|$|The fort, {{abandoned}} by its garrison, {{was captured by}} the British the following year, {{and it has been}} known as Fort Ticonderoga (after its location) ever since. This battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability that had an effect on future <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the area. Despite several large-scale military movements through the area, in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, this was the only major battle fought near the fort's location.|$|E
5|$|Another factor behind Echmarcach's {{actions against}} Sitriuc could concern Knútr. Echmarcach's seizure of Dublin {{occurred}} {{only a year}} after the latter's death in 1035. There appears to be numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Knútr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Wales. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Knútr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Knútr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that the confusion caused by Knútr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region.|$|E

5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|E
5|$|Laos was {{a neutral}} country {{according}} to the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on 23July1962. Therefore, the United States was prohibited from openly conducting <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had {{to be approved by}} the U.S. Ambassador to Laos William H. Sullivan. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed it as he thought that Laotian Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma would not allow his country to be involved in an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. However, Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by U.S. military personnel.|$|E

5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{frontiers of}} the Principality of Albania {{had not been}} set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they {{had not yet been}} {{determined}} by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. Greek troops conducted <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, {{in the northern part of}} the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.|$|E
5|$|The special police {{subsequently}} {{took part}} in all <b>military</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the Croatian War of Independence, sustaining losses of 179 troops killed, 790 wounded and 14 missing. Personnel of all units directly subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior were transferred to the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG) by 15 May 1991, when four infantry brigades were established to replace the special police units disbanded in the process. A part of the force {{was transferred to the}} Zrinski Battalion—the first special forces unit of the ZNG established around former French Foreign Legion personnel on 18 May. The Airborne Unit, the Lučko ATU and the regionally organised units remained active throughout the war.|$|E
