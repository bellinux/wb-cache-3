40|$|Using {{computerized}} tomographic {{data and}} three dimensional model, we studied {{the influence of}} tibial intramedullary canal axis and other morphologic factors of the tibia on the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for tibial intramedullary alignment guides. Various anatomical parameters including tibial anteroposterior dimensions (AP), mediolateral dimensions (ML), aspect ratio (ML/AP), bowing and the intramedullary canal axis were studied. In addition, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for the intramedullary alignment guide for primary and revision total knee arthroplasty were studied. The averaged <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> {{at the level of}} the tibial plateau was 5. 7 ± 2. 2 mm anterior and 4. 3 ± 2. 0 mm lateral to the classical <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> (P<. 001). Furthermore, this <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> was more anterolateral in females when compared to males (P<. 001). At a depth 10 mm below the tibial plateau, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> was on average 8. 8 ± 1. 9 mm anterior and 2. 9 ± 1. 9 mm lateral to the center of the cut surface. With increasing tibial varus the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> tended to shift laterally at both levels (r= 0. 49) (P<. 001). In Korean, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for tibial intramedullary alignment systems is anterolateral to the classically described <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> Moreover, the increment of tibial varus necessitates more lateral placement of the <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> Intraoperatively, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> can be localized during primary knee arthroplasty to a point 15. 9 ± 2. 8 mm anterior to and 1. 2 ± 2. 8 mm lateral to the lateral tibial spine.

40|$|Piriform fossa, trochanteric fossa {{and greater}} trochanteric tip have each been {{described}} as <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> for antegrade femoral nailing. However, the terminology used for these <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> is confusing. The accuracy of the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> nomenclature in published text and illustrations was recorded in this review study. The trochanteric fossa, a deep depression {{at the base of}} the femoral neck is indicated as 'piriform fossa' in the vast majority of the publications. Other publications indicate the insertion site of the tendon of the piriformis muscle on the greater trochanteric tip as 'piriform fossa'. As a result of recurrent terminology error and consistent reproductions of it, the recommended <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> in literature is confusing and seems to need standardisation. The piriform fossa does not appear to exist in the femoral region. The trochanteric fossa is the standard <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> which most surgeons recommend for facilitating a standard straight intramedullary nail, as is in line with the medullary canal. The greater trochanteric tip is the lateral <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for intramedullary nails with a proximal lateral bend. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{cope with}} {{unpredictable}} packet losses {{caused by the}} wireless environment there exist techniques using route selection, retransmission, and buffering. This can make losses incurred over a one or two hop path acceptable. However, {{as the number of}} hops in the path increases to three, four, and beyond packet losses inexorably add up and exceed the limits of these techniques. This can cause unacceptable interruptions in content delivery and make it impossible to meet service level agreements. In a wireless cloud with multiple <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> an incorrect <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> selection can result in unnecessary additional hops causing unacceptable interruption of service. Addressing this problem in this work we present an anycast <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> selection technique that minimizes hop count in a wireless cloud through intelligent selection of <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> into the cloud.

In part 2, pedicle screws were inserted in fresh cadavers, {{using a different}} <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> in {{the left and right}} pedicles. Objectives. To identify the safest <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> and screw orientation for pedicle screws in the thoracic spine. Summary of Background Data. A few morphometric investigations have been performed on thoracic vertebrae, but the safest technique for screw insertion in thoracic pedicles has not been analyzed. Methods. Mean, range, and standard deviations of pedicle transverse diameter and pedicle orientation were measured in 99 dried thoracic vertebrae. We evaluated the position of the bottom of the superior facet and that of the superior border of the transverse process in relation {{to the center of the}} pedicle. The relation between the pedicle axis and the superior facet in the frontal plane was also assessed. In part 2 of the study, pedicle screws were inserted in fresh cadavers at the intersection between the superior border of the transverse process and the middle of the superior facet (<b>entry</b> <b>point</b> A) and between the former and the lateral two thirds of the facet (<b>entry</b> <b>point</b> B). Results. The smallest transverse diameter was found at T 6 (mean 4. 3 mm) where pedicles measured less than 5 mm in 68 % of the specimens. In the frontal plane, the pedicle axis intersected the middle of the superior facet inn 15 % of specimens, the lateral two-thirds in 62 %, and the lateral border of the facet in 23 %. Of the 126 screws inserted in fresh human cadavers, 15 (24 %) of the screws inserted using <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> A and 10 (16 %) of those inserted using <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> B violated the pedicle cortex (P < 0. 05). Six (10 %) of the screws inserted using <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> A compared with no screw inserted using <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> B penetrated the anterior vertebral cortex (P = 0. 03). Conclusions. Pedicles between T 4 and T 8 may not be wide enough for screw fixation. An <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for pedicle screws located at the intersection between the superior border of the transverse process and the lateral two thirds of the superior facet seems more likely to be line with the pedicle axis than do other <b>entry</b> <b>points.</b> In the lower thoracic vertebrae this <b>entry</b> <b>point,</b> in combination with insertion of the screws more medially oriented than the pedicle axis, significantly reduces the risk of violating the anterior vertebral cortex...|$|R
