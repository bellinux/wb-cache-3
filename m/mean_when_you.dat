500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I <b>mean,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E

30|$|You {{asked what}} is the meaning of sannyās. It is a very deep (gaherā) topic. Sannyās means freedom (svatantratā). Freedom from what? Desire (kām). From disgust (dveś) and passion (rāg). That is real (asli) sannyās, to be free of rāg and dveś in one’s heart (man). Rāg <b>means</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> say “this is mine and I want it by any means,” 24 and dveś <b>means</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hate something. Hatred is dveś. The sannyāsī should not have hatred or {{possession}} in his nature. Let’s say he is hating something and says, “Oh, I don’t want to see this. Take it away.” That is dveś. These are not good things. The sannyāsī should be ‘balanced.’ Sannyāsīs should be balanced in their heart-minds and see everything as equal (barābar). Now, understand that the sannyāsī’s family is big. Not only those four family members are his, but the entire world (duniyā) belongs to him. Those four people didn’t become erased from the sannyāsī’s world. No. They have been added to his world. The only thing is this: The sādhu, the sannyāsī, has to treat everyone equally. Whatever he does, he should do it equally. He shouldn’t say rubbish things to lift himself up.|$|R
