40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{denoising}} {{scheme is}} presented suitable for <b>magnetic</b> <b>exploration</b> data. It {{is based on}} an empirical study and combines the shift invariant denoising method {{with the use of a}} variable threshold, which is calculated in each cycle of the shift invariant algorithm. The calculation of each threshold is based on the wavelet transformation of random noise with the same standard deviation as in the data. The scheme is particularly useful in “archaeological geophysics ” where it is important to produce results that mostly resemble the plane view of the buried objects. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Syringomyelia is a cavitary {{extension}} {{inside the}} spinal cord which can be either symptomatic or congenitally-idiopathic. Syringomyelia {{during the course of}} the disease in patients presenting with clinically definite multiple sclerosis was described earlier. Syringomyelia in patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis is unusual. Case Outline. We present two patients presenting with demy-elinating disease of the central nervous system with syringomyelia in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. We did not find classical clinical signs of syringomyelia in our patients, but we disclosed syringomyelia incidentally during <b>magnetic</b> resonance <b>exploration.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> resonance <b>exploration</b> using the gadolinium contrast revealed the signs of active demyelinating lesions in {{the spinal cord}} in one patient but not in the other. Conclusion. Syringomyelia in demyelinating disease of the central nervous system opens the question whether it is a coincidental finding or a part of clinical features of the disease. Differentiation of the significance of syringomyelia finding in these patients plays a role in the choice of treatment concept in such patients...|$|R

40|$|In {{technical}} geological publications it {{has been}} demonstrated that Broken Hill Type deposits and their host provinces are characterised by similarities in their geological settings and ore deposit mineralogy at both local and regional scales. The purpose of this thesis was to examine magnetic characteristics of the globally most significant BHT deposits, and their host provinces, {{in order to develop}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>exploration</b> model for BHT deposits. This involved detailed aeromagnetic interpretation of available datasets with reference to mapped geology. Four significant BHT provinces were studied: Broken Hill Block - Australia Eastern Succession, Mt Isa Block - Australia Bergslagen District - Sweden Aggenys -Gamsberg District - South Africa The study showed that host provinces to BHT deposits share common magnetic characteristics which reflect common geological characteristics. However, significant differences in the aeromagnetic character occur which are related to differences in volume of BHT host stratigraphy, basement stratigraphy and structural style of the host province. BHT deposits naturally divide into two classes, based on {{the presence or absence of}} magnetic minerals within the ore. This may result from differing ore-forming environments and/or fluid chemistry. Deposits which contain magnetic minerals within the ore are commonly associated with magnetic anomalies which are amongst the strongest within the host meiasedimentary /metavolcanic sequence. Deposits which do not contain magnetic minerals within the ore itself are associated with a locally anomalous signature when the immediate environs of the ore deposit are considered. The most economically signifcant deposit, Broken Hill (Australia), is of this type, although both types include large tonnage deposits. Thermodynamic modelling was undertaken to test whether the variations of magnetic deposit signatures could be explained by variations in the environment of exhalation. The roles of boiling, cooling and seawater mixing (oxidised and reduced) as precipitation mechanisms were examined. The modelling showed that a single fluid can give rise to a spectrum of iron oxide distribution, depending on whether the dominant precipitation mechanism was boiling, cooling, mixing with oxidised sea water or mixing with reduced sea water. Precursors to metamorphosed BHT ore and gangue minerals were produced by several of these thermodynamic models. It is concluded that the interpreter, when defining the likely spectrum of magnetic responses of a BHT deposit, must consider the likely range of environments of deposition consistent with known geology...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the Carolina de Michilla district, {{northern}} Chile, stratabound copper mineralization is {{hosted by}} Jurassic volcanic rocks along the {{trace of the}} Atacama fault system. In this study, we present the overall effects of hydrothermal alteration on the magnetic properties of rocks in this district. Two types of metasomatic alteration associations occur, one of regional extent and the other of local hydrothermal alteration associated with copper mineralization (e. g., Lince­Estefanía­Susana). Regional alteration is interpreted as a low-grade "propylitic association" characterized by an epidote­chlorite­smectite­titanite­albite­quartz­calcite association. The local hydrothermal alteration is characterized broadly by a quartz­albite­epidote­chlorite­calcite mineral assemblage. The most pervasive alteration mineral is albite, followed by epidote and, locally, actinolite. These minerals contrast sharply against host rock minerals such as chlorite, calcite, zeolite, prehnite, and pumpellyite, but alteration is constrained to mineralized bodies as narrow and low contrast alteration halos that go outwards from actinolite­albite to epidote­albite, to epidote­chlorite, and finally to chlorite. Hydrothermal alteration minerals, compared to regional alteration minerals, show iron-rich epidotes, a lower chlorite content of the chlorite­smectite series, and a nearly total albite replacement of plagioclase in the mineralized zones. Opaque minerals associated with regional alteration are magnetite and maghemite, and those associated to hydrothermal alteration are magnetite, hematite, and copper sulphides. We present paleomagnetic results from nine sites in the Michilla district and from drill cores from two mines. Local effects of hydrothermal alteration on the original magnetic mineralogy indicate similar characteristics and mineralogy, except for an increase of hematite that is spatially associated with the Cu­sulphide breccias with low magnetic susceptibilities. Results indicate {{that it is impossible}} to magnetically differentiate mineralized bodies from unmineralized lavas, except for pyrite-rich hydrothermal breccias. In conclusion, for stratabound copper deposits of the Michilla type, the overall effect of hydrothermal alteration on the paleomagnetic properties of rocks is of low contrast, not clearly discernable even at a small scale. From an exploration point of view, <b>magnetic</b> <b>exploration</b> surveys should not discern mineralized bodies of Cu­sulphide breccias except in detailed ground surveys due to the small size of contrasting bodies. Unoriented drill cores with primary ore mineralization record a characteristic remanent magnetization of reverse polarity. Taking into account the azimuth and dip of the drill cores, we were able to compare the magnetization of the mineralized bodies with the characteristic directions from sites drilled in situ from Late Jurassic­Early Cretaceous intrusives mostly. The characteristic direction recorded by the Pluton Viera is similar to the magnetization of the ore bodies of the Estefania mine. If copper mineralization mostly postdates the tilt of the volcanic flows, the low paleomagnetic inclinations suggest an age for the mineralization near 145 Ma, the time of the lowest paleolatitude for the South American plate during the Mesozoic...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{magnetic}} anomaly separation using reduction-to-the-pole (RTP) technique and the fractal concentration-area (C-A) method {{has been applied}} to the Qoja-Kandi prosepecting area in NW Iran. The geophysical survey that resulted in the ground magnetic data was conducted for <b>magnetic</b> elements <b>exploration.</b> Firstly, RTP technique was applied for recognizing underground magnetic anomalies. RTP anomalies was classified to different populations based on this method. For this reason, drilling points determination with RTP technique was complicated. Next, C-A method was applied on the RTP-Magnetic-Anomalies (RTP-MA) for demonstrating magnetic susceptibility concentration. This identification was appropriate for increasing the resolution of the drilling points determination and decreasing the drilling risk, due to the economic costs of underground prospecting. In this study, the results of C-A Modeling on the RTP-MA are compared with 8 borehole data. The results show there is good correlation between anomalies derived via C-A method and log report of boreholes. Two boreholes were drilled in magnetic susceptibility concentration, based on multifractal modeling data analyses, between 63 533. 1 and 66 296 nT. Drilling results show appropriate magnetite thickness with the grades greater than 20 % Fe total. Also, anomalies associated with andesite units host iron mineralization...|$|R

40|$|Earth is {{a complex}} dynamic system and study of the {{geomagnetic}} field can provideinsight to the dynamic processes operative in the outer core where the main field isproduced by a geo-dynamo mechanism. By contrast the study of transient geomagneticvariations is an important tool for studying the complex solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. In addition the currents induced by the time varying externalcurrent system allow us to image the crust and the upper mantle in terms ofelectric conductivity. Lack of measurements and collection of geomagnetic data fromcertain strategic locations restricts the development of high quality models of maingeomagnetic field {{as well as the}} current systems responsible for transient geomagneticvariations. Division V of the International Association of Geomagnetic Aeronomy(IAGA) jointly with the Interdivisional Commission for Developing Countries organizeda special symposium «Geomagnetic Measurements in Remote Regions» at GeneralAssembly of IUGG held at Perugia (Italy) during July 2 - 12, 2007. Papers werepresented on data base numerical simulations identifying strategic gaps in the existingobservatory network where new measurements of geomagnetic field could improveupon existing geomagnetic reference models. Special focus was on describing thenovel design of equipment, modes of data collection and dissemination from remoteregions. During the symposium, 21 presentations were presented and this issue ofAnnals of Geophysics compiles a selection of papers. It is significant that each paper in this special issue is multi-authored by severalinstitutions and countries. This emphasizes the importance of worldwide collaborationwhen obtaining and analyzing data from geophysical observations in remote regions. With current technology magnetic observatories still require people to take measurementsat least once per week to enable baselines to be established and must beaway from power sources and transmission lines. This restricts the location of magneticobservatories used for deep Earth investigations. However, presented here arepapers describing ways to overcome harsh conditions and obtain magnetic data inremote locations. The need for long term ground based geomagnetic observatoriesfor reference models is well established and discussed. Also discussed, is the studyof magnetic field variations for determining transient phenomena. The measuringstations can exist unmanned as highlighted during the session by the Japanese group (not included in this volume) and Chambodut et al. Five papers (Cafarella et al., Chambodut et al., De Lauretis et al., Maksymchuket al., and Torta et al.) describe magnetic observations in Antarctica. Most of thiscontinent is covered by ice so {{it is almost impossible to}} sample the continental surfacedirectly: <b>magnetic</b> <b>exploration</b> allows us to overcome much of this problem, providingimportant information on the geological and tectonic settings of this continent. Antarctica is also an interesting magnetic region because it is in darkness forhalf of the year, so production of the ionospheric plasma that creates the daily Solarquiet variation is reduced for this period in this region (Chambodut et al.). In addition,it contains the southern polar cap current system – a window to the solar windand the magnetospheric-ionospheric energy transfer processes (De Lauretis et al.). Torta et al. and Chambodut et al. describe the exceptional means necessary for amagnetic observatory in Antarctica attempting to attain INTERMAGNET status. Torta etal. use Livingston Island (LIV), in the South Shetland Islands archipelago (in operationfor ten years), and Chambodut et al. describe Concordia Base (in operation forjust over 3 years). Both have not yet achieved INTERMAGNET status. De Lauretis et al. use two stations Concordia at Dome C and Mario Zucchelli atTerra Nova Bay to show that the geomagnetic signals, measured by the two stations,have very different signatures that depend upon the position of the stations with respectto the sources. The paper by Cafarella et al., describes long-term trends in geomagnetic measurementswhich have non-absolute baselines for six months of the year at MarioZucchelli station (TNB). These authors compare TNB data with the models fromsatellite measurements and find them to be in good agreement. They exhibit the differentlong-term trend in source currents for example, daily variation, pulsationsand internal Earth sources such as jerks. Maksymchuk et al. also describe the results of long-term (1998 - 2005 yrs.) magneticinvestigations but use tectonomagnetic techniques in the Western Antarcticnear the location of Ukrainian Antarctic Station «Academic Vernadsky». This newtype of research is described. A novel approach to remote data acquisition is given in Torta et al. They describethe development of data transmission facilities for real time access between Antarcticaand Spain using METEOSAT and GOES satellites and recently the move to ahigh frequency (HF) digital radio-link, using ionospheric propagation. Geomagnetic measurements from the deep sea are discussed in Vitale et al. From 2000 to 2005 two exploring geophysical missions were undertaken in the Tyrrheniandeep seafloor at depths between around - 2000 and - 3000 m in the framework of the European-funded GEOSTAR Projects. During the two GEOSTAR deep seafloormissions, scalar and vector magnetometer measurements were used to improveglobal and regional geomagnetic reference models and to infer specific geoelectricinformation about the two sites. Three papers (Korte et al., Macmillan et al., Matzka et al.) describe magnetic observationsin the region of the South Atlantic anomaly. This is the region betweenAfrica and South America where Earth’s main magnetic field is depressed causinglocalized space weather hazards (some described in Macmillan et al.), especiallysatellite outages. Korte et al. describes the installation of new magnetic observatoriesin Bolivia, Namibia and St Helena, and Macmillan et al. describe two oldermagnetic observatories located on Ascension Island and Port Stanely. Repeat station surveys are a way of measuring the secular variation of main field. Matzka et al. contains a detailed report of a repeat station survey in this region atTristan da Cunha Island. They also describe the drawbacks of repeat station surveysand prefer a magnetic observatory in the region which will be established for theSWARM satellite mission. However, Korte et al. show that when nothing else existsrepeat stations are still a good way of obtaining secular variation data. They describethe addition of several repeat stations in the South Atlantic anomaly area inAfrica. Torta et al. and Korte et al. also describe efforts being made to create an unmannedmagnetic observatory, which would have INTERMAGNET standards.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{hydrocarbons}} is growing exponentially {{and to meet}} this demand an integrated approach is required for hydrocarbon <b>exploration.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> techniques have long been used in this regard. However, {{over the past two}} decades, the application of aeromagnetic data to hydrocarbon exploration has moved from primarily mapping basement structures and lithologies to mapping structures within the sedimentary section. Geochemical studies have shown that magnetic mineralisation may be associated with hydrocarbon seepage and migration that could result in miniscule magnetic signatures.

40|$|Non-sulfide zinc {{deposits}} (zinc “oxide ” deposits) {{are becoming}} favored exploration targets due to {{new developments in}} metallurgy allowing for solvent-extraction and electrowinning. While geologic understanding of the genesis {{of these types of}} deposits is improving, there has been little work aimed at documenting their geophysical responses. We therefore investigate the geophysical signature of two major hypogene non-sulfide deposits, Vazante in Brazil and Beltana in Australia. Physical property values were measured for each deposit site and combined with geologic information to generate two- and three-dimensional models for geophysical modeling. Results indicate that gravity method will be valuable at both deposit sites for direct detection of either ore and/or the alteration halo associated with mineralization. Simulated magnetic data indicate that the responses will not be large enough at either site to warrant <b>magnetic</b> method in <b>exploration</b> for willemite. Electrical method simulations vary for the two deposit sites. At Vazante, neither DC resistivity or induced polarization (IP) will generate a detectable response based on physical property values; while at Beltana, simulated data and inversion results indicate that both techniques will be valuable as an exploration tool.

40|$|Small {{molecule}} organic semiconductors such as phthalocyanines {{and their}} derivatives represent {{a very interesting}} alternative to inorganic semiconductor materials {{for the development of}} flexible electronic devices such as organic thin field effect transistors, organic Light Emitting Diodes and photo-voltaic cells. Phthalocyanine molecules can easily accommodate a variety of metal atoms as well in the central core of the molecule, resulting in wide range of <b>magnetic</b> properties. <b>Exploration</b> of optical properties of organic crystalline semiconductors thin films is challenging due to sub-micron grain sizes and the presence of numerous structural defects, disorder and grain boundaries. However, this can be overcome by fabricating macroscopically ordered semiconductor films by solution processing. Presence of fewer grain boundaries and defects while modifying the pi orbital overlap by controlling the molecular stacking by forming macroscopic long range ordered grains, was essential in understanding the delocalization and diffusion length and its role in magnetic exchange mechanisms in this system. The origins of magnetic exchange mechanism between delocalized ligand electrons and spins in organic semiconductors has been of key interest as it underlies many complex optical and transport properties and is investigated in this thesis. The interaction between magnetic ions in organic magnetic semiconductors is quite challenging to interpret due to competing exchange mechanisms present in crystalline thin films. Better understanding of these exchange mechanisms is essential for tuning of magnetic exchange interaction to suit the need of practical magnetic storage and spintronic devices. Optical techniques such as linear dichroism, magnetic circular dichroism and magneto-photoluminescence are used and provided key understanding about the relation between excitons, spin exchange mechanisms and collective magnetic behavior of delocalized electrons in organic semiconductors. An enhancement in the collective magnetization of the crystalline thin films with strong exchange coupling between the delocalized ligand electrons and d-electrons is observed. The electronic states responsible for magnetic exchange are identified utilizing magnetic field and temperature dependent studies. Furthermore, soluble organics allowed engineering of organic analogues to diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) by creation of metal/metal-free Pc alloys. Optical studies provided crucial information about delocalization and diffusion lengths in these systems allowing fine tuning of this delocalization length scale and metal-metal distance. The <b>exploration</b> of <b>magnetic</b> behavior in metal/metal-free Pc alloys opens an avenue for tuning magnetic properties through an exchange similar to Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) type interaction in organic magnetic semiconductors...|$|R
40|$|Two US {{spacecraft}} {{are presently}} exploring Mars, and several scientific Martian missions {{are planned for}} the next years. The Martian magnetic field is of great interest in many respects, and so magnetometers are included in payload plans of the missions. Since the magnetic field of Mars is very small {{compared with that of}} the Earth (≈ 0. 1 %), fields due to the spacecraft and its instruments can es-sentially distort the recordings of a magnetometer. Incorrect interpretations and conclusions may result unless the distorting fields are known and carefully taken into account. Each of the two (identical) Small Surface Stations belonging to the Russian "Mars– 96 " mission, which was launched, although unsuccessfully, in November 1996, contained a magnetometer. Before the launch, the problem of a dis-turbing magnetism of the Small Station was investigated at the Nurmijärvi Geophysical Observatory, Finland. Distortions of several tens of nanoteslas were indicated, which are of importance when measuring the weak Martian magnetic field. The main result of the work done and of this paper is that the applicability of the Nurmijärvi facilities to this kind of a “magnetic cleanliness ” study was clearly demonstrated. Due to the catastrophe of Mars– 96, the scientific goals will, of course, never be reached. However, a lot of important work was done, which can directly be utilized in future Martian missions. A careful documentation of the work is therefore necessary, and this paper is a contribution about the Nurmijärvi facilities for magnetic cleanliness measurements.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to use ground <b>magnetic</b> survey for <b>exploration</b> of new deposit in Taknar polymetal massive sulfide which is located in Northeast Iran in a tectonic corridor between two active faults. It is a syngenetic type mineralization formed at specific horizon within Taknar formation (Paleozoic?). Four mineralized zones named Tak 1, 2, 3 and 4 have been identified. Three style of mineralization such as layered, massive and stockwork have been recognized. Magnetite increases toward the massive part (up to 80 %), which is situated in the upper section. Magnetic susceptibility of the country rocks is 6 x 10 - 5 to 27 x 10 - 5 SI, the stockwork mineralization is 4600 x 10 - 4 SI, the layered is 7054 x 10 - 4 SI and massive is 1730 x 10 - 3 SI. Due to this sharp magnetic contrast magnetic method found ideal and used for the identification of new deposit in Tak 1, 4 and outside of Tak 1 (to the east). Magnetic maps and images revealed distinctive anomalies on Tak 1, 4 and outside of Tak 1. The amplitude of the anomaly on Tak 1, 4 and outside of Tak 1 was 1500, 2227 and 1231 gamma respectively. The anomaly outside of Tak 1 is similar in magnitude to Tak 1 and does not have surface exposure. By analogy the source of all magnetic anomalies in Tak 1, 4 and outside of Tak 1 is magnetite present along with mineralization. Therefore the location of the anomaly outside of Tak 1 on the reduction to the pole map was proposed as drilling target...|$|R
30|$|Two {{contrasting}} observations, both {{of which}} are associated with silicic volcanoes, illustrate the difficulty for interpreting the <b>magnetic</b> anomaly in <b>exploration.</b> First, above the Sunrise deposit associated with a rhyolite volcano, the target of the present study, only a weak magnetization low has been observed (Honsho et al. 2016 a). This structure might be influenced by a geological structure inherent to this site and by a fluid flow (alteration) pattern. Second, above another hydrothermal field associated with a dacitic volcano, the Hakurei hydrothermal field of the mid-Okinawa Trough, high magnetization is found that is correlated with hydrothermal mounds (Honsho et al. 2016 b). Analyzing the magnetic susceptibility of drilled core samples in this field, Honsho et al. (2016 b) argued that the high magnetization is attributable to the existence of pyrrhotite, a sulfide mineral with high magnetization. Moreover, volcanic bodies show high magnetization; fluid conduits show low magnetization (e.g., Honsho et al. 2016 b). As a historical fact, before the discovery of the Hakurei hydrothermal field, many observations were conducted with high magnetization around dacitic volcanic bodies, located north of the hydrothermal field (Kato et al. 1989). Consequently, in adopting the magnetic method to the exploration of hydrothermal deposits, geological information serves an important role: it distinguishes observed anomalies of the kinds described above. The self-potential method requires no such information, but it provides some useful constraints. It detects a negative self-potential anomaly above an ore body with either high or low magnetization. It does not respond to a volcanic body or a fluid conduit. Nonetheless, the geomagnetic method is beneficial because magnetization information is related to a substance-specific quantity, particularly when combined with geological and mineralogical information (Honsho et al. 2016 b).|$|R

In the magnetosphere of Mercury, ULF waves were observed {{in the vicinity of the}} magnetopause and in the inner magnetosphere with frequencies in the range of 0. 1 - 0. 5 Hz. In the magnetosphere of Jupiter, at least three different types of wave sources are observed. Near the dayside and the dawn magnetopause, waves with periods 5 - 20 min and amplitudes between 5 and 10 nT are observed which may be caused by an interaction between the corotating outflowing plasma and the antisunward moving plasma from the magnetosheath. In Saturn's magnetosphere, ULF waves have been observed to be strongly confined to the plasma sheet and have wave periods in the range of 5 - 60 minutes. The calculated fundamental has a wave period of 5 - 6 hours in the region where these waves were observed. The ULF waves have extremely small amplitudes (approximately = 0. 3 nT) in the magnetosphere of Uranus. These waves were also seen to be confined to the low magnitude latitudes and have periods much shorter than that of the fundamental of a standing Alfven wave...|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of new emerging unconventional ground {{states is a}} great challenge for experimental and theoretical solid-state physicists. New ground states are developing, where different energy scales compete, leading to a high sensitivity of the system to external tuning parameters like doping, pressure or <b>magnetic</b> field. The <b>exploration</b> of superconductivity {{proved to be a}} fascinating and challenging scientific undertaking. Discovered by H. Kammerlingh Onnes in 1911, prior {{to the development of the}} quantum theory of matter, superconductivity was defying a microscopic theory for more than four decades until the BCS theory was formulated in 1957 by J. Bardeen, L. N. Cooper and J. R. Schrieffer. Superconductivity of most of the simple metals or metallic alloys is well described within the frame of the BCS scenario, however, in the last thirty years numerous new superconducting materials were found to exhibit exotic properties not accounted for by the BCS theory. Among them are included the high-Tc compounds, the heavy-fermion superconductors and as well the organic superconductors. It was the purpose of this work to probe different facets of superconductivity in heavy-fermion and in low-dimensional metallic compounds. This dissertation is divided into six chapters. After this introduction, in Chapter 1 we will outline the basic theoretical concepts later needed for the analysis of the experimental results. In Chapter 2 we briefly introduce the experimental techniques with a special focus on the new pressure cells developed during this thesis and used for the measurements presented in Chapters 3 to 5. In Chapter 3 the possible realization of the inhomogeneous superconducting FFLO state in CeCoIn 5 is studied by specific heat measurements under hydrostatic pressure, while in Chapter 4 the results of AC specific heat experiments on UBe 13 under uniaxial pressure are presented. The ambient pressure properties as well as results obtained by resistivity measurements under hydrostatic pressure on the one-dimensional metallic compounds TlxV 6 S 8 are discussed in Chapter 5. At the end, Chapter 6 summarizes and concludes this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Gold-bearing {{volcanic}} breccia complexes {{are the major}} sources of gold in the Tasman Fold Belt System in north Queensland. The Tasman Fold Belt System represents the site of continental accretion {{as a series of}} island-arcs and intra-arc basins with accompanying thick sedimentation, volcanism, plutonism, tectonism and mineralisation. In north Queensland, the fold belt system comprises the Hodgkinson-Broken River Fold Belt, Thomson Fold Belt, New England Fold Belt and the Georgetown Inlier. The most numerous ore deposits are associated with calc-alkaline volcanics and granitoid intrusivesof the transitional tectonic stage of the fold belt system. The formation and subsequent gold mineralisation of {{volcanic breccia}} complexes are related to Permo-Carboniferous magmatism within the Thomson Fold Belt and Georgetown Inlier. The two most important producing areas are at Mount Leyshon and Kidston mines, which are high tonnage, low-grade gold deposits. The Mount Leyshon breccia complex was emplaced along the contact between CambroOrdovician metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, and Ordovician-Devonian I-type granitoids of the Lolworth-Ravenswood Block. The Kidston breccia complex is located on a major lithological contact between the Early to Middle Proterozoic. Einasleigh Metamorphics and the Silurian-Devonian Oak River Granodiorite. The principal hosts to the gold mineralisation at the Mount Leyshon and Kidston deposits, are breccia pipes associated with several episodes of porphyry intrusives. The goldbearing magmatic-hydrothermal and phreatomagmatic breccias post-date the development of a porphyry-type protore. The magmatic-hydrothermal breccias were initially emplaced without the involvement of meteoric-hydrothermal fluids, within a closed system. Later magma impulses reached higher levels in the cooled upper magma chamber, where meteoric water invaded the fracture system. This produced an explosive emplacement of phreatomagmatic breccias, as seen at Mount Leyshon. Widespread sericitisation and pyrite mineralisation are common, with cavity fill, disseminated and fracturelveincontrolled gold and base metal sulphides. The Kidston and Mount Leyshon breccia complexes have hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation characteristics of the 'Lowell-Guilbert Model'. However, the argillic zone is generally not well defined. The gold travelled as chloride complexes with the hydrothermal fluids before being deposited into cavities and fractures of the breccias. Later stage epithermal deposits formed {{at the top of the}} breccia complexes that were dominantly quartz-adularia-sericite-type. The erosion, collapse and further intrusion of later porphyry phases allowed the upper parts of the breccia complexes to mix with the lower hydrothermal systems. Exploration for gold-related volcanic breccia complexes is directed at identifying hydrothermal alteration. This is followed by detailed ground studies including geological, mineralogical, petrological and geochemical work, with the idea of constructing a 'model' that can be tested with subsequent subsurface work (e. g. drilling). Geomorphology, remote sensing, geochemistry, geophysics, petrology, isotopes and fluid inclusions are recommended exploration techniques for the search of gold-bearing volcanic breccia complexes. Spectral remote sensing has especially become an important tool for the detection of hydrothermal alteration. Clay and iron minerals of the altered rock, within the breccia complexes, have distinctive spectral characteristics that can be recognisable in multispectral images from the Landsat thematic mapper. The best combination of bands, when using TM remote sensing for hydrothermally altered rock, are 3 / 5 / 7 or 4 / 5 / 7. The breccia complexes have exploration signatures represented as topographic highs, emplaced within major structural weaknesses, associated I-type granitic batholiths, early potassic alteration with overprint of sericitic alteration, and an associated radiometric high and <b>magnetic</b> low. The <b>exploration</b> for gold-bearing volcanic breccia complex deposits cannot be disregarded, because of the numerous occurrences that are now the major gold producers in north Queensland. ...|$|R
