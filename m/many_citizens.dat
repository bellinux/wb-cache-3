These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which has raised the ire of Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E

They are ambushed by Pike's former partner, Deke Thornton, who is leading a posse of bounty hunters hired and deputized by the railroad. A bloody shootout kills several of the gang. Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway, and <b>many</b> <b>citizens</b> are killed in the crossfire.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning after}} the battle, forty young noblemen from Besançon, {{suspected}} of sympathizing with the Protestant insurgents, were executed after lengthy torture sessions. Other citizens suspected of heresy would receive the same punishment—some were imprisoned; others were banished from the city, or had their money and possessions taken away. <b>Many</b> <b>citizens</b> were publicly hanged {{in front of the}} city hall. Some Protestants were hanged, beheaded, and quartered, while some others were dragged onto a publicly displayed pile of bodies. Some Protestant corpses were cut up and the pieces exposed on the city gates. Masses were held at St. Jean's Cathedral and St. Stephen's Cathedral of Besançon to celebrate the defeat of the Huguenots.|$|E
5|$|The town {{continued}} {{to expand in}} the 20th century, annexing Caversham across the River Thames in Oxfordshire in 1911. Compared to many other English towns and cities, Reading suffered little physical damage during {{either of the two}} World Wars that afflicted the 20th century, although <b>many</b> <b>citizens</b> were killed or injured in the conflicts. One significant air raid occurred on 10 February 1943, when a single Luftwaffe plane machine-gunned and bombed the town centre, resulting in 41 deaths and over 100 injuries.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, they {{experienced}} further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten {{by a small}} garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading <b>many</b> <b>citizens</b> to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was.|$|E

5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of <b>many</b> <b>citizens.</b> Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among <b>many</b> <b>citizens</b> and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution. The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in Cuautepec.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, <b>many</b> <b>citizens</b> in Kentucky fell {{deep into}} debt and began petitioning the {{legislature}} for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if the creditor would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if the creditor demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional {{in the cases of}} Williams v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky's {{school system}} was {{expanding}} rapidly, creating {{a shortage of}} qualified teachers in the state; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state-supported teacher education program at Transylvania University. The state's superintendent, John D. Matthews, lobbied for the bill, claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children's minds. The bill passed in 1856, and Transylvania University made {{the transition from a}} private institution to a state-supported university. Money raised through school taxes, previously regarded as revenue by the legislature, was diverted to support of Transylvania. Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy-five students, opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage. <b>Many</b> <b>citizens</b> felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education. Governor Morehead defended the plan, but when the legislature convened two years later, it revoked the university's funding.|$|E
5|$|The Guam National Weather Service office {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Marshall Islands shortly after Pongsona developed into {{a tropical storm}}, and a day later watches were issued for Chuuk. On December 5, the service issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Federated States of Micronesia. As Pongsona became a typhoon, the Guam National Weather Service office issued a typhoon watch for Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning about 23hours prior to the onset of tropical storm-force winds; typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of Agrihan. By one day before the typhoon moved through the Mariana Islands, JTWC predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward track than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of December 8, when forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>citizens</b> felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistent}} {{variation in}} the path of Claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall. On July 13, two days prior to Claudette's eventual landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch between Brownsville and Port O'Connor, Texas. By the next day, a hurricane warning existed from Baffin Bay to High Island, Texas, while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. When it became apparent that Louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm, the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled. In Texas, Galveston County officials recommended evacuations for western Galveston Island and Jamaica Beach, 24hours prior to Claudette's projected landfall. The Emergency Phone Notification System notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night. <b>Many</b> <b>citizens</b> heeded the evacuation suggestion, some of whom remembered the flooding from Tropical Storm Frances five years before.|$|E

The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or Molotov cocktails for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent III {{also began}} preaching {{what became the}} Fourth Crusade in 1200, {{primarily}} in France but also in England and Germany. After gathering in Venice, the Crusade was used by Doge Enrico Dandolo and Philip of Swabia to further their secular ambitions. Dandolo's aim was to expand Venice's power in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Philip intended to restore his exiled nephew, Alexios IV Angelos, along with Angelos's father, Isaac II Angelos, to the throne of Byzantium. This would require overthrowing the present ruler, Alexios III Angelos, the uncle of Alexios IV. When an insufficient number of knights arrived in Venice, the Crusaders were unable to pay the Venetians for a fleet, so they agreed to divert to Constantinople and share what could be looted as payment. As collateral, the Crusaders seized the Christian city of Zara; Innocent was appalled, and promptly excommunicated them. However, the French Crusaders eventually had their excommunications lifted. When the original purpose of the campaign was defeated by the assassination of AlexiosIV Angelos, they conquered Constantinople, not once but twice. Following upon their initial success, the Crusaders captured Constantinople again and this time sacked it, pillaging churches and killing <b>many</b> <b>citizens.</b> The Fourth Crusade never came within 1,000 miles of its objective of Jerusalem.|$|E
