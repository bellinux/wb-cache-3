This process comprises mixed culture microbial activities on the cocoa bean pulp, producing metabolites that act as important precursors for cocoa flavour development. Variations in the microbial population dynamics during the fermentation process may induce changes in the overall process. Thus, {{the introduction of a}} specific <b>microbial</b> <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> may improve the quality of the fermentation. This article discusses the effects of the addition of Saccharomyces cerevisae var. Chevalieri starter culture on cocoa bean fermentation. The dynamics in the yeast concentration, sugary pulp compounds and metabolic products were measured during fermentation. The alterations in the dynamic metabolite profile were significant, although only a slight difference was observed in the yeast population. A higher fermentation index was measured for the cocoa bean fermentation with yeast starter culture, 1. 13 compared to 0. 84. In conclusion, this method can potentially be applied to shorten the cocoa bean fermentation time...|$|E

In some industrial foodstuff fermentations, mostly in the beer brewing industry, yeast strains are used as starter cultures because of historical rather than scientific reasons. Other important industrial fermentations, such as chocolate or tea, even still occur spontaneously. In this study, we screened a wide variety of yeast strains, which are particularly suited for industrial purposes, such as the production of beer, wine, chocolate and tea. Our high throughput screening and subsequent data analysis show an enormous geno- and phenotypic diversity among different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains.

40|$|Cocoa pulp {{fermentation}} is {{a spontaneous}} process {{during which the}} natural microbiota present at cocoa farms is allowed to ferment the pulp surrounding cocoa beans. Because such spontaneous fermentations are inconsistent and contribute to product variability, there is growing interest in a <b>microbial</b> <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> {{that could be used}} to inoculate cocoa pulp fermentations. Previous studies have revealed that many different fungi are recovered from different batches of spontaneous cocoa pulp fermentations, whereas the variation in the prokaryotic microbiome is much more limited. In this study, therefore, we aimed to develop a suitable yeast starter culture that is able to outcompete wild contaminants and consistently produce high-quality chocolate. Starting from specifically selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, we developed robust hybrids with characteristics that allow them to efficiently ferment cocoa pulp, including improved temperature tolerance and fermentation capacity. We conducted several laboratory and field trials to show that these new hybrids often outperform their parental strains and are able to dominate spontaneous pilot scale fermentations, which results in much more consistent microbial profiles. Moreover, analysis of the resulting chocolate showed that some of the cocoa batches that were fermented with specific starter cultures yielded superior chocolate. Taken together, these results describe the development of robust yeast starter cultures for cocoa pulp fermentations that can contribute to improving the consistency and quality of commercial chocolate production. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{fermentation}} of the viscous pulp surrounding cocoa beans is {{a crucial}} step in chocolate production. During this process, the pulp is degraded, after which the beans are dried and shipped to factories for further processing. Despite its central role in chocolate production, pulp degradation, which {{is assumed to be}} a result of pectin breakdown, has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive physicochemical analysis of cocoa pulp, focusing on pectic polysaccharides, and the factors influencing its degradation. Detailed analysis reveals that pectin in cocoa pulp largely consists of weakly bound substances, and that both temperature and enzyme activity play a role in its degradation. Furthermore, this study shows that pulp degradation by an indigenous yeast fully relies on the presence of a single gene (PGU 1), encoding for an endopolygalacturonase. Apart from their basic scientific value, these new insights could propel the selection of <b>microbial</b> <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> for more efficient pulp degradation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Microbial</b> <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> have {{extensively}} {{been used}} to enhance the consistency and efficiency of industrial fermentations. Despite the advantages of such controlled fermentations, the fermentation involved {{in the production of}} chocolate is still a spontaneous process that relies on the natural microbiota at cocoa farms. However, recent studies indicate that certain thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures can be used as <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> for cocoa pulp fermentation. In this study, we investigate the potential of specifically developed <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> to modulate chocolate aroma. Specifically, we developed several new S. cerevisiae hybrids that combine thermotolerance and efficient cocoa pulp fermentation with a high production of volatile flavor-active esters. In addition, we investigated the potential of two strains of two non-Saccharomyces species that produce very large amounts of fruity esters (Pichia kluyveri and Cyberlindnera fabianii) to modulate chocolate aroma. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the cocoa liquor revealed an increased concentration of various flavor-active esters and a decrease in spoilage-related off-flavors in batches inoculated with S. cerevisiae <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> and, to a lesser extent, in batches inoculated with P. kluyveri and Cyb. fabianii. Additionally, GC-MS analysis of chocolate samples revealed that while most short-chain esters evaporated during conching, longer and more-fat-soluble ethyl and acetate esters, such as ethyl octanoate, phenylethyl acetate, ethyl phenylacetate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl dodecanoate, remained almost unaffected. Sensory analysis by an expert panel confirmed significant differences in the aromas of chocolates produced with different <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Together, these results show that the selection of different yeast cultures opens novel avenues for modulating chocolate flavor. status: publishe...|$|R

This is especially true in the beer industry, where brewers often use a particular yeast because of historical rather than scientific reasons. In this study, we screened a wide variety of yeast strains, which are particularly suited for industrial purposes such as beer brewing. This resulted in a large collection of industrial yeast strains (> 600), with each strain characterized to an unprecedented level of detail (genetic relatedness, fermentation characteristics, aroma production, stress resistance, flocculation, …). This high-throughput screening and subsequent data analysis show an enormous geno- and phenotypic diversity among different saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Our data allows us to rapidly select yeast strains for specific industrial purposes. Additionally, this dataset provides an excellent platform to select strains for breeding of novel yeasts with beneficial traits from both parents.

In water soluble extracts of cheese, the presence of free NH 2 groups in all ripening stages was detected, which means smaller peptides and amino acids, whose concentration significantly (P< 0. 01) increased during ripening. Cheeses produced with and without microbial culture resulted in statistically significant differences (P< 0. 01) in content amino acids free on the 90 th and 120 th day of ripening.

40|$|The {{fermentation}} {{of cocoa}} pulp, {{the first step}} in the production process of chocolate, is crucial for chocolate flavor development and pulp degradation. Despite the large annual production of cocoa beans, about 4 million tonnes per year, this fermentation process is one of the few remaining large-scale spontaneous fermentations in today’s food industry. Spontaneous cocoa pulp fermentations contain a wide variety of microorganisms, with lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and yeasts being the main players. Previous studies revealed that many different yeasts are recovered from spontaneous fermentations, whereas the variation in the prokaryotic microbiome is much more limited. Because spontaneous fermentations lead to unwanted product variability and possibly off-flavor formation, there is a growing interest in <b>microbial</b> <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> that can be used to inoculate cocoa pulp fermentations, yet with limited success. <b>Starter</b> <b>cultures</b> have been successfully applied in the production process of many foods and beverages, where they greatly increase the efficiency and reproducibility of the fermentation process and result in augmented product consistency. We therefore aimed to develop optimal yeast-based cocoa <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> able to outcompete wild contaminants, consistently produce high-quality chocolate and tune chocolate flavor. We differentiated between <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> for the production of regular (bulk) chocolate, and specialty, aromatic chocolate with distinct fruity notes. We first characterized different spontaneous cocoa pulp fermentations in the two most prominent cocoa-exporting regions to investigate and characterize the microbiota involved. We established that the spontaneous fermentations were characterized by a core and a variable microbiota. The core microbiota consisted of a prokaryotic fraction, largely unaffected by geographical location, and a region-specific yeast fraction. A recurring multi-phase yeast profile was observed, characterized by a transient dominance of fast glucose-fermenting yeasts (Hanseniaspora spp.), which are quickly outcompeted by more thermotolerant yeasts (Saccharomyces and/or Pichia spp.). In a second part, we developed yeast hybrids with an improved thermotolerance that efficiently ferment cocoa pulp, starting from specifically selected industrial and indigenous cocoa Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The aromatic hybrids that were developed for a specialty, aromatic chocolate were additionally able to produce high concentrations of fruity esters. These esters, such as isoamyl acetate, are important flavor compounds in fermented beverages, lending a pleasant, fruity aroma to the product. Several laboratory and field trials showed that the new hybrids often outperformed their parental strains and were able to dominate pilot scale fermentations, resulting in much more consistent microbial profiles. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the cocoa liquor revealed a decrease in spoilage-related off-flavors in S. cerevisiae inoculated fermentations compared to spontaneous fermentations, and a specific increase in various acetate ester concentrations for fermentations inoculated with the aromatic yeast hybrids. Analysis of the resulting chocolate by an expert and a consumer panel showed that some cocoa batches fermented with specific <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> yielded superior chocolate, indicating that these <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> can be used for commercial production. In a last part, we characterized pectin and hemicellulose cell wall polysaccharides in cocoa pulp and their role in the degradation of the pulp. It is assumed that pulp degradation is the result of pectin breakdown caused by pectinolytic yeasts, while the contribution of the hemicellulose fraction has been neglected. Therefore, we first provided a comprehensive overview of the composition of pectin and hemicellulose cell wall polysaccharides. By consequently subjecting the cocoa pulp to different physicochemical, enzymatic and microbial treatments that mimicked the changing conditions during a fermentation process, we showed that increasing temperatures, endo-polygalacturonase and xyloglucanase reduce the viscosity of cocoa pulp, thereby contributing to the desired liquefaction. Taken together, the results describe the development of optimal S. cerevisiae <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> for cocoa pulp fermentations that improve the consistency and quality of commercial chocolate production and introduce desired product diversification. This work further provides a comprehensive overview of what contributes to changing the viscosity of cocoa pulp during fermentation. status: publishe...|$|R

Therefore, it’s necessary to elucidate the stability, organization and identification of the dominant microbiota presented in the cheese. Bacteria and yeasts were subjected to culture-dependent on selective media and culture-independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and sequencing of dominant bands to assess the microbial structure and dynamics through ripening. In further studies, kefir grains were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. A total of 147 bacteria and 129 yeasts were obtained from the cheese during ripening. Lactobacillus paracasei represents the most commonly identified lactic acid bacteria isolates, with 59 of a total of 147 isolates, followed by Lactococcus lactis (29 isolates). Meanwhile, Kazachstania servazzii (51 isolates) represented the mainly identified yeast isolate, followed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (40 isolates).

40|$|Pages i-ii not in originalCharacterised by a fermentative sugar {{metabolism}} {{resulting in}} lactic acid {{as a major}} end product, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may be isolated from {{a broad range of}} sources. Dairy products, fermented vegetables, meats and baking products such as sourdough bread involve these organisms in a consistent and intentional manner in present times, no matter how accidental or fortuitous their initial involvement may have been. Alcoholic beverages such as beer, cider and, most pertinently here, wine are also affected by the presence of particular LAB. As conditions differ between nutrient environments so do the LAB found in wine differ to those isolated elsewhere - being both ethanol tolerant to the degree where growth is capable in 10 % v/v ethanol and aciduric, able to maintain an active presence at acidic levels as great as pH 4 or less. This ability to remain viable during the primary yeast fermentation of juice into wine leads to these LAB being of no small practical interest in the wine industry. The process of malolactic fermentation (MLF) involves the wine LAB altering the law materials present in the juice and wine further, increasing the intricacies of the winemaking and final product. Primarily encouraged due to its effect of reducing wine acidity, MLF also alters flavour and aroma in what is generally thought to be an advantageous manner when applied correctly. Another factor thought to be of significance is an increase in biological stability. Found, for example, among the lactobacilli, pediococci and leuconostocs, the wine LAB are classed as either homofermentative or heterofermentative. Homofermenters commonly produce two moles of lactic acid per mole of glucose fermented, while heterofermenters form one mole each of lactic acid and carbon dioxide and varied quantities of ethanol and acetic acid from one mole of glucose. Natural or chance occurrences of wine LAB, whether as part of the microbiological community on the raw materials or from other sources - such as inoculation from contaminated equipment - were the original manner in which these organisms were introduced into the vinification equation. With the predilection towards quality control, standardisation and safety in the present day, the use of pure <b>microbial</b> <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> to initiate MLF has become increasingly widespread. In order to optimise the manipulation of wine LAB in both the laboratory and industry a thorough insight into their physiology and metabolism is an obvious necessity. Certain areas of interest have undergone more intensive study than others, with, for example, the catabolism of carbohydrates in both wine (Davis et al., 1986) and model wine systems (Liu et al., 1995 a) having had a considerable amount of research compared to less primary sources of energy such as nitrogen metabolism...|$|R

Yoghurts have pH values between 3. 95 - 4. 23, viable S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus numbers were determined between 10 - 10 cfu/g for yoghurts producing with <b>starter</b> <b>culture,</b> 10 - 107 8 5 6 cfu/g and 10 - 10 cfu/g for yoghurts producing with traditional methods, respectively. Coliforms, E. coli, yeast 6 7 and mould counts have at low numbers for all yoghurt samples. As the result, yoghurts which are produced by <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> have high numbers of yoghurt bacteria means that yoghurts produced by using <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> have higher therapeutic and/or antimicrobial properties beside of their organoleptic characteristics. Importance of yoghurt production by using <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> should be known and advantages of using <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> in fermentation products should be stated...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of the use of selected lactic acid bacteria <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> of dairy origin in the production of nitrite-free low-acid fermented venison (Dama dama) sausage (Salame di daino) produced in a small-scale plant in Umbria (Italy), and their effect on microbiological, physico-chemical and sensorial properties of the products. Salame di daino was obtained with two different processes: with and without the addition of selected LAB <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> <b>Microbial</b> counts of safety indicators were lower in salami made with the addition of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Pathogens after the first week of ripening were only detected from salami made without the addition of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures.</b> Control salami were paler and harder, whereas those made with the addition of <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> slightly saltier, juicier and in general more acceptable.

40|$|Control of {{activity}} and functionality of <b>microbial</b> <b>starter</b> and probiotic <b>cultures</b> under industrial fermentation conditions {{is essential in}} order to provide a tasty, appealing, healthy, and safe product. Oxidative stress is one of the harsh conditions that fermentative microbes have managed to endure during their use in industrial fermentation processes. A widely-used lactic acid bacterium in food fermentations is Lactobacillus plantarum. Hence, understanding oxidative stress response in this micro-organism can be used for engineering robustness towards oxidative stress. There are two systems known to be involved in oxidative stress response and redox homeostasis in bacteria: the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems. In this study, we constructed a set of L. plantarum WCFS 1 strains with alterations in these systems. Using the constructed strains under different oxidative stress conditions (hydrogen peroxide, diamide (thiol-stress), aerobic growth, and respiratory growth), global transcriptome analysis was performed. Subsequently, the functional role of the thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin system was analyzed and validated using a number of different techniques including comparative genomics, enzyme assays, and q-PCR. The main results obtained in this study include the role of the thioredoxin system in oxidative stress response in L. plantarum as well as in adaptation to aerobic cultivation; characterization and overlap of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin system in this bacterium; insight into transcriptome regulation of oxidative stress response, and unravelling of stress-response networks present in L. plantarum WCFS 1. The comparative genomics and global transcriptome analysis of the oxidative stress response of L. plantarum WCFS 1 presented in this thesis can be used for optimization of the performance of lactic acid bacteria in industrial fermentations...|$|R

40|$|Generation of biogas by a {{combination}} of four substrates of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), cassava (Manihot esculentum) peels, poultry droppings and cow dung was investigated using anaerobic digester and gasometric chamber to determine the level of production. Total viable bacterial counts in the combination were 7. 86 X 107, 5. 45 X 105 cfuml- 1 before and after digestion respectively while fungal counts were 2. 45 x 102, 3. 35 X 104 cfuml- 1 before and after digestion respectively. The combination of the four substrates, yielded biogas of 815 mls, 875 ml and 1340 mls from respective weights of 1 kg, 2 kg and 3 kg within 15 days without <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> while with <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> biogas yield within 15 days was 840 mls 1170 mls and 1690 mls from the 1 kg, 2 kg and 3 kg weights respectively. Total biogas yield obtained without <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> was 4355 mls, 5325 mls and 6700 mls from the 1 kg, 2 kg and 3 kg weights respectively and 4865 mls, 5935 mls and 7822 mls within 45 days with <b>starter</b> <b>culture.</b> Results, show that biogas volume vary significantly, [F(2, 16) = 14. 93, P < 0. 001] with and [F(2, 16) = 19. 42, P < 0. 001] without <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> at the 1 % level of significance due to weights.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> (Lactobacillus sakei KM 5474 and Lactobacillus plantarum KM 1450) on the accumulation of biogenic amines (BAs) in Thai traditional fermented fish sausage. BAs formation (cadaverine, putrescine, histamine, tryptamine, phenylethylamine, and tyramine) was significantly higher in som-fug fermentation without <b>starter</b> <b>culture.</b> Accumulation of these BAs in som-fug could reduce significantly by the incubation with of L.  sakei KM 5474 and L.  plantarum KM 1450. The influence {{of the availability of}} free amino acids (FAAs) on BA formation during the fermentation of som-fug with and without <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> was also investigated. The significant differences in the amount of some FAAs among batches would be partially attributed to the distinct proteolytic and BAs accumulation of specific microbiota of each batch. In general, amounts of FAA were related with their corresponding BAs. In batch control of the availability of practically all FAA precursors, BA formation could be observed. The formation of some BAs (histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, and phenylethylamine) occurring in batch control was related to the amounts of FAA precursors (histidine, arginine, lysine, and phenylalanine). <b>Starter</b> <b>culture</b> L.  plantarum KM 1450 was more efficient in reducing BA accumulation in som-fug than that of <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> L.  sakei KM 5474, while mixed <b>starter</b> <b>cultures</b> of L.  sakei KM 5474 and L.  plantarum KM 1450 showed the highest effectiveness in reducing BA accumulation during som-fug fermentation compared with the sample sausage without <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> or with monostarter culture...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} consumer demand for dairy products which are safe and free from additives. <b>Microbial</b> <b>starter</b> strains, {{in combination with other}} factors, were studied for their contribution to the control of unwanted microbes, and maintaining the quality of soft cheese. The technological and functional characteristics of the <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> strains Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and probiotic bacterial strains Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB 12, Lactobacillus acidophilus LA- 5 and Lactobacillus casei Shirota were investigated. The tests included the milk fermentation, resistance to salt and heat, bile and acid resistance, and growth at a range of temperatures. The probiotic strains differed in their resistance to salt, bile salts and acid. Inhibitory interactions between probiotic bacterial strains {{with each other and with}} <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> strains were not detected. The probiotic bacteria and <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> strains used have an ability to grow together on homofermentative and heterofermentative differential agar and fermentation of fructose in different levels. Non-starter cheese (NSC), cheese with starter strains (SCS), and cheese with starter and probiotic strains (PSC) were manufactured. The levels of mesophilic aerobic and lactic acid bacteria, moulds and yeasts, and Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated in all cheeses. Their contents of fat, total solids, salt and pH value were tested during 21 days of storage at 2 - 5 °C. <b>Starter</b> <b>culture</b> strains contributed to maintaining the quality of all cheeses, through decreasing the viable count of some undesirable microbes. Cheeses differed in the intensity of the crumbliness attribute, and in preference and intensity of colour attribute. The colour of starter soft cheese, which was tested using a colorimeter, was closer to the colour of probiotic soft cheese than those cheeses which were manufactured without <b>starter</b> <b>culture.</b> The <b>microbial</b> status, storage conditions, rancidity, and the sensory characteristics of unripened soft cheese, which was manufactured with <b>starter</b> <b>culture</b> strains only, were determined during the storage for 50 days at 2 - 5 °C, as well as during their shelf life for the product. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) contributed to slowing the growth of unwanted microbes, and decreased the values of TBA, TVB-N and TMA in soft cheese. Consequently, delaying the undesirable changes and maintaining the quality of the product and extending its shelf life, when compared with vacuum, brine, and air packaging methods, under the same storage conditions. Potential effects of inulin on the cheese quality and sensory characteristics of probiotic soft cheese were investigated. The cheeses differed in their loads of lactic acid bacteria, in addition to the total solids and water activity. The levels of probiotic bacterial strains were higher in probiotic soft cheese that manufactured with inulin than in cheese without inulin, with a potential in the formation synbiotic between the probiotic strains LA- 5 and BB 12 and inulin. Both cheeses were recorded to have high acceptance in the cheese attributes, in terms of appearance, aroma, colour texture and the overall acceptance. The presence of inulin increased the hardness of cheese under vacuum packaging, after storage for 14 days at 2 - 5 °C. Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Ira...|$|R
