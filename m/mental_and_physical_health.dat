As of 2006 he was in good <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health,</b> {{displayed}} by his ability to quickly recite the alphabet backwards, spell out his name in Morse Code, and take daily walks with his wife to keep in shape. At the age of 100 he wrote an autobiography titled Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock. It was distributed only to family and friends.|$|E

5|$|The New Thought movement, {{which emerged}} in the 1880s, was {{responsible}} for popularizing belief {{in the power of}} the mind to achieve prosperity. While initially focused on achieving <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health,</b> New Thought teachers such as Charles Fillmore made material success a major emphasis of the movement. By the 20th century, New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture, being common features of both self-help literature and popular psychology.|$|E

5|$|The Government of Finland held {{a crisis}} meeting, and {{declared}} a national day of mourning for September 24, with ministers agreeing that Finland's laws pertaining to gun ownership should be reviewed. Suggestions included introducing legislation to aid {{police officers in}} accessing information about the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> of applicants for firearms licenses, {{and the right to}} request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. The question whether or not private persons should be allowed to own handguns was also raised.|$|E
5|$|When Tennyson {{heard on}} 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, {{he was living}} in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped {{quarters}} with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends were becoming increasingly concerned about his <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam.|$|E
5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, {{and the right to}} request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that caregiver health affects patient health. Consistent with the Biopsychosocial Model, mental health (anxiety, depression, satisfaction with life, self-esteem), <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> (bodily pain, general <b>health,</b> performance in <b>physical</b> role, <b>physical</b> functioning), burden, <b>and</b> social support {{were examined in}} the present study to understand the relations between these variables and the overall health of 81 caregivers of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in Mexico. The relation between <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> was significant. Canonical correlations revealed that depression and general health emerged as primary variables and these were entered into a series of analyses with burden and social support as potential moderating variables. No significant moderations were detected. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed significant relations between demographic <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> variables, <b>and</b> three <b>mental</b> health outcomes: anxiety, depression, and self-esteem.

25|$|Governments now {{recognize}} {{the benefits of}} walking for <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> and are actively encouraging it. This growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously. In the UK, a Department of Transport report found that between 1995/97 and 2005 {{the average number of}} walk trips per person fell by 16%, from 292 to 245 per year. Many professionals in local authorities and the NHS are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them. Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design.|$|E

25|$|On November 2, Snuka {{pleaded not}} guilty before Judge Kelly Banach. A hearing to {{determine}} Snuka's competency for trial began in May 2016.

Prosecutors countered by showing a tape of Snuka performing wrestling moves at a May 2015 match. On June 1, 2016, Judge Banach ruled that Snuka was not mentally competent to stand trial for the murder and that a new hearing would be held six months later to re-evaluate his competency, though his attorneys maintained that his condition wouldn't improve over time. Judge Kelly Banach dismissed the charges on January 3, 2017, deeming Snuka not mentally fit to stand trial.|$|E
25|$|Chapter XIV {{is about}} the Sokol (Falcon) Society, founded in Prague in 1862 by Jindřich Fügner and Miroslav Tyrš. The goal of the Sokol Society was to revive and enhance the {{national}} awareness and promote <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> of the Czech people through sports and moral education. The idea soon gained a pan-Slavic character, and Sokol organizations were later established in Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. The Sokol movement had full support from Strossmayer, then Bishop of Đakovo. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary {{and the establishment of}} the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, Croatian Sokol societies were united with Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{few more}} settings, {{completing}} {{the first half of}} the Italienisches Liederbuch, were composed in 1891 before Wolf's <b>mental</b> <b>and</b> <b>physical</b> <b>health</b> once again took a downturn at the end of the year; exhaustion from his prolific past few years combined with the effects of syphilis and his depressive temperament caused him to stop composing for the next several years. Continuing concerts of his works in Austria and Germany spread his growing fame; even Brahms and the critics who had previously reviled Wolf gave favorable reviews. However, Wolf was consumed with depression, which stopped him from writing—which only left him more depressed. He completed orchestrations of previous works, but new compositions were not forthcoming, and certainly not the opera which he was now fixated on composing, still convinced that success in the larger forms was the mark of compositional greatness.|$|E
