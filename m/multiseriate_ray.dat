In spite of the similarity in the qualitative traits, according to statistical analysis, tangential vessel diameter, radial vessel diameter, vessel frequency, vessel wall thickness, <b>multiseriate</b> <b>ray</b> width, fibre length, fibre diameter, and fibre wall thickness showed statistically {{significant differences in the}} stem and branch wood of taxon examined. Fibre length and vessel element length in branch wood is about 16 % and 3 % shorter respectively. In addition, vessel frequency in the branch wood is about 52 % higher.

40|$|Provenance {{tests can}} provide {{information}} about the silvicultural behavior and wood quality for the exploration of variability and conservation of genetic material for future use. This study aims to investigate the effect of provenances on some wood properties of the Cariniana legalis. Seedlings of three provenances (Porto Ferreira, Piracicaba and Campinas) were planted in Luiz Antonio-SP using randomized block design with six replicates. After 26 years of planting, eighteen trees, six of each provenance, were felled. The properties studied were basic density and the cellular dimensions. The results revealed that the basic density, fiber length, fiber wall thickness, vessel element length, vessel diameter, uniseriate ray height and width were influenced by the provenances. A good positive relationship was found among the fiber length, fiber wall thickness, vessel element length; vessel diameter and <b>multiseriate</b> <b>ray</b> height with radial position and a negative relation between vessel frequency with the radial position...|$|E

In order to develop a sirnple method for histological identification of Glycyrrhizae Radix, a comparative anatomical study and TLC analysis were carried out on the roots and rhizomes of G. uralensis, G. glabra, G. inflata, G. eurycarpa, G. aspera, G. yunnanensis, G. pallithflola and Sophora alopecuroides. As a result, eight species could be distinguished from one another by distinct characteristics such as height and width of <b>multiseriate</b> <b>ray,</b> the amount of xylem fiber, the arrangement of phloem fiber bands, the ratio of xylem to root/rhizome in diameter, etc. and TLC pattern.

40|$|The wood {{structure}} of 78 species from 27 genera representing the woody primuloids (Maesaceae, Myrsinaceae, and Theophrastaceae) was investigated using light microscopy (LM) and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Results indicated that the ray structure, the nature of mineral inclusions, and the occurrence of breakdown areas in rays {{can be used to}} separate the three primuloid families from each other. Within Ericales, the presence of exclusively <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> is synapomorphic for Myrsinaceae and Theophrastaceae, and the occurrence of breakdown areas in rays is synapomorphic for Myrsinaceae. Within Myrsinaceae, the wood {{structure of}} the mangrove genus Aegiceras differs because it has short vessel elements that are storied, non-septate fibers, a combination of low uni- and <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> with exclusively procumbent body ray cells. The aberrant wood anatomy of Coris and Lyshimachia can be explained by their secondary woodiness. Within Theophrastaceae, Clamp and Theophrasta can be distinguished from Bonellia, jacquinia, and Deherainia. The recent division of Jacquinia s. l. into Jacquinia s. s. and Bonellia is supported by a difference in mineral inclusions. status: publishe...|$|R

This {{study focused on}} finding phylogenetically informative characters to help elucidate any obscure evolutionary patterns within the family. The earliest diverging subfamily Napoleonaeoideae has mixed simple/scalariform vessel perforations, scalariform vessel-ray pitting, and high <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> all features that are also present in Scytopetaloideae. The wood {{structure of}} Napoleonaea is distinct, but its supposed close relative Crateranthus strongly resembles Scytopetaloideae. The isolated position of Foetidia (Foetidioideae) can be supported by a unique type of vessel-ray pitting that is similar in shape and size to intervessel pitting (distinctly bordered,, 5 lm). The more derived Planchonioideae and Lecythidoideae share exclusively simple perforations and two types of vessel-ray pitting, but they can easily be distinguished from each other {{by the size of}} intervessel pitting, shape of body <b>ray</b> cells in <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and the type of crystalliferous axial parenchyma cells. The anatomical diversity observed is clearly correlated with differences in plant size (shrubs vs. tall trees) : the percentage of scalariform perforations, as well as vessel density, and the length of vessel elements, fibers, and <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> are negatively correlated with increasing plant size, while the reverse is true for vessel diameter. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomical}} structure of 11 out of 13 genera from four tribes of the Vaccinioideae, namely Andromedeae s. s., Gaultherieae, Lyonieae and Oxydendreae (Ericaceae s. l.), is described using light and scanning electron microscopy. Several {{features of the}} secondary xylem support the tribal classification based on molecular data: arrangement of vessel-ray pitting, height of <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> and {{the shape of the}} body ray cells. Oxydendreae are clearly defined from the other representatives by various wood anatomical features. Gaultherieae can be distinguished from Lyonieae by differences in vessel perforation plates, vessel-ray pitting, height and structure of <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> and occurrence of prismatic crystals, but the wood of Andromedeae s. s. is similar to Gaultherieae. Moreover, Andromedeae s. s., Oxydendreae and Vaccinieae are characterized by their pith structure, whereas considerable variation in the pith cells is found in Lyonieae and Gaultherieae.

40|$|Wood {{samples of}} 111 Vaccinieae {{specimens}} (Vacciioideae, Ericaceae s. l.) representing 98 species and 26 genera are investigated with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The wood structure of Vaccinieae delivers taxonomically important characters {{that can be}} used to define some subclades within the tribe. The wood of the large polyphyletic genus Vaccinium strongly resembles non-vaccinioid members of the family, which are characterized by bordered vessel-ray pits and relatively narrow (2 - to 4 -seriate) and low <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> (often less than 1000 mum) with exclusively or mainly procumbent body ray cells. The East Malesian clade, Meso-American/Caribbean clade, and the Andean clade show a combination of wood anatomical features that is lacking in other representatives of the family. These features include scalariform vessel-ray pits with strongly reduced borders, a high portion of upright body ray cells, wide (4 - to 14 -seriate) and high <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> (often more than 3000 mum), and prismatic crystals in chambered ray cells (although absent in Symphysia racemosa). The presence of secretory ducts in the primary xylem and in the pith tissue may represent a synapomorphy for the Andean clade. Furthermore, the presence of undivided axial parenchyma cells, usually ranging from 500 to 900 mum, seems to be unique in the subfamily. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Wood of Bruniaceae is very {{primitive}} {{according to}} widelyaccepted criteria. Vessels are relatively long, with scalariform perforation plates having numerous bars, fully or vestigially bordered. Many aberrations in disposition of bars and perforations in perforation plates are present, and no species has exclusively normal perforation plates. Lateral wall pitting of vessels, both intervascular and between vessels and rays, is scalariform to opposite. Vessels are solitary or nearly so, angular to round in transection. Helical thickenings {{are present in}} vessels of only a single species. All imperforate elements are thick-walled tracheids, some with gelatinous walls. Tracheids are only slightly longer (in two instances shorter) than the vessel elements they accompany in any given species. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with very slight tendencies toward aggregates or vasicentric scanty. Rays are heterocellular, with a predominance of upright cells, or upright cells exclusively in species with very narrow <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays.</b> <b>Multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> vary from biseriate {{to an average of}} more than five cells in width, according to species. Uniseriate wings are present on at least some <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> in all species. Borders are frequently present on the tangential walls of ray cells, which tend to be thick. U niseriate and <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> are present in all species. Growth rings vary from absent to conspicuous, the latter mostly in montane species. Inconspicuous growth rings feature narrow vessels or narrow tracheids in latewood. More pronounced growth rings have more numerous as well as wider vessels in earlywood; vessels may be absent or nearly so in latewood, which would thus constitute an all-tracheid band produced annually. Crystals are present in rays of most species, sometimes chambered in subdivided ray cells. A few species have crystals in chambered axial parenchyma cells. Droplets or massive deposits of amorphous dark-staining compounds are present in all species. Woods of Bruniaceae are exemplary, considering their primitiveness, for adaptation to xeromorphy, based on current concepts of wood xeromorphy. Vessels are notably narrow or numerous per mm 2 of transection, or both. The nature of growth rings and of perforation plate modifications are suggestive of xeromorphy. Although species of moister habitats do have quantitatively more mesomorphic wood features, the span within Bruniaceae is not great, suggesting that wood of the family as a whole is adapted to extremes of water stress in accordance with the dry, hot summers, high incidence of wind, and porous sandstone soils of Cape Province, South Africa. Lignotubers have woods more parenchymatous and mesomorphic than wood of stems in the lignotuber- bearing species. Wood of stems does not differ appreciably from that of roots. Bruniaceous woods are most closely comparable to those of Geissolomataceae and Grubbiaceae, although other 2 ̆ 2 rosoid 2 ̆ 2 families have similar woods.

40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} 14 species of Clematis and one species each of Delphinium, Helleborus, Thalictrum, and Xanthorhiza (Ranunculaceae) is {{compared}} to that of Glaucidium palma tum (Glaucidiaceae) and Hydrastis canadensis (Ranunculaceae, or Hydrastidaceae of some authors). Clematis wood has features typical of wood of vines and lianas: wide (earlywood) vessels, abundant axial parenchyma (earlywood, some species), high vessel density, low proportion of fibrous tissue in wood, wide rays composed of thin-walled cells, and abrupt origin of <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays.</b> Superimposed on these features are expressions indicative of xeromorphy in the species of cold or dry areas: numerous narrow latewood vessels, presence of vasicentric tracheids, shorter vessel elements, and strongly marked growth rings. Wood of Xanthorhiza is like that of a (small) shrub. Wood of Delphinium, Helleborus, and Thalictrum is characteristic of herbs that become woodier: limited amounts of secondary xylem, parenchymatization of wood, partial conversion of ray areas to libriform fibers (partial raylessness). Wood of Ranunculaceae other than Clematis has numerous narrow vessels, probably an adaptation to cold more than drought. Glaucidium has occasional scalariform perforation plates like those almost universally present in Paeonia, but the two genera differ strongly in other wood features. Wood of Hydrastis (scalariform perforation plates occasional in primary xylem, rare in secondary xylem) accords with the idea that Hydrastis is a lineage that separated from the base of Ranunculaceae. Features that ally Ranunculaceae with other families of Ranunculiflorae include presence of wide <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> (without accompanying uniseriate rays), vessel restriction patterns, and storied structure.

The narrow rays in Pelliciera are characteristic of this genus, but a broader concept of Tetrameristaceae including Pelliciera is favored. Within Marcgraviaceae, wide rays (more than five-seriate) are typical of the genus Marcgravia. Furthermore, there is evidence that the impact of altitude and habit {{plays an important role in}} the wood structure of this family. The wood structure of Balsaminaceae cannot be compared systematically with other balsaminoids because of their secondary woodiness.

Based on LM and SEM observations of 56 Apocynoideae species — representing all currently recognized tribes — and eight Periplocoideae, we found striking differences in vessel grouping patterns (radial multiples vs. large clusters) between the mainly nonclimbing apocynoid tribes (Wrightieae, Malouetieae, Nerieae) and the climbing lineages (remaining Apocynoideae and Periplocoideae). The presence of large vessel clusters in combination with fibers in the ground tissue characterizing the climbing Apocynoideae and Periplocoideae clearly contrasts with the climbing anatomy of the rauvolfi oids (solitary vessels plus tracheids in ground tissue), supporting the view that (1) the climbing habit has evolved more than once in Apocynaceae, (2) the three nonclimbing apocynoid tribes are basal compared to the climbing apocynoids, and (3) Periplocoideae belong to the crown clade.

Wood data support separation of Rennelia and Prismatomeris from Morindeae s. str.; vessels in both genera are exclusively solitary and axial parenchyma is always diffuse to diffuse-in-aggregates. Damnacanthus differs from the Morindeae alliance by the occurrence of septate fibres, absence of axial parenchyma, and the occasional presence of fibre wall thickenings. There are interesting similarities between members of the Lasianfhus clade and the Pauridiantheae/Urophyleae group such as the sporadic occurrence of spiral thickenings in axial parenchyma cells...|$|R
40|$|Stems of Ipomoea obscura Ker Gawl., {{increase}} in thickness by forming multiple rings of cambia. Stems 5 - 6 mm thick produce parenchymatous derivatives which divide repeatedly to form small arcs of cambium. Several such small arcs initiate simultaneously {{and form a}} ring of small cambial arcs. After {{the formation of a}} few xylem and phloem elements, all these arcs are interconnected by transdifferentiation of parenchyma cells present between the cambial arcs and constitute a complete cambial cylinder. This newly formed cambium is functionally bidirectional: earlier- formed arcs produce xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally, while later-formed segments exclusively produce thin-walled parenchyma cells on either side. Young stems are circular in cross section but as stem thickness increases they become oval to elliptic or lobed and dumbbell-shaped. Xylem rays are mostly uni- or biseriate and thin-walled, but <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> characteristic for a climbing habit are observed occasionally. In thick stems, the marginal ray parenchyma in most of the samples becomes meristematic and develops ray cambia which exclusively produce sieve elements. Similarly, parenchyma cells produced from later-formed cambial segments give rise to several irregularly oriented vascular bundles. The secondary xylem is diffuse porous, with indistinct growth rings and is composed of fibriform and wider vessels, fibres, and axial and ray parenchyma cells, while phloem consists of sieve elements, companion cells, and axial and ray parenchyma cells...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the formation of successive rings of cambia in Rivea hypocriteriformis Choisy (Convolvulaceae). The mature stem is composed of four to five rings of xylem alternating with phloem. Successive cambia originate as smaller and larger segments; union and anastomosing of small cambial segments often leads {{to the formation of}} discontinuous rings. In the initial stage of growth, several vascular bundles interconnect to form the first ring of vascular cambium. The cambium remains functional for one complete season and becomes dormant during summer; a new ring of cambium is completed prior to the subsequent monsoon season and sprouting of new leaves. Successive cambia are initiated from the pericyclic parenchyma situated three to four cell layers outside of the protophloem. Functionally, all the successive cambia are bidirectional and produce secondary xylem centripetally and phloem centrifugally. The secondary xylem is diffuse-porous, with indistinct growth rings and consisting of wide fibriform vessels, fibre tracheids, and axial and ray parenchyma cells. The xylem rays are uni- to multiseriate and heterocellular. The <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> contain lignified marginal ray cells and thin-walled, unlignified central cells. The central ray cells also show accumulations of starch and druses. Discrete strands of intraxylary phloem occur at the periphery of the pith, and additional intraxylary phloem develops from adjacent cells as secondary growth progresses. Earlier-formed phloem shows heavy accumulation of callose, followed by its compaction. The development of successive cambia is correlated with extension growth and with the phenology of the plant...|$|R
40|$|Premise of the study: A large {{range of}} growth forms is a notable aspect of {{angiosperm}} diversity and arguably {{a key element}} of their success. However, few studies within a phylogenetic context have explored how anatomical, developmental, and biomechanical traits are linked with growth form evolution. Aristolochia (similar to 500 species) consists predominantly of climbers, but a handful of shrub-like species are known from Aristolochia subgenus Isotrema (hereafter, shortened to Isotrema). We test hypotheses proposing that the establishment of functional traits linked to lianescence might limit the ability to evolve structurally diverse growth forms, particularly self-supporting forms. Methods: We focus on the origin of the shrub habit in Isotrema, from which we sampled representatives from climbing to self-supporting forms. Morphological, anatomical, and biomechanical characters are optimized on a chloroplast- and nuclear-derived phylogeny. Key results: Character-state reconstructions revealed that the climbing habit is plesiomorphic in Isotrema and shrub-like forms are derived from climbers. However, shrubs do not constitute a monophyletic group. Both shrubs and climbers show large <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays,</b> but differ in terms of vessel size and proportion of fibers and soft tissues. Conclusion: We suggest that while shrub-like species might have partly escaped from the constraints of life as lianas; their height size and stability are not typical of self-supporting shrubs and trees. Shrubs retained lianoid stem characters that are known to promote flexibility such as ray parenchyma. The transitions to a shrub-like form likely involved relatively simple, developmental changes that may be attributed to heterochronic processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} wood anatomy of 29 species {{belonging}} to 10 genera {{of the tribe}} Detarieae, subfam-ily Caesalpinioideae and compare them with tribe Caesalpinieae. Detarieae is the largest of four tribes of Caesalpinioideae, with 84 genera, only eleven occur in Venezuela with species of timber importance. The speci-mens were collected in Venezuela and include wood samples {{from the collection of}} the Laboratorio de Anatomía de Maderas de la Facultad de Ciencias Forestales y Ambientales de la Universidad de Los Andes, Venezuela, and of the Forest Products Laboratory of the USDA Forest Service in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The terminol-ogy and methodology used followed the iAWA List of Microscopic Features for Hardwood identification of the iAWA Committee, 1989. Measurements from each specimen were averaged (vessel diameters, vessel element lengths, intervessels pit size, fibre lengths and ray height). The species of Detarieae can be separated using a combination of diagnostic features. Wood characters that provide the most important diagnosis and may be used in systematics of Detarieae include: intercellular axial canals, rays heterocellular, rays exclusively or predomi-nantly uniseriate, prismatic crystals common in ray cells, irregular storied structure and fibre wall thickness. For comparative anatomy between Detarieae and Caesalpinieae: intercellular axial canals, heterocellular rays, rays exclusively or predominantly uniseriate, prismatic crystals common in ray cells (in Detarieae) and regular storied structure, fibres septate, fibre wall thick or very thick, <b>rays</b> homocellular, <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> and silic...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} ten species in five genera of the Cape Province (South Africa) family Stilbaceae is {{reported}} in {{quantitative and qualitative}} terms. Wood anatomy for stem, root, and lignotuber is reported for the monotypic Cape genus Retzia. Stilbaceae and Retziaceae are alike in wood anatomy but differ from Verbenaceae by having scalariform perforation plates with few and wide-bordered bars (simple plates and modified scalariform plates are also present); vessel elements clearly fibriform in shape; very scarce axial parenchyma; and long uniseriate wings on <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays.</b> When added to endosperm presence and ericoid habit, these features may serve to segregate Stilbaceae from Verbenaceae. The wood of Stilbaceae is xeromorphic in having very narrow vessels, numerous vessels per mm 2, and pores grouped into radial multiples. The least xeromorphic wood within Stilbaceae is found in species from relatively moist montane localities; these species also have scalariform perforation plates in vessels. The most xeromorphic wood occurs in those Stilbaceae restricted to lowlands or lowlands plus dry montane sites. Scalariform perforation plates are interpreted {{as an indicator of}} primitiveness in Stilbaceae and Retziaceae, an interpretation reinforced by presence of borders on pits of imperforate tracheary elements in Eurylobium serrulatum (all other Stilbaceae have libriform fibers with simple pits). The rock-crevice species Stilbe rupestris has caudex wood specialized for storage, stem wood adapted for mechanical strength. Species characters appear to be related to ecology, but sampling is inadequate for establishment of many features as systematic indicators. Wood anatomy confirms close relationship between Stilbaceae and Retziaceae, and union of the families is endorsed...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} features are reported for stem wood of 13 collections of 12 {{species of the}} Hawaiian genus Dubautia. Although the species share a basic wood plan, quantitative expressions range widely, especially with respect to vessel element dimensions, vessel density, vessel grouping, length of libriform fibers, and dimensions of <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays.</b> Ecology and habit explain most of the diversity. Variations in the ratio between vessel element length and libriform fiber length are correlated with habit both within Dubautia and when Dubautia is compared with Argyroxiphium and Wilkesia. Other variation in wood is related mostly to ecology. The Dubautia species of wet forest have high mesomorphy ratio values. Low mesomorphy ratio values occur in species of recent or dry lava (e. g., D. scabra) or dry alpine areas (D. menziesii); mesomorphy ratio values in the xeric species are comparable with those in Argyroxiphium. Highly xeromorphic wood in the bog species D. waialealae may reflect recent immigration from a dry habitat or peculiar features of the bog habitat. The lianoid D. latifolia has notably xeromorphic wood, which may reflect recent entry into wet forest or else the tendency for lianas in general to have xeromorphic features that confer conductive safety. All species of Dubautia show fiber dimorphism. Dubautia is a superb example of adaptive radiation, {{in contrast to the}} Hawaiian Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae), which has shifted into various habitats with little change in wood anatomy, or the Galapagos genus Scalesia, all species of which must survive periods of drought and have xeromorphic wood...|$|R
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} 16 of the 37 genera within the epacrids (Styphelioideae, Ericaceae s. l.) is {{investigated}} by light and scanning electron microscopy. Several {{features in the}} secondary xylem occur consistently at the tribal level: arrangement of vessel-ray pits, distribution of axial parenchyma, ray width, and the presence and location of crystals. The primitive nature of Prionoteae and Archerieae {{is supported by the}} presence of scalariform perforation plates with many bars and scalariform to opposite vessel pitting. The wood structure of Oligarrheneae {{is similar to that of}} Styphelieae, but the very narrow vessel elements, exclusively uniseriate rays and the lack of prismatic crystals in Oligarrheneae distinguish these two tribes. The secondary xylem of Monotoca tamariscina indicates that it does not fit in Styphelieae; a position within Oligarrheneae is possible. Like most Cosmelieae, all Richeeae are characterized by exclusively scalariform perforation plates with many bars, a very high vessel density and paratracheal parenchyma, although they clearly differ in ray width (exclusively uniseriate rays in Cosmelieae vs. uniseriate and wide <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> in Richeeae). Several wood anatomical features confirm the inclusion of epacrids in Ericaceae s. l. Furthermore, there are significant ecological implications. The small vessel diameter and high vessel frequency in many epacrids are indicative of a high conductive safety to avoid embolism caused by freeze-thaw cycles, while the replacement of scalariform by simple vessel perforation plates and an increase in vessel diameter would suggest an increased conductive efficiency, which is especially found in mesic temperate or tropical Styphelieae.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for woods of 37 species representing 11 genera; most species included represent a maximal degree of woodiness for the family, and herbaceous groups are mostly omitted. Growth rings are absent or nearly so. Vessel elements have simple perforation plates (except for Kohleria elegans) and alternate circular or oval pits {{of various sizes}} on vessel-vessel walls (often laterally elongate, often with gaping apertures, on vessel-parenchyma and vessel-septate fiber interfaces). Grooves interconnect pit apertures in vessels of four genera. Vessels are grouped, usually in radial chains, to a moderate extent. Tyloses are present. Imperforate tracheary elements are libriform fibers or (Coronanthera) fiber tracheids with vestigial borders on pits. Septa are present in imperforate tracheary elements of most species, but in most species of Cyrtandra, septate fibers occur only near vessels. Uniseriate rays are present in some species, but in most species rays are muItiseriate only or are absent altogether. Vascular and vasicentric tracheids are absent. In Cyrtandra, wood with <b>multiseriate</b> <b>rays</b> can be demonstrated to be rayless earlier in ontogeny. Crystals are present in rays and in septate fibers of a few species. Storying is present in a few species. All features of wood reflect the mesic habitats characteristic of Gesneriaceae, but moderate degrees of xeromorphy are illustrated by species in which narrow vessels, grouped vessels, and grooves in vessel walls occur. The wood anatomy of Drymonia reflects its vining habit. Raylessness may indicate secondary woodiness in Besleria and Cyrtandra. Wood anatomy of Gesneriaceae is consonant with a hypothesis that the family {{is closely related to}} Acanthaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and other families of Scrophulariales...|$|R
