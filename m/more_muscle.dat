5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
25|$|Andy: Andy is {{very sweet}} and kind. He is always being {{made fun of}} by Quinn and Vange for having <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> than brains. He lives on a farm with his family. He often works there before and after school. Andy is closest to Megan.|$|E

50|$|Standardbreds {{tend to be}} <b>more</b> <b>muscled</b> {{and longer}} bodied than the Thoroughbred. They also are of more placid dispositions, as suits horses whose races involve more {{strategy}} and more changes of speed than do Thoroughbred races. Standardbreds are considered people-oriented, easy-to-train horses.|$|R
25|$|Respiration rate {{also appears}} to be {{influenced}} significantly by caste. Males show a considerably higher rate of respiration than females and workers, due, in part, to their capability for flight and higher muscle mass. In general, males have <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> and less fat, resulting in a higher metabolic O2 demand.|$|E
25|$|It {{usually takes}} me {{an hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx {{against the back of the}} chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
500|$|Compared {{with normal}} breeds of beef cattle, North American Piedmontese cattle are more {{proficient}} in converting feed into lean muscle. They also produce {{a higher percentage}} of the most desirable cuts of meat. They average 20% <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> with less bone and fat. Research indicates that there is less connective tissue within the muscle of [...] "double-muscled" [...] cattle; this would imply less background toughness and therefore more tender meat.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{the sequel}} to P90X was released, P90X2. Also a 90-day workout regimen, P90X2 focuses on an applied sports science called Muscle Integration. Instead of working one muscle group at a time, P90X2 uses {{resistance}} on unstable platforms to engage <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> with each movement.|$|R
50|$|Fraser {{suffers from}} spasmodic dysphonia, a voice {{disorder}} caused by involuntary movements {{of one or}} <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> of the voice box that causes the voice to sound stiff and strangled. He has written a memoir of his battles {{to regain control of}} his voice called The Voice Gallery.|$|R
50|$|Dogs have ear {{mobility}} {{that allows}} them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound. Eighteen or <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> can tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.|$|R
500|$|Crystal Dynamics {{focused on}} believability rather than realism to re-develop the character, posing {{decisions}} around the question, [...] "What could Lara do?", and giving her action more freedom. The designers updated Lara Croft's move set {{to make her}} movements appear more fluid and continuous. The animations were also updated so the character could better interact with environmental objects. The developers introduced a feature that causes the character's skin and clothing to appear wet after swimming and dirty after rolling on the ground. Responding to criticism directed at the character controls in Angel of Darkness, Crystal Dynamics redesigned the character's control scheme to provide what it felt was the best third-person action experience. The developers also introduced close-quarter melee manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics updated the character model to add more realism, but retained past design elements. The polygon count increased to over 9,800. More {{attention was paid to}} the character's lip synching and facial expressions to allow for dynamic emotional responses to in-game events. In redesigning the character's appearance, Crystal Dynamics updated Croft's hairstyle, wardrobe, and accessories. Her shirt was changed to a V-neck crop top, her body was given <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> tone, and her hair braid was switched to a pony tail. The voice actor for Lara Croft was initially rumoured to be Rachel Weisz, but the role was eventually given to Keeley Hawes. Crystal Dynamics retained the design changes for the next game, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, a remake of the first game. The designers aimed to portray Croft with more emotional depth, and focused on the character's desire to achieve the end goal of the game, culminating in killing one of the antagonists. The developers used the death to evoke guilt in Croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice.|$|E
2500|$|One {{advantage}} of pennate muscles is that <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers can be packed in parallel, thus allowing the muscle {{to produce more}} force, although the fiber angle to the direction of action means that the maximum force in that direction is somewhat less than the maximum force in the fiber direction.|$|E
2500|$|Redundancy plays a {{large role}} in muscle synergy. [...] Muscle {{redundancy}} is a degrees of freedom problem on the muscular level. [...] The central nervous system is presented with the opportunity to coordinate muscle movements, and it must choose one out of many. [...] The muscle redundancy problem is a result of <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> vectors than dimensions in the task space. [...] Muscles can only generate tension by pulling, not pushing. [...] This results in many muscle force vectors in multiple directions rather than a push and pull in the same direction.|$|E
50|$|FACS defines AUs, {{which are}} a {{contraction}} or relaxation of one or <b>more</b> <b>muscles.</b> It also defines a number of Action Descriptors, which differ from AUs in that the authors of FACS have not specified the muscular basis for the action and have not distinguished specific behaviors as precisely {{as they have for}} the AUs.|$|R
50|$|Since the Erma has a magazine-grip, {{it has its}} {{limitations}} {{when it comes to}} grip-modifications. Shooters with stubby fingers will have problems reaching the trigger with the appropriate 90-degree angle. The grip-angle is somewhat shallow and outdated compared to new high-class pistols, meaning that the shooter must use <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> to get a good shot.|$|R
25|$|Low body {{temperature}} results in shivering becoming <b>more</b> violent. <b>Muscle</b> mis-coordination becomes apparent.|$|R
2500|$|The {{activation}} of one motor neuron {{will result in}} a weak but distributed muscle contraction. The {{activation of}} more motor neurons will result in <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> fibers being activated, and therefore a stronger muscle contraction. Motor unit recruitment is a measure of how many motor neurons are activated in a particular muscle, and therefore is a measure of how many muscle fibers of that muscle are activated. The higher the recruitment the stronger the muscle contraction will be. [...] Motor units are generally recruited in order of smallest to largest (smallest motor neurons to largest motor neurons, and thus slow to fast twitch) as contraction increases. [...] This is known as Henneman's Size Principle.|$|E
2500|$|For New Nightmare, Lou Carlucci, {{the effects}} coordinator, remodeled Freddy's glove {{for a more}} [...] "organic look". He says, [...] "I did the {{original}} glove on the first Nightmare and we deliberately made that rough and primitive looking, like {{something that would be}} constructed in somebody's home workshop. Since {{this is supposed to be}} a new look for Freddy, Craven and everybody involved decided that the glove should be different. This hand has <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable. Everything about this glove has a much cleaner look to it, it's more a natural part of his hand than a glove." [...] The new glove has five claws.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrangement}} of connective tissue fibers determines {{the range of}} motion of a body, and serves as an antagonist against muscle contraction. The most commonly observed connective tissue arrangement for soft bodied animals consists of layers of alternating right and left-handed helices of connective tissue fibers which surround the hydraulic body. This cross helical [...] arrangement {{is seen in the}} tube feet starfish, different types of worms and suckers in octopus. This cross helical arrangement allows for the connective tissue layers to evenly distribute force throughout the hydrostatic body. Another commonly observed connective tissue fiber range is when the connective tissue fibers are embedded within a muscle layer. [...] This {{arrangement of}} connective tissue fibers creates a stiffer body wall and <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> antagonism, which allows for more elastic force to be generated and released during movement. This fiber arrangement is seen in the mantle of squid and the fins in sharks.|$|E

50|$|Howard {{graduated}} from high school in May 1923 and moved back to Cross Plains. On his return to his home town, he engaged in a self-created regimen of exercise, including cutting down oak trees and chopping them into firewood every day, lifting weights, punching a bag and springing exercises; eventually building himself from a skinny teenager into a <b>more</b> <b>muscled,</b> burly form.|$|R
50|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} superior alternating hemiplegia) {{has a few}} distinct symptoms: contralateral hemiparesis of limb and facial muscle accompanied by weakness in one or <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> that control eye movement on the same side. Another symptom that appears {{is the loss of}} eye movement due to damage to the oculomotor nerve fibers. The upper and lower extremities have increased weakness.|$|R

60|$|He was {{an unusually}} strong young Arctic swashbuckler, with {{considerably}} <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> than brains, a restless spirit, and {{what may be}} styled a homicidal tendency. He was also tyrannical, like many men of that stamp, and belonged to the same tribe as Cheenbuk.|$|E
50|$|It is a long-held {{belief that}} it takes <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> to frown {{than it does to}} smile. It is {{difficult}} to determine exactly how many muscles are involved in smiling or frowning as there is a wide range of facial expressions that might be considered a frown or a smile. At minimum ten muscles are required to smile in which only the upper lip and corners of the mouth are lifted. A similarly minimal frown requires only six muscles to lower the corners of the mouth. According to plastic surgeon Dr. David H. Song of the University of Chicago Medical Center, however, frowning requires 11 muscles while smiling requires 12. This method of counting the number of muscles used in generating a facial expression {{does not take into account}} the energy consumed by each muscle or the individual variability in facial muscles. While humans share facial musculature to express the universal emotions, some humans have <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> in their face and may use more of them when smiling or frowning.|$|R
5000|$|A primary {{benefit of}} exercising with an {{exercise}} ball as opposed to exercising directly on a hard flat surface is that the body responds to the instability of the ball to remain balanced, engaging many <b>more</b> <b>muscles.</b> Those muscles become stronger over time to keep balance. Most frequently, the core body muscles [...] - [...] the abdominal muscles and back muscles [...] - [...] {{are the focus of}} exercise ball fitness programs.|$|R
5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others argue for the Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred a heavier, <b>more</b> <b>muscled</b> horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used {{from the time of the}} Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|R

I don't say that it's got <b>more</b> <b>muscle</b> than I have, but--' And then he shows me the insides of his hands. They was blistered and cut and corned and swelled up till they looked {{like a couple of}} flank steaks criss-crossed with a knife--the kind the butchers hide and take home, knowing what is the best.|$|E
60|$|I learned, further, that {{brain was}} {{likewise}} a commodity. It, too, {{was different from}} muscle. A brain seller was only at his prime when he was fifty or sixty years old, and his wares were fetching higher prices than ever. But a labourer was worked out or broken down at forty-five or fifty. I {{had been in the}} cellar of society, and I did not like the place as a habitation. The pipes and drains were unsanitary, and the air was bad to breathe. If I could not live on the parlour floor of society, I could, at any rate, have a try at the attic. It was true, the diet there was slim, but the air at least was pure. So I resolved to sell no <b>more</b> <b>muscle,</b> and to become a vendor of brains.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} charge can stimulate both motor and sensory nerves. In some applications, the nerves are stimulated to generate localized muscle activity, i.e., the stimulation {{is aimed at}} generating direct muscle contraction. In other applications, stimulation is used to activate simple or complex reflexes. In other words, the afferent nerves are stimulated to evoke a reflex, which is typically expressed as a coordinated contraction of one or <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> {{in response to the}} sensory nerve stimulation.|$|R
50|$|Defining {{expressions}} {{in terms}} of muscle actionsA system has been conceived in order to formally categorize the physical expression of emotions. The central concept of the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, as created by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978 are action units (AU).They are, basically, a contraction or a relaxation of one or <b>more</b> <b>muscles.</b> However, as simple as this concept may seem, {{it is enough to}} form the base of a complex and devoid of interpretation emotional identification system.|$|R
50|$|Recently LGBTQ superheroes are {{becoming}} more prevalent and available. In 2011 Batwoman DC reinvented Batwoman from a casual sidekick in need of saving to an independent, lesbian superheroine. This version fights back against female stereotypes, and lacks the traditional female superhero physique. Her body sports <b>more</b> <b>muscles</b> and less chest and hip padding. She also lacks the traditional long flowing hair, instead sporting a short cut. She fights the more grotesque images of womanhood including the gorgons, her undead mother, and the ghost of her previous incarnation.|$|R
