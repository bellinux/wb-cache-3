50|$|Transmission {{of power}} to the front wheels was via a four speed manual {{transmission}} without synchromesh. Whereas the transmission on the rear wheel drive Primus was controlled using a floor <b>mounted</b> <b>lever,</b> gear changing on the front-wheel drive Trumpf was achieved using a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Drive {{or reverse}} gears can be engaged {{with a dash}} <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Air {{controls}} can {{be installed}} as floor <b>mounted</b> <b>levers</b> or dashboard <b>mounted</b> switches.|$|R
5000|$|Cable {{controls}} {{are the least}} expensive, and are commonly floor <b>mounted</b> <b>levers.</b> They are generally favored in cold weather environments.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission {{of power}} to the front wheels was via a four speed manual {{transmission}} without synchromesh. [...] Gear changing used a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Command-Trac II {{works the}} same as Command-Trac but uses a console mounted switch to control the MP1522 {{transfer}} case {{as opposed to a}} floor <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1939 Ford Taunus the car’s 1,172 cc unit {{delivered}} a claimed , married up to a three-speed transmission controlled with a centrally <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b> Drive was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Cab {{controls}} {{can either}} be operated by cable, air or electricity. Both cable and air controls, in a floor <b>mounted</b> <b>lever</b> configuration, offer additional benefits in controlling the load, by feathering the controls.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{package for}} the saloon/sedan and estate/station wagon bodied Rekord Bs featured a manual all-synchromesh gearbox, controlled by a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b> Customers could choose between three or four forward speeds.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox was a four speed manual unit {{controlled}} using {{a column}} <b>mounted</b> <b>lever,</b> featuring synchromesh {{on the top}} three ratios. Power was transmitted to the front wheels, front wheel drive having been a specialty and an enthusiasm of Grégoire for many years.|$|R
5000|$|One-piece {{handlebar}} {{steering control}} with <b>mounted</b> brake <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gearbox, {{controlled}} by a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever,</b> was a three speed manual system coupled with a free-wheel device: in Autumn 1953 a four speed box was offered as an option. 1957 saw a further transmission advance with {{the availability of a}} Saxomat automatic centrifugal clutch on the DKW.|$|R
50|$|The Rekord P2 {{took its}} three-speed all-synchromesh {{transmission}} from its predecessor, {{along with the}} column <b>mounted</b> gear <b>lever</b> through which it was controlled. However, the P2 {{was also the first}} Rekord on which, as an option, buyers could specify a four-speed all-synchromesh transmission, still controlled using a column <b>mounted</b> gear <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} was a three speed {{manual system}} controlled using a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b> That was a similar arrangement to {{that on the}} previous model which had received an all-synchromesh gear box for its final year: for the new model synchromesh was included for all three forward ratios from the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a four {{cylinder}} four stroke 995 cc side-valve unit. Claimed maximum power was of [...] at 4,000 rpm. This supported a claimed {{top speed of}} 90 km/h (56 mph). Power was delivered to the front wheels via a four speed manual transmission controlled {{by means of a}} column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|To {{climb and}} descend in the aircraft, the {{vertically}} <b>mounted</b> <b>lever,</b> [...] "...is moved fore and aft, thus causing {{the front edge}} of the rudder none of Watson's aeroplanes were fitted with a vertical rudder. The Wrights also initially referred to their horizontal stabilisers as horizontal rudders to be moved downwards or upwards." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{connected}} to a four-speed gearbox with centrally <b>mounted</b> change <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Safeties: Slide <b>mounted</b> {{decocking}} <b>levers.</b> Loaded chamber indicator. Firing-pin safety. Slide retention device.|$|R
50|$|The Isabella {{featured}} a swing axle at the back: it {{was supported by}} coil springs on all four wheels. The four-cylinder 1493 cc engine had a claimed power output of , and was connected {{by means of a}} then innovative hydraulic clutch to the four speed full synchromesh gear box. Gear changes were effected by means of a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{package for}} the saloon/sedan and estate/station wagon bodied Rekord Ds featured a manual all-synchromesh four-speed gearbox, controlled on the early versions by a column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b> A centrally positioned floor-mounted gear lever, marketed as a [...] "Sportschaltung" [...] (sports gear change) was available from the start on petrol fueled cars, initially as an optional extra and later as a standard feature.|$|R
50|$|Coupé buyers {{found the}} four speed manual transmission, but {{controlled}} using a centrally positioned floor <b>mounted</b> gear <b>lever,</b> {{included in the}} price.|$|R
50|$|The Caterpillar Sixty {{was famous}} for its {{overhanging}} radiator, individually <b>mounted</b> cylinders, <b>lever</b> controls, andopen clutch. It was to rival the Holt 10 Ton model.|$|R
5000|$|The Series 80 and Series 90 used a 344 cu. in. version (bore 3 5/16 in., stroke 5 in.) for 104 brake HP. Automatic vacuum-operated {{spark advance}} was another new feature {{replacing}} the steering column <b>mounted</b> spark <b>lever</b> although an emergency lever was now dash mounted. Buick scored another first in 1939 {{when it became}} the first company to introduce turn signals, which did not appear on other car brands until almost a decade later. [...] All 1939 models also had a steering column <b>mounted</b> shift <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1948 - 1952 - Ape A: 125 cc engine, {{wooden pick}} up bed, front fork mounted {{to the left}} of the wheel hub and column <b>mounted</b> gear <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1963 Ambassadors {{were offered}} {{only with the}} 327 CID L V8, in either [...] 2-barrel or [...] 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller 287 CID L V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The {{automatic}} transmission was controlled by a steering column <b>mounted</b> <b>lever,</b> replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from 12000 - 25000 mi, the recommended engine oil change was at 4000 mi, and all Ambassador models included an alternator and an electronic voltage regulator as standard equipment.|$|R
50|$|The front brakes became discs {{and from}} 1964 it gained a new gearbox with {{synchromesh}} on first gear. The optional Borg Warner automatic got a floor <b>mounted</b> selector <b>lever.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The most {{complicated}} mechanical aid {{for use with}} extensions is the mechanical lever system nicknamed the machine. This lever system, which superficially resembles the keying mechanism of reed instruments such as the bassoon, <b>mounts</b> <b>levers</b> beside the regular fingerboard (near the nut, on the E-string side), which remotely activate metal [...] "fingers" [...] on the extension fingerboard. The most expensive metal lever systems also give the player the ability to [...] "lock" [...] down notes on the extension fingerboard, as with the wooden [...] "finger" [...] system. One criticism of these devices is that they may lead to unwanted metallic clicking noises.|$|R
50|$|The Saab 96 and its {{station wagon}} sibling, the Saab 95, {{featured}} column <b>mounted</b> tranmsmission <b>levers.</b> The gearbox originally had three gears, the first unsynchronised. Later, a four-speed option, with synchromesh first gear, was offered and the three-speed was phased out.|$|R
50|$|The T140 uses a {{five-speed}} sequential gearbox, {{the gear}} shafts are removable {{from the right}} side of the engine without the need to split the crankcases. The clutch is of the wet, multiple-disc coil spring type and is cable operated. The gearbox is 'splash' lubricated by its own oil contents. Early models featured a right <b>mounted</b> gear change <b>lever</b> with all later models (from August 1975) featuring a left <b>mounted</b> gear <b>lever.</b> A shock absorbing or 'cush drive' system for the chain final drive consisting of rubber blocks is unusually mounted in the clutch centre.|$|R
5000|$|A new 2.2-liter X22SE engine {{built by}} Holden in Australia {{served as the}} base engine. Isuzu also offered the [...] 6VD1 V6 that carried 214 lbft Nm of torque at 3000 rpm. Fuel {{consumption}} is an estimated 22 mpg highway. From a technical prospective, the Rodeo and Amigo were built with a rigid frame that has eight crossmembers. Front suspension has independent lower and upper arms, with a solid rear axle. The Rodeo and Amigo 4WD models came with a modified Dana 44 rear axle and push-button four-wheel drive. They also had a traditional floor <b>mounted</b> <b>lever</b> for switching from high- to low-range. Underneath, both vehicles came with protective skid plates as a standard feature.|$|R
50|$|Power was {{transmitted}} to the rear wheels via a single dry-plate clutch and a four-speed all-synchromesh gear box, controlled using a conventional floor <b>mount</b> gear <b>lever.</b> There were 200 mm brake drums on all four wheels: braking operated via a single circuit hydraulic system.|$|R
40|$|Rats with chronically implanted, bipolar {{electrodes}} in the septal and medial forebrain bundle areas, {{in addition}} to the region of the mammillary bodies of the posterior hypothalamus, were trained to press a permanently <b>mounted</b> <b>lever</b> in order to produce a second, retractable lever. Rewarding brain stimulation was programmed on the retractable lever; following completion of the programmed number of CRF response-stimulations, that lever was retracted from the box. Responding on the permanent lever could reintroduce the retractable lever. Fixed interval, fixed ratio, DRL, and variable interval schedules were programmed on the permanent lever in the range of schedule parameters often used with conventional reinforcers. Typical effects are described, and it is concluded that there are no striking differences between brain-stimulation reinforcement and the conventional reinforcers...|$|R
50|$|The {{engineers}} George M. Tinker and John W. Piper were {{employees of}} the Waltham Manufacturing Company, at that time makers of the Orient bicycles in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1898, they were allowed by the company's owner, Charles Herman Metz, to build a light steam buggy at {{a corner of the}} plant. This vehicle was finished {{at the end of the}} year and named the Waltham Steam. It had a very light (50 lbs), 3 bhp (2.24 kW) two cylinder, double acting steam engine. The copper-built condenser weighted in at 110 lbs, and the complete vehicle at only 600 lbs. It had wire wheels, and steering was provided by a vertically <b>mounted</b> <b>lever.</b> Tinker and Piper exhibited their steam buggy at the Boston Automobile Show in 1898.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to arrange a highfield lever to work two backstays or shrouds by <b>mounting</b> the <b>lever</b> transversely {{so that it is}} thrown from side to side rather than fore and aft, tensioning the rigging {{on one side of the}} boat as it relaxes the other.|$|R
50|$|The {{first series}} of cars were {{produced}} between 1964 and 1969 in Moscow. These automobiles had vertical rear lights, two or four round headlights, a front bench seat, and a 4-speed manual transmission with column <b>mounted</b> gear <b>lever.</b> The {{length of the}} standard model was 4090 mm.|$|R
2500|$|Power for the XR-400 was {{supplied}} by a standard Ambassador two-barrel [...] AMC V8 engine. The engine bay could accommodate any of AMC’s I6 or V8 engines. The transmission was an automatic (not typical of sports cars) controlled through a floor console <b>mounted</b> shift <b>lever.</b> Braking {{was provided by}} an experimental front disc brake system.|$|R
