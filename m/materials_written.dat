5|$|Five years later, Buffalo was {{presented}} with the Treaty of La Pointe covering his lands. Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart, who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry, led the negotiations for the US government. No record of the negotiations was made. But <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> by missionaries, traders, and the Ojibwa through their agent indicated that Stuart used bullying and outright deception to force the Ojibwa to accept the terms.|$|E

25|$|Tancredo {{criticized the}} Denver Public Library system for {{purchasing}} reading <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> in Spanish and for offering space for classes {{to be held}} for these library users, on the grounds that putting Spanish-speakers in a 'linguistic ghetto' would delay their integration into American society.|$|E
25|$|The ban {{sparked a}} debate, {{largely on the}} Internet which led to Slifkin's publisher, Targum Press discontinuing {{distribution}} of his books. Yashar Books, a smaller Jewish publisher, agreed to distribute them. <b>Materials</b> <b>written</b> by Slifkin {{were removed from the}} websites of influential Orthodox kiruv (Jewish outreach) organisations, such as Aish HaTorah.|$|E

25|$|Kurds often {{speak the}} Kurdish {{language}} in public, unless all those present do not. According to the Human Rights Watch, Kurds in Syria {{are not allowed}} to officially use the Kurdish language, {{are not allowed to}} register children with Kurdish names, are prohibited to start businesses that do not have Arabic names, are not permitted to build Kurdish private schools, and are prohibited from publishing books and other <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> in Kurdish. But this is no longer enforced due to the civil war.|$|E
25|$|The National Baptist Publishing Board {{fulfilled}} Boyd's goal {{of providing}} black Baptists with religious <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> by other black Baptists, primarily periodicals and Sunday School materials, but also including some books. At the beginning, the Publishing Board took over responsibility for publishing the National Baptist Magazine and it launched the new Teacher's Monthly in 1897. The Publishing Board started {{making a profit}} {{as early as the}} first quarter of 1897, when it distributed more than 180,000 copies of published materials, and it grew increasingly profitable over time.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Compass is a 2007 British-American fantasy {{adventure}} film {{based on}} Northern Lights, the first novel in Philip Pullman's trilogy His Dark <b>Materials.</b> <b>Written</b> {{and directed by}} Chris Weitz, it stars Nicole Kidman, Dakota Blue Richards, Daniel Craig, Sam Elliott, Eva Green, and Ian McKellen. The project was announced in February 2002, but difficulties over the script and {{the selection of a}} director caused significant delays. At US$180 million, it was one of New Line Cinema's most expensive projects ever, and its disappointing results in the USA contributed to New Line's February 2008 restructuring.|$|E

25|$|Techniques used to {{suppress}} the ethnic identity of Kurds in Syria include various bans {{on the use of}} the Kurdish language, refusal to register children with Kurdish names, the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic, the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names, the prohibition of Kurdish private schools, and the prohibition of books and other <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> in Kurdish. Having been denied the right to Syrian nationality, around three-hundred thousand Kurds have been deprived of any social rights, in violation of international law. As a consequence, these Kurds are in effect trapped within Syria. In February 2006, however, sources reported that Syria was now planning to grant these Kurds citizenship.|$|E
25|$|From 1696 to 1700, {{only about}} 250 {{separate}} items were issued {{from the major}} printing presses in the American colonies. This is a small number compared to {{the output of the}} printers in London at the time. London printers published <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> by New England authors, so the body of American literature was larger than what was published in North America. However, printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England. In England, restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations, where the government could monitor what was published: London, York, Oxford, and Cambridge. Because of this, the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts.|$|E
500|$|The Antemoro speak a dialect of the Malagasy {{language}}, {{which is}} {{a branch of the}} Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. [...] The language is traditionally written using the sorabe script, and those who master this form of writing are called katibo and are considered to possess unusual power. [...] Sorabe writings traditionally ranged from instructional texts for teaching astrology, to historical records and other forms of documentation, and <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> using the sorabe script were considered to be sacred.|$|E

500|$|A {{variety of}} writers and thinkers have found Kaali an {{exciting}} figure for reflection and exploration, notably feminists and participants in New Age spirituality who {{are attracted to}} goddess worship.

[...] confusion and misrepresentation, stemming from a lack of knowledge of Hindu history among these authors, [...] draw upon <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> by scholars of the Hindu religious tradition… [...] It is hard to import the worship of a goddess from another culture: religious associations and connotations have to be learned, imagined or intuited when the deep symbolic meanings embedded in the native culture are not available.|$|E
500|$|In {{published}} <b>materials</b> <b>written</b> {{more than}} a decade after its initial release, E.T. has been universally panned by critics and is frequently listed as the worst video game ever. Reiley ranked it number one in a list of the 20 worst games of all time in Electronic Gaming Monthly's 150th issue. Michael Dolan, deputy editor of FHM magazine, has also listed the game as his pick for the worst video game of all time. Townsend placed E.T. {{at the top of his}} list of worst video games, noting that, [...] "about a third of the people I quizzed came up with this title almost instantly, and it's not hard to see why." [...] GameTrailers ranked the game the second worst on their [...] "Top Ten Best and Worst Games of All Time" [...] list.|$|E
