40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{critical}} {{interpretation of the}} EU’s recent Maritime Security Strategy (MSS) of 2014, making distinctions between hard and soft conceptions of maritime security. The theoretical approach employed invokes the ‘EU as neo-medieval empire’ (Bull 1977 : 254 - 255; Rennger 2006; Zielonka 2006). By this account, the main objectives of EU maritime strategy are stability and encouragement of globalised <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> to be achieved using the classic instruments of ‘soft maritime security’. While replete with great possibilities, the EU’s maritime security strategy {{is likely to be}} a relatively weak maritime security regime, which suffers from a number of important limits...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} transport costs and trade for Uruguay’s bilateral imports {{over a period of}} six years (2000 - 2006) and compare the analysis with its main competitors: Argentina and Brazil. The data used are disaggregated (SITC 5 digit level) <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows.</b> With this data set, a transport costs equation and a gravity equation of trade are estimated using linear regression analysis in a panel data framework. The results allow to quantify the effect of the explanatory variables on international maritime transport costs and imports for the three countries considered and to compare the obtained elasticities with previous cross-section analysis. The main findings are twofold. First, economies of scale in transport, port infrastructure and connectivity are important determinants of transport costs. Second, transport costs {{are one of the most}} influential determinants of imports at aggregated and at disaggregated level whereas the geographical position, measured in terms of distance to trade partners, plays a residual role...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the relationship between maritime trade and transport cost in Latin America. The data available are disaggregated (SITC 5 digit level) <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> on trade routes within Latin America over the period 1999 - 2004. The contribution to the literature is to disentangle the effects that transport costs have on the extensive margin (number of products imported) and the intensive margin (quantity imported of each product) of international trade in order to test some of the predictions of the trade theories that introduce firm heterogeneity in productivity, as well as fixed costs of exporting. Recent investigations show that spatial frictions (distance) reduce trade mainly by reducing the number of shipments and that most firms ship only to geographically proximate customers, instead of shipping to many destinations in quantities that decrease in distance. Our findings confirm this result for intra-LA trade and show that the opposite pattern is observed for ad-valorem freight rates that reduce aggregate trade values mainly by reducing the quantity imported (intensive margin) ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of <b>maritime</b> <b>trade.</b> It focuses in particular {{on the extent to}} which variations in trade-related costs between Asia and Europe help to explain the surge in Euro–Asian trade in eight of the most emblematic categories of products related to Asian success: textiles, footwear, confection, machinery, electronic products, vehicles, furniture and pharmaceutical products. In marked contrast to other studies that focus only on {{the determinants of}} total <b>maritime</b> <b>trade,</b> we decompose trade into two margins: the number of different products exchanged (extensive margin) and the average value of each product (intensive margin). We estimate a trade-augmented gravity model with trade cost factors for specific <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> and industries and for both margins of trade. Several types of trade costs are considered, namely maritime transport costs, time to export/import, behind-the-border trade costs and distances. The main findings indicate that lower freight costs increase aggregate trade values mainly by increasing the average value of imported varieties, but also by increasing the number of products traded. Our findings suggest that political actions aimed at spurring competition and innovation in the maritime transport industry do have an impact on the volume and composition of international trade...|$|R
50|$|In 1407 a new <b>Maritime</b> <b>Trade</b> Supervisorate was {{established}} at Yuntun, while two new such offices were established at Xinping (新平) and Shunhua (順化) in 1408.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} transport costs for intra-Latin American trade {{over a period of}} six years (1999 - 2004). The data refer to yearly disaggregated (SITC 5 digit level) <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> on 277 trade routes. With this data set, a transport costs equation is estimated using linear regression analysis in a panel data framework. The first contribution to the literature is to exploit the greater variability present in our data and to control for unobservable heterogeneous effects. The second is to investigate the influence of open registries on the variability of maritime transport costs. Three groups of explanatory variables are considered. Firstly, timevarying variables: use of open registries and trade imbalance. Secondly, variables related to liner shipping network structures: number of liner services, shipping opportunities, deployed ships and deployed TEUs. Finally, product related variables such as volume of shipment, value of product and special characteristics of the cargo (i. e. refrigerated cargo). The results will allow us to quantify the effect of the explanatory variables on international maritime transport costs and to compare the obtained elasticities with previous cross-section analysis. In particular, estimating the impact of the use of open registries on transport cost is a new contribution in this field that could provide policy makers with valuable information {{to be used in the}} implementation of economic policies.

40|$|Piracy has {{plagued the}} oceans {{throughout}} human history. Increasing <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> {{have led to}} recurrent waves of piracy and armed robbery at sea. Piracy was always {{more than just a}} crime. It has been a constitutive problem for developing global order, for establishing the distinction between private violence and state violence, and for regulating global space from the Pax Britannica to the modern international law of the sea. Piracy is a problem not only of the past or of theory. Since the 1990 s, the return of large-scale piracy in East Asia, the Horn of Africa, and other regions can be observed. In particular, piracy rooted in Somalia has received wide international attention. International security actors, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), or the UN Security Council, have become concerned about piracy. In consequence, since 2008 an international armada has patrolled the Horn of Africa. Contemporary piracy is increasingly recognized {{to be one of the}} major nontraditional security threats. It is a multidimensional issue, connected to concerns over state failure, arms trade, terrorism, transport, energy, and environmental security, as well as global maritime security. The goals of this article are, first, to familiarize the reader with works that examine the history of the concept and the practice of piracy in light of the development of global political order and international law. Second, the article encompasses literature on contemporary piracy and the international response to it, including contributions that theorize the causes of piracy as a conjecture of weak governance, opportunity, and cultural acceptability. Works that study the responses of global and regional security governance and that propose alternative policies of coping with piracy are also included. The main focus is on today’s two major hot spots of piracy, East Asia and the Horn of Africa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of a survey on <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> to {{agri-food}} products among Sicily and the non-EU countries of the Union for the Mediterranean, through maritime transport. The aim {{of this paper is to}} outline the role that Sicily plays in respect of trade in agricultural products through the maritime mode considering its strategic location in the Mediterranean basin. Political reference scenario is that of the Union for the Mediterranean and EU Mediterranean Transport Policy (motorways of the sea). The work contains an analysis of the evolution of <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> in agri-food of Sicily, in the main ports of departure and arrival, with non-EU countries of the Union for the Mediterranean, estimated on the basis of data provided specifically by the Customs Agency of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance. The relative geographical orientation index has allowed to estimate the geographic specialization of the island, compared to Italy, in the <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> of agri-food products with non-EU Countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The results highlight how Sicily, thanks to its particular geographical position is one of the most specialized partner in the <b>maritime</b> <b>trade</b> with the other Mediterranean countries. These trades are gradually increased over the last decade, both in terms of absolute value and in relative terms, concerning the traffic of agri-food products. It is evident, therefore, as the creation of motorways of the sea linking Sicily with the coastal countries of the South and East of the Mediterranean could constitute an further factor of economic integration...|$|R
