40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed some light on the use of fuzzy {{measures}} and integrals as aggregation operators in <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> These techniques have been widely used on an ad hoc basis, but with no axiomatization. It is possible to obtain preference representation theorems in <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problems, relying on a formal parallelism between decision under uncertainty and <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> Though, it raises some commensurability problems. In this paper, we show how to obtain an axiomatization of <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problems, in a very natural way, and we show how to solve the commensurability problem in a particular case...|$|E
40|$|<b>Multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> {{refers to}} {{selecting}} or ranking alternatives from available alternatives {{with respect to}} multiple, usually conflicting criteria involving either a single decision maker or multiple decision makers. It often takes place {{in an environment where}} the information available is uncertain, subjective and imprecise. To adequately solve this decision problem, the application of fuzzy sets theory for adequately modelling the uncertainty and imprecision in <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> has proven to be effective. Much research has been done on the development of various fuzzy multicriteria analysis approaches for effectively solving the <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problem, and numerous applications {{have been reported in the}} literature. In general, existing approaches can be categorized into (a) <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> with a single decision maker and (b) multicriteria group decision making. Existing approaches, however, are not totally satisfactory due to various shortcomings that they suffer from including (a) the inability to adequately model the uncertainty and imprecision of human decision making, (b) the failure to effectively handle the requirements of decision maker(s), (c) the tedious mathematical computation required, and (d) cognitively very demanding on the decision maker(s). This research has developed four novel approaches for effectively solving the <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problem under uncertainty. To effectively reduce the cognitive demand on the decision maker, a pairwise comparison based approach is developed in Chapter 4 for solving the multicriteria problem under uncertainty. To adequately meet the interest of various stakeholders in the <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> process, a decision support system (DSS) based approach is introduced in Chapter 5. In Chapter 6, a consensus oriented approach is presented in multicriteria group decision making on which a DSS is proposed for facilitating consensus building in solving the multicriteria group decision making problem. In Chapter 7, a risk-oriented approach is developed for adequately modelling the inherent risk in multicriteria group decision making with the use of the concept of ideal solutions so that the complex and unreliable process of comparing fuzzy utilities usually required in fuzzy multicriteria analysis is avoided. Empirical studies of four real fuzzy <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problems are presented for illustrating the applicability of the approaches developed in solving the <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problem. A hospital location selection problem is discussed in Chapter 8. An international distribution centre location problem is illustrated in Chapter 9. A supplier selection problem is presented in Chapter 10. A hotel location problem is discussed in Chapter 11. These studies have shown the distinct advantages of the approaches developed respectively in this research from different perspectives in solving the <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> problem...|$|E

40|$|Until now, {{decision}} under {{uncertainty and}} <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> {{have been investigated}} separately and almost independently, {{although there is a}} close link between both fields. Decision theory is also closely related to measurement theory. Besides, {{it is well known that}} additive representations in decision making are not sufficient to avoid paradoxes such as Ellsberg’s paradox. Therefore, we investigate the links between the two paradigms of decision and measurement theory in order to propose a Choquet representation theorem in <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> A key concept for this is a commensurability assumption between the values of attributes. We show that this hypothesis, under a very general structural property on the sets of values of attributes is not restrictive.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} multicriteria lotteries. The interest of this {{lies in the fact}} that decision under uncertainty and <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> are formally equivalent when the set of states of the world is finite in the uncertainty framework. Using this analogy, together with an extension of the Anscombe-Aumann representation theorem to the non-additive case due to Wakker, we are able to give a Choquet-integral representation of preferences in <b>multicriteria</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> We also show that multicriteria lotteries can be used in order to consider both paradigms of decision in a same problem, by formally introducing some uncertainty in the consequences.

40|$|AbstractInformation for <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> is {{classified}} into four elements: alternatives, criteria, outcomes, and preferences. By {{the assumption of}} procedural rationality, a decision maker always collects and uses information necessary to form expectations about various alternatives and makes his choices from Pareto-optimal alternatives. The Pareto-optimality of an alternative depends on evaluation criteria, the assessments of criterion functions, {{and the existence of}} other relevant alternatives. Therefore, Pareto-equilibria will dynamically change with time and new information input. This paper studies the stability of dynamic Pareto-equilibria in a process of <b>multicriterion</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> Both local and global measures of stability are proposed and their equivalence is proved.
