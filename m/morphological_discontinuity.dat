This study analyses the 5 and 6 May 1998 event which affected the Pizzo d’Alvano (Campania, southern Italy). More than 400 slides affecting shallow pyroclastic deposits were triggered by intense and prolonged but not extreme rainfall. Landslides affected the pyroclastic deposits that cover the steep calcareous ridges and are soil slip-debris flows and rapid mudflows. About 30 main channels were deeply scoured by flows which reached the alluvial fans depositing up to 400 000 m 3 of material in the piedmont areas. About 75 % of the landslides are associated with <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> such as limestone cliffs and roads. The sliding surface is located within the pyroclastic cover, generally {{at the base of}} a pumice layer. Geotechnical characterisation of pyroclastic deposits has been accomplished by laboratory and in situ tests. Numerical modelling of seepage processes and stability analyses have been run on four simplified models representing different settings observed at the source areas. Seepage modelling showed the formation of pore pressure pulses in pumice layers and the localised increase of pore pressure in correspondence of stratigraphic discontinuities as response to the rainfall event registered between 28 April and 5 May. Numerical modelling provided pore pressure values for stability analyses and pointed out critical conditions where stratigraphic or <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> occur.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. elsevier. comLand evaluation, {{an integral part of}} land use planning, has been established as one of the preferred methods to support sustainable land use management. In essence, land evaluation aims to compare and match each potential land use with the properties of individual parcels of land, also called land units. A land unit is an area that is, according to predetermined properties, different from the surrounding land and can be assumed to have homogeneous land properties (e. g. climate, soils, cover). Land components (also called landform elements, terrain units or land surface segments) are often used as land units, mainly because their boundaries frequently coincide with transitions in environmental conditions. Although land components have traditionally been delineated by studying topographical maps, interpreting aerial photographs and making field measurements, such manual mapping techniques are very time-consuming and subjective. Land component maps can be generated more objectively and faster by using computer algorithms. This paper compares the maps produced by three algorithms, namely the automated land component mapper (ALCoM), the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm (ISODATA) and multi-resolution image segmentation (MRS), to determine which technique produces the most homogenous and morphologically representative land components for an area in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The results revealed that the three methods produced significantly different land component maps. While ISODATA's units were relatively homogenous, their boundaries rarely followed <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> ALCoM performed better in delineating land components along terrain discontinuities, but produced relatively heterogeneous land components. Overall, MRS performed consistently well and was significantly more sensitive to <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> than the other two methods tested. Land use managers should, however, use MRS with care as {{more research is needed to}} determine what effect its different input parameters have on land unit boundaries. Post-prin...|$|R

We study this phenomenon {{as a way}} to understand the normal mechanisms involved in the spatial regulation of homeotic gene expression.

We find that the <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> observed in the adult transformations are caused by corresponding new patterns of the Ubx proteins in the imaginai anlagen.

Transported material was meant to be mineral particles found in the soil profile, transported probably by water or gravity, that were not present neither in the parent material nor derived from it. Five soils of this region (two Alfisols, two Ultisols and one Mollisol) were sampled and morphological, sand grain size statistics, chemical and mineralogical analyses were used to search for evidences of deposition of transported materials. Two soils had abrupt textural change but no evidence of deposition of transported materials, two soils had less contrasting morphology and some characteristics that are possibly related to deposition, and one soil had no <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuity,</b> but had deposition of material enriched in magnetite-maghemite in the sand fraction of the A horizon.

Our goal is to align the sub-volumes by estimating a set of optimal global transformations that preserve morphological continuity of medical structures, e. g., blood vessels, in the reconstructed 3 D volume. We approach the problem by learning morphological characteristics of structures of interest in each sub-volume to understand global alignment transformations. Based on the observations of morphology, sub-volumes are aligned by connecting the morphological features at the sub-volume boundaries by minimizing <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuity.</b> To minimize the discontinuity, we introduce three <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuity</b> metrics: discontinuity magnitude at sub-volume boundary points, and overall and junction discontinuity residuals after polynomial curve fitting to multiple aligned sub-volumes.

30|$|The {{pavement}} {{resistance of}} bitumen, {{due to a}} reduced penetration grade, can be increased by using SBS. SBS is a flexible long-chain polymer and its thermoplastic properties cause {{the reduction in the}} penetration grade of bitumen mixed with it. A three-dimensional network of polystyrene blocks and butadiene middle blocks occur in bitumen with thermoplastic properties (polystyrene blocks), which cause increasing viscosity of the bitumen at high temperatures, and as a result, the penetration grade of the bitumen is reduced, proven by tests of softening point. However, due to the presence of these blocks with elastic properties (butadiene middle blocks) at low temperatures, the bitumen also has good elasticity. Then, by increasing the percentage of polymer, reduced resistance and softness can be achieved, i.e., dominance of the polymer network in the bitumen, which gives <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuity.</b>|$|E

Published canonical discriminant analyses, and additional cluster analyses, presented in this article, indicate <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> among the populations. In addition, specimens collected from one region, although morphologically similar to P. stonei, are regarded as representing a new species of Paratemnopteryx. To investigate the utility of molecular data at the population and species level for this genus, we sequenced the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS 2) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Sequences were obtained from 14 individual cockroaches used in the morphometric analyses. The size of the ITS 2 gene region was 504 – 592 bp, with a mean G+C content of 52. 3 %. We found that the ITS 2 data supported the existence of at least three races of P. stonei, and the new species of Paratemnopteryx.

40|$|Thymus herba-barona is {{endemic to}} Majorca, Corsica, and Sardinia. In {{order to gain}} insight into its {{evolutionary}} history, we examined the genetic diversity and phylogeography of the species using sequences of the trnT-trnL intergenic spacer from 106 individuals belonging to 15 populations. We detected high within-species genetic diversity and strong amongpopulation differentiation, but no evidence for phylogeographic structure. A haplotype network supported the occurrence of three main clades, the ancestral one being geographically restricted to the Gennargentu massif in Sardinia, while the two derived ones were relatively widespread. Coalescent-based analyses indicated deep divergence times and limited ongoing gene flow between major clades. The inferred evolutionary history of the species involved an early range expansion followed by successive fragmentation episodes, probably related to progressive climatic aridification since the Pliocene (3. 2 Ma). Our data suggest that long-distance dispersal events played a minor role in the evolutionary history of the species. The exact origin of the species remains unclear. The highly structured pattern of genetic variability detected suggests that random genetic drift {{played a major role}} in structuring genetic variation in this endemic plant.

40|$|Despite {{continuous}} historical {{distribution of}} the grey wolf (Canis lupus) throughout Eurasia, the species displays considerable morphological differentiation that resulted in delimitation {{of a number of}} subspecies. However, these <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> are not always consistent with patterns of genetic differentiation. Here we assess genetic distinctiveness of grey wolves from the Caucasus (a region at the border between Europe and West Asia) that have been classified as a distinct subspecies C. l. cubanensis. We analysed their genetic variability based on mtDNA control region, microsatellite loci and genome-wide SNP genotypes (obtained for a subset of the samples), and found similar or higher levels of genetic diversity at all these types of loci as compared with other Eurasian populations. Although we found no evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck, genome-wide linkage disequilibrium patterns suggest a long-term demographic decline in the Caucasian population - a trend consistent with other Eurasian populations. Caucasian wolves share mtDNA haplotypes with both Eastern European and West Asian wolves, suggesting past or ongoing gene flow. Microsatellite data also suggest gene flow between the Caucasus and Eastern Europe. We found evidence for moderate admixture between the Caucasian wolves and domestic dogs, at a level comparable with other Eurasian populations. Taken together, our results show that Caucasian wolves are not genetically isolated from other Eurasian populations, share with them the same demographic trends, and are affected by similar conservation problems...|$|R
40|$|In the Northern Apennines several olistoliths {{made up of}} serpentinites, calpionelle limestones and ophiolitic breccias {{have been}} {{recognized}} within the Porcellara Complex, Monte Cassio Unit. These olistoliths are frequently crossed by a dense network of centimeter to decimeter veins generally filled by carbonate minerals (e. g. La Costa, Berceto, PR). Morphological and compositional data (SEM-EDS and XRPD) have revealed that these carbonate minerals consist mainly of well-formed, white to milky calcite crystals, strictly associated with chrysotile. This mineral is found as white thin fibers (< 1 micron), grew up in intimate association with calcite crystals. These fibers may be very rare and randomly scattered within the crystals of calcite, or can be grouped into bundles of millimeter to centimeter size. At times, the chrysotile can get to completely fill the vein. Chrysotile fibers are well-formed and euhedral at all scales from hand specimen to electron microscope images. In some cases, individual fibers of chrysotile are not visible in hand specimen or under the petrographic microscope; however, SEM images show the characteristic elongate crystal morphology. The fibers are also characteristically curved at the millimeter scale. It {{is important to note}} that the fibers of chrysotile appear, frequently, as a physical extension of calcite crystals, without any evident <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in the transition from a massive (calcite) to a fibrous (chrysotile) appearence. The results of detailed SEM-EDS elemental analyses carried out in various segments of the contact areas between calcite and chrysotile crystals seem to show a gradual transition in chemical composition from pure calcite to pure chrysotile phases, passing through various intermediate arrangements...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{assumption}} of an individually grammatical semantics of word-formation types, this paper deals {{with the development of}} determinative compounding in the history of German from an inner-morphological perspective. Diachronically, the former research observed that German nouns have become “longer”, i. e. more complex (firstly been formulated by Wurzel 1996). Additionally, some morphological restrictions within nominal compounding have been documented for historical stages of German, but some of them cannot be attested in present-day German. This suggests a formally and semantically motivated, inner-morphological change which can be described in terms of grammaticalization theory. For this purpose, previ-ous results from historical word-formation and semantics will be combined with new observa-tions on <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in the history of German, especially by focussing on morphological restrictions from a synchronic and a diachronic perspective. Since this approach comprises various linguistic phenomena (such as the diachronic development of part of speeches, (de-) referencialization, definiteness etc.) and since morphological restrictions have merely not been documented empirically – neither for present-day nor for historical stages of German, the paper aims at sketching the most prominent lines of development from a theoreti-cal perspective, also by contrasting them with results from language typology, variational lin-guistics, and semantics. Additionally, the paper provides morpho-syntactical prospects for further theoretical and empirical research on historical morphology, also by conceiving word-internal language change {{as an integral part of}} the dynamics of morpho-syntactic structuring...|$|R

Nine out of 16 investigated traits were significantly different between C. * thyrsoides and C. * carniolica. For C. * carniolica inflorescence length was 1. 49, and above-ground biomass 2. 79 higher, while flower density was significantly lower. Campanula * carniolica also showed delayed flowering and flower development from bottom to top as compared to C. * thyrsoides which flowered from top to bottom. The inflorescence growth was indeterminate and flowering took several weeks in C. * carniolica, whereas C. * thyrsoides showed determinate flowering, rapidly opening all flowers within a few days. This differentiation in flowering phenology {{is likely to be}} adaptive. The submediterranean climate favours indeter-minate flowering in C. * carniolica, allowing ongoing growth of the inflorescence throughout the long summer until environmental conditions worsen, whereas determi-nate and early flowering in C. * thyrsoides is favourable in the short growing season in the high Alps where seed production must be secured before temperature drops.

40|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{problems}} associated with apomictic ferns, {{it is not so much}} a question of defining and delimiting mor-phological discontinuities, but one of dis-covering and defining biological discon-tinuities. Whereas it is assumed that <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> of suffi-cient magnitude to delimit taxa have a genetic basis, with apomictic taxa it is more a question of determining biological or genetic discontinuities behind which one must then evaluate the morphological differences in order to make taxonomic determinations. In dealing with vascular plants we often are faced with a covert, or sometimes overt, convention-at least at the floristic level-that in the final analysis the dif-ferent taxa must be separable with a 10 X hand lens or else we are splitting the pie too thinly. This has its advantages as long as one is willing to compromise and gloss over some of the more complicated prob-lems in evolutionary diversity. If one wishes to classify on the basis of conven-ience, one could make a case for it.

40|$|The {{majority}} of species boundaries {{are based on}} morphology, {{under the assumption that}} <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> equate with reproductive incompatibility. In scleractinian corals, morphological boundaries between some species are indistinct, particularly where skeletal characters overlap to form a morphologic continuum between species. It has recently been discovered that at least some morphological species of coral are capable of interbreeding in vitro {{and it may be that}} events such as hybridisation could explain the high degrees of morphological variation recorded in many coral species and genera. In order to better understand the nature of species relationships and evolutionary processes within the Scleractinia, a detailed analysis of species boundaries within a single, representative genus - Platygyra - was carried out. A multivariate morphometric analysis based on nine skeletal characters indicated seven morphologically distinct species (including two undescribed species) were present within the genus Platygyra on the Great Barrier Reef. However, no diagnostic species characters were found. The range of skeletal variation within a morphological species was also examined and was found to be high, with discrete morphotypes occurring within the species Platygyra daedalea. Intra-specific morphological variation in corals is often attributed to environmental influences whereby colonies of the same species will display different morphologies in different environments. A transect survey of all species and morphs of Platygyra on Davies Reef, central Great Barrier Reef, indicated that all morphs and species occurred sympatrically in six different reef habitats. Similarly, a broad scale survey of Platygyra colonies on reefs around Australia showed all species and morphs were widespread and common across their range. The sympatric distribution of Platygyra species suggest morphological variation in these corals is not a result of environmental influences at either a between-reef or within-reef scale. Fertilisation trials between morphological species of Platygyra showed all seven species are capable of hybridisation in vitro.

As a pixel classifier, to within a moderate <b>morphological</b> tolerance, the <b>discontinuity</b> detector has an accuracy of 99 % on the images for which it has been tested...|$|R
40|$|Background: Neotropical {{freshwater}} stingrays (Batoidea: Potamotrygonidae) host {{a diverse}} parasite fauna, including cestodes. Both cestodes and their stingray hosts are marine-derived, but the taxonomy of this host/parasite system is poorly understood. Methodology: Morphological and molecular (Cytochrome oxidase I) data {{were used to}} investigate diversity in freshwater lineages of the cestode genus Rhinebothrium Linton, 1890. Results {{were based on a}} phylogenetic hypothesis for 74 COI sequences and morphological analysis of over 400 specimens. Cestodes studied were obtained from 888 individual potamotrygonids, representing 14 recognized and 18 potentially undescribed species from most river systems of South America. Results: Morphological species boundaries were based mainly on microthrix characters observed with scanning electron microscopy, and were supported by COI data. Four species were recognized, including two redescribed (Rhinebothrium copianullum and R. paratrygoni), and two newly described (R. brooksi n. sp. and R. fulbrighti n. sp.). Rhinebothrium paranaensis Menoret & Ivanov, 2009 is considered a junior synonym of R. paratrygoni because the morphological features of the two species overlap substantially. The diagnosis of Rhinebothrium Linton, 1890 is emended to accommodate the presence of marginal longitudinal septa observed in R. copianullum and R. brooksi n. sp. Patterns of host specificity and distribution ranged from use of few host species in few river basins, to use of as many as eight host species in multiple river basins. Significance: The level of intra-specific morphological variation observed in features such as total length and number of proglottids is unparalleled among other elasmobranch cestodes. This is attributed to the large representation of host and biogeographical samples. It is unclear whether the intra-specific morphological variation observed is unique to this freshwater system. Nonetheless, caution is urged when using <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> to delimit elasmobranch cestode species because the amount of variation encountered is highly dependent on sample size and/or biogeographical representation.

40|$|The {{primitive}} woody Angiosperm family Winteraceae is centred in {{the southwest}} Pacific, has an outpost in Madagascar (1 species), and a section of Drimys (4 species) in the New World. Pseudowintera is restricted to New Zealand, the Old World section Tasmannia of Drimys extends from the Philippines to Tasmania. Since A. C. Smith’s review {{of the family in}} 1943 about ten times as much material has become available and it appears that the taxonomy of the section Tasmannia is far more complicated than it seemed to be in 1943. This induced me to make a field study in New Guinea and to pay special attention to its morphology in the hope of finding additional criteria. On this basis the Australian species of Drimys could be better defined but the characters of the New Guinean taxa (Smith: 29 species) proved to be highly unstable. It was found that in the section Tasmannia the stomata are occluded by waxy plugs. The structure of the inflorescence is described and compared with that in section Drimys. In the flower two zones are distinguished. In the lower zone the floral appendages are arranged in (sub) opposite pairs, in the higher zone they are arranged according to the space available at the greatest possible distance from a focus of the floral apex which I termed ‘activity centre’; this centre often does not coincide with the ‘topographical apex’. The tilt of the floral apex appears to influence the arrangements as well. Shifting of determination factors in relation to the available locations on the floral apex is assumed to play an important role. As for the specific delimitation, the New Guinean material appeared to be the crux. The very heterogeneous material did not show correlated discontinuities in characters, which made it impossible to reach a division into species. The variability of the resulting very complex species Drimys piperita is described {{with the aid of a}} non-taxonomic subdivision, the units of wich are called ‘entities’. Field studies revealed that local populations are often very stable, but the <b>morphological</b> <b>discontinuities</b> between such local populations are obscured by material from other localities. It is supposed that vegetative propagation as observed in the field, combined with incidental cross-breeding, may be of importance in establishing such a situation. In Australia besides D. piperita four other species can be distinguished. The sections of Drimys are maintained, although Ehrendorfer c. s. and Smith proposed raising them to generic rank. In Pseudowintera the arrangement within the inflorescence is spiral, not decussate as described earlier, and a terminal flower is present. Minute hairs on bracts and young leaves, the mode of opening of the calyx cupule, and details of the lower leaf surface are used as a new set of specific characters. The fact that about twenty per cent of the specimens show varying combinations of specific characters is thought to be caused by hybridisation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Distinguishing {{individual}} Russula {{species has}} been difficult due to extensive phenotypic plasticity and obscure <b>morphological</b> and anatomical <b>discontinuities.</b> Due to highly similar macroscopic features, such {{as the presence of}} a red-cap, species identification within the Russula subgenus Amoenula is particularly difficult. Three species of the subgenus Amoneula have been reported in Korea. We used a combination of morphology and three molecular markers, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 28 S nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU), and RNA polymerase II gene (RPB 2), for identification and study of the genetic diversity of Russula subgenus Amoenula in Korea. We identified only two species in Korea (R. mariae and R. violeipes); these two species were indistinguishable according to morphology and LSU, but were found to be reciprocally monophyletic species using ITS and RPB 2. The markers, ITS, LSU, and RPB 2, have been tested in the past for use as DNA barcoding markers, and findings of our study suggest that ITS and RPB 2 had the best performance for the Russula subgenus Amoneula...|$|R
40|$|Distinguishing {{individual}} Russula {{species can}} be very difficult due to extensive phenotypic plasticity and obscure <b>morphological</b> and anatomical <b>discontinuities.</b> In this study, we use the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28 S nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU) markers to identify and study the genetic diversity of species in the Russula subgenus Compacta in Korea. We focus on two morphologically similar species that are often misidentified for each other: R. nigricans and R. subnigricans. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, we identify three subgroups of R. nigricans, with two from Asia and one from Europe/North America. Surprisingly, we find Korean R. subnigricans are {{more closely related to}} R. eccentrica from North America than the type specimen of R. subnigricans from Japan. These molecular data, along with habitat data, reveal that Korean R. subnigricans had previously been misclassified and should now be recognized as R. eccentrica. Both ITS and LSU exhibit high interspecific and low intraspecific variation for R. eccentrica, R. nigricans, and R. subnigricans. These markers provide enough resolutional power to differentiate these species and uncover phylogeographic structure, and will be powerful tools for future ecological studies of Russula...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} of Infrared Thermography (IRT) as a novel operational tool for landslide surveying, mapping and characterization was tested and demonstrated in different case studies, by analyzing various types of instability processes (rock slide/fall, roto-translational slide-flow). In particular, IRT was applied, both from terrestrial and airborne platforms, in an integrated methodology with other geomatcs methods, such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and global positioning systems (GPS), for the detection and mapping of landslides’ potentially hazardous structural and <b>morphological</b> features (structural <b>discontinuities</b> and open fractures, scarps, seepage and moisture zones, landslide drainage network and ponds). Depending on the study areas’ hazard context, the collected remotely sensed data were validated through field inspections, {{with the purpose of}} studying and verifying the causes of mass movements. The challenge of this work is to go beyond {{the current state of the}} art of IRT in landslide studies, with the aim of improving and extending the investigative capacity of the analyzed technique, in the framework of a growing demand for effective Civil Protection procedures in landslide geo-hydrological disaster managing activities. The proposed methodology proved to be an effective tool for landslide analysis, especially in the field of emergency management, when it is often necessary to gather all the required information in dangerous environments as fast as possible, to be used for the planning of mitigation measures and the evaluation of hazardous scenarios. Advantages and limitations of the proposed method in the field of the explored applications were evaluated, as well as general operative recommendations and future perspectives...|$|R
