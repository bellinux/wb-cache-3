500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>father</b> cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery {{turned down}} an offer to cameo as Henry Jones, Sr., as he found {{retirement}} too enjoyable. Lucas stated that in hindsight it was good that Connery did not briefly appear, as it would disappoint the audience when his character would not join the film's adventure. Ford joked, [...] "I'm old enough to play <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>father</b> in this one." [...] The film addresses Connery's absence by Indiana implying that both Henry, Sr. and Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliott in the previous films, who died in 1992) died before the film's events. Connery later stated that he liked the film, describing it as [...] "rather good and rather long." [...] Michael Sheard, who portrayed Adolf Hitler in the third film, expressed interest in appearing in the film, but he died in August 2005.|$|E
500|$|Ford was {{initiated}} into Freemasonry on September 30, 1949. He later said in 1975, [...] "When I took my obligation {{as a master}} mason—incidentally, with my three younger brothers—I recalled the value <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>father</b> attached to that order. But I {{had no idea that}} I would ever be added to the company of the Father of our Country and 12 other members of the order who also served as Presidents of the United States." [...] Ford was made a 33° Scottish Rite Mason on September 26, 1962. In April 1975, Ford was elected by a unanimous vote Honorary Grand Master of the International Supreme Council, Order of DeMolay, a position in which he served until January 1977. Ford received the degrees of York Rite Masonry (Chapter and Council degrees) in a special ceremony in the Oval Office on January 11, 1977, during his term as President of the United States.|$|E

[...] In regard to his opinion of Lee, Boo was quoted as saying, [...] "I look at him as how I would look at <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>father,</b> a powerful and distant figure for whom I have mixed feelings – a lot of gratitude, but also doubt." ...|$|E
