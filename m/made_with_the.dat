5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen in visible light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength surveys of the HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Spitzer Space Telescope. Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E
5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his {{coworkers}} produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> MIRC instrument on the CHARA array interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any main-sequence star, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E
