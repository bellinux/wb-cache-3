50|$|Sharfman and his wife, Nava, {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on the Mount Ainos in the Ioanian island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia,</b> Greece while en route to Corfu on April 29, 2009.|$|R
50|$|Mount Aenos or Ainos (Ancient Greek: Ὄρος Αἶνος; Modern Greek: Όρος Αίνος. Italian: Monte Nero or Montagna Nera) is {{the tallest}} {{mountain}} in the Ioanian island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia,</b> Greece, with an elevation of 1628 m.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Iannis - The island's unofficial, {{unlicensed}} doctor, {{who spends}} much of his time writing about the history <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia.</b> He is respected by the community, although regarded as a bit odd, and is thanked for his medical services by means of food and drink.|$|R
50|$|On the Greek island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia,</b> General Antonio Gandin, {{commander}} of the 12,000-strong Italian Acqui Division, decided to resist the German attempt to forcibly disarm his force. The battle raged from 13-22 September, when the Italians were forced to surrender after suffering some 1,300 casualties. The ensuing massacre of several thousand Italian prisoners of war by the Germans stands {{as one of the}} worst single war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Dr. Iannis, an {{experienced}} and multilingual doctor {{who has a}} well-established practice on the Greek island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia.</b> Iannis lives with his daughter Pelagia; Pelagia's mother died of tuberculosis when Pelagia was still a girl. Pelagia, now a young woman, is headstrong and intelligent, and has learned about medicine by observing her father. Some of the subsequent chapters, however, are told {{from the perspective of}} Carlo Guercio, a homosexual Italian man who has decided to join the Italian army which has been raised under the rule of Benito Mussolini during World War II.|$|R
40|$|It is 1941 and Captain Antonio Corelli, a young Italian officer, is {{posted to}} the Greek island <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia</b> as part <b>of</b> the occupying forces. At first he is ostracised by the locals, {{but as a}} conscien-tious but far from fanatical soldier, whose main aim {{is to have a}} {{peaceful}} war, he proves in time to be civilised, humorous - and a consumate musician. When the local doctor's daughter's letters to her fiance go unanswered, the working of the eternal triangle seems inevitable. But can this fragile love survive as a war of bestial savagery gets closer and the lines are drawn between invader and defender...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{theme of}} the novel is the study of history. Dr Iannis spends much of his spare time {{attempting}} to write a history <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia,</b> but he often finds his personal feelings and biasses running through whatever he writes. There is also a strong feeling against 'professional' history, which is suggested by Carlo Guercio's statement that [...] "I know that if we Axis win then there will be stories about mass graves in London and vice versa". This is reinforced by a quotation from Bernières which says that: [...] "history ought to be made up of the stories of ordinary people only." [...] From this viewpoint, {{it can be seen that}} Bernières is very much a revisionist historian, considering social history superior to political history.|$|R
50|$|Two other notable acts of {{brutality}} were the massacres of Italian troops at the islands <b>of</b> <b>Cephallonia</b> and Kos in September 1943, during the German {{takeover of the}} Italian occupation areas. In Cephallonia, the 12,000-strong Italian Acqui Division was attacked on September 13 by elements of 1. Gebirgs-Division with support from Stukas, and forced to surrender on 21 September after suffering some 1,300 casualties. The next day, the Germans began executing their prisoners and did not stop until more than 4,500 Italians had been shot. The 4,000 or so survivors were put aboard ships for the mainland, {{but some of them}} sank after hitting mines in the Ionian Sea, where another 3,000 were lost. The Cephallonia massacre serves as the background for the novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of mainstream liturgical churches require that sacramental wine should be pure grape wine. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, for example, sacramental wine {{used in the}} Divine Liturgy must usually be pure red grape wine, often sweet, though this is not required. Greek churches favour the use <b>of</b> <b>Mavrodaphne</b> or Nama, while Russian churches favour Kagor. Wines with additives, such as retsina, are not allowed.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of French rule, a Russo-Turkish fleet captured the island Zakynthos on 23 October 1798. From 1800 to 1807, the island was made part of the Septinsular Republic which consisted of the islands <b>of</b> Kerkyra, Zakynthos, <b>Cephallonia,</b> Lefkada, Ithaka, Paxos and Kythera. The Republic was nominally under sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire but protected by Russia. Russia appointed the Zakynthian nobleman, Georgios Motsenigos (1765-1836) as commissioner of the Republic and in turn appointed the Kerkyrian and future prime minister of independence Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias as secretary-general. The Zakynthian Spyridon Neranztis (1760-1833) was also recruited to help draft the various Constitutions of the Septinsular Republic and also became financial administrator. The administrative capital of the Septinsular Republic was in Kerkyra. It {{was the first time}} Greeks had been granted even limited self-government since the fall of the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottoman Empire in the mid-15th century. However, despite some hope for the national aspirations of Diaspora Greeks, its constitutional structure were not reflective of the will for self-determination by the peoples of the Ionian Islands. In 1800-1801, Britain attempted {{to take control of the}} Ionian islands after a revolt, under the leadership of James Callander Campbell but these intentions stopped after the Peace of Amiens. In 1807, the Septinsular Republic was ceded to Napoleon's First French Empire, but the islands were not annexed by France, keeping their institutions of government. The British gradually took control of the islands, and following the Treaty of Paris.|$|R
