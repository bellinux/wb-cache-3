30|$|In general, many {{different}} terminologies {{are related to}} business failure, such as firm closure, entrepreneurial exit, dissolution, discontinuance, insolvency, organizational mortality, and bankruptcy (Cardozo & Borchert [2004]). Typically, entrepreneurial failure {{is defined as the}} cease of an operation for financial reasons, but one type of entrepreneurial failure is the discontinuance of venturing efforts by entrepreneurs (Liao et al. [2008]). In particular, definitions of business “disappearance”, “closure”, “exit”, and “failure” are confusing and often overlapping (Cardozo & Borchert [2004]; Stokes & Blackburn [2002]). Nonetheless, a failed business is the one which have to sell or liquidate in order to avoid losses or pay off the creditors, or the one which is unable to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profitable <b>go</b> <b>of</b> the business (Gaskill et al. [1993]). Pretorius ([2009]) reviewed the business failure definitions, and suggested a universal definition for the failure phenomenon: “a venture fails when it involuntarily becomes unable to attract new debt or equity funding to reverse decline; consequently, it cannot continue to operate under the current ownership and management” (Pretorius [2009]).|$|R
