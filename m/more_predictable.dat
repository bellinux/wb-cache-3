Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E

5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often <b>more</b> <b>predictable</b> and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
5|$|After he was rammed by his {{teammate}} Brian Vickers in the UAW-Ford 500, Johnson said the expectations {{for him to}} succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be <b>more</b> <b>predictable.</b> Martin {{said he was in}} the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is {{a species that}} is found in both urban and rural habitats. There are now more {{northern mockingbird}}s living in urban habitats than non-urban environments, so they are consequently known as an urban-positive species. Biologists have long questioned how northern mockingbirds adapt to a novel environment in cities, and whether they fall into the typical ecological traps that are common for urban-dwelling birds. A comparative study between an urban dwelling population and a rural dwelling one shows that the apparent survival is higher for individuals in the urban habitats. Lower food availability and travel costs {{may account for the}} higher mortality rate in rural habitats. Urban birds are more likely to return to the nest where they had successfully bred the previous year and avoid those where breeding success was low. One explanation for this phenomenon is that urban environments are <b>more</b> <b>predictable</b> than non-urban ones, as the site fidelity among urban birds prevents them from ecological traps. Mockingbirds are also able to utilize artificial lighting in order to feed nestlings in urban areas such as residential neighborhoods into the night in contrast to those that do not nest near those areas. The adaptation of mockingbirds in urban habitats has led it to become more susceptible to lead poisoning in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the {{investigation}} into Wheldon's death were released on December 15, 2011. In a report prepared by crash investigators, it was found that Wheldon's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit. Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident, stating that it created two ideal racing lines, and that these lines made the location of cars <b>more</b> <b>predictable</b> for other drivers; {{at the time of the}} accident, all 34 cars had been behaving as expected. The report also revealed that the right front pull rod of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon's survival cell, though it did not cause him any injury. The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon, as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the IR03 and later IR05 model chassis, which was being retired at the end of the race. The pull-rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates {{the needs of students}} with smaller class sizes, staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, <b>more</b> <b>predictable</b> environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E

40|$|This note {{conducts a}} simple test for myopia and {{liquidity}} constraints in aggregate U. S. consumption. The test exploits the fact that, under myopia, consumption should be equally sensitive to predictable income declines and increases, while under liquidity constraints consumption should be <b>more</b> sensitive to <b>predictable</b> income increases than to declines. Using quarterly postwar data, the author shows that aggregate consumption {{is in fact}} <b>more</b> sensitive to <b>predictable</b> income declines than increases. This 'perverse asymmetry' is inconsistent with both myopia and liquidity constraints but is qualitatively consistent with recent theoretical work incorporating loss aversion into intertemporal preferences.

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the falling cost of genome sequencing and the accompanying rise in available genomic data, scientific interest in RiPPs has increased in the last few decades. Because the chemical structures of RiPPs are <b>more</b> closely <b>predictable</b> from genomic data than are other natural products (e.g. alkaloids, terpenoids), their presence in sequenced organisms can, in theory, be identified rapidly. This makes RiPPs an attractive target of modern natural product discovery efforts.|$|R
