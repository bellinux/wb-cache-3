40|$|A {{physically}} based distributed {{slope stability}} model is described that utilizes a combined surface-subsurface kinematic wave module to assess groundwater fluctuations related to slope stability. A total of 82 major rainstorms from 1972 to 1990 in Carnation Creek, British Columbia, were examined {{to determine the}} influence of different characteristics of rainstorms (such as mean and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> intensity, duration, and rainfall amount) on the slope stability. These rainstorms vary in mean intensity from 16 to 112 mm h- 1, storm duration from 11 to 93 h, and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> intensity from 34 to 35 mm h- 1. Four synthetic 'uniform intensity' rainstorms were also tested against real storms to assess the effect of short-term hourly rainfall intensity peaks on landslide occurrence. Altogether, 602 simulations were conducted. The combined influence of mean and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> intensity, duration, and total rainfall amount of rainstorms were important in generating landslides. The temporal distribution of short-term intensity also influenced the landslide occurrence. When saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil was lowered or soil depth was raised, most rainstorms produced larger numbers of landslides. For the most part, actual rainstorms produced less stable conditions than their synthetic 'uniform intensity' counterparts. For all landslide-producing storms, slope failure usually occurred after some threshold of cumulative rainfall and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall intensity. These simulations provide insights into the distributed behaviour of landslide occurrence during large rainstorms with varying characteristics. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Outdoor {{environmental}} {{risk factors for}} asthma have been extensively researched, even though the majority of a person 2 ̆ 7 s daily activity occurs indoors. There is limited evidence linking personal exposure concentrations of ozone, pollen, mold, temperature, and humidity to childhood asthma. ^ The current study consisted of a secondary, more complex {{analysis of the data}} from the Houston Air Toxics and Asthma in Children (ATAC) Study to further investigate the association of personal ozone exposure on asthma outcome variability among middle school children with asthma. The ATAC Study primarily investigated the association between selected oxygenated air toxics and indicators of asthma variability (PEFR, FEV 1, asthma symptoms, and rescue medication usage) among 30 labile and persistent Houston middle-school children with diagnosed asthma. This panel study used a repeated measurements design of four separate 10 -day sampling periods that extended over a 20 month period. The secondary analysis included aggregate regression models that were constructed with two different estimates of ozone exposure (daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> outdoor concentration and daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal exposure), with three different estimates of personal environmental temperature and humidity exposures (daily average, intraday difference, and interday difference), and for thee different time periods [same day of exposure (lag 0), one day after initial exposure (lag 1), and two days after initial exposure (lag 2) ]. ^ Overall, the models using daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposures in combination with intraday and interday personal temperature and humidity differences produced more significant plausible associations than models using daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposures with personal average temperature and humidity exposures. Significant associations were identified between daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposure and clinical indicators of asthma variability. The increasing effect on rescue medication usage from daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> personal ozone exposure were identified as soon as the same day of exposure (lag 0; p= 0. 0072), and the same effects were delayed until the second next day (lag 2; p= 0. 0026). The increasing effect on asthma symptoms were identified on the second next day after initial exposure (lag 2; p= 0. 0024). There was a consistent inverse relationship between personal relative humidity exposure and indicators of asthma variability. Decreasing effects on daily FEV 1 variability from personal relative humidity exposure were identified on the same day of exposure (lag 0; p= 0. 034), increasing effects on morning PEFR were identified on the next day after initial exposure (lag 1; p= 0. 0001), and decreasing effects on overnight PEFR variability were identified on the second next day after the initial exposure (lag 2; p= 0. 007). With the conclusion of this research, there are opportunities for future similar studies in the preventive management of asthma in children living in high-ozone areas. ...|$|R

The relationship of the daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> ozone values with meteorological variables, including near surface air temperature and relative humidity and with air pollution variables like the persistency of ozone levels and its seasonal variation is examined.

Multiple linear regression analysis has been performed to establish the relationship between the above mentioned parameters and peak ozone concentration. The agreement between observed and predicted daily <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> ozone values is very good, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0. 87.

The main steps necessary to characterize a districtheating plant are shown and twocase-studies are discussed. As far as the energetic aspects are concerned, these new plants always offer a primary energy saving, and the globalenvironmentaleffects are improved due to a reduction in CO 2. Local NOx emissions of a future plant do not decrease with respect to the existing emissions, and this aspect is closely connected to the type of CHP unit that is adopted (in this paper, natural gas fuelled engines).

In another study for summer cooling, it was noted that maximum air temperature drop was observed at 2  m/s and <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> cooling was observed at air velocity 5  m/s (Bansal et al. 2010). Similar results were also obtained by Wu et al. (2007) for cooling operation, by increasing air velocity (from 1 to 4  m/s); the outlet air temperature jumps to higher values, but the heat transfer rate increases because of increase in mass flow rate. Dubey et al. (2013) observed that, by increasing air velocity from 4.1 to 11.6  m/s, the air temperature drop reduced from 8.6 to 4.18  °C, and COP also decreased from 6.4 to 3.6. In an experimental study, Bisoniya et al. (2014) considered three different velocities (2, 3.5, and 5  m/s) for an EATHE pipe of 0.1  m diameter and 19.2  m length. The observed maximum and minimum drops in air temperature were 12.9 and 11.3  °C, at air flow velocities of 2 and 5  m/s, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of ground level {{distribution}} of ozone in Pisa (Italy) in the periods May to September, 1986 - 1991. The recurrence of relevant levels of photochemically produced ozone is described. The <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> peak (M 1) proved to be 128 ppb and {{the average of the}} M 1 peaks turned out to be 60 ppb. The threshold of 100 ppb was surpassed in 17 d. The average value of the 'daily highest consecutive 7 -h mean concentrations' (M 7) was 53 ppb. M 1 and M 7 are closely correlated and both show approximately a log-normal distribution. Monthly variations are relatively low, with September showing the lowest values. The years 1986 and 1991 show values that are clearly higher than the other years, and no temporal trend has been verified. Ozone levels were positively correlated with temperature and solar radiation.

40|$|Baiu-fronts and typhoons {{passing through}} {{southern}} Kyushu and its adjacent area often bring about extraordinarily heavy rainfall, and, consequently, result dangerous floods and collapses of hill-slopes with Shirasu. Shirasu, which is widely distributed over souhern Kyushu, is very susceptible to water erosion {{and ready to}} collapse. This paper deals with the failure of hill-slope that occurs {{in the period of}} heavy rainfall. In this paper, the author classifies the failure of hill-slope into ten basic types according to the features of slope-movements and describes their causes for failures briefly. The hill-slopes with Shirasu are likely to be led to the most frequent collapses in the event of the rainfall exceeding about 300 mm during a spell of rain and in less than several hours after the time when the <b>maximum</b> <b>hourly</b> rainfall has occurred...|$|R
