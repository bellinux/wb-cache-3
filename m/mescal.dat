Although he {{reinforces}} the behaviour that causes hatred for Linda in Malpais by sleeping with her and bringing her <b>mescal,</b> he still holds the traditional beliefs of his tribe. In his early years John also attempts to kill him. He gave Linda {{a copy of the}} Complete Works of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 the Mexicans {{once again}} {{attacked}} the Apache. After months of {{fighting in the}} mountains, the Apaches and Mexicans decided on a peace treaty at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico. After terms were agreed, the Mexican troops gave <b>mescal</b> to the Apaches and, while they were intoxicated, they attacked and killed 20 Apaches and captured some. The Apache were forced to retreat into the mountains once again.|$|E
25|$|The town of Santiago Matatlán {{calls itself}} the world capital of mezcal. The best known {{producer}} here is Rancho Zapata, {{which also has}} a restaurant. It is owned by a man that goes only {{by the name of}} Tío (uncle) Pablo, who won first prize for his <b>mescal</b> in Chicago in 2003. In many parts of the Central Valleys area, one can find small stands and stores selling locally made mezcal on roadsides.|$|E

25|$|The {{abundant}} agave (<b>mescal)</b> {{was also}} important to the Mescalero, who gathered the crowns in late spring after reddish flower stalks appeared. The smaller sotol crowns were also important. Both crowns of both plants were baked and dried.

25|$|The most {{important}} plant food {{used by the}} Chiricahua was the Century plant (also known as <b>mescal</b> or agave). The crowns (the tuberous base portion) of this plant (which were baked in large underground ovens and sun-dried) and also the shoots were used.

500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in October 1993, but was delayed because Crowe was busy on another film in Australia. Principal photography for The Quick and the Dead lasted from November 21, 1993 to February 27, 1994. Locations included Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and <b>Mescal,</b> 40 miles southeast of Tucson. Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems. Thell Reed, who was hired as the gun coach and weapons master, worked with the cast through over three months of training. To age Cort's Colt 1851 Navy Revolver and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures. [...] "I took them out by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust," [...] he explained. [...] "They looked rusty and old, but were brand new guns." [...] Such detail, including the nickel plating and ivory handles on Ellen's Colt Peacemakers, was accurate to the time period.|$|E
500|$|The Earp posse briefly {{returned}} to Tombstone, where Sheriff Behan {{tried to stop}} them. The heavily armed posse brushed him aside. Hairlip Charlie and Warren remained in Tombstone, and the rest set out for Pete Spence's wood camp in the Dragoon Mountains. They found and killed Florentino [...] "Indian Charlie" [...] Cruz. Two days later, near Iron Springs (later <b>Mescal</b> Springs), in the Whetstone Mountains, they were seeking to rendezvous with a messenger for them. They unexpectedly stumbled onto the wood camp of Curly Bill Brocius, Pony Diehl, and other outlaw Cowboys. According to reports from both sides, the two sides immediately exchanged gunfire. Except for Wyatt and Texas Jack Vermillion, whose horse was shot, the Earp party withdrew to find protection from the heavy gunfire. Curly Bill fired at Wyatt with a shotgun, but missed. Eighteen months prior, Wyatt had protected Curly Bill against a mob ready to lynch him, and then provided testimony that helped spare Curly Bill from a murder trial for killing Sheriff Fred White. Now, Wyatt returned Curly Bill's gunfire with his own shotgun and shot Curly Bill in the chest from about 50 feet (15m) away. Curly Bill fell into the water by {{the edge of the}} spring and died.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} few years, Burnham worked as a mounted {{messenger}} for the Western Union Telegraph Company in California and Arizona Territory. On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by Tiburcio Vásquez, a famous Californio bandit. At 14, he began {{his life as a}} scout and Indian tracker in the Apache Wars, during which he took part in the United States Army expedition to find and capture or kill the Apache chief Geronimo. In Prescott, Arizona, he met an old scout named Lee who served under General George Crook. Lee taught Burnham how to track Apache by detecting the odor of burning <b>mescal,</b> a species of aloe they often cooked and ate. With careful study of the local air currents and canyons, trackers could follow the odor to Apache hiding places {{from as far away as}} 6 miles (9.7km). During the Apache uprisings, the young Burnham also learned much from Al Sieber, the Chief of Scouts, and his assistant Archie McIntosh, who had been Chief of Scouts in Crook's last two campaigns. Burnham learned much about scouting from these Indian trackers, who were advanced in age and fading from the frontier, including the vital lesson that [...] "it is imperative that a scout should know the history, tradition, religion, social customs, and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among." [...] But the scout who was to have perhaps the greatest influence on Burnham during his formative years was a man named Holmes.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly he {{sprang to}} his feet, almost {{upsetting}} the boat. [...] "He's like <b>Mescal's</b> Wolf!" [...] He looked closer, his heart beginning to thump, {{and then he}} yelled: [...] "Ki-yi! Wolf! Hyer! Hyer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's gone!" [...] cried Snap Naab. He {{ran into}} the hall, into <b>Mescal's</b> room, and {{returned}} trailing the white wedding-dress. [...] "The time we thought she spent to put this on she's been--" ...|$|R

2500|$|Mezcal (or <b>mescal)</b> (...) is a {{distilled}} {{alcoholic beverage}} made from {{any type of}} agave plant native to Mexico. The word mezcal comes from Nahuatl mexcalli [...] metl [...] and ixcalli [...] which means [...] "oven-cooked agave".|$|E

2500|$|During the Earp Vendetta Ride, Wyatt Earp {{killed one}} of Ringo's closest friends, [...] "Curly Bill" [...] Brocius, in a gunfight at Iron Springs (later <b>Mescal</b> Springs) about [...] from Tombstone. Earp told his biographer, Stuart Lake, that Cruz confessed {{to being the}} lookout at Morgan's murder, and {{identified}} Ringo, Stilwell, Swilling, and Brocius as Morgan's killers, though modern researchers have cast doubt on Earp's account.|$|E
6000|$|The wind {{sang in the}} cedars. No {{longer a}} sigh, sad as {{thoughts}} of a past forever flown, but a song of what had come to him, of hope, of life, of <b>Mescal's</b> love, of the things to be! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Outrun!" [...] he cried, with blazing eyes. <b>Mescal's</b> {{white face}} was pressed {{close to his}} shoulder. [...] "Silver has beaten them. They'll hang on till we reach the sand-strip, hoping the {{slow-down}} will let them come up in time. But they'll be far too late." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{passed the}} Indian herding the sheep into a corral built against an {{uprising}} ridge of stone. Naab dispatched {{him to look}} for the dead coyotes.

2500|$|Its two {{component}} squadrons {{were the}} 570th and the 571st Strategic Missile Squadrons. [...] Launcher locations for the 570th Squadron were at Oracle, Three Points, Rillito (4 silos), and Oracle Junction, Arizona (3 silos). The 571st's silos were located at Benson (2 silos), <b>Mescal,</b> Pantano, Continental (2 silos), Palo Alto, and Three Points, Arizona. On 31 March 1963, the contractor turned site 570-2 over to SAC for operational use.|$|E
2500|$|On March 24, 1882, the Earp {{party was}} expecting to meet Charlie Smith at Iron Springs (later <b>Mescal</b> Springs), in the Whetstone Mountains. Charlie was {{bringing}} cash from Tombstone about [...] {{to the east}} to help pay posse expenses. As they surmounted {{the edge of a}} wash near the springs, they stumbled upon Brocius, Pony Diehl, Johnny Barnes, Frank Patterson, Milt Hicks, Bill Hicks, Bill Johnson, Ed Lyle, and Johnny Lyle, cooking a meal alongside the spring.|$|E
2500|$|Brocius had {{a number}} of {{conflicts}} with the lawmen of the Earp family, and he was named as one of the individuals who participated in Morgan Earp's assassination. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and a group of deputies including his brother Warren Earp pursued those they believed responsible for Morgan's death. The Earp posse unexpectedly encountered Curly Bill and other Cowboys on March 24, 1882, at Iron Springs (present day <b>Mescal</b> Springs). [...] Wyatt killed Curly Bill during the shootout. In his journal written in October 1881, George Parsons referred to Brocius as [...] "Arizona's most famous outlaw".|$|E
60|$|It came to Hare {{afterward}} with {{a little}} start of surprise that <b>Mescal's</b> purposeless, yet all-satisfying, watchful gaze {{had come to be}} part of his own experience. It was inscrutable to him, but he got from it a fancy, which he tried in vain to dispel, that something would happen to them out there on the desert.|$|R
60|$|Hare met the Bishop and {{his family}} with composure, but his arrival {{following}} so closely upon <b>Mescal's,</b> increased their alarm. They seemed repelled yet fascinated by his face. Hare ate in silence. John Caldwell did not come in to supper; his brothers mysteriously left the table before finishing the meal. A subdued murmur of voices floated in at the open window.|$|R

2500|$|In the August 1890 Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, [...] {{submitted}} by Indian Agent D.J.M. Wood, the total Tonkawa reservation population was counted at 76. Of this number, 14 were school children. They {{were described as}} a group who dressed in the white society's attire and attempted to speak only English. Many in the populace were identified as retired Government scouts and their wives. The agent stipulated these people should be cared for, in recognition of their government service. The only problem reported was alcohol and <b>mescal</b> bean addiction. The report called the Tonkawa [...] "ready and anxious" [...] to accept allotments.|$|E
2500|$|John Gregory Bourke {{described}} {{the use of}} [...] "mariguan", which he identifies as Cannabis indica or Indian hemp, by Mexican residents of the Rio Grande region of Texas in 1894. He described its uses for treatment of asthma, to expedite delivery, to keep away witches, and as a love-philtre. He also wrote that many Mexicans added the herb to their cigarritos or <b>mescal,</b> often taking a bite of sugar afterward to intensify the effect. Bourke wrote that because it was often used in a mixture with toloachi (which he inaccurately describes as Datura stramonium), mariguan {{was one of the}} several plants known as [...] "loco weed". Bourke compared mariguan to hasheesh, which he called [...] "one of the greatest curses of the East", citing reports that users [...] "become maniacs and are apt to commit all sorts of acts of violence and murder", causing degeneration of the body and an idiotic appearance, and mentioned laws against sale of hasheesh [...] "in most Eastern countries".|$|E
2500|$|Oaxacan cuisine {{varies widely}} {{due to the}} {{relative}} geographic isolation of its peoples, and the climates in which foods are produced. Oaxaca's gastronomy {{is known for its}} [...] "seven moles," [...] chapulines, Oaxaca tamales in banana leaves, tasajo and <b>mescal.</b> Regional variations include the wide variety of vegetables in the Central Valleys region, fish and shellfish in the Coast and Isthmus regions and the year-round availability of tropical fruit in the Papaloapan area on the Veracruz border. Like {{most of the rest of}} Mexico, corn is the staple food, with corn tortillas, called [...] "blandas" [...] accompanying most meals. Black beans are preferred. Oaxaca produces seven varieties of mole called manchamanteles, chichilo, Amarillo, rojo, verde, coloradito and negro. These moles and other dishes are flavored with a variety of chili peppers such as pasillas Oaxaqueños, amarillos, chilhuacles, chilcostles, chile anchos and costeños. Epazote, pitiona and hoja santa are favored herbs in Oaxacan cooking. The last is indispensable for the preparation of verde version of mole.|$|E
60|$|He was fainting, yet his sensations were {{singularly}} acute. <b>Mescal's</b> hand {{dropped from}} his shoulder; her cheek, {{that had been}} cold against his, grew hot; she quivered through all her slender length.
