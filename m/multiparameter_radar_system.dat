40|$|The natural {{cumulative}} {{distributions of}} rainfall observed by {{a network of}} rain gauges and a <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> are matched to derive <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> algorithms for rainfall estimation. Conventional usage of <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> measurements for rainfall estimation {{has been associated with}} tracking the variability of the raindrop size distribution. The use of <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> measurements in a statistical framework to estimate rainfall is presented in this paper. The techniques developed in this paper are applied to the radar and rain gauge measurement of rainfall observed in central Florida and central Italy. Conventional pointwise estimates of rainfall are also compared. The probability matching procedure, when applied to the radar and surface measurements, shows that <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> algorithms can match the probability distribution function better than the reflectivity-based algorithms, thereby indicating the potential of <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> measurements for statistical approach to rainfall estimation. It is also shown that the <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> algorithm derived matching the cumulative distribution function of rainfall provides more accurate estimates of rainfall on the ground in comparison to any conventional reflectivity-based algorithm...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multiparameter</b> <b>radars</b> measure {{one or more}} {{additional}} parameters {{in addition}} to the coventional reflectivity factor. The combination of radar observations from a <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> is used to study the time evolution of rainstorms. A technique is presented to self-consistently compare the area-time integral (ATI) and rainfall volume estimates from convective storms, using two different measurements from a <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar.</b> Rainfall volumes for the lifetime of individual storms are computed using the reflectivity at S band (10 -cm wavelength) as well as one-way specific attenuation at X band (3 -cm wavelength). Area-time integrals are computed by summing all areas in each radar snapshot having reflectivities (S band) in excess of a preselected threshold. The <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> data used in this study were acquired by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CP- 2 radar during the Cooperative Huntsville Meteorological Experiment (COHMEX) and the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CaPE), respectively. ATI studies were accomplished in this work using <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> data acquired during the lifetime of six convective events that occurred in the COHMEX radar coverage area. A case study from the COMHEX field campaign (20 July 1986) was selected to depict the various stages in the evolution of a storm over which the ATI and rainfall volume computations were performed using <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> data.

It was shown that C-band <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> contains information about particle density and the number concentration of the ice particles.

40|$|<b>Multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> and {{polarized}} microwave {{radiative transfer}} models for arbitrarily shaped particles are developed. The ice crystals modeled are horizontally oriented hexagonal plates, columns, and needles. The ice water content is fixed at 0. 1 g/cu m, and a realistic size distribution is used. The radar modeling {{is done for}} S through K-band, and the passive microwave calculations are at 37, 85, and 157 GHz. The modeling results show that particle shape is important for both <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> and passive microwave radiometry. Radar reflectivity and upwelling microwave brightness temperatures depend strongly on the individual particle volume, which in turn depends on the ice crystal shape. Radar differential reflectivity is high for the plates and lower for needles and columns. Linear depolarization calculations indicate that oblate ice crystals such as plates can be distinguished from prolate crystals such as columns. At 85 and 157 GHz, significant polarization brightness temperature differences are calculated for plates and columns. The particle bulk density strongly affects the radar and radiometer observables.

We have focused particular attention on combining both aircraft and SSM/I radiometer imagery with ground-based <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> observations. As part of this and the past NASA contract, we have developed a multi-stream, polarized radiative transfer model which incorporates scattering. The model has the capability to be initialized with cloud model output or <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> products. This model provides the necessary 'link' between the passive microwave radiometer and active microwave radar observations. This unique arrangement has allowed the brightness temperatures (TB) to be compared against quantities such as rainfall, liquid/ice water paths, and the vertical structure of the cloud.

40|$|Abstract—Rainfall {{estimation}} {{based on}} radar measurements {{has been an}} important topic in radar meteorology for more than four decades. This research problem has been addressed using two approaches, namely a) parametric estimates using reflectivity-rainfall relation (Z-R relation) or equations using <b>multiparameter</b> <b>radar</b> measurements such as reflectivity, differ-ential reflectivity, and specific propagation phase, and b) relations obtained by matching probability distribution functions of radar based estimates and ground observations of rainfall. In this paper we introduce a neural network based approach to address this problem by taking into account the three-dimensional (3 -D) struc-ture of precipitation. A three-layer perceptron neural network is developed for rainfall estimation from radar measurements. The neural network is trained using the radar measurements as the input and the ground raingage measurements as the target output. The neural network based estimates are evaluated using data collected during the Convection and Precipitation Electrification (CaPE) experiment conducted over central Florida in 1991. The results of the evaluation show that the neural network can be successfully applied to obtain rainfall estimates on the ground based on radar observations. The rainfall estimates obtained from neural network are shown to be better than those obtained from several existing techniques. The neural network based rainfall estimate offers an alternate approach to the rainfall estimation problem, and it can be implemented easily in operational weather <b>radar</b> <b>systems.</b> Index Terms—Multiparameter <b>radar,</b> neural networks, radar rainfall estimation.
