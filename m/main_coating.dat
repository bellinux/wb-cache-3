40|$|Rain erosion damage, {{caused by}} {{repeated}} droplet impact on wind turbine blades, {{is a major}} cause for concern, even more so at offshore locations with larger blades and higher tip speeds. Due to the negative economic influence of blade erosion, all wind turbine Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are actively seeking solutions. In most cases, since the surface coating plays a decisive role in the blade manufacture and overall performance, it {{has been identified as}} an area where a solution may be obtained. In this research, two <b>main</b> <b>coating</b> technologies have been considered: In-mould coatings (Gel coating) applied during moulding on the entire blade surface and the post-mould coatings specifically developed for Leading Edge Protection (LEP). The coating adhesion and erosion is affected by the shock waves created by the collapsing water droplets on impact. The stress waves are reflected and transmitted to the laminate substrate, so microstructural discontinuities in coating layers and interfaces play a key role on its degradation and may accelerate erosion by delamination. Analytical and numerical models are commonly used to relate lifetime prediction and to identify suitable coating and composite substrate combinations based on their potential stress reduction on the interface. Nevertheless, in order to use them, it is necessary to measure the contact adhesion resistance of the multi-layered system interfaces. The rain erosion performance is assessed using an accelerated testing technique, whereby the test material is repeatedly impacted at high speed with water droplets in a Whirling Arm Rain Erosion Rig (WARER). The materials, specifically the coating–laminate interphase region and acoustic properties, are further characterised by several laboratory tests, including Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), pull-off testing, peeling–adhesion testing and nanoindentation testing. This body of work includes a number of case studies. The first case study compares two of the <b>main</b> <b>coating</b> technologies used in industry (i. e., gel coating and LEP); the second case investigates the effects of the in-mould gel coating curing; and the third considers the inclusion of a primer layer on a LEP configuration system. Following these case studies, the LEP is found to be a far superior coating due to its appropriate mechanical and acoustic properties and the interface between the coating and the substrate is highlighted as a key aspect, as poor adhesion can lead to delamination and, ultimately, premature failure of the coating...|$|E

Excellent performance was achieved due to the synergy between V and C as <b>main</b> <b>coating</b> elements and the nanoscale multilayer structure of the coating. TiAlCN/VCN was deposited by the combined High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering/Unbalanced Magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS/UBM) technology. Macroparticle free V+ ion flux generated by HIPIMS discharge was used to sputter clean the substrates prior to the coating deposition.

In dry milling of Al 7010 -T 7651 alloy, TiAlCN/VCN nanoscale multilayer PVD coating outperformed state of the art Diamond Like Carbon (DLC, Cr/WC/a-CH) coating by factor of 4.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{deterioration}} modelling and performance assessment of metallic bridges affected by atmospheric corrosion, considering also {{the contribution of}} typical protective systems {{in the form of}} multi-layer coatings. The mechanisms leading to coating degradation are reviewed and the <b>main</b> <b>coating</b> types used by infrastructure owners are highlighted. Building on information contained in industry manuals, a simple model for coating degradation is proposed. Atmospheric corrosion models are then presented, with emphasis given to exposure classification, in line with corrosivity classification guidelines and recent research quantifying the influence of corrosion through dose–response functions. Coating degradation and corrosion models are integrated into a modelling framework, aimed at producing performance profiles of elements in metallic railway bridges. Finally, the framework is implemented in a case study in which a range of condition and resistance performance criteria are presented for different elements, such as girders and stiffeners, and their constituent parts, such as webs and flanges. It is shown that the proposed methodology is sufficiently detailed to enable differentiated performance predictions based on key external factors, and has scope for improvement, especially as coating and corrosion models are informed by the collection of field data...|$|E

Defective phage particles are not converted to infectious phages if the synthesis of the histidine-containing maturation protein is resumed in the host cells. Furthermore, arguments have been provided that viral messengers which are repressed for the biosynthesis of the viral RNA synthetase—presumably by specific combination with a few subunits of the <b>main</b> <b>coat</b> protein—might not be incorporated into infective particles.

The thickness of palagonite coating the chilled margins increases in the fragments found from the innerfloor axis towards the walls of the Rift Valley.

As {{a result of the}} evaluation, two <b>main</b> <b>coating</b> procedures were developed. In one, LOS was shown to coat efficiently in 0. 2 % TCA, at 37 °C, when incubated for only 30 min.

The new ELISA was compared to three previously reported ELISAs, and showed the greatest sensitivity, probably, {{as a consequence of the}} higher coating efficiency of LOS to plates. The biologic activity of LOS was not modified by the low TCA concentration used, as proven by retention of its biological activity in the induction of procoagulant activity in blood mononuclear cells.
