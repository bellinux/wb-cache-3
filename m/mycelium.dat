5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the <b>mycelium</b> is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the <b>mycelium</b> is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous <b>mycelium,</b> the <b>mycelium</b> would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} T.felleus {{have a high}} {{capacity}} to accumulate radioactive caesium (137Cs) from contaminated soil, a characteristic attributed to the deep soil penetration achieved by the <b>mycelium.</b> In contrast, the species has a limited capacity to accumulate the radioactive isotope 210Po.|$|E
5|$|Fruiting begins {{about six}} weeks after the initial {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of <b>mycelium</b> as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow {{very close to the}} initial site of inoculation—within 3mm—and take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form.|$|E
5|$|Several {{bioactive}} secondary metabolites {{have been}} isolated and identified from Volvariella bombycina fruit bodies, <b>mycelium,</b> or pure culture. The compounds ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraene-3-one, ergosterol peroxide, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and indazole {{were found in}} liquid culture. In 2009, the novel compound isodeoxyhelicobasidin was identified from culture broth; this compound inhibits the enzyme human elastase. The fungus also produces compounds that have antioxidative activity.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic <b>mycelium.</b> However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing <b>mycelium.</b> A specialized anatomical structure, called a clamp connection, is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|E
5|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of O.nidiformis fruit bodies is best seen in low-light conditions {{when the}} viewer's eyes have become dark-adapted. The gills {{are the most}} luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although {{the intensity of the}} luminescence is variable, William Henry Harvey once reported that it was bright enough to read a watch face by. It is not known if the <b>mycelium</b> is also luminescent.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The <b>mycelium</b> is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid <b>mycelium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the <b>mycelium</b> can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of <b>mycelium,</b> deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its <b>mycelium</b> in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E
5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus <b>mycelium</b> produces high levels of laccase, an oxidoreductase enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E
5|$|Sclerocitrin, a pigment {{compound}} originally {{isolated from}} the common earthball (Scleroderma citrinum), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the <b>mycelium</b> and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow pigment, chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E
5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to {{the dead}} insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes. A similar reason {{may account for the}} many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the <b>mycelium,</b> cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is an olive-brown colour. The oval to {{spindle-shaped}} spores have dimensions of 8–10 by 3.5–4.5μm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, measuring 22.4–33.4 by 5.8–8.0μm. They bear four sterigmata (each holding a single spore), which {{are up to}} 6.8μm long. Cystidia are present on both the tube ends (cheilocystidia) and tube faces (pleurocystidia). There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of Suillus bovinus. The cap cuticle comprises filamentous, gelatinized hyphae with a diameter of 2.6–5.0μm. The <b>mycelium</b> has a pink tinge.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is brown. Spores {{typically}} measure 8.0–9.0 by 4.0–5.5µm, {{and have an}} ellipsoid to oblong to ovoid shape, depending on the viewing angle. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 24–40 by 7–12µm. The cheilochrysocystidia (found on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measuring 30–55 by 4–40µm, with a neck that is 2–5µm wide. Pleurochrysocystidia (on the gill face) are 40–60 by 5–18µm with a 2–4µm-wide neck. Clamp connections are abundant in all tissues of S.caerulea. The fungus produces acanthocytes, which are spiny cells produced on short branches on the <b>mycelium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the <b>mycelium.</b> Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the <b>mycelium</b> develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the <b>mycelium</b> is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, having been recorded from Europe, North, Central, and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout the year. In British Columbia, Canada, {{it is sometimes}} found on maple, poplar, or pine, but is most abundant on red alder. It prefers to grow in habitats ranging from mesic to wet. The fungus grows parasitically on the <b>mycelium</b> of wood-rotting corticioid fungi in the genus Peniophora. Occasionally, T.mesenterica and its host fungus can be found fruiting together.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the <b>mycelium</b> can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow <b>mycelium</b> (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the <b>mycelium,</b> envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground <b>mycelium</b> {{and the young}} roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in distribution to California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies {{only a small percentage of}} ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E
5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common <b>mycelium,</b> A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus <b>mycelium</b> using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{and as such}} {{plays an}} important role in facilitating nutrient and water uptake by trees. It grows in association with birch (Betula) and hemlock (Tsuga) in mixed forests. It is also known to grow in urban settings when birch trees are nearby. A field study in Scotland concluded that the species is more likely to be present in older than in younger birch woodlands. Fruit bodies grow on the ground, scattered or grouped together. They are a component of the diet of the red squirrel, and serve as breeding sites for some fungus-feeding flies in the Drosophilidae and Mycetophilidae families. Lactarius torminosus mushrooms may be parasitized by the mold Hypomyces lithuanicus, which produces a cream-ochre to cinnamon-colored granular or velvety growth of <b>mycelium</b> on the surfaces of the gills and causes them to be deformed.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus <b>mycelium</b> has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus <b>mycelium</b> can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Panellus stipticus uses a heterothallic, tetrapolar mating system: each {{basidiospore}} develops into a self-sterile <b>mycelium</b> which, when grown alone, remains homokaryotic (i.e., {{with all}} cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of P.stipticus from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated allopatric populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, {{the results revealed}} a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and Oceanian collections, {{as well as between}} and within Oceanian collections.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the <b>mycelium</b> becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or {{clusters}} on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially oak and chestnut) {{during the spring}} and autumn. The fungus forms a white, woolly <b>mycelium</b> {{on the surface of}} decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, Japan, Malesia, Turkey, and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The mature <b>mycelium</b> {{consists}} of thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of Boletopsis nothofagi {{seems to be}} strongly connected to the {{occurrence of}} the southern beech Nothofagus fusca, a species of Fagales that is endemic to New Zealand. B.nothofagi has been found exclusively in N.fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37° S. The fungus forms a mycorrhizal association with the trees of N.fusca, in which the hyphae of the fungal <b>mycelium</b> wrap around {{the roots of the}} tree and penetrate the cortex, but not its cells. Subsequently, B.nothofagi takes over the function of the root hair and directs water and soil nutrients to the tree. In return, the fungus can, through contact with the root tissue, access the products of the tree's photosynthesis. The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May, the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The spore dust is olive to {{brownish}} olive. The spores are oval to somewhat -shaped, measuring 11–15μm long by 4.5–6.5μm wide. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (on the edges of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The <b>mycelium</b> is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white <b>mycelium</b> {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the nematodes primarily feed on fungal <b>mycelium.</b> If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the nematodes with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The nematodes are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} stipitate hydnoid fungi are {{hampered}} by {{a dearth of}} information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground <b>mycelium,</b> {{making it hard to}} determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P.niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers {{that can be used to}} detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P.melaleucus and P.niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction.|$|E
