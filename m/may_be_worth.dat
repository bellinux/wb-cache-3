On his 2010 income of $1.7million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, {{allowing them to}} reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. As per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> as much as $10million.|$|E
5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E

25|$|NB: Evidence {{from the}} Slavic {{language}} group {{suggests that it}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> revisiting this line of thought: compare Polish wiedźma (witch) / wiedzieć (to know) – the parts of these words highlighted in bold are pronounced the same i.e., roughly vee-edge. The aural similarity to “witch” is striking.|$|E

25|$|Mining is {{becoming}} a major industry in Nicaragua, contributing less than 1% {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP). Restrictions are being placed on lumbering due to increased environmental concerns about destruction of the rain forests.

25|$|These {{sorts of}} {{collections}} are not enjoyed by mainstream collectors and traditional collectors, {{even though they}} themselves may {{have in the past}} or continue to have pieces which could be considered part of an aesthetic collection. One of the issues with this category is that the coins can be seen to have less perceived value to speculators and appraisers. Secondly the coins may be produced artificially, that is coins can be exposed to substances which can create effects similar to those sought for aesthetic collections. This means that coins which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> more to historians, numismatists and collectors for their purposes will be destroyed by the process.|$|E
25|$|When {{a player}} commits a foul, {{or when the}} ball is deemed unplayable, play is resumed from a free-hit or a face-off. A free hit {{involves}} a player from one team to start play from {{the place where the}} ball was last deemed unplayable. A comparison of this is a free kick in soccer. For many fouls, such as stick infractions, a free hit is the only discipline provided. However, at the referee's discretion, a penalty <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> either two or five minutes. At that point, the player who committed the foul sits in the penalty area, and his team is short handed for the time of the penalty. If an 'extreme' foul is committed, such as physical contact or unsportsmanlike behavior, a player may receive a 10-minute penalty or even a match misconduct.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} size, tapirs have few natural predators, and even reports of killings by tigers are scarce. The main {{threat to the}} Malayan tapirs is human activity, {{including}} deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by the damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade. In Thailand, for instance, capture and sale of a young tapir <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> US$5500.00. In areas such as Sumatra, where the population is predominantly Muslim, tapirs are seldom hunted for food, as their physical similarity to pigs has made tapir meat a taboo, but in some regions they are hunted for sport or shot accidentally when mistaken for other animals. Protected status in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, which seeks to curb deliberate killing of tapirs but {{does not address the}} issue of habitat loss, has had limited effect in reviving or maintaining the population.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{the heyday}} of a placer gold rush would last only a few years. The free gold supply in stream beds would become {{depleted}} somewhat quickly, and the initial phase would be followed by prospecting for veins of lode gold that were the original source of the placer gold. Hard rock mining, like placer mining, may evolve from low capital investment and simple technology to progressively higher capital and technology. The surface outcrop of a gold-bearing vein may be oxidized, so that the gold occurs as native gold, and the ore needs only to be crushed and washed (free milling ore). The first miners may at first build a simple arrastra to crush their ore; later, they may build stamp mills to crush ore more quickly. As the miners dig down, they may find that the deeper part of vein contains gold locked in sulfide or telluride minerals, which will require smelting. If the ore is still sufficiently rich, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> shipping to a distant smelter (direct shipping ore). Lower-grade ore may require on-site treatment to either recover the gold or to produce a concentrate sufficiently rich for transport to the smelter. As the district turns to lower-grade ore, the mining may change from underground mining to large open-pit mining.|$|E

The club's manager Lee Johnson {{was reported}} to have expressed [...] "grave reservations" [...] about the signing, but was overruled by the club's owner Simon Corney.

500|$|On {{the ninth}} {{birthday}} of the severely ill Tamsin, parents Graham and Jan struggle with a camcorder and blow up balloons. A charity called WishmakerUK has arranged for pop star Frankie J Parsons to visit Tamsin. Frankie arrives, {{much to the}} excitement of Jan, accompanied by his personal assistant Si and WishmakerUK representative Sally. Frankie visits Tamsin in her bedroom, and blows up a purple balloon for her. He begins to struggle for breath and then collapses from an intracranial aneurysm. Later, Graham makes tea for Jan and Sally. Jan is upset about Frankie's death. Si says {{that no one can}} touch anything or call an ambulance until Frankie's manager arrives. Tamsin, sitting in her wheelchair, holds the balloon; and Graham and Si realise that it may be valuable. Si takes the balloon from Tamsin, and Graham ties it. Sally takes a call from her boss, but does not mention Frankie's death. She makes excuses to have a colleague cover for her on her next assignment so that she can stay at the house. Graham and Si argue over the balloon, and Graham gives it to Sally, as he considers her [...] "a neutral". He looks online to work out how much the balloon and accompanying footage <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast port of Incoming {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics. IGN opened their review by saying that, although the game [...] "is lacking in many areas, there's {{more than enough}} here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action." [...] Though criticizing the graphics' ability to [...] "get in the way at times," [...] the [...] "very vague" [...] mission briefings and the [...] "odd flying model for the planes," [...] the reviewer conceded that [...] "if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're {{looking for a good}} challenge, you'll probably want to look into Incoming." [...] GameSpy's review was harsher, describing the plot as [...] "the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type," [...] the multiplayer split screen mode as [...] "lame" [...] and the objectives as [...] "mundane." [...] The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as [...] "a bit dated," [...] the reviewer did acknowledge the [...] "nifty special effects" [...] and admitted that [...] "Incoming <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> a rental... is only slightly better than mediocre." [...] In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, GameVortex described the visuals as [...] "some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game."

[...] The review concluded by describing the game as [...] "lots of fun and highly recommended." ...|$|E
