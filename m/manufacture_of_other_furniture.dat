Also linear programming model is introduced to optimize the aggregate production planning problem. Application of the models in a furniture production company is evaluated to demonstrate that practical and beneficial solutions can be obtained from the models. Finally some benchmarking <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing industries was undertaken to assess relevance and level <b>of</b> use in <b>other</b> <b>furniture</b> firms...|$|R

From these results, total 5 subclasses with very low ratios of SMEs were excluded in the further analysis of market concentration: the KSIC code (1) 24211 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> smelting, refining, and alloys of copper, 6  %), (2) 26120 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> diodes, transistors, and similar semi-conductor devices, 13  %), (3) 26211 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> liquid crystal flat display boards, 4  %), (4) 26422 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> mobile phone, 0.4  %), and (5) 30121 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> passenger motor vehicles 0.01  %).

Changes in companies' segment orientation between 2002 and 2005 are examined and the factors of these changes are discussed. The analysis {{is based on a}} survey of 77 companies. The data support the hypothesis that there exist segments in the consumer goods market, defined by the income level of customers. In the capital goods market, it is shown that domestic-owned customers are the low-end segment of the market, whereas foreign-owned customers constitute a higher segment. It seems that industries producing capital goods have shifted towards higher market segments between 2002 and 2005 and their principal motive was the pressure exerted by competitors, both domestic and foreign. product differentiation, quality, competitiveness, manufacturing. ...|$|R
