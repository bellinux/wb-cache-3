2500|$|Hayek's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} economics is widely acknowledged. Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics, which is particularly striking since his own lecture was critical of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical <b>modelisation.</b> A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award but nevertheless claimed that [...] "there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last {{half of the twentieth century}} economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 (and the 1931–2007) historical scene". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and Böhm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher, Joseph Schumpeter, to have been wrong on the central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.|$|E

40|$|Towards a {{linguistic}} modeling of writing models {{of high school}} learners writers Abstract Focusing on writing from a didactic aspect is to present it as a complex activity that requires the mobilization of much knowledge and a multitude of procedures. Writing represents a language phenomenon, it becomes a language in the fullest sense and a new order of language practices is established that some call it scriptural (Peytard 1970 Dabène 1987). Our purpose is to analyze the final product, {{the result of the}} editorial process (SC Thomas, 2000). In fact, we present the study and analysis of a corpus which presents the written productions of High school learners that reflect their actual skills. It is a question of observing the linguistic modeling required for the learners' written productions that rely on relevant parameters of semantics, cognitive psychology (Fayol, 1996) and the socio-cultural dimension (Dabène 1996). Do these processes, practiced by learners writers, provide a guarantee of success valuing a written production? We then examine the transposition of models mentioned in the written productions and configurations of writers with regard to their scripts. Finally, we conclude with the clarification of editorial measures offering insight into writing as a recursive activity evolving through the support models that require recurrences depending {{on the nature of the}} written production. Educational recommendations, based on all observations are advanced to locate the practical framework of learners/writers writing activities.

40|$|The {{influence}} of random perturbations of high intensity accelerator elements on the beam losses is considered. This influence is analyzed {{with the help}} of the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to allow loss estimates for a very low fraction of the beam. Many fields of modern science and engineering have to deal with events which are rare but have significant consequences. EVT is considered to provide the basis for the statistical modeling of such extreme events (extreme variations of financial market for insurance companies or extreme wind speed for electric companies). To illustrate the application of this theory to beam losses estimates, the SPIRAL 2 driver is used.

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{accuracy}} now reached by space geodetic techniques, and also considering some <b>modelisations,</b> the temporal variations of some Earth Gravity Field coefficients can be determined. They are due to Earth oceanic and solid tides, as well as geophysical reservoirs masses displacements. They {{can be related to}} the variations in the Earth's orientation parameters (through the inertia tensor). Then, we can try to improve our knowledge of the Earth Rotation with those space measurements of the Gravity variations. We have undertaken such a study, using data obtained with the combination of space geodetic techniques. In particular, we use CHAMP data that are more sensitive to such variations and that complete the ones already accumulated (for example with Starlette and LAGEOS I). In this first approach, we focus on the Earth precession nutation, trying to refine it by taking into account the temporal variations of the Earth dynamical flattening. The goal is mainly to understand how Geodesy can influence this field of science. Like this, {{we will be able to}} compare our computation with up to date determinations of precession nutation...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to tackle}} the {{question}} of automatic translation of languages, from a psycholinguistic viewpoint. We shall consider the issue {{in relation to the}} following problematic areas: intra- and extra-linguistic interactions between dialogues and, more particularly, interactions between cultural substratum's. An ALT (Automatic Language Translation) system should be able to pick out the connections between what is said, by whom and to whom, and incorporate the cultural and developmental variables. The works presented here illustrate the complexity involved in constructing a method for the exchange of information between source language and target language, especially when the formatting can differ in many ways, for example in spatial and contextual dimensions. In fact, one cannot effectively use computers to study dialogues without first analysing the cognitive complexity of the representations generated by individual cultural and linguistic substratum's.

40|$|Proceedings of the Molecular Spectroscopy Science Meeting 2015; Open Access {{funded by}} Creative Commons Atribution Licence 3. 0 The strong {{indications}} of the untapped potential of Carbon-based nanostructured materials as next-generation sorbents come mainly from simulation and theoretical work [1]. Dispersive interactions {{among the various}} carbon nanostructures (graphene, nanotubes, etc) {{as well as with}} guest molecules (H 2, CO 2, etc) are {{at the core of the}} relevant physical mechanisms involved. However, the vast majority of the “in-silico” studies rely on effective pairwise descriptions of the dispersive forces (Lennard-Jones). Recent developments of new van-der-Waals DFT functionals [2] provide a convenient starting point to attain a more accurate representation. By making recourse of the SCARF-RAL cluster we have calculated the energy barriers involved in a specific type of stacking fault in graphite using a dispersive DFT functional. The calculations agree well with the experimental data but, the comparison with the standard pairwise potential calculations reveals a discrepancy of an order of magnitude. We show here our ongoing study of the limits as well as of possible improvements of classical pairwise <b>modelisations</b> of the interlayer interactions. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{numerous}} {{scientific and}} engineering fields, sensitivity analysis tools {{are essential for}} design optimization as well as uncertainty quantification. For instance, adjoint algorithms are common place in aerospace engineering {{when it comes to}} optimize the shape of an airfoil, the configuration of a rocket or to quantify the impact of a manufacturing imperfection on the performance of a product. The quantities of interest are long-time averaged outputs such as the average drag on a plane wing. However, these conventional methods fail to compute the right sensitivity when the physical model exhibits chaos. This is the case of many turbulent fluid flows and atmospheric <b>modelisations.</b> A recently developed method, Least Squares Shadowing or simply LSS, tackles this problem and proposes an alternative approach to compute the desired sensitivities.

However, growth can neither be infinite nor reach a finite steady state at an infinite asymptotic time. Moreover before some decay, some growth must have occurred. For example, some levelling-off could occur at finite time, followed either by some growth again or then by some decay. Numerous examples show that the Verhulst and Gompertz <b>modelisations</b> are too reductive (or restrictive) descriptions of their original purpose. It is aimed, in the present note, to encompass into ONE simple differential equation the growth AND decay features of, e. g., population sizes, or numbers, but also of many other measured characteristics found in social and physical science systems. Previous generalisations of Verhulst or Gompertz functions are recalled. It is shown that drastic growth or decay jumps or turnovers can be readily described through drastic changes in values of the growth or decay rate. However smoother descriptions can be found if the growth or decay rate is modified in order to take into account some time or size dependence. Similar arguments can be carried through, but not so easily, for the so called carrying capacity, indeed leading to more elaborate algebraic work.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in data transmission systems requires high output power single transverse mode laser diodes for Raman and Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier pump sources. Several approaches have shown high output power emission up to 1 Watt for 14 xx-nm InGaAsP/InP pump lasers. In these works, the design rules were mainly {{related to the}} active volume increase, through large or flared waveguides or {{through the use of}} MMI. Such designs lead to electrical and thermal resistance decrease. MMI waveguide have already demonstrated better behavior in comparison with straight active waveguide, but neither experimental comparison nor <b>modelisations</b> between different active MMI structures have been reported. In this work, we report on 2 D-BPM simulations and experimental results between different active MMI 1 x 1 structures for 14 xx-nm pump laser. The MMI 1 x 1 is a large multimode waveguide connected in both sides center by one single transverse mode waveguide. Several parameters such as p order, wavelength emission, MMI width and MMI length have been studied in order to carry out simple design rules for active MMI waveguide based lasers. Moreover, to achieve high level output power, long lasers are necessary. In this case, we also compare long laser, typically 1. 2 mm, formed by one long MMI waveguide or formed by several short MMI waveguide. Simulations show a better behavior for short MMI length (LMMI< 250 µm) and small MMI width (WMMI< 10 µm). As expected, experimental results are in good agreement with simulations, and the output power figure is improved using the long laser formed by several short MMI waveguide...|$|R
40|$|The {{broad-band}} teleseismics {{records of}} the earthquake of October 29, 1989 in Algeria (MW = 6. 0) allow a detailed study of the rupture process of this earthquake. The focal mechanism obtained by P and SH modeling corresponds to reverse faulting {{with a small amount}} of left-lateral movement along a fault striking 246 ° and dipping 56 °. The rupture is found to be complex with two sub-events separated in time but occurring on the same plane. The lowfrequency records of an accelerometer located some 25 km to the west of the main shock are also better fi tted when the rupture is composed of a double pulse. In the two cases, there is strong evidence for the rupture to propagate from south-west towards north-east. The relocalisation of the main shock by using a master-event technique and the data from Italian and Spanish stations led to the same conclusions. Soon after the main event, a temporary seimic network was installed in the epicentral area. The aftershock clouds defi ne a SW-NE fault dipping to the NW compatible with the results of the <b>modelisations</b> of the teleseismic body-waves and the accelerogram. The focal mechanisms correspond mainly to reverse faulting. The maximum principal direction of the stress tensor obtained from the inversion is about N-S and the minimum is vertical, typical of a compressive regime.
