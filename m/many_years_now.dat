25|$|In the {{two decades}} that {{followed}} {{after the end of}} the first controversy, the social and cultural processes which led to the establishment of the Israelite Temple ripened and intensified, engulfing most of German Jews. An entire generation went to modern schools; levels of personal observance, which were steadily declining for <b>many</b> <b>years,</b> <b>now</b> reached a critical turning point. In the 1840s, the majority could be classified a non-Orthodox. The last traditional yeshiva, that of Fürth, closed in 1828. Higher education became mandatory for rabbis both by government decree and popular demand. Young university graduates slowly replaced the old religious leadership. Reform tendencies, limited to the upper crust of acculturated laymen twenty years earlier, now permeated the rabbinate itself.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> and also if I was going to do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

She described the album as [...] "be {{the next level}} from what I've already done....It's just more vibrant and exciting. And I can't wait for people to hear it." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Bedingfield said: [...] The thirteen-track standard edition, the twenty-one track deluxe edition and pre-order bonus track editions of the album were compiled from more than 50 songs which Bedingfield had written since touring. In an interview with PopEater she said [...] "I've been touring for so <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>now</b> that I wrote with my live gigs in mind. I wanted to write anthems that people could sing along to – things that were still personal, but definitely {{trying to find the}} best way to connect with people." [...] On the album she worked with Andreas Kleerup, John Hill, Wyclef Jean, Salaam Remi, Ryan Tedder, Jonas Myrin, Eg White and Sia Furler. None of the songs worked on with Jean, Remi or Furler made the final track listing, although all of the songs on the final track list were co-written by Bedingfield. Additionally Idolator revealed that Bedingfield had recorded a Ne-Yo-assisted duet titled [...] "The Little Things", which was produced by StarGate, though it was not included on the final pressing either. Bedingfield told fans in December 2010, via a recorded video message, that the album could be released elsewhere in the world later on but for the near present she was focusing on America.|$|E

2500|$|For <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> tourism {{has been}} the {{mainstay}} {{of the economy in}} the town, generating over £76,000,000 p.a. The borough had been enjoying a modest trade in tourists since George III visited in the 1790s but the number of visitors increased after the arrival of the railways in the early 1860s. Improvements in trains and motor coaches and a general increase in the standard of living meant that by 1914 Christchurch was a well established holiday destination. The development of Bournemouth also generated a great deal of traffic bound for Christchurch; although the town remained a resort in its own right. The number of visitors increased during the 20s and in the late 50s a holiday camp was built on the quay. In 1961 it became a [...] "Pontin's" [...] which in turn shut down and now is housing and a riverside hotel. Farms, factories and boat yards have since been replaced with housing but Christchurch was once an important trading port and prospered due to its industry and manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|Boyd {{described}} the album as having [...] "a very a particularly warm musical tone to it. It steps further out from anything we've ever done."

Something unique, both to the world and to us as a band. We decided that If Not Now, When?, our seventh full length studio album, would be just that." [...] Prior to the album's release, bassist Ben Kenney discussed the writing process in relation to fan expectations, stating [...] "from my perspective, we only write music to satisfy ourselves. We love to play and we’ve been fortunate to have people follow us and have really great and successful records. But, for the most part it’s to entertain each other and write music that we like to play." [...] Discussing the band's stylistic change, Kenney noted, [...] "There’s no way we could have written this record a few years ago." ...|$|E

2500|$|Senegal {{people are}} not prosecuted for their sexual {{orientation}}. Sexual orientation in Senegal is a purely private matter. It is a private matter, nothing more. For <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>now,</b> we have seen homosexuality in our country and that has never lead to situations where homosexuals are harassed, persecuted, or prosecuted. What {{has happened is that}} there have been sutiations where shocking behavior which ran counter to our religious beliefs and morality which [...] punishes unnatural sexual relations. I would ask you to understand the social realities of our country. This is an issue which is very complex. It is a very complicated issue in Senegal. Let me say once again in Senegal homosexuals lead freely ... we even had a federal republic to authorize a homosexual to have their name changed to a woman's name in order to emphasize their feminine side. No one was shocked when the president authorized the man to adopt the woman's name. But when homosexuality becomes blatantly public, it leads to embarrassing situations. You have to understand that we are a country with a particularly tolerant form of Islam. And that is why we must avoid, we must avoid the development of fundamentalism. We must ensure social cohesion. We must also take measures to protect the lives of homosexuals. That is why I ask you to bear in mind our society, our sociological realities. This is a perfectly complicated issue for us where there are some problems but we are aware of them. ... I would like {{to go back to a}} very important issue. We are all struggling for the independence of our judges, for the independence of our justice system. If the courts hand down a decision, you cannot say the government is responsible for that court decision. The ... independent justice system which hands down a decision. And that is what the courts did in the case of the trials of these homosexuals. And I must say ... for 25 years I was a lawyer at the bar. I know the Senegalese justice system from the inside. ... Over those years there have been three cases where homosexuals were brought before the courts. The first case was an organized homosexual marriage with a lot of fuss, a lot of publicity. The police arrested them and the court case led to an acquittal. The second case of homosexuals related to a foreign national who was already rather elderly who married a young Senegalese boy. And I would like to warn you ... that if an elderly man marries a young boy, the young boy does it so that he can emigrate and go in live in France or some other country abroad, that is the interest of the young person in getting married. This led to a conviction and an appeal was made against the conviction and ... the foreigner was able to leave the country after they were acquitted on appeal. And the third case ... is the case of homosexuals who joined together again with a great deal of fuss, carried out activities which led to disturbances in the neighborhood. The neighbors complained and the police acted. This has already been tried in the first instance, and an appeal has been made against that judgment, and the justice system is now dealing with this case independently on appeal.|$|E
