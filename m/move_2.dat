5000|$|In chess, Fool's Mate, {{also known}} as the [...] "Two-Move Checkmate", is the checkmate in the fewest {{possible}} number of moves {{from the start of the}} game. This can be achieved only by Black, who can deliver checkmate on <b>move</b> <b>2</b> with the queen. Fool's Mate received its name because it can only occur if White plays extraordinarily weakly (i.e., commits a blunder). Even among rank beginners, the mate almost never occurs in practice.|$|E
50|$|The optimal {{strategy}} for a single-board game of Notakto allows {{the first player}} to force a win. It is for {{the first player to}} play the center and then play a knight's <b>move</b> (<b>2</b> squares vertically and 1 square horizontally, or vice versa) away from the opponent's play. This strategy works because it creates a boot-like structure, which is called the boot trap. From the boot trap position the first player will be able to force a win.|$|E
