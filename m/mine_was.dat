5|$|In 1872, {{some time}} after they {{had taken over the}} Sikhs' territory, the British {{developed}} the mine further. They found the mining to have been inefficient, with irregular and narrow tunnels and entrances that made the movement of labourers difficult and dangerous. The supply of water inside the <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> poor, and there was no storage facility for the mined salt. The only road to the <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> over difficult, rocky terrain. To address these problems the government levelled the road, built warehouses, provided a water supply, improved the entrances and tunnels, and introduced a better mechanism for excavation of salt. Penalties were introduced to control salt smuggling.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, during torrential rain {{all over}} Pakistan, {{water from a}} nearby nullah entered the mine, {{reaching}} a depth of two feet (60cm) and blocking the exits, after which the <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> closed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was a copper mine from 1845–54 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, a restored Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now {{used to make the}} footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.|$|E

5|$|An {{ironstone}} <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> {{opened to}} work on a rock outcrop in 1853. The <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The Tea Tree Gully Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water Gully were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied quartzite road metal for the District Council of Tea Tree Gully. A crushing plant was erected {{on the north side of}} the gully in 1912 to create this road material.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cavalry}} {{got closer to}} the salt mine, Averell {{discovered}} that the <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> defended by a large force of infantry and cavalry. He decided to abandon the planned attack on the salt mine, and proceeded toward Wytheville, intending to join with Crook's infantry.|$|E

The Colliery Camp <b>mines</b> <b>are</b> located in the Iva Valley which is near the neighbouring town of Ngwo and Hilltop of Enugu. The Iva Valley coal <b>mine</b> <b>is</b> accessed through the Iva Valley road linking Enugu with Ngwo. Other coal <b>mines</b> <b>are</b> located in the Ogbete and Coal Camp layouts; these <b>mines</b> <b>are</b> located on the periphery of the city near the Iva Valley as well.|$|R

5|$|Dodington was {{the site}} of the Buckingham Mine where copper was extracted. The <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} before 1725 and followed earlier exploration at Perry Hill, East Quantoxhead. It was financed by the Marquis of Buckingham until 1801 when it was closed, until various attempts were made to reopen it during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|New mines {{were opened}} in Ahtme (1948), Jõhvi (No. 2, 1949), Sompa (1949), Tammiku (1951), {{and in the}} area between Käva and Sompa (No. 4, 1953). The Küttejõu open-pit <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1947 and the Küttejõu {{underground}} <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> merged with the Kiviõli mine in 1951. The Ubja <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1959. After construction of large oil shale-fired power stations, demand for oil shale increased and consequently new larger mines were constructed: the underground mines Viru (1965) and Estonia (1972) along with the open-pit mines Sirgala (1963), Narva (1970) and Oktoobri (1974; later named Aidu). Correspondingly, several exhausted smaller mines like Kukruse (1967), Käva (1972), No. 2 (1973), No. 4 (1975), and Kiviõli (1987) were closed. The Estonia Mine became the largest oil shale mine in the world. Because {{of the success of}} oil shale-based power generation, Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31.35million tonnes, and in the same year power generation peaked at 18.9TWh. The industry declined during the subsequent two decades. Demand for electric power generated from oil shale decreased following construction of nuclear power stations in the Russian SFSR, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station. At the end of 1988, a fire broke out in the Estonia Mine. The largest underground fire in Estonia, it continued for 81days and caused serious pollution of ground and surface waters.|$|E

5|$|With the {{discovery}} of gold in the area, gold rush brought miners to the area. In 1890, Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay {{was the scene of}} a meeting of the miners, which was followed by the establishment of the Berry mining district. In the 1890s, a salt <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> established at Bartlett Cove. Fox farms and a cannery were also established; however, the cannery was abandoned in 1935.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined with limited success. The last <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the Iron Mountain Mine closed, but {{pollution}} {{continued and}} still continues, and in 1983, the Iron Mountain <b>Mine</b> <b>was</b> {{listed on the}} National Priorities List. The Iron Mountain Mine is known for having the most acidic naturally found water content on Earth, with samples having up to a −3.6 pH value when tested in the early 1990s, which is roughly 100 times the acidity of battery acid. However, this pH value is only found inside and near the mine, as the average pH of water entering the Spring Creek Reservoir is 4.12.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} {{almost as}} rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 {{made it more difficult}} to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.|$|E
5|$|Royal Engineer {{tunnelling}} {{companies were}} formed {{in response to}} the German blowing of 10 small mines in December 1914, at Givenchy. The first British <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> detonated at Hill 60 on 17 February 1915. Mining was used increasingly during the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915, and the battle of Loos in September 1915. In July 1916, {{on the first day of}} the battle of the Somme, what became known as the Lochnagar Crater was created by a mine at La Boisselle.|$|E

5|$|The Corsica and Elba mines {{remained}} the chief {{source of employment}} until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> converted into an open pit, {{and the future of}} the town once again seemed secure. Then the Great Depression hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1934. Once World War II began, the mining business boomed again.|$|E
5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} <b>mine</b> <b>was</b> hot {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
