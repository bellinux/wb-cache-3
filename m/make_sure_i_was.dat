500|$|In the {{television}} series Alias (2001–06), Cooper achieved some {{success for the}} role of Will Tippin, a local reporter for a newspaper and the best friend of Jennifer Garner's character, Sydney Bristow. Garner {{was one of the first}} people he met in Los Angeles and was, in Cooper's words, [...] "very maternal... She wanted to take care of me, <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> okay all the time." [...] He acted in the 2002 psychological thriller Changing Lanes. The scenes in which he appeared were edited out of the final cut of the film, but are featured on the film's DVD and Blu-ray releases. Also in 2002, he played a man involved in a love triangle in the romantic drama Bending All the Rules. He guest-starred in the short-lived TV series Miss Match and played the part of cowboy and race horse trainer Morgan Murphy in {{the television}} film The Last Cowboy, which aired on the Hallmark Channel in January 2003. He later appeared in the television film I Want to Marry Ryan Banks (2004) with Jason Priestley and as a regular guest star in the WB series Jack & Bobby (2004–05).|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, they do," [...] replied Tommy, [...] "I walked {{three miles}} {{to see one}} to <b>make</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> near putting in another {{beautiful}} bit about weeping-willows." ...|$|E

60|$|When I {{heard those}} words I had to rub {{my eyes to}} <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> awake.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is indeed, Mr. Richards. I {{can hardly}} believe even {{now that it is}} all true, and have pinched myself two or three times to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> awake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was coming}} round to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite through with your case, but it's tolerably evident {{you have no}} more use for me," [...] he said. [...] "Stopping here?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What {{made her}} {{bring me the}} letters?' he asked himself. It was a very unusual attention. His heart replied, very sullen and shameful: 'She wanted to know; she wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> all right.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Jud. And, to <b>make</b> all <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{ordered to}} be from home. When I come back again, I shall knock at your door, with, [...] Speak, brother, speak; [...] [Singing. [...] Is the deed done? ...|$|R
5000|$|When Sunderland {{decided to}} attempt the circumnavigation, he {{purchased}} a 36 ft Islander for $6,000, using {{all of his}} savings. With his father's assistance, he retrofitted the boat for the trip. Sunderland planned to complete his voyage in April 2009 with a maximum time of 18 months. He continued his schooling while sailing, saying, [...] "I have all my books with me. I have one more year to finish at high school and I have to send back my tests (via e-mail) to my mom. She's going to grade them and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing well." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{walked on}} as briskly as the heat {{would let me}} till I reached the {{cross-road}} {{which led to the}} village, looking back {{from time to time to}} <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not followed by any one.|$|R
60|$|They {{had only}} come, after all, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asleep and had heard nothing. Whatever this {{business}} {{might be on}} which they were engaged, they evidently meant to conduct it with the utmost secrecy. Whatever these things meant, they did not mean murder.|$|E
60|$|Again this {{wonderful}} horse amazed me. He pointed his alert and quivering ears {{at me and}} followed with never {{so much as a}} single start or shying bound. He seemed to reason that as I had led him through many dangers safely I could still be trusted. Around us huge trucks rattled, electric cars clanged, railway engines whizzed and screamed, but Ladrone never so much as tightened the rein; and when in the dark of the chute (which led {{to the door of the}} car) he put his soft nose against me to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still with him, my heart grew so tender that I would not have left him behind for a thousand dollars.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{talking like}} Christian and Faithful by the way, he and I came down upon a hamlet by the Tarn. It {{was but a}} humble place, called La Vernede, {{with less than a}} dozen houses, and a Protestant chapel on a knoll. Here he dwelt; and here, at the inn, I ordered my breakfast. The inn was kept by an {{agreeable}} young man, a stone-breaker on the road, and his sister, a pretty and engaging girl. The village schoolmaster dropped in to speak with the stranger. And these were all Protestants--a fact which pleased me more than I should have expected; and, what pleased me still more, they seemed all upright and simple people. The Plymouth Brother hung round me with a sort of yearning interest, and returned at least thrice to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> enjoying my meal. His behaviour touched me deeply at the time, and even now moves me in recollection. He feared to intrude, but he would not willingly forego one moment of my society; and he seemed never weary of shaking me by the hand.|$|E
2500|$|Late in April 2008, Smith {{suffered}} a thigh injury which {{prevented him from}} playing for seven weeks. In late June 2008, Smith {{signed a contract with}} Leicestershire– who were in the second division of the County Championship– to play on loan from Lancashire for a month. Lancashire had a full strength bowling attack– including Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson who had returned from England duty– and Smith was unable to break into the side. Smith explained that [...] "I am Lancashire born and bred and I want to play for Lancashire for all of my career. I'm just going to get some cricket and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ticking over well". He was immediately drafted into the Leicestershire side.|$|R

6000|$|... 'There {{were others}} coming, and {{presently}} a little group of perhaps {{eight or ten}} of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> real. There was nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, {{there was something in}} these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.|$|E

5000|$|With Souths {{unwilling to}} match the offer from Wests Tigers, Pettybourne joined his new club from 2013.

40|$|Many {{people have}} a magazine, a crossword puzzle, a newspaper, or a book on hand to fill idle time. I, however, prefer to tease my mind with a book of Sudoku puzzles (pronounced sue‐dah‐coup), {{trying to figure out}} what number goes where while {{resisting}} the temptation to peek in the back at the answer to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> on the right track. For those of you who are unaware of what Sudoku is, it is a highly popular number game whose notoriety may even surpass the crossword or word search puzzles. It can be found in popular newspapers such as USA Today, the New York Times, and the LA Times. Even the Lincoln Journal Star and the University of Nebraska’s Daily Nebraskan make a daily puzzle available to their readers...|$|R

5000|$|The first African-American {{family to}} move to Kenilworth, the Calhouns, was met with {{resistance}} from some in the community, such as a cross burning and racially charged vandalism, while others voiced shock over the offenses. However, most residents expressed {{their support for the}} family. Walter Calhoun, a young student and athlete at the time, recalls [...] "They bent over backwards to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never left out." [...] Four years after the shocking incident, two teenagers visited Harold Calhoun in his downtown office where they confessed and apologized for the cross burning.|$|E
5000|$|Bryan was {{committing}} suicide under a train. He {{came up on}} to the platform and introduced himself. I said: [...] "How nice to meet you, Mr Forbes. There’s a chance I might be in your film." [...] He said: [...] "Well, I’m afraid {{this is the last}} day of shooting. They’ve brought you here under false pretences." [...] He drove me home to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> OK - and that was it... So, at the age of 17, I did the cleverest thing I’ve ever done: said yes when Bryan asked me to marry him. I don’t think I’ve topped that.|$|E
5000|$|Though Kara {{focused on}} {{producing}} his work, {{he did have}} several notable showings and his work appeared in locations around California. In 1965, his sculpture of Elizabeth Taylor was commissioned for and appeared in The Sandpiper. This film brought him exposure in Hollywood and beyond. [...] "Elizabeth came to see it to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not doing something outrageous. She approved," [...] Kara told Curtis. A short promotional film called Statue for the Sandpiper (an original movie promotion) features Kara in action. He was flown to the unveiling in Paris where the actors and producers viewed and commented on the piece.|$|E

He also performed at the Bloom Festival {{as part of the}} 50th anniversary celebrations of The Rose of Tralee in 2009. He made an appearance on the Crawdaddy Stage at Electric Picnic 2009. On 31 December 2009, he performed a date at the Cork Opera House as part of celebrations marking the end of the decade. He has sold out several other venues around Ireland and has also toured the UK.|$|R
60|$|I had {{expected}} {{something of the}} kind, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not greatly astonished when I beheld the bogus crockery that filled the packing-case.

5000|$|A perfect result. There {{was a bit}} of a rush at {{the start}} as {{everybody}} went out on the track to take advantage while it was still dry. I was probably able to read the conditions better than everybody else and managed to be very quick in the middle sector. I had my second run towards the end because the surface can dry very quickly and I wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a position to take advantage and defend my pole position if necessary. The race tomorrow will be very close but I want the ten points. David Coulthard, following the qualifying session.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson {{elaborated}} to the Herald Sun on how his son Moe (3-years-old at {{the time}} this was written) inspired this song: [...] "He was drinking a lot of soya milk {{at the time}}. I told him if he kept drinking too much, he would grow a tail with an eyeball at the end. He looked at me trying to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kidding. When he figured that out, he attached his elbow to his butt and pointed his finger around the room. He had made this tail with an eyeball. He pointed at me and said, 'Dad, you look good.' I {{thought that was a}} sweet thing to say." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the poor}} {{commercial}} {{performance of their}} debut album, Aim and Ignite, Fun decided to put Jeff Bhasker as producer for their second studio effort. The band's frontman, Nate Ruess, met with Bhasker at his hotel in New York City in February 2011. Ruess was anxious about meeting Bhasker, so he arrived early at the bar in the Bowery Hotel on the Lower East Side [...] "and had a little to drink just to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> loosened up." [...] According to Bhasker, he wasn't really wanting to meet the band, as he [...] "was working with Beyoncé, and also with Alicia, Kanye and Jay-Z, and doing {{this had been a}} big goal in my life.
