40|$|This sabbatical {{allowed me}} the {{opportunity}} to view overseas schools assessment systems: formative assessment in action as well as the style and results of summative assessment. I had prepared a brief of my study to email to schools in Scotland to obtain their approval to visit. I wanted a variety of schools large and small from cities, towns and villages in different Local Education Authorities to see if there were differences in district operation. It proved to be more difficult than I anticipated getting schools to respond to my initial request. Some schools I visited were “cold calls ” without an appointment but I was never turned away. The schools I visited were very welcoming and forthcoming with information that I “maun ken ” (must know) while being inquisitive about New Zealand schools. At times when responding to their questions about our schools I felt as if I was on a recruiting drive for teachers to come to New Zealand. My Board had approved me taking <b>my</b> principal’s <b>laptop</b> which was invaluable for storage purposes but not much use for emailing back to school as their systems were not as advanced as I had been led to believe. At times during the visits the schools were reassuringly similar and in other ways, such as the physical set up, completely different to Tairua Primary School. Their similar teaching style was plainly illustrated when I observed a 20 minute lesson taken completely in Gaelic. Even though the teacher and students only spoke Gaelic I could easily follow the lesson because of familiar teaching styles and learning intentions. Scotland has a great sense of history with its castles, battles in the glens and kinship. The older Scots I talked to outside of school maintain that Scottish education has and is continuing to go downhill. Most educators believe they are on the path of improvement to success by focussed formative assessment. Time will tell who is right...|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, I {{was happy}} with gNewSense 3.0. Being based on Debian, the {{distribution}} {{can be counted on}} to provide both stability and amazing performance. The distribution is lean, fast and uncluttered. The flip side to this is gNewSense's system installer and default package management tools are geared more toward experienced users and will probably provide a steep learning curve to novice Linux users. Not much is automated and there is a minimum of hand holding. The main feature of gNewSense, the lack of proprietary software, is also a double-edged blade. On the one hand, it means the entire operating system can be audited, modified and redistributed. This is great from the perspective of software freedom. The fact that the distribution can play most multimedia formats and handled Flash content fairly well is a testament of the power of free and open source software. The one problem I ran into with gNewSense's software policy was with regards to my wireless network card. Most distributions ship with the non-free Intel firmware, but gNewSense doesn't include it and this means the distribution isn't a good fit with <b>my</b> <b>laptop.</b> It is, on the other hard , a great match with my desktop system.|$|E
