40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the state of {{knowledge}} on cutaneous neurogenic inflammation. Peripheral effector functions served by afferent sensory neurons underlie the so-called neurogenic inflammation. The mechanism of cutaneous neurogenic inflammation is connected with the release of neuropeptides from the sensory endings. They also exert a number of functions within the immune system. The activity of neuropeptides in the inflammation of the skin can be observed in the form of erythema, edema, hyperthermia and pruritus. Beside these peptides and their receptors, inflammatory skin response, is regulated by tryptase and proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR- 2). Capsaicin decreases effects of inflammation-induced sensory neuropeptides, which was used in the treatment of diseases caused by inflammation. The activity of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor 1 (TRP-V 1) is associated with the neurogenic inflammation. In inflammatory processes, the neuro- immunocutaneous system undergoes activation, which is responsible for triggering and <b>maintening</b> the inflammatory conditions, both in the healthy skin as well as in the pathological conditions, like psoriasis. Skin exposure to UV radiation influences the neuroimmuno-cutaneous system and causes the release of neuropeptides, thereby eliciting inflammatory response in photodermatosis. In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms and the factors controlling neurotransmitters and their receptors will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of cutaneous diseases e. g. pruritus, psoriasis, alopetia areata.

40|$|The general {{interest}} for genetic resources {{is based on}} the opportunities offered by their utilization. Genetic resources are a necessary starting point for plant improvement. Up to now, reflection on the management of genetic resources considered a three-step linear model : conservation -> evaluation -> utilization. In this system, it is expected that genetic resources are kept in a gene bank, in the best possible way, i. e. using methods <b>maintening</b> over time the initial genetic state of the accessions and conferring them the longest life possible. In this system, important characteristics of conservation of genetics resources are stability and availability. We present a choice of methods of conservation directed to the maintenance of genetic stability of accessions. We also present a choice of methods of conservation in relation with the availability of the genetic material for the various utilizations by the plant breeder. Complementary methods are now proposed for the conservation of genetic resources. These methods correspond to {{a modified version of the}} linear model, with interactions between conservation, evaluation, and utilization. These new methods place less emphasis on the conservation of genetically well defined accessions but promote genetic mechanisms allowing evolution of these accesssions. This evolutionary conservation is obtained by management of experimental populations, or by on-farm management of landraces, relying on knowlegde and activity of farmers, and on local breeding. For the wild relatives of crops, an in situ management is to be considered. Using some examples, we discuss the constraints of these new modes of genetic resources conservations and utilization.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine 1) the {{associations}} between history of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and insomnia complaints and {{excessive daytime sleepiness}} (EDS), and 2) the relationships between sleep complaints and future CVD in persons over 65. METHODS: CVD was assessed at baseline and during two, four, and six-year follow-up in 5494 non-demented subjects. Self-reported insomnia complaints (poor sleep quality, difficulty in initiating sleep, difficulty in <b>maintening</b> sleep, and early morning awakening), EDS and sleep medication use were evaluated at baseline. Logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazard models, with delayed entry and age of participants as the time scale, were adjusted for socio-demographic, lifestyle and clinical variables. RESULTS: At baseline, 748 participants had a past-history of CVD. A past-history of CVD was associated with EDS (OR =  1. 28 95 %CI = [1. 05 - 1. 57]) {{and the number of}} insomnia complaints (OR =  1. 26 95 %CI = [1. 03 - 1. 55] for 1 - 2 insomnia complaints; OR =  1. 32 95 %CI = [1. 03 - 1. 71] for ≥ 3 complaints). In longitudinal analyses, neither the four components of insomnia nor the number of insomnia complaints were significantly associated with first or recurrent CVD events (n =  391 events). EDS was independently associated with future CVD events even after adjusting for prescribed sleep medication and past-history of CVD (HR =  1. 35 95 %CI = [1. 06 - 1. 71]). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the relationships between sleep complaints and CVD could be complex. Insomnia complaints are more likely a consequence of CVD, whereas EDS appears to be a determinant of CVD independently of past-history of CVD.
