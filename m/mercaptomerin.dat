40|$|The {{diuretic}} {{response of}} normal infants, 6 to 47 days of age, to single doses of <b>mercaptomerin,</b> chlorothiazide, acetazolamide, triamterene and spironolactone was studied by following urinary electrolytes, pH and osmolality. Peak diuresis occured {{two to four}} hours after drug administration, and because of compensatory mechanisms little change in urinary excretion was found if only 24 -hour urines were studied. <b>Mercaptomerin</b> increased sodium excretion seven-fold, compared to three- to four-fold increases for the other diuretics. Control urinary Na:K ratios averaged 0. 68 in infants compared to 2. 8 for adults, and <b>mercaptomerin</b> produced the largest increase in this ratio. Qualitatively the response to diuretics is the same in newborn in the ages studied as it {{is reported to be}} for adults; no immaturity of the infant kidney in this regard was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} trial {{was carried out}} with the object of comparing the effects of furosemide, a new oral diuretic agent, with those of <b>mercaptomerin</b> and hydrochlorothiazide. Eleven edematous patients were chosen for the study and the diuretics were rotated, each drug being preceded by a one- to three-day control period. The patients served as their own controls. Urine electrolytes, body weight, and blood chemistry were monitored...|$|E
40|$|O F all {{diuretic}} drugs, the mercurial diuretics {{have the}} established advantage of combining effectiveness and safety when administered intramuscularly. 1 They may on occasion cause local or generalized reactions of varying degree. Chemical modifications of these organic mercurial compounds have been em-ployed {{in an effort}} to minimize such toxic effects. 2 ' 8 Another mercurial com-pound, <b>mercaptomerin</b> sodium (Thiomerin) has recently been introduced. This preparation is an organic mercurial combined with a mercaptan (disodium salt of N- (gamma-carboxy-methyl-mercaptomercuri-beta-methoxy) propyl cam...|$|E
40|$|The acute {{intravenous}} {{toxicity of}} organic mercurial diuretics limits their use-fulness in clinical practice. A need exists for an effective diuretic agent of low cardiac toxicity {{which could be}} used where the usual mercurial compounds are ill-advised or contraindicated. Recently, Lehman (1947), by combining meral-luride sodium (Mercuhydrin) with a solution of sodium thioglycollate to form a stable mercaptide complex, has obtained a compound which appears to meet this need. <b>Mercaptomerin</b> sodium (Thiomerin) has received wide acceptance among clinical investigators for its virtual lack of cardiac toxicity with no los...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of a radioactive isotope of mer-cury, Hg 203, and the recent improvements in in-strumentation for radioactivity assay obviating loss of mercury through volatilization has made pos-sible a further study {{of the behavior of}} an organic mercurial diuretic agent, <b>mercaptomerin</b> sodium (Thiomerin®). Previous studies in the rabbit (1) have shown that 87 to 96 per cent of the radio-activity administered as Hg 203 -labeled mercapto-merin can be recovered in the urine, kidney, and liver. Analysis of the entire carcass, urine and feces of a rabbit 24 hours after injection of a tracer dose of Hg 203 as labeled <b>mercaptomerin</b> showed that 97 per cent of the total administered radioactivity could be accounted for. Studies in the rabbit (1), rat and dog (2) have shown species differences in the renal excretion of mercury; residual radioactivity was concentrated primarily in the kidney. The concentration of mercury in the renal tissue varied considerably, even in normal healthy rabbits (1). This finding, together with the clinical observation that the diuretic response of human beings to the injection of a standard amount of a mercurial agent cannot be predicted, suggested that there might be considerable varia-tion in the ability of diseased human kidneys to concentrate mercury administered in an organic form and that this variability {{may be one of the}} factors contributing to the erratic response to mer-curial therapy. The purpose of the present study was to deter-mine the tissue distribution of Hg 203 which had been administered parenterally as labeled mercap-'This study was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the American Heart Association and Wyeth Labora-tories, and in part under a contract with the U. S. Atomi...|$|E
40|$|Meralluride, <b>mercaptomerin,</b> ethacrynic acid, and {{penicillamine}} inhibited {{urease activity}} of Proteus mirabilis. The {{activity of the}} organic mercurials and ethacrynic acid was markedly inhibited by human and dog urine. Antiurease activity could not be detected in the urine of a human and a dog given meralluride by injection. Urine from patients receiving penicillamine also failed to inhibit urease activity. Ascorbic acid inhibited, whereas dehydroascorbic acid enhanced, {{the activity of the}} mercurials, but neither agent altered the inhibitory effect of urine. The lethal effect of meralluride against Proteus occurred at the same concentration at which urease activity was inhibited, but penicillamine inhibited the enzymatic activity without affecting viability of the organism. The data suggest that these sulfhydryl-reactive compounds will not be useful against Proteus infections of the urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) was {{studied in}} tissue homogenates and {{subcellular}} fractions derived from human cadaver kidneys maintained in an organ preservation unit for transplantation. The activity of ouabain-sensitive ATPase was {{highest in the}} medulla, intermediate in the cortex and lowest in the papilla. The cortical enzyme activity dimin-ished with time during maintenance perfusion of the kidneys. Similar concentrations of K, Na, Mg, ATP and MgATP were required for half-maximal rates of ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity from the cortex or the medulla. The sensitivity of the enzyme to ouabain from both parts of the kidney was similar. K antagonized inhibition of the enzyme by ouabain. Chlormerodnn, mersalyl, <b>mercaptomerin</b> and ethacrynic acid were inhibitors of the enzyme.

40|$|Diuretics and {{antibiotics}} {{are frequently}} used concomitantly. The possibility of drug interactions {{led us to}} {{study the effects of}} several diuretics on the renal elimination of cephalothin. Five healthy volunteers received a constant infusion of 500 mg of sodium cephalothin per h for 9 h on 4 consecutive days. Each day, after the third hour of infusion, the subjects were given one of the following in varying order: (i) furosemide (1 mg/kg, intravenous), (ii) <b>mercaptomerin</b> (250 mg, intramuscular), (iii) mannitol (25 g, intravenous), or (iv) no diuretic (control day). Fluid losses were replaced hourly. Serum and complete urine collections were obtained each hour and assayed for creatinine and cephalothin (bioassay). Clearances (milliliter per minute) and urinary excretions (milligram per hour) of cephalothin did not differ either when the diuretic day values were compared with control day, or when pre- and postdiuretic results on the same day were compared. Creatinine clearances were not affected by diuretics except for a transient rise after furosemide...|$|E
40|$|Microperfusion {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} increases in flow rate of tubule fluid through the loop of Henle are followed by reductions in single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and stop-flow pressure (SFP) measured in the proximal tubule of the same nephron. Because changes in luminal sodium concentration are not consistently related to changes in SNGFR and SFP, we explored {{the possibility that a}} transport step at a flow-dependent distal-sensing site might be involved in feedback control of SNGFR. Because the macula densa cells of the distal tubule are adjacent to the glomerular vessels of the same nephrons, they could be the distal-sensing mechanism. We perfused superficial loops of Henle from late proximal to early distal segments in three groups of rats while measuring SFP in the proximal tubule of the same nephron, SNGFR in the proximal tubule of the same nephron, or flow rates of fluid, Na, K, and Cl emerging from the perfused loops. Perfusion solutions used were 0. 15 NaCl, Ringer or Ringer with one of several inhibitors of electrolyte transport. Perfusion rates were 10 or 40 nl/min (also, zero during measurements of SFP and SNGFR). With Ringer alone the loop-flow rate increased from 10 to 40 nl/min, caused a decrease in SFP from 37. 6 to 32. 1 mm Hg, and a decrease in SNGFR from 29. 9 to 18. 7 nl/min. Concentrations of Na, K, and Cl in early distal fluid and absorption of Na and Cl along the loop segment were also increased when loop perfusion rate was increased. Decreasing the perfusion rate to zero had little effect on SFP or SNGFR. The SFP response to increased flow rate did not occur when the perfusion solution contained furosemide (10 - 4 M). No reduction of the SFP response was seen with other diuretics tested (amiloride, acetazolamide, ethacrynic acid, <b>mercaptomerin)</b> or with 0. 15 M NaCl alone. The SNGFR response to increased perfusion rate was reduced by furosemide, triflocin, and cyanide but not by amiloride. Na and Cl absorption by the perfused segment were inhibited by furosemide, triflocin, cyanide, and amiloride. Amiloride and acetazolamide, probably do not act in the ascending limb. Ethacrynic acid and <b>mercaptomerin</b> are known to be ineffective in rat nephrons. Thus, agents that could have inhibited NaCl absorption by macula densa cells interfered with the feedback mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Calcium binds to {{membranous}} structures {{isolated from}} rabbit kidney cortex homogenates. The binding {{is enhanced by}} ATP and Mg++ in combination. Other nucleotides, ITP and GTP, do not have this property. In contrast to similar preparations of nerve and muscle, the binding is not augmented by oxalate (3 – 100 mM). Also, binding of calcium cannot be correlated with ATP hydrolysis. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and the mercurial diuretic agent <b>mercaptomerin</b> inhibit the binding of calcium. This system can be distinguished from the binding of calcium by mitochondria by lack of azide inhibition and by failure of ADP-succinate to substitute for ATP. 14 C- and γ- 32 P-labeled ATP bind to the renal membranes {{in the absence of}} calcium, but only the 32 P binding increases when calcium is added. The ratio of 32 P bound to 45 Ca bound is 2 : 1. The above data are consistent with a hypothesis that calcium is metabolically bound to renal membranes and that this binding is associated with membrane phosphorylation. Such a formulation may have pertinence to the conformational state of renal membranes and subsequent permeability characteristics. It also allows for the concept that membrane stability requires metabolic participation, as well as calcium ions...|$|E
