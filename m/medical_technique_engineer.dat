40|$|The current {{regulatory}} {{status in}} the USA, European Union (EU), Japan, and China, associated with the clinical application of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is presented.

Also, {{it is suggested that}} two-tier regulatory framework of medical products be constructed, with the first level built on existing and newly introduced regulatory provisions and the second technical level encompassing all the technical requirements. In China, the demarcation line between <b>medical</b> <b>technique</b> mode and <b>medical</b> product mode is not made clear and coherent and flexible regulatory framework has not been intentionally designed. If the recommendations concerning the desirability of regulatory framework will be adopted in China, it means the present application of <b>medical</b> <b>technique</b> mode should be reconsidered and adjusted based on the risk analysis.
