40|$|This study unravels {{the nature}} of inter-functional {{integration}} in roadmapping. Roadmapping is indicated as an important innovation phenomenon and is practiced by multiple large organizations. Functional integration is widely acknowledged to {{play a significant role}} in enhancing new product success. Roadmapping outcomes have been shown to shape and influence NPD practices and performance. Yet, little is known about {{the nature of}} functional involvement in roadmapping and its impact on roadmapping performance. This paper provides an empirical contribution to the understanding of the roadmapping phenomenon and extends the existing body of knowledge on functional integration towards the context of front end innovation. The aim is to unravel the nature of inter-functional integration in roadmapping from the rationale that detailed interactions must be tracked to offer a realistic account of how roadmapping occurs and how employees from different functional departments integrate their contributions into a roadmap. A sequential analysis method is employed to examine roadmapping practices. In this rigorous data analysis procedure to systematically evaluate and make sense of longitudinal data also ‘objects’ are included to be able to analyse the maps used for inter-functional mapping. Philips, the large multinational corporation of Dutch origin, was chosen as the case site. Roadmap data spanning five years from 2002 to 2007 were collected at the Philips Beverages business unit. Supported by the QDA miner software, the detailed analysis led to a substantial data set of 479 identified events and 137 objects. The overall analysis resulted in the reconstruction of 21 sequences. These sequences are associated with the roadmapping outcome; the envisioned products on the roadmap. The end results determined six patterns of commonalities and differences among the sequences of actions, interactions and objects. The sequence patterns are 1. Technology innovation route; 2. Market creation route; 3. Market competitor-inspired route; 4. Market innovation route; 5. Product improvement route; 6. Market improvement route. With respect to the new product performance of envisioned versus actual new products, the results indicate that mapping with numerous functional involvement may not result in more successful product introductions. Overall, the results show a shift in functional leadership of roadmapping practice to marketing, demonstrating a broadening of cross-functional relations. Contrary to the literature, we found that technology involvement in roadmapping can be low. Further, our case analysis indicates how <b>marketing</b> <b>domination</b> in early roadmapping practices can lead to unsuccessful product launches.

40|$|Summary]: Non-timber {{forest product}} (NTFP) {{is one of}} the sources of {{livelihood}} in developing countries like Nepal. In the present context of agriculture crop production decline because of climate change, an alternative to agro-crops, NTFP species domestication could be a viable option of livelihood for the resource poor farmers of south Asian region. Domestication is important in two ways: One is that helps fulfil the demand of food and other is that it helps conserve natural resource base in the forest. Therefore, domestication is critical for both livelihood and environmental sustainability. The book Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs) and Domestication provides an insight into the potentiality of cultivation of NTFPs in cultivated land in place of agro-crops. Based on a structured questionnaire survey and some secondary documents this book has sought to explore the perception of smallholder farmers whether or not the NTFPs could be an alternative to existing agro-crops. The book deals with constraints and opportunities, market opportunities and risks with regards to promotion (domestication) of NTFPs in the cultivated land. The book also throws light on whether or not the existing policies are favourable to NTFPs domestication at farm level. Findings suggest that farmers are very much willing to cultivate NTFPs in their farmland in place of agro-crops. They perceive NTFPs more profitable and environmentally desirable than agro-crops since NTFPs requires less input (fertiliser, soil works, labour etc.) than agro-crops. But farmers are reluctant to adopt domestication extensively because of market risks (price fluctuation, insecure <b>market,</b> trader <b>domination).</b> Lack of direct access of farmers to the big trading companies is another constraint posed to expensive cultivation of NTFPs in the farm land. ...|$|R

The problem encountered is the domestic market liberalization gives rise to changes in market power and results ini the dominant position of multinational companies. This research aimed to (i) analyze {{the impact of the}} exercise of market power by cocoa multinational company, (ii) to analyze the possibility of deregulation of cocoa bean domestic trade, and (iii) to estimate the potential increase in added value of cocoa down-stream industry as a result of deregulation. Some steps of research conducted includes (i) desk research, (ii) field survey by interviewing samples of farmers, traders, exporters, processors, as well as other business participants, (iii) special interviews with key persons related to regulation as well as deregulation of domestic trade and down-stream industry development, and (iv) focussed group discussion involving related stakeholders of cocoa. The results showed that the impact of the exercise of market power by multinational companies refers to the decreasing market shares of national companies from 2007 to 2009. Based on the <b>market</b> power <b>domination</b> of multinational companies in one side and the lack of down-stream industry development in the other side, there is a possibility to deregulate the above policy by continuing the new regulation (export tax of cocoa beans, directing multinational exporters toward downstream industry by partnership with domestic-idle capacity processing industry and import tariff escalation for processed cocoa). By the new regulation, the opportunity to increase domestic added value becomes greater. This cocoa down-stream industry development will increase the potential domestic added value at least 10 %.

Data was obtained through progeny history recall on 2, 000 heifer loss cases out of 4, 398 heifers born between 1991 and 2009. The estimated heifer loss was 0.455 and was 11.8 % higher (P < 0.0001) in peri-urban herds (0.505 ± 0.040) than in pastoral herds (0.387 ± 0.047). The extent of heifer loss was significantly associated with veterinary service access (P < 0.05), labour hire (P < 0.01) and state of security (P < 0.01).

Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible.

40|$|The central {{question}} in our paper {{is how the}} crisis impacts on national housing markets: how vulnerable are specific housing systems to the crisis? We searched for {{the consequences of the}} current crisis on housing markets in five countries: Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and England. The results show that we must first of all make a distinction between markets with a high turnover on the owner occupied market versus housing markets with a low turnover. High turnover is found in the England, Ireland and the Netherlands, while low turnover exists in Belgium and Germany. The high turnover <b>markets</b> show a <b>domination</b> of new construction by commercial large scale (speculative) development and a relatively high level of housing transactions in the existing stock. Low turnover markets are characterized by a relatively low number of transactions in the existing stock while in the house building market, the private 9 ̆ 1 self 9 ̆ 2 build model prevails. The high turnover housing markets seem more vulnerable to a crisis, especially when combined with loose planning controls like in Ireland. With these insights we have tried to make a relation with crisis stimulus packages for national housing markets. For instance, the UK has implemented a wide range of housing market measures while the German government launched two massive packages to support the wider economy that did not include any specific housing market intervention...|$|R

It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European <b>market</b> without undue <b>domination.</b> Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition {{in a short period of}} time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Cantonese Pop Song market in the Hong Kong arena. Hong Kong’s market, same as many in {{different}} parts of the world, are faced with serious recession in recent years due to the drastic decrease of record sales in recent years. Such changes in its ecology give rise to a lot of changes in the music scene. It is observable that the mode of music reception is different now in comparison with the vibrant years when record selling was the major income source for musicians and music companies. Online streaming, illegal or legal downloading, movie clips watching in the Internet almost totally replaced the traditional mode of listening to music. However, changes in response to the downturn of this industry do not only lie in the media and technical side. There are also changes in music styles observable, which is particularly obvious in Hong Kong. During the vibrant years of the Cantonese pop music industry in the 80 ’s and 90 ’s, the <b>market</b> sees <b>domination</b> of a certain music style, which is further developed and known as “K-songs” in Cantonese. They are not only consumed for listening, but also as a form of content to sing in Karaoke lounges, which is a very popular past- time during those years. The number of music labels at that time was very few, though very dominant. And in the late 90 ’s, a lot of dynamics happened between record companies, some merged together, and some acquired by other companies. These “K-song” styles continue to grow as a dominant music style for Hong Kong people throughout the 2000 ’s, as a form of entertainment for both listening and Karaoke singing. However, in the recent few years, it is observable that more and more independent music labels evolved, bringing about more and more independent music for the audiences. They were not bounded by the big players in the industry, but rather gained much freedom in terms of its music styles and mode of operation. The desire in search for freedom and to break free from existing boundaries and restrictions are not only limited to music in recent years however. It has, to a certain extent, became a way of living, a new form of culture in Hong Kong, and music has become either a very dominant cultural form on its own, as well as a complementary form in other cultures, such as music cafes. For this reason, in this paper, I aim to discuss whether or not doing independent music label in Hong Kong is a way out in the Hong Kong music industry in terms of money making as well as non- monetary motives. published_or_final_versionMedia, Culture and Creative CitiesMasterMaster of Social Sciences in Media, Culture and Creative Citie...|$|R
