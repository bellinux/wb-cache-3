60|$|Larry {{tossed the}} <b>mocassin</b> to his leader, who eyed it {{carelessly}} for a moment. Suddenly he started, and, turning the <b>mocassin</b> over, examined it with close and earnest attention. Then he smiled, {{as if at}} his passing anxiety, and dropped it on the ground.|$|E

60|$|The {{rest of the}} party, who {{had lain}} down, laughed at this sally, and Stiff, on consideration, thought it best to laugh too. In a few minutes every one in the encampment was sound asleep, with the {{exception}} of Robin Gore, who took the first hour of watching, and who sat beside the sinking fire like a Indian in earnest meditation, with his eyes resting dreamily on the worn-out <b>mocassin.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was a wild, forsaken road, now winding through dreary pine barrens, {{where the}} wind whispered mournfully, and now over log causeways, through long cypress swamps, the doleful trees {{rising out of the}} slimy, spongy ground, hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss, while ever and anon the loathsome form of the <b>mocassin</b> snake might be seen sliding among broken stumps and {{shattered}} branches that lay here and there, rotting in the water.|$|E

60|$|All {{of which}} counted for little. There was the fire, {{snapping}} and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame. He started to untie his moccasins. They were coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the <b>mocassin</b> strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration. For {{a moment he}} tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} {{determining}} the production date of the dolls is by studying the footwear. For example, the earliest dolls from around 1913 had mocasins made of leather. By 1918, the <b>mocassins</b> were simulated with suede applied to wood, and painted designs. By 1924, they were molded of composition material, and by the 1950s, the dolls had plastic feet. Production of the dolls ended in the early 1960s.|$|R
60|$|That morning Nelly {{could do}} little but ramble {{about in a}} wild sort of fashion, trying to imagine that she was queen {{of the world around}} her! She sobered down, however, towards noon, and went {{diligently}} about the work which Roy had given her to do. She had the internal arrangements of the hut to complete and improve, some pairs of <b>mocassins</b> to mend, and several arrows to feather, besides other matters.|$|R
5000|$|His name is also spelled Mama'nte and is {{translated}} {{in several}} ways, including Man-on-a-Cloud, Sky Walker, Walking Above, or Walks-in-the-Sky. After the head chief Dohäsan died in 1866, naming Guipago {{as his own}} designated heir and consequently establishing Satanta as the second-ranking chief, Mamanti {{assumed the role of}} a war chief, but he got real power when he gained screech owl medicine and became an owl prophet.His rivalry as a medicine man was versus Napawat (No <b>Mocassins),</b> a powerful and influent one friendly to Tene-angopte.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were two}} routes {{over the hills}} to the south, neither of which is clearly marked on the {{original}} survey maps. The western route crossed the Shawnee Hills at [...] "Buffalo Gap", near Goreville. The eastern crossed the Shawnee Hills at [...] "Mocassin Gap". While the Buffalo Gap route had the lower summit, the <b>Mocassin</b> Gap was the more direct route.|$|E
50|$|The short, mapped {{segment of}} the road between Wagon Creek and Reynoldsburg shows the road going down a steep grade to Sugar Creek. A high ridge lies between Sugar Creek and Reynoldsburg. From {{the top of the}} ridge, a modern road runs down to <b>Mocassin</b> Gap and Reynoldsburg. This is {{probably}} the route of the old road: except for the missing Sugar Creek crossing, there would be a modern road all the way from Creal Springs to Reynoldsburg.|$|E

60|$|As {{the last}} thought passed through his brain, Bracebridge's little mustang slouched past the window, ridden (without a saddle) by a {{horseman}} whom {{there was no}} mistaking for no one but the immaculate colonel, the chevalier sans peur et sans reproche, dared to go about the country 'such a figure.' A minute afterwards he walked in, in a student's felt hat, a ragged heather-coloured coatee, and old white 'regulation drills,' shrunk half-way up his legs, a pair of embroidered Indian <b>mocassins,</b> and an enormous meerschaum at his button-hole.|$|R
60|$|To such {{extremity}} {{were the}} gods driven that they ate the soft-tanned leather of their <b>mocassins</b> and mittens, while the dogs ate the harnesses off {{their backs and}} the very whip-lashes. Also, the dogs ate one another, and also the gods ate the dogs. The weakest and the more worthless were eaten first. The dogs that still lived, looked on and understood. A few of the boldest and wisest forsook the fires of the gods, which had now become a shambles, and fled into the forest, where, in the end, they starved to death or were eaten by wolves.|$|R

[...] "The bear is for your father, mademoiselle," [...] said he. [...] "This little skin I have brought from America for you. It is but a trifle, and yet it may serve to make a pair of <b>mocassins</b> or a pouch." ...|$|R
50|$|J.M. Weston is a French luxury shoe company {{founded by}} Édouard Blanchard in 1891, in Limoges. It is {{renowned for its}} {{handmade}} shoes for men. They also produce a full line of leather goods ranging from belts and briefcases to luggage items. The company's most famous models are the 677 Chasse (a sturdy outdoor shoe), 598 Demi-Chasse (a dressier version of the Chasse), and the 180 <b>Mocassin</b> (a classic penny loafer). J.M. Weston shoes are sold in its own boutiques, or in luxury department stores such as Harvey Nichols.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{terrestrial}} orchids, the rhizome {{is short and}} robust, growing in the uppermost soil layer. The rhizome grows annually with a growth bud {{at one end and}} dies off at the other end. The stem grows from the bud {{at the tip of the}} rhizome. Most slipper orchids have an elongate erect stem, with leaves growing along its length. But the <b>mocassin</b> flower or pink lady's slipper (Cypripedium acaule) has a short underground stem with leaves springing from the soil. The often hairy leaves can vary from ovate to elliptic or lanceolate, folded (plicate) along their length. The stems lack pseudobulbs.|$|E
50|$|On the {{original}} survey plats, a short {{segment of the}} Lusk's Ferry Road is labeled in Section 19, T11S, R4E. This segment lines up with the Wagon Creek Road, and is pointed toward modern Reynoldsburg, three miles (5 km) southeast, which some sources cite as having been on the road. (The road is not, however, shown on the map {{at the location of}} Reynoldsburg.) The Shawnee summit is between the mapped segment and Reynoldsburg, so this area was probably once called <b>Mocassin</b> Gap. Modern U.S. Route 45 crosses this area, but perpendicular to the apparent route of the old road.|$|E

[...] "The child didn't {{use to make}} <b>mocassins.</b> I'm not sure if {{she could do it}} at all; besides she was last heard of miles and miles away from here in another direction. No, no, Walter lad, we mustn't let foolish fancies bother us. However, the sight o' this has fixed me to push on to-morrow as hard as I can lay my legs to it, for if Wapaw's alive we can't fail to come up wi' him afore sundown; and I'm keen to turn about an' go after my children. I'll push on by myself if ye don't care to keep up wi me." ...|$|R
60|$|Tanner {{was worried}} into marrying a young squaw (at least {{he says he}} did it because the girl wanted it), and this led to all his sorrows--this and a quarrel with a medicine-man. The medicine-man accused him of being a wizard, and his wife got another Indian to shoot him. Tanner was far from surgeons, and he {{actually}} hacked out the bullet himself with an old razor. Another wounded Indian once amputated his own arm. The ancient Spartans could not have been pluckier. The Indians had other virtues as well as pluck. They were honest and so hospitable, before they knew white men's ways, that they would give poor strangers new <b>mocassins</b> and new buffalo cloaks.|$|R
60|$|Had Roy {{been a man}} and Nelly a woman, the {{two would}} {{probably}} have cast around a lingering glance of admiration, and then gone quietly about their avocations; but, being children, they made up their minds, on the spot, to enjoy the state of things to the utmost. They ran down to the lake and tried the ice. Finding that it {{was strong enough to}} bear them, they advanced cautiously out upon its glassy surface; then they tried to slide, but did not succeed well, owing to their soft <b>mocassins</b> being ill adapted for sliding. Then they picked up stones, and tried how far they could make them skim out on the lake.|$|R
