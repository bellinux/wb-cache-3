5|$|Goldhagen {{recommends}} several significant {{steps that}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by the Church to make reparation for its alleged role.

5|$|In early 1996, a {{few months}} after his {{credentials}} had been accepted, Carney met with senior Sudanese foreign ministry officials prior to vacating the U.S. embassy in Khartoum for the safer environs of Nairobi. He proposed tangible steps to recover the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Washington and Khartoum. In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A. Africa experts, about U.S. sanctions policy against Sudan and what measures <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by the Bashir regime to lift them.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Democratic {{leadership}} {{stated the}} bill <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from committee {{and brought to}} a debate before the full Senate, which was possible after March 10, 2009. Following a rally held on February 22, 2009, that opposed the passage of H.B. 444 and in which between 2,000 and 8,000 people participated, a number of Democratic senators became unwilling to {{vote in favor of}} the motion, citing concerns about changing common Senate procedure. The number of senators supporting civil unions was reduced from 18 to 13 out of 25 senators. Supporters held a candlelight vigil attended by 300 to 400 people in support of the bill on March 7, 2009.|$|E

5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
5|$|With no {{resources}} available from either Congress or the Continental Army, Irvine gave permission for volunteers to organize their own offensive. Detroit {{was too far}} and too strong for a small-scale operation, but militiamen such as David Williamson believed that an expedition against the American Indian towns on the Sandusky River was feasible. It {{was to be a}} low-budget campaign. Each volunteer had to provide at his expense a horse, rifle, ammunition, rations, and other equipment. Their only payment would be an exemption from two months of militia duty, plus whatever plunder <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> from the Indians. Because of ongoing Indian raids—the wife and children of a Baptist minister were killed and scalped in western Pennsylvania on May 12, 1782—there was no shortage of men willing to volunteer.|$|E
5|$|The {{state board}} that {{controlled}} the militia considered {{it to be}} pro-secessionist and ordered it to store its arms. On July 20, 1861, Buckner resigned from the state militia, declaring that {{he could no longer}} perform his duties due to the board's actions. That August he was twice offered a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army—the first from general in chief Winfield Scott, and the second from Secretary of War Simon Cameron following the personal order of President Abraham Lincoln—but he declined. After Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk occupied Columbus, Kentucky, violating the state's neutrality, Buckner accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on September 14, 1861, and was followed by many of the men he formerly commanded in the state militia. When his Confederate commission was approved, Union officials in Louisville indicted him for treason and seized his property. (Concerned that a similar action <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against his wife's property in Chicago, he had previously deeded it to his brother-in-law.) He became a division commander in the Army of Central Kentucky under Brig. Gen. William J. Hardee and was stationed in Bowling Green, Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by masters into free states. Most free states not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, when Nicholas {{expressed a}} desire to return to the Russian fleet at Kobe, Emperor Meiji ordered Prince Kitashirakawa, Prince Arisugawa Takehito, and Prince Arisugawa Taruhito to accompany him. Later, Emperor Meiji, ignoring protests from some senior statesman that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> hostage, paid a personal visit to the Tsesarevich, who was recuperating on a Russian warship in Kobe harbor.|$|E
25|$|While the Apostolic process {{concerning}} {{the reputation of}} sanctity was under way outside of Rome, documents were prepared by the Procurator of the cause for the discussion de non cultu, or absence of cultus, and at the appointed time an ordinary meeting (congregatio) was held in which the matter was investigated; if {{it was found that}} the decree of Pope Urban VIII had been obeyed, another decree provided that further steps <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b>|$|E
50|$|James then {{asserted}} that his oath {{was not meant}} to encroach upon anyone's conscientious convictions. Hereupon minimizers began to maintain that the words of the oath <b>might</b> <b>be</b> interpreted by the intention of the law-giver, that the oath <b>might</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{hydrophobicity}} of {{a compound}} can give scientists {{an indication of}} how easily a compound <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> up in groundwater to pollute waterways, and its toxicity to animals and aquatic life. Partition coefficient can also used to predict the mobility of radionuclides in groundwater. In the field of hydrogeology, the octanol-water partition coefficient, or Kow, is used to predict and model the migration of dissolved hydrophobic organic compounds in soil and groundwater.|$|E
25|$|The canonization of confessors or martyrs <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> up {{as soon as}} two miracles were {{reported}} to have been worked at their intercession, after the pontifical permission of public veneration as described above. At this stage it was only required that the two miracles worked after the permission awarding a public cultus be discussed in three meetings of the congregation. The discussion proceeded in the ordinary way; if the miracles were confirmed, another meeting (super tuto) was held. The pope then issued a Bull of Canonization in which he not only permitted, but commanded, the public cultus, or veneration, of the saint.|$|E
25|$|Sufficient {{stocks of}} {{supplies}} {{had not been}} prepared for the army, since the King Gustaf IV Adolf thought it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility {{of the armed forces}} or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Ayutthaya Kingdom {{entered into}} {{conflict}} with the East India Company, officially declaring war in August 1687. The reason was that the Englishman Samuel White had risen to prominence to become governor of Mergui in 1684, replacing his compatriot Barnaby. From there he traded under {{the flag of the}} Ayutthaya Kingdom and engaged in piracy, sometimes attacking ships under English jurisdiction. The English responded by sending warships to the harbour of Mergui, and the Thai, fearing that the city <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> and resenting corruption, massacred most of the English residents there.In place of Samuel White, the French Chevalier de Beauregard was nominated Governor of Mergui by the king of Ayutthaya in 1687.|$|E
25|$|When Bakunin visited Japan {{after his}} escape from Siberia, {{he was not}} really {{involved}} in its politics or with the Japanese peasants. This <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as evidence of a basic disinterest in Asia, {{but that would be}} incorrect. Bakunin stopped over briefly in Japan as part of a hurried flight from twelve years of imprisonment, a marked man racing across the world to his European home; he had neither Japanese contacts nor any facility in the Japanese language; the small number of expatriate newspapers by Europeans published in China and Japan provided no insights into local revolutionary conditions or possibilities. Besides, Bakunin's conversion to anarchism came in 1865, towards the end of his life, and four years after his time in Japan.|$|E
25|$|While {{performing}} {{experiments to}} test hypotheses, scientists {{may have a}} preference for one outcome over another, {{and so it is}} important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias. This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions. After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Taken</b> in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).|$|E

25|$|Francisco Portusach {{returned}} to Piti where {{his brother was}} waiting for him, and was informed that the Spanish officers were under arrest, but had been paroled {{with the understanding that}} they would deliver themselves on board the Charleston so they <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to Manila as prisoners of war. Francisco then ordered his head boatman, Tiburcio de los Santos, and several of his men to deliver the lighters and boats to the Charleston early in the morning. The two brothers got into their buggy and started for Agana. On the road home they met several soldiers who were struggling with two small artillery pieces which had been turned back by Captain Duarte since it was not necessary to salute the American cruiser.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from field corn was spurred in the U.S. {{by the discovery}} that methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms {{are in fact}} carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and biochemistry is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the history of biochemistry <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term biochemistry was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening {{in the rate of}} increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as BIOSIS Previews and Biological Abstracts, which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically {{that by the end of}} the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic database.|$|E
