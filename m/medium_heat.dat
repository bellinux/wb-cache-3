25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano and spices until cooked throughout. The meat is roasted at <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester and nylon cook bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|E
2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces. Two main types are well known in their cuisine: kecap asin which translates to 'salty kecap' in Indonesian (a salty soy sauce) and kecap manis or literally [...] "sweet kecap" [...] in Indonesian. Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a bay leaf reduced over <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> until rather syrupy. A third type, kecap ikan, meaning [...] "fish kecap" [...] is fish sauce similar to the Thai nam pla or the Philippine patis. It is not, however, soy-based.|$|E

40|$|Hot air and {{hot water}} heating {{methods have been}} {{extensively}} studied as thermal treatments to control insect pests in fruits to replace chemical fumigation. An inherent difficulty in using these methods is that slow heating rates may result in long treatment times and possible damage to fruit quality. Many factors influence heating time. A systematic analysis of those influences is desirable to help in designing effective treatment protocols. A simulation model based on heat transfer theory was developed to study the effect of fruit thermal property, fruit size, <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> and <b>heating</b> <b>medium</b> speed on <b>heat</b> transfer rates within spherical fruits. The simulation demonstrated that the small variation in thermal diffusivity among fruits {{had little effect on}} heating time. Fruit internal heat transfer rate was significantly influenced by fruit size and by <b>heating</b> <b>medium.</b> Water was a more efficient medium than air and increasing air speed increased heating rates. Water circulation speeds had little influence on heat transfer rate. The Biot number showed that internal energy transfer by conduction was a heating rate limiting factor. Combining low frequency electromagnetic energy with hot air or hot water eliminated conduction as a major rate-limiting factor because the energy was directly delivered to the fruit interior. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.
