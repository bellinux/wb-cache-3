40|$|Mutations in the HIV- 1 genes {{associated}} with resistance to antiretroviral drugs were detected also in primary HIV infected individuals {{who did not}} receive antiretroviral treatment. Drug resistance genotyping of HIV pol gene was done by in situ DNA hybridization using a Line Probe Assay and by direct sequencing. Viral variants harbouring resistance mutations such as: M 41, T 69 R, K 70 R, M 184 V, T 215 Y in the pol gene were detected in 14 % of the subjects. HIV mutants resistant to NRT inhibitors were found in 10 and 20 % of patients infected {{before and after the}} year 2000, respectively. <b>Multiple</b> drug <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> (2 – 3 drug classes) were present in 3. 5 % of the mainly recently infected patients.

These findings indicate the evolution of drug resistance showing a correlation with the time of introduction of combination therapy in our country, where more than 70 % of HIV infections were by homo/bisexual transmission. This confirms the transmission of drug-resistant HIV shown by genotype testing during primary infection in therapy-naive patients and initiates serious clinical and public health consequences...|$|R
40|$|Antiviral {{treatment}} of HIV- 1 infection often fails {{because of the}} rapid emergence of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> within weeks of the start of therapy. This {{raises the question of}} whether <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> pre-exist in drug-naive patients or whether it is produced after the start of therapy. Here we compare the likelihood of pre-existence with the likelihood of production of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> during therapy. We show that provided <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> pre-exists, then a stronger therapy may lead to a greater initial reduction of virus load, but will also cause a faster rise of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus.</b> In this case the total benefit of treatment is independent of the degree of inhibition of sensitive virus. If, on the other hand, resistant mutants do not pre-exist, then the emergence of resistance during treatment depends on the efficacy of the drug. If the drug is sufficiently potent to eradicate sensitive virus, then the probability that resistant mutants first appear during therapy is smaller than the probability that they existed before therapy. If the drug cannot eradicate the sensitive virus, then after sufficiently long time resistant mutants will appear. However, mutants that are unlikely to pre-exist may taken long time to appear...|$|R

40|$|For most HIV-infected patients, {{antiretroviral}} therapy controls viral replication. However, in {{some patients}} drug resistance can cause therapy to fail. Nonetheless, continued therapy with a failing regimen can preserve or even lead to increases in CD 4 + T cell counts. To understand the biological basis of these observations, we used mathematical models to explain observations made in patients with drug-resistant HIV treated with enfuvirtide (ENF/T- 20), an HIV- 1 fusion inhibitor. Due to resistance emergence, ENF {{was removed from the}} drug regimen, drug-sensitive virus regrown, and ENF was re-administered. We used our model to study the dynamics of plasma-viral RNA and CD 4 + T cell levels, and the competition between drug-sensitive and <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> during therapy interruption and re-administration. Focusing on <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> carrying the V 38 A mutation in gp 41, we found ENF-resistant virus to be 17 ± 3 % less fit than ENF-sensitive virus {{in the absence of the}} drug, and that the loss of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> during therapy interruption was primarily due to this fitness cost. Using viral dynamic parameters estimated from these patients, we show that although re-administration of ENF cannot suppress viral load, it can, in the presence of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus,</b> increase CD 4 + T cell counts, which should yield clinical benefits.

40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} {{and spread}} of drug <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> variants reflects both within-host and between-host processes. We develop an epidemiological model {{that can be}} used to address the spread of resistance at the population level, and a virus dynamics model {{that can be used}} to study the dynamics of virus over the time course of an individual’s infection. The dynamics depend in an important way on the competition between drug sensitive and drug <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> strains. A key observation is that the strength of competition between strains is strongly modulated by the degree of cross-immunity that infection with one strain confers against infection with the other. At the within-host level, we see that an efficient immune response can reduce the likelihood of the emergence of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus.</b> Consequently, resistance poses more of a problem for chronic infections in which there is significant immune impairment than for acute infections.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of drug <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses,</b> {{together with the}} possibility of increased virulence, is an important concern in the development of new antiviral compounds. Cidofovir (CDV) is a phosphonate nucleotide that is approved for use against cytomegalovirus retinitis and for the emergency treatment of smallpox or complications following vaccination. One mode of action for CDV has been demonstrated to be the inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase. Results We have isolated several CDV resistant (CDV R) vaccinia viruses through a one step process, two of which have unique single mutations within the DNA polymerase. An additional <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> isolate provides evidence of a second site mutation within the genome involved in CDV resistance. The CDV R viruses were 3 – 7 fold more resistant to the drug than the parental viruses. The virulence of the CDV R viruses was tested in mice inoculated intranasally and all were found to be attenuated. Conclusion Resistance to CDV in vaccinia virus can be conferred individually by at least two different mutations within the DNA polymerase gene. Additional genes may be involved. This one step approach for isolating <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> without serial passage and in the presence of low doses of drug minimizes unintended secondary mutations and is applicable to other potential antiviral agents. </p...|$|R

Here we report three <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> of the A/Perth/ 16 / 2009 strain that were selected {{in the presence of a}} broadly neutralizing stalk-binding antibody. The three <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> harbor three different mutations in the HA stalk: (1) Gln 387 Lys; (2) Asp 391 Tyr; (3) Asp 391 Gly. The Gln 387 Lys mutation completely abolishes binding of the antibody to the HA stalk epitope. The other two mutations, Asp 391 Tyr and Asp 391 Gly, do not affect antibody binding at neutral pH and only slightly reduce binding at low pH. Interestingly, they enhance the fusion ability of the HA, representing a novel mechanism that allows productive membrane fusion even in the presence of antibody and hence virus escape from antibody neutralization. Therefore, these mutations illustrate two different resistance mechanisms used by IAV to escape broadly neutralizing stalk-binding antibodies.

Drug resistant HBV species with specific polymerase mutations may emerge during lamivudine treatment.  AIMS—To examine the clinical consequences of graft infection by lamivudine <b>resistant</b> <b>virus.</b>  METHODS—The clinical course of four liver transplant patients who developed graft infection with lamivudine <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> was reviewed. The response of HBV infection to reduction of immunosuppression and to manipulation of antiviral therapy was assessed. For each patient, serum viral titre was measured and the viral polymerase gene was sequenced at multiple time points.  RESULTS—High serum titres were observed following emergence of the lamivudine resistant species. Wild type HBV re-emerged as the dominant serum species after lamivudine withdrawal. All patients developed liver failure, and onset of liver dysfunction was observed when <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> was the dominant serum species. In three patients, liver recovery was observed when immunosuppression was stopped and when alternative antivirals were given. Wild type virus appeared to respond to ganciclovir, and to reintroduction of lamivudine.

40|$|AbstractResistance to the adamantane {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs by human A/H 3 N 2 influenza viruses currently exceeds 90 % in the United States and multiple Asian countries. Adamantane resistance {{is associated with}} a single amino acid change (S 31 N) in the M 2 protein, which was shown to rapidly disseminate globally in 2005 in association with a genome reassortment event. However, the exact origin of influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses carrying the S 31 N mutation has not been characterized, particularly in South-East Asia. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA, and M 1 / 2 segments of viral isolates collected between 1997 and 2007 from temperate localities in the Northern hemisphere (New York State, United States, 492 isolates) and Southern hemisphere (New Zealand and Australia, 629 isolates) and a subtropical locality in South-East Asia (Hong Kong, 281 isolates).

40|$|Background/Aims: Orthotopic liver {{transplantation}} has {{an established}} {{role for the}} treatment of patients with chronic liver failure secondary to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Unfortunately, recurrent infection of the graft can be associated with aggressive disease, and with diminished graft and patient survival. Currently the role of nucleoside analogues for prevention of graft re-infection is being evaluated. Preliminary results are encouraging, but treatment failure has been associated with emergence of drug-resistant virus. Methods: We have studied ten consecutive patients who received lamivudine prophylaxis for prevention of HBV graft reinfection. Sequential sera, collected prelamivudine then during treatment before and after liver transplantation, were examined. Conventional serological markers were measured, as were serum viral DNA levels with a sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: Lamivudine treatment effected a reduction in serum HBV levels, but six patients still had measurable viral DNA at the time of transplantation. Five patients developed graft re-infection with lamivudine-resistant <b>virus.</b> <b>Resistant</b> <b>virus</b> emerged 8 to 15 months post-transplant. The likelihood of emergence of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> was related to the pre-treatment serum HBV titre, Persistent serum viral DNA positivity and evidence of graft re-infection during the early post-transplant period did not predict the subsequent emergence of <b>resistant</b> <b>virus.</b> Conclusions: Our observations suggest that the resistant species may be present in the viral quasispecies in the serum and liver of patients with high-level replication prior to lamivudine exposure. The resistant species can persist during lamivudine treatment prior to transplantation, and emerge following transplantation. These observations suggest strategies which might prevent the emergence of drug-resistant species, and imply that graft re-infection may be a preventable phenomenon...|$|R

From 1999 to 2003, resistance-mutations to drugs with high genetic-barrier significantly decreased (L 90 M/V 82 A/M 46 I/I 54 V/G 73 S/I 84 V/G 48 V for PIs; M 41 L/D 67 N/L 210 W/V 1181 for NRTIs, p < 0. 05), while mutations to drugs with low genetic-barrier increased (D 30 N in protease, M 184 V/K 103 N/V 108 I in reverse transcriptase, p < 0. 05). Taken together, earlier recruitment to first GRT in patients with less severe disease, and with lower prevalence of drug-resistant viruses may further improve therapeutic strategies aimed at longer and greater control of HIV-related disease progression...|$|R

However, isolates from various HIV- 1 subtypes (such as clade C, D, A/E, F and group O) were not inhibited by 2 G 12 mAb (IC 50 > 20  μg/ml). 2 G 12 mAb pressure in HIV- 1 IIIB- and NL 4. 3 -infected T cell cultures selected for <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> containing only few (1 to 3 N-glycosylation) deletions in gp 120. The 2 G 12 -resistant viruses keep their full sensitivity to various mannose-specific lectins and other known HIV entry inhibitors. Moreover, we {{observed that the}} NL 4. 3 - 2 G 12 -resistant virus, with the N 295 K mutation in gp 120, became significantly more sensitive to several mannose-specific lectins. This is, to our knowledge, the first report showing that a <b>resistant</b> <b>virus</b> generated in vitro against a neutralizing mAb and containing a mutation in gp 120, has increased sensitivity to another class of HIV entry inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Influenza {{neuraminidase}} (NA) {{plays an}} important role in viral replication, and characterization of <b>viruses</b> <b>resistant</b> to NA inhibitors will help elucidate the role of active-site residues. This information will assist in designing better inhibitors targeted to essential active-site residues that cannot generate drug-resistant mutations. In the present study we used the benzoic acid-based inhibitor BCX- 140 to select and characterize <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses.</b> BCX- 140 binds to the NA active site in an orientation that is opposite that of a sialic acid-based compound, 4 -guanidino- 2, 4 -dideoxy- 2, 3 -dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (GANA). Thus, the guanidino group of BCX- 140 binds to Glu- 276, whereas in GANA the guanidino group binds to Glu- 119. We passaged influenza A/Singapore/ 1 / 57 (H 2 N 2) in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in the presence of BCX- 140, and <b>virus</b> <b>resistant</b> to this inhibitor was selected after six passages. The NA of this mutant was still sensitive to inhibition by BCX- 140. However, the mutant <b>virus</b> was <b>resistant</b> to BCX- 140 in plaque and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Sequence analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes revealed changes in both, although none were in the active site of the NA. Depending on the method of selection of the <b>resistant</b> <b>virus,</b> two types of changes associated with the sialic acid binding site were seen in the HA. One is a change in HA 1 of Ala- 133 to Thr, a residue close to the binding site, while the other change was Arg- 132 of HA 1 to Gln, which in HA 1 of serotype H 3 is a sialic acid contact (Asn- 137). Binding studies revealed that both types of <b>resistant</b> <b>viruses</b> had reduced receptor binding affinity compared to that of the wild type. Thus, resistance to BCX- 140 was generated by modifying the HA. NA active-site residue 276 may be essential for activity, and thus, it cannot be changed to generate resistance. However, drug-induced changes in the HA can result in a virus that is less dependent on NA activity for growth in cells and, hence, resistant to NA inhibitors...|$|R
