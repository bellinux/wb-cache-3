5000|$|Phaeogalera {{is a small}} genus of slender, fleshy bog and swamp-inhabiting {{mushrooms}} with large, brownish spores with a germ pore and a hymenium lacking chrysocystidia. Phaeogalera resemble Galerina {{in their}} habitat, <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearance,</b> and spore print color, however, their microscopic characteristics (smooth spores with a distinct germ pore and non-tibiiform cystidia) more closely resemble Psilocybe. The type species, Phaeogalera stagnina, has an Arctic-alpine distribution in the Northern Hemisphere extending into the boreal forests and taiga. It grows {{along the edges of}} bogs in peaty soils and sometimes amongst Sphagnum or other mosses. This type species has been classified in Galerina, Tubaria and Psilocybe. Modern molecular evidence supports the recognition of Phaeogalera as an independent genus separate from Galerina. The generic name is built upon the antiquated generic name [...] "Galera", now synonymous with Galerina, and with a reference to the darker colors of the basidiospores of Phaeogalera. When originally proposed by Kühner, he forgot to fully cite the original publication for the type species which explains by the name was later validly published by Pegler & Young in 1975. The genus Meottomyces was segregated from Phaeogalera after briefly being classified together by Romagnesi (under the name [...] "P. oedipus").|$|E

40|$|Glomus tumor is an {{infrequent}} and in {{most cases}} benign mesenchymal neoplasia which affects subcutaneous/submucosal tissue and occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, solid organs (e. g. liver, kidney) and the extremities. Visceral glomus tumor of the stomach generally presents with non-specific epigastric pain, loss of appetite and GI bleeding (melaena), often without haemodynamic instability. <b>Macroscopic</b> <b>appearances</b> on upper GI endoscopy are non-diagnostic. Endosonographic appearances are generally heterogenous and poorly-reflective, hence fail to differentiate glomus tumor from other potential diagnoses. Histological confirmation of the diagnosis is only possible when a fine needle biopsy is inclusive of abnormal tissue. These difficulties in diagnosis mean that in many cases, only immunohistochemical analysis of surgically resected tissue can distinguish glomus tumor from several possible differentials. Therefore, endoscopically-assisted laparoscopic curative wedge-resection of a lesion suspicious for glomus tumor of the upper gastrointestinal tract must be considered first-line in terms of a combined investigative and curative approach...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the significance of}} the endoscopic classification of gastritis proposed by a working party at the World Congress of Gastroenterology in Sydney 1990, 167 patients undergoing upper alimentary endoscopy were prospectively assessed by comprehensive endoscopic and histological methods. Ninety eight patients had endoscopic mucosal changes of gastritis according to the Sydney classification. Twenty six (27 %) of these had histologically normal biopsy specimens. This was not statistically significantly different to the 26 (38 %) of 69 with normal endoscopies whose biopsy specimens were histologically normal (chi 2 = 1. 857, p > 0. 1). Forty three (62. 5 %) patients with normal endoscopies had histological gastritis.

30|$|A seed {{is a small}} {{embryonic}} plant {{enclosed in}} a protective covering called the seed coat (Fenner and Thompson [2005]). As compared to most flowering plants, the structure of orchid seeds is minute and simple (Dressler [1993]). The orchid seeds generally lack a well-defined endosperm and contain a globular-shaped embryo covering by the thin layers of seed coats (Arditti [1992]). Although the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearances</b> of various orchid seeds are similar, the orchid seeds are highly diverse owing to their seed coats (Clements and Molvray [1999]). The morphological variability in seed coats of orchids may relate to the dispersal strategy and seed dormancy. The seeds of Vanilla species are hard and black, and embedded in the fresh and non-dehiscent fruits that are adapted to bird-dispersed (Cameron and Chase [1998]; Rodolphe et al. [2011]). These characteristics, i.e. the hard seed body and the fresh fruit are unique that could be observed in the basal genera of orchid family, such as Apostasia, Selenipedium and Vanilla (Nishimura and Tamura [1993]; Nishimura and Yukawa [2010]).|$|R
40|$|Careful {{endoscopic}} {{classification of}} <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearance</b> of superficial neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract {{is essential in}} the early detection and appropriate treatment of cancer. It has contributed to introduce minimally invasive endoscopic surgery and has significantly improved survival of patients with colon and gastric cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity has been characterized, in past and present times, by poor prognosis and lack of progress in treatment outcome. Failure in diagnosing oral malignancy {{at an early stage}} is a major culprit, and the lack of a worldwide adopted classification of its <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearance,</b> similar to that of gastrointestinal neoplasias, may have contributed to it. AIM: To test the hypothesis that is possible to extend the diagnostic benefit of a classification based upon the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearance</b> of superficial tumours of the digestive tract to superficial carcinoma of the oral mucosa. METHODS: We retrospectively examined a group of patients who developed multiple intraepithelial and early invasive malignant oral neoplasias, applying {{a modified version of the}} Paris classification of superficial GI neoplastic lesions. One hundred and ten out of 116 (94. 9 %) of the study lesions had morphological features that accorded with the prepared classification.

40|$|A multi-analytical {{approach}} {{has been applied to}} characterize Khirbet Kerak Ware from the archaeological site of Khirbet al-Batrawy (Jordan), a highly distinctive pottery production of Early Bronze III Levant. Sherds of Khirbet Kerak Ware vessels, dating back to 2750 - 2500 B. C., show peculiar shapes and a highly polished red/black coating, alien to other Levantine ceramic traditions. Micro-Raman, infrared spectroscopic and petrographic data have been obtained with the aim of defining the fabric, tracing the origin of the raw material used in the manufacturing process and exploring the technological aspects. The results on Khirbet Kerak Ware are then compared with those of ceramics of the same period found at that site in order to highlight possible differences or similarities in the manufacturing process. All these pottery productions reveal similar mineralogical composition, compatible with a local sourcing of the raw materials; moreover, the identification of a specific mineral assemblage allows to estimate a firing temperature ranging from 850 degrees C to 900 degrees C. In spite of the marked differences observed between <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearances</b> of Khirbet Kerak Ware and those of other coeval and local pottery productions, the results are indicative of overall local manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{study the}} {{pathological}} features of fungal infections affecting the lower intestinal tract (duodenum, {{small and large}} bowels). METHODS: Between mid- 1981 and mid- 1991, 14 cases of deep mycotic infections affecting the lower intestinal tract were found among 890 consecutive necropsies on patients with malignant disease treated in a regional cancer centre (incidence 1. 6 %). These 14 cases accounted for 54 % of all gastrointestinal fungal infection detected. The relevant clinical, necropsy, histological and microbiological data were reviewed. RESULTS: Candida spp and Aspergillus spp accounted for all infections. The <b>macroscopic</b> <b>appearances</b> included ulcers of varying configuration, mucosal flecks, sloughed mucous membranes, polypoid masses and segmental lesions. Either organism could produce this range of lesions, but Candida tended to have a mucosal location and Aspergillus was associated with transmural invasion. Combined infections showed Candida in the surface mucosa and Aspergillus hyphae in submucosal vessels with spread into the bowel wall in a radiating pattern. During the final illness, gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were often slight and microbiological investigations were unhelpful. CONCLUSIONS: Variable gross appearances are relevant for endoscopists, particularly lesions which resemble pseudomembranous colitis. Endoscopic biopsy specimens may {{have a role in}} antemortem diagnosis. Failure to diagnose these infections during life emphasises the importance of necropsy in the clinicopathological audit of deaths in this group of patients...|$|R
