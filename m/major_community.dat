25|$|In {{the state}} capital Adelaide, a {{conventional}} paid service exists, the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service (SAMFS). A handful of large towns in South Australia also have retained their own metropolitan services, {{but the vast majority}} (over 430 communities) rely on the CFS. Several Adelaide suburbs that retain extensive scrubland have CFS stations whose area of operation overlaps that of the SAMFS with joint training exercises sometimes organised for <b>major</b> <b>community</b> facilities such as the Flinders Medical Centre. For urban incidents, both services will often attend with the Country Fire Service taking command.|$|E

25|$|The Konkan {{region has}} {{witnessed}} the immigration of various groups, {{such as the}} Bene Israeli,and Kudaldeshkars. Each of these settled in distinct parts {{of the region and}} there was little mingling between them. The Chitpavans were apparently the last <b>major</b> <b>community</b> to arrive there and consequently the area in which they settled, around Ratnagiri, was both the least fertile and that with a relative scarcity of good ports for trading. While the other groups generally took up trade as their primary occupation, the Chitpavans became known as administrators.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{nitrogen}} eutrophication decreases the amount of carbon allocation to soil biota over longer periods of time. This can pose problems to the mycobionts, whose production of sporocarps later in the growing season is totally dependent upon the allocation of photosynthates from host plants. Unlike the <b>major</b> <b>community</b> shifts that can occur in sporocarp responses to nitrogen addition, root tips and soil hyphae respond in a considerably subtler manner in the short term. However, over longer periods of time, eutrophication can cause major shifts in the dominant fungi and dramatically alter belowground diversity.|$|E

25|$|Teignmouth and Shaldon {{museum was}} {{completed}} in 2011. It comprises an architecturally iconic extension of the existing 18th century museum building, with new roof terrace looking over the town, glass tower and community facility. Some of the exhibits include a restored bathing machine; artefacts from the Church Rock wreck, such as cannons; exhibits from the nearby Haldon aerodrome, plus film footage including the Beatles' visit to {{the town and the}} 2009 homecoming concerts by Muse. The new build cost almost £1.1m and was enabled by a <b>major</b> <b>community</b> fund-raising effort, in combination with Lottery and UK government funding and other sources such as local grant funders and Devon County Council.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} {{was at first}} heavily German but many Jews from the Lower East side of Manhattan came to the area when the Williamsburg Bridge was completed. Williamsburg was a financial hub rivaling Wall Street for a time, with its two <b>major</b> <b>community</b> banks: the Williamsburgh Savings Bank (chartered 1851, since absorbed by HSBC) and its rival the Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburgh (chartered 1864, {{now known as the}} DIME, has remained independent). The area around the Peter Luger Steak House, established in 1887, in the predominantly German neighborhood under the Williamsburg Bridge, was a major banking hub until the City of Brooklyn united with New York City. One of the early high schools in Brooklyn, the Eastern District High School, opened here in February 1900.|$|E
25|$|Since the Middle Ages, popes have {{encouraged}} devotions such as Eucharistic Adoration, the Rosary and the Stations of the Cross. However, {{the position of}} the Church with respect to the primacy of liturgy over specific devotions has always been maintained. On the other hand, pious devotions have influenced some important parts of the Catholic calendar such as the feast of Corpus Christi which arose after petitions by those following the devotion; or various Marian feasts that gradually appeared with the growth of devotions. Catholic devotions can form the basis of <b>major</b> <b>community</b> events e.g. the statue of our Our Lady of Zapopan attracts over one million pilgrims on October 12 each year as the statue travels through the streets moving from one Cathedral to another.|$|E

25|$|Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville. In a <b>major</b> <b>community</b> survey, {{close to}} 30% of the {{respondents}} described the town as fine, good, nice, great, or pleasant; more than half {{of the respondents}} like the community or small town feel, while 46.3% enjoyed the friendly neighbourhoods. The most important municipal issues indicated by residents in 2008 were the need to improve the road system; traffic issues; increasing urbanization and overcrowding; land use development and sprawl; and the cost of living (including taxes and user fees) in the town. Environmental protection, including environmental assessments for new development and natural preservation measures, was identified as matter of high importance by residents, but low on a scale of satisfaction. In the hamlet of Musselman's Lake, 72% of residents in 2009 were concerned about the environmental health of the lake and the surrounding community. All municipalities in York Region except Whitchurch–Stouffville have an active Environmental Advisory Committee; the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville dismantled its committee after the municipal elections in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Euonymeia {{is largely}} a {{residential}} area, with small shops and businesses along Ionias and Dodecanesou avenues. The central public space of the community stretches along {{the path of the}} Trachones stream, most of which now runs underground. This area features Karaiskakis square and park, which includes the [...] "Klouva" [...] outdoor public basketball court, and the municipal amphitheater, where the <b>major</b> <b>community</b> events take place. Adjacent to the square is a large school complex with two public elementary schools, and the 2nd Lyceum of Alimos public high school. Next to the school complex is the Municipal Indoor Gymnasium of Trachones with a capacity for 350 seated spectators, the home court of the three local Basketball teams Trachones - Dias Union, A.L.F. Alimos, A.O. Kalamaki, and the Trachones Volleyball team. Along the same axis next to the Geroulanou Estate is Trachones Field ( [...] , Gipedo Trachonon), a 457-seat track and field stadium that is the seat of the local soccer team, FC Trachones.|$|E
500|$|When PA646 becomes NY16 at {{the state}} line, it is already {{at a very high}} {{elevation}} on a ridgecrest, and at a rise two miles (3.2km) into New York, it reaches [...] in elevation, making it the highest state highway in western New York and {{among the highest in the}} state. It remains at a high elevation for several more miles, through what was once one of New York's major oil fields. Afterwards, NY16 then begins to drop through a narrow valley to cross the Allegheny River and enter its first <b>major</b> <b>community,</b> the city of Olean (which, like several other communities in the region, takes its name from oil). It crosses the city as Union Street, intersecting its first state highway, NY417, at State Street. Here, ownership and maintenance of NY16 shifts to the city for six blocks before becoming state-maintained once more at the point where North Union Street heads northwest to serve North Olean.|$|E
