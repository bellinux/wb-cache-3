40|$|Compliant washer seals high {{pressures}} without excessive {{compressive stress}} on transducer. Conformal washer serves as effective seal for transducer passing through walls of pressure vessel. Washer makes it unnecessary to tighten <b>mounting</b> <b>nut</b> to high torque, which could damage transducer or adversely affect accuracy. Washer {{also used to}} seal mountings for temperature sensors and other devices...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{interchangeable}} barrel revolvers produced {{were the}} Dan Wesson Models W8, W9, W11, and W12, all medium-frame size frame revolvers chambered in [...]38 Special or [...]357 Magnum. The W8 and W11 had either a fixed rear sight, or a rear sight adjustable only for windage, while the W9 and W12 featured a rear sight fully adjustable for both windage and elevation. The barrels and shrouds for both models were interchangeable {{and used a}} large externally <b>mounted</b> <b>nut</b> on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange (known to collectors as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] shrouds) which mated with {{the front of the}} revolver's frame. Initial barrel/shroud options were 2 1/2-inch, 4-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inches. A custom barrel nut wrench and feeler gauge were supplied with each pistol, and barrel changes could be accomplished in two minutes or less.|$|R
40|$|Nut overcomes {{mechanical}} mismatch from accumulated tolerances {{and maintains}} assembly even if <b>mounting</b> screw loosens. <b>Nut</b> and screws can be painted with bonding agent to insure lock. If assemblies are removed frequently, nut and screws {{can be made}} of steel to reduce {{wear and tear on}} threads and risk of faulty threads...|$|R

The journey will take Milk through several levels where the process of finding and saving his love will repeat itself several times as <b>Nuts</b> <b>mounts</b> an ever-present {{resistance}} against his quest for romance.|$|R
40|$|During the {{production}} of aerospace components, many time consuming and complicated manual processes are included. ● Drilling holes through composite and alloy ● Countersinking of holes ● <b>Mounting</b> bolts and <b>nuts</b> The general task {{is to look at}} how these processes can be automated. In agreement with KDA, we have chosen to mainly look at the process of automating the bolt assembly process, after the drilling and countersinking process is completed. Although we are only looking at this operation, KDA preferably wants a product that can complete the entire process, so it is important for us to design our product with the entire process in mind...|$|R
5000|$|The {{driving system}} for a home lift is often built inside the lift {{structure}} itself and features a screw, an electric motor, and a <b>nut</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the control panel of the lift's platform; it is thus {{referred to as a}} [...] "screw and nut" [...] system. When the lift is operated, the engine forces the nut to rotate around the screw, pushing the lift up and down. Most home lifts come with an open platform structure to free even more space and grant access from 3 different sides of the platform. This requires all producers to include specific safety mechanisms and, in some countries, to limit the travel speed.|$|R

5000|$|MIL-DTL-83538, (formerly MIL-C-83538) {{describes}} connectors and accessories, electrical, circular, umbilical. The {{connector assembly}} provides the necessary connections {{required to meet}} a MIL-STD-1760, Class I electrical interface between stores and their associated launchers using a [...] "blind mating" [...] mechanism. The connector assembly consists of a receptacle installed on the launcher, a receptacle installed on the store, and a buffer plug installed between the two receptacles. This specification also includes the required <b>mounting</b> adapters and <b>nut,</b> accessory adapter, cable bushing, and protective covers. This connector assembly provides the transfer of MIL-STD-1760 interface class I electrical signals and power between an aircraft (or ground vehicle) mounted launcher and an associated store. This connector is military unique because {{it is intended to}} be used on rail and eject launchers where engagement/disengagement of the launcher receptacle (with attached buffer plug) to the store receptacle will be via a blindmate mechanical mechanism; whereas no known commercially equivalent substitute is available. The insert arrangement is 25-20 of MIL-STD-1560.|$|R
