25|$|Another {{weakness}} of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is {{the difficulty in}} determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building orogeny releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their <b>magnetic</b> <b>signature.</b> This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations. Moreover, further evidence is accumulating that large-scale remagnetization events have taken place which may necessitate revision of the estimated positions of the palaeomagnetic poles.|$|E
25|$|The Archer class {{submarines}} {{were designed}} and built by Kockums AB as single-hull, double compartment submarines optimised to reduce noise and <b>magnetic</b> <b>signature.</b> The two pressure-tight compartments also enhance safety and survivability of the crew. The submarines were designed {{to operate in the}} shallow waters of the Baltic Sea and are therefore also optimised for operation in Singapore waters, which have similar depth profiles.The Archer class submarines are also equipped with Stirling AIP engines. This enables the submarines to have longer submerged endurance and lower noise signature, enhancing the stealth capability of the submarines. The advanced sonar system allows the submarines to detect contacts at a further distance, while the torpedo system has a better target acquisition capability, which allows the submarines to engage contacts at a longer range.|$|E

Subsequent {{to the location of}} the Titanic and the [...] by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the museum conducted a seminar at the 50th anniversary of the ship's loss in November 1991 to determine if Sydney could be located. This project was assisted by Associate Professor Kim Kirsner of the University of Western Australia. While the size of the area being searched in the hunt for Kormoran was reduced to a size similar to that used in previous successful searches, the oceanographers, scientists, and search and rescue specialists at the seminar could not reduce the area to be searched for Sydney below a [...] zone. While the location of the battle as reported by German sailors and their commander had been confirmed by oceanographic evidence, researchers were unsure of the whereabouts of Sydney. One alternative was that the ship had tried to reach the nearest dry dock at Surabaya; another possibility was that they had tried to head toward the nearest port facility at Geraldton. Some Germans said they saw the Sydney sink while they rowed towards its burning hulk after they had abandoned their own ship; others said it had disappeared on a south-east course into the night. As a result of pressure from the newly formed HMAS Sydney Foundation Trust, a joint standing committee held a parliamentary inquiry in 1997 into the circumstances surrounding the sinking of Sydney. The inquiry was the largest in Australia’s history, receiving submissions from hundreds of parties. The committee made a number of findings and recommendations, concluding: ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A {{methodology}} {{was developed}} to evaluate and mitigate the impacts of particle size and post-depositional diagenesis when using mineral <b>magnetic</b> <b>signatures</b> to trace the sources of historically deposited sediment in farm dams in the South African Karoo. Materials and methods: Samples {{from a range of}} potential sediment sources were sieved to different particle size fractions, and the relationships between pairs of tracer signatures were established for each fraction. Non-conservatism of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>signatures</b> was determined by identifying whether the <b>magnetic</b> <b>signatures</b> of the farm dam sediments were within the range of those of the fractionated source samples. By fractionating the sediment source samples, the core samples were able to be traced using appropriately sized sources. Results and discussion: It was found that strong relationships existed between the pairs of tracer signatures at all particle size fractions. Relationships in the < 32 μm fraction were significantly different to that of coarser fractions. It was also found that particle size had a large effect on all <b>magnetic</b> <b>signatures</b> and would prove to be a large source of uncertainty if not accounted for within any methodology developed for quantitative source discrimination and source apportionment. There was very little non-conservatism caused by diagenetic or biogenic processes in six of the seven dams sampled. In one dam, there was evidence to suggest that dissolution had probably caused the loss of almost all small superparamagnetic and stable single-domain grains. The other signatures associated with coarser magnetic grains in this dam were generally unaffected by the dissolution processes. Conclusions: The good preservation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>signatures</b> suggests that they can make reliable tracers over historical timescales (up to 164 years) in the Karoo and similar semi- arid catchments. However, the mitigation of particle size effects and screening for post-depositional alteration {{is an essential part of}} their use. The methodology presented in this paper is a potential way of recognising tracer non-conservatism and limiting its effects in future studies...|$|R
