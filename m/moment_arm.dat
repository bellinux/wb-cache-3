25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning <b>moment</b> <b>arm.</b> In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge.

The aim of this study was to compare estimates of Achilles tendon <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> when calculated using the different constraints of constant force (and thus tendon stretch), constant joint torque, or contraction effort.

40|$|Abstract—Almost all {{computer}} {{models of the}} musculoskeletal system represent muscle geometry using a series of line segments. This simplification (i) limits the ability of models to accurately represent the paths of muscles with complex geometry and (ii) assumes that <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> are equivalent for all fibers within a muscle (or muscle compartment). The goal of this work was to develop and evaluate a new method for creating three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element models that represent complex muscle geometry and the variation in <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> across fibers within a muscle. We created 3 D models of the psoas, iliacus, gluteus maximus, and gluteus medius muscles from magnetic resonance (MR) images. Peak fiber <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> varied substantially among fibers within each muscle (e. g., for the psoas the peak fiber hip flexion <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> varied from 2 to 3 cm, and for the gluteus maximus the peak fiber hip extension <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> varied from 1 to 7 cm). <b>Moment</b> <b>arms</b> from the literature were generally {{within the range of}} fiber <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> predicted by the 3 D models. The models accurately predicted changes in muscle surface geometry over a 55 ◦ range of hip flexion, as compared to changes in shape predicted from MR images (average errors between the model and measured surfaces were between 1. 7 and 5. 2 mm). This new framework for representing muscle will enhance the accuracy of {{computer models}} of the musculoskeletal system...|$|R

The model confirmed that muscle <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> increase {{as the center of}} rotation is shifted medially or inferiorly from the anatomical position.

We hypothesized that ßexion of the hip would increase internal rotation <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> and decrease external rotation <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> of the primary hip rotators. To test this hypothesis we measured rotational <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> of the gluteus maximus (six compartments), gluteus medius (four compartments), gluteus minimus (three compartments) iliopsoas, piriformis, quadratus femoris, obturator internus, and obturator externus. <b>Moment</b> <b>arms</b> were measured at hip ßexion angles of 0, 20, 45, 60, and 90 ¡ in four cadavers. A three-dimensional computer model of the hip muscles was developed and compared to the experimental measurements. The experimental results and the computer model showed that the internal rotation <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> of some muscles increase with ßexion; the external rotation <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> of other muscles decrease, and some muscles switch from external rotation to internal rotation as the hip is ßexed. This trend toward internal rotation with hip ßexion was apparent in 15 of the 18 muscle compartments we examined, suggesting that excessive hip ßexion may exacerbate internal rotation of the hip. The gluteus maximus was found to have a large capacity for external rotation. Enhancing the activation of the gluteus maximus, a muscle that is frequently underactive in persons with cerebral palsy, may help correct excessive ßexion {{and internal}} rotation of the hip.

Using a musculoskeletal model of the lower extremity, a set of values was established for the length of each musculotendon actuator for different lower limb generalized coordinates (joint angles). A multidimensional spline function was then used to fit these data. Muscle <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> were obtained by differentiating the musculotendon length spline function with respect to the generalized coordinate of interest.

The simulator was designed to offer physiologically-correct adjustable <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> throughout the elbow's range of motion. To validate this, muscle <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> were measured in three cadaver elbow specimens. Flexion-extension <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> were measured at three different pronation/supination angles: fully pronated, fully supinated, and neutral. Pronation-supination <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> for four elbow muscles were measured at three different flexion-extension angles: 30 °, 60 °, and 90 °. The numeric results compared well with those previously reported. The biceps and pronator teres flexion-extension <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> varied with pronation-supination position, and vice versa. This represents the first use of closed-loop feedback control in an elbow simulator, one of the first reports of both flexion-extension and pronation-supination <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> in the same specimens, and demonstrates the adjustability of the <b>moment</b> <b>arms</b> that the elbow simulator can produce. Towards accurate motion analysis of the radial head, two areas were investigated. The first identified the phenomena of camera-switching, which occurs in motion analysis when data from one or more cameras is temporarily excluded from the computation of a marker's three-dimensional position. Tests with static markers showed that camera-switching could cause up to 3. 7 mm of perceived movement. The second area of investigation set the stage for future studies with cadaver elbows. A protocol was developed to quantify both the travel of the native radial head, radial head implants, and the finite helical axis during pronation-supination movement. The tracking of implant motion employs a unique circle-fitting algorithm to determine the implant's center. A video-based motion analysis system was used to collect marker position coordinates actuated by a precision micrometer table.
