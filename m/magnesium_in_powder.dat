The demonstrated optical technique requires only milligrams of sample and can potentially be used to measure the de/absorption temperature and kinetics of magnesium nanostructures, which are often fabricated via the physical vapor deposition method inside an optically transparent quartz tube. This would help to eliminate the common problem of oxidation associated with removal and transport of the freshly fabricated nanostructures into an inert protective environment. This optical technique could be applied to any hydrogen-storage material in the form of powder which shows a significant difference in its optical absorption between the hydride and the non-hydride phase...|$|R
5000|$|The joint project, {{initiated}} in 2005 {{and still in}} the experimental stage, developed a prototype carbon dioxide (...) -free engine in 2006 that ran successfully {{without the need for}} fossil fuels. The chemical reaction between <b>magnesium</b> (<b>in</b> a <b>powder</b> form) and water at room temperature produces high-energy steam and hydrogen. The hydrogen is burned {{at the same time to}} produce additional high-energy steam. These two steam sources power the engine. The energy cycle produces no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions. The only by-products of this reaction are water and magnesium oxide. The magnesium (a common metallic element) is separated from the oxygen through a solar-powered laser process (the development of which is already well advanced) and is reused over and over again as fuel.|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{structural}} and hydrogenation properties of nanoscale <b>magnesium</b> <b>in</b> various forms (<b>powders</b> and thin films). A structure consisting of Mg and Ti multilayered thin films is also proposed and studied. The Mg and Mg/Ti thin film samples were fabricated using a magnetron sputtering system. SEM and XRD allowed {{the study of}} the structures and composition of the Mg and Mg/Ti thin film samples. XRD confirmed a (002) preferential orientation of the films in agreement with literature. Differences in the sputtering conditions of the Mg/Ti samples also showed differences in their XRD patterns. Furthermore, the XRD results also showed the existence of intrinsic stresses within the films. Hydrogenation properties were studied mainly using thermo-volumetric and gravimetric analysis. The hydrogenation of the samples was confirmed using XRD. Sorption enthalpies of the films were calculated through van’t Hoff plots and were found to be quite high. However, the 40 layer Mg/Ti sample displayed the lowest enthalpy of all (due to the cooperative phenomena). Studies on sorption kinetics showed the fastest absorption kinetics for the 40 layer Mg/Ti sample while the 20 layered sample exhibited the fastest desorption. Finally, TPD results showed a possible presence of the metastable γ-MgH_ 2 phase...|$|R
40|$|Lead {{magnesium}} niobate (PMN) is {{an important}} relaxor ferroelectric material commonly employed in multilayer capacitor and actuator manufacturing owing to its high dielectric constant and superior electrostrictive properties. However, stability of this material in water is not very well known and there is need for a detailed investigation. In this research, solubility of lead <b>magnesium</b> niobate <b>powders</b> <b>in</b> water was determined {{as a function of}} solids concentration. The obtained results showed that the amount of cation leaching from the PMN surface depends on the pH value of the suspension and the solids concentration. The Pb 2 + and Mg 2 + ion dissolution was very high especially in the acidic pH range. Nevertheless, neither the dissolution mechanism nor the effects of dissolved ions on the stability were the same for those ions. The study provides new aspects on the solubility of perovskite materials which possess more than one soluble cation in their structure. TUBITAK and DP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract— The {{effect of}} {{selected}} antacids {{on the amount}} of FK 506 in solution in simulated gastric juice has been studied. FK 506 (2 – 5 mg) was incubated in 100 mL simulated gastric fluid (SGF) with the equivalent of 500 mg of various antacids. The addition of Mylanta and Turns resulted in 14 and 30 % loss of FK 506, respectively, in 24 h; 98 % loss was observed in 12 h in the presence of Mag‐Ox; 100 % loss was observed in the presence of <b>magnesium</b> oxide <b>powder</b> <b>in</b> 2 h. The loss of FK 506 from these solutions appears to be due to a pH mediated degradation of FK 506. The addition of aluminium hydroxide gel USP (Roxane) to the FK 506 solution resulted in a 35 % loss within 2 min but no further loss was noted for 24 h, indicative of adsorption of FK 506. These results suggest that until additional in‐vivo studies are carried out, it is prudent not to dose FK 506 and antacids {{at the same time to}} avoid potential interactions. 1991 Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britai...|$|R

40|$|Attention {{is growing}} for a {{potential}} role of <b>magnesium</b> <b>in</b> the pathoetiology of cardiovascular disease. Magnesium modulates mechanical, electrical and structural functions of cardiac and vascular cells, and small changes <b>in</b> extracellular <b>magnesium</b> levels and/or intracellular free magnesium concentration may have significant effects on cardiac excitability and on vascular tone, contractility and reactivity. Thus, magnesium may be important in the physiological regulation of blood pressure whereas alterations <b>in</b> cellular <b>magnesium</b> metabolism could contribute to the pathogenesis of blood pressure elevation. Although most epidemiological and experimental studies support a pathological role for <b>magnesium</b> <b>in</b> the etiology and development of hypertension, data from clinical studies have been less convincing.
