40|$|ABSTRACT: The article {{concerns}} {{failure and}} fatigue phenomena associated with local effects {{occurring in the}} vicinity of junctions between different core materials in sandwich beams subjected to transverse shear loading. It is known from analytical and numerical modeling that these effects lead to stress concentrations at such junctions. However, their influence on the failure behavior is not fully understood, and there are indications that the available models overestimate the importance of the local effects. In the present article, typical sandwich beam configurations with glass fiber-reinforced plastic face sheets and core junctions between polymer foams of different densities and rigid aluminium were tested under quasi-static and fatigue loading conditions. The failure behavior was compared with results from finite element analyses using various failure criteria. It was found that for the transverse shear load case the inherent core shear stresses overrule the local effects in terms of being most critical with respect to causing failure for the most common sandwich configurations using low density semi-brittle polymer foam cores. A simple <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>criterion</b> is appropriate for failure prediction (core shear failure) in those cases.

40|$|Introduction: Apple {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} horticultural crops of Iran. Its production in the country stands in the second place after citrus. Iran holds the fourth place in the world production of apples and gains a major share in the export of this product. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the quantity and quality of the fruit in order to maintain and promote its position among the countries importing this product from Iran. Most of the mechanical damages to fruits and vegetables occur due to contact stresses under static, quasi-static and impact loading. To obtain stress distribution inside the fruit we can use finite element analysis. The aim of this study was to simulate the behavior of the apple as a viscoelastic body subjected to quasi-static loading and also to determine the failure criteria (maximum normal stress or shear stress) of apple flesh to estimate its susceptibility to mechanical bruising. Materials and methods: In this study, Golab kohanz apple was used. Two samples were removed from each apple using a core sampler, one was used for uniaxial compression and the other was used for confined compression test using Instron universal tension and compression machine. Spherical indenter and parallel plate tests were performed in order to study apple susceptibility to bruising at four deformation levels (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm) and the bruise volume was then measured after 24 hours. Stress-strain curves were plotted and then, the elastic and viscoelastic properties were obtained. Then, by using the data obtained from apple properties, the apple was modeled in Abaqus software as spherical and cylindrical shapes with viscoelastic behavior subjected to quasi-static loadings. Results and Discussion: The normal stress distribution of the modeled apple in the shape of a cylindrical sample is shown in Fig. 4. The value of maximum normal stress was obtained (0. 51 MPa) at the contact point of the loading plate with the sample. Experimental and modeled stress-strain curves are shown in Fig. 5. Up to the bio-yield point, the two curves are nearly matched; and beyond that point, there are some overestimations in the predicted stress values. The location and pattern of failure have often been used to explain the cause of failure in fruits. When specimens of fruit are subjected to a uniaxial compression, the failure often occurs the maximum shear stress plane. Failure patterns in the tested samples indicate that the failure occurs due to shear stresses. Another explanation that has been used by researchers for shear failure is the bruising position inside the fruit after loading. The position of bruising in most of the tested apples was a distance away from the apple surface (Fig. 7). According to the experiments results at the three deformation levels of 2, 3, and 4 mm, the maximum generated normal stress inside the apple was above the point of failure of the cylindrical samples. Based on the empirical results, the bruising was almost zero for the apples subjected to one or two mm deformation (Fig. 9 a). The experimental value of the shear strength of the Golab kahanz apple was obtained to be 0. 23 MPa. The maximum shear stress inside the modeled apple due to the two mm deformation was 0. 195 MPa, which was lower than the shear strength of the apple. On the other hand, by applying three and four mm of deformation, the maximum shear stresses were obtained to be 0. 24 and 0. 26 MPa, respectively, indicating that the induced stress exceeded the shear strength of apple flesh; therefore, the bruising was observed in the flesh of these apples. The location of the maximum shear stress corresponds to the location of bruising in the tested samples as shown in Fig. 9 b. According to the obtained results from the modeling in the finite element software, we can use this software in order to recognize and investigate the damages in agricultural products during different loading conditions (Harvesting, transportation, packaging and storage). Conclusions: In this work, Golab apple was considered as a viscoelastic material and its behavior under quasistatic loading was modeled using finite element method. Elastic, viscoelastic properties and shear strength of apple flesh were obtained and used in the simulation. Comparison of modeling and experimental results shows that the model simulates the behavior of apples during quasistatic loading well. The location of bruise occurrence in the flesh of tested apple and the location of maximum shear stress in the simulated apple was the same. Therefore, the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> <b>criterion</b> can be used to estimate the susceptibility of apple varieties to internal bruising under quasistatic loading.

In this thesis, press hardened boron alloyed steelsubjected to differential thermo-mechanical processing is characterized. Fracture properties {{in relation to the}} different microstructures obtainedis studied. Furthermore a dual phase (DP) cold forming steel is chosenfor evaluation of ductility limit in shear loading. throughout thiswork a strategy for modelling post-localization response and predictingductility limit using shell elements larger then the typical width of thelocalized neck is used. The studied material is assumed to be in a stateof plane stress. Mesh dependency is alleviated by the introduction of aelement size dependent parameter into the constitutive description. Thisparameter acts as a hardening parameter, controlling the evolution ofthe yield surface depending on loading, strain history and shell elementsize. Model calibration relies on a full field measurement technique, DigitalSpeckle Photography (DSP), to record the plane deformation field oftensile specimens. Quantitative measurements of the severely localizeddeformation preceding crack initiation are feasible. With the proposedstrategy, mesh sensitivity in terms of post localization load responseand fracture elongation predictions is reduced significantly compared toresults obtained without the element size dependent parameter. It wasfound that high strain hardening favours strain localization of shear band type, and accelerates the formation of a localized neck. The hardeningcharacteristics is determinant to which deformation mode dissipates theminimum energy. For the DP steel, the Tresca yield surface more accuratelydescribes the yielding point compared to the von Mises planestress elipse. Furthermore, the exponential ductility function dependenton the stress triaxiality parameter agrees well with experimental fracturedata in the ductile loading regime for both DP and boron steel. In <b>shear</b> loading, the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> (MS) <b>stress</b> <b>criterion</b> successfullydescribes the ductility limit.

The results show that(1) The order of influence factors respectively is L, S, b, h / b for the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> on interface in the front of pile, and it is L, b, S, h / b for the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> on behind of pile;(2) L is the main factor that affects the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> on the interface between anti-slide pile and soil;(3) Effect about S and L acting on <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> of the interface respectively is significant and very significant; h/b has no significant effect on <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> of the interface...|$|R

Systematic test results from two previous publications {{were used to}} verify {{the accuracy of the}} proposed method. The Hong Kong design method was also used to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> of the nail-soil interface. These analyses confirmed that the experimental data were more accurately predicted by the proposed analytical method. An extensive parametric study was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} several key parameters on the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> It was observed that when there was no grouting pressure, <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> increased with increasing overburden pressure, failure surface distance, dilation angle, or decreased drill hole radius. Analysis using the proposed model also demonstrates that grouting and overburden pressures share an interactional effect. The larger the grouting pressure, the greater the influence of the overburden pressure; and, consequently, the larger the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the nail-soil interface.

The <b>maximum</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> in the TEM is evaluated for different designs focusing on their dependency on the fill factor. Although predictions by the previously developed analytical modeling are in partial agreement with numerical results, simplifying assumptions for the analytical model can limit the range of validity. Our numerical analysis shows that reduction of the fill factor alone under all the circumstances will not reduce the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> Imposing mechanical constraints at the boundaries, increasing the number of legs (6 Ã 6 in the analysis), and engineering the coefficient of thermal expansion are some of the key parameters controlling the <b>maximum</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>stress</b> and its changes with the fill factor...|$|R

The fatigue crack initiation and early propagation plane orientations are measured by optical microscope, the results of macro-analysis show that both the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> amplitude and normal mean stress have effects on the orientations of crack initiation and propagation plane orientation, which {{are close to the}} plane of the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> amplitude plane. With increasing the mean tensile stress, more cracks are inclined to initial and propagate on or near the <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> amplitude plane with larger normal mean stress, and the angle of deviation from the plane of <b>maximum</b> <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> amplitude increases.
