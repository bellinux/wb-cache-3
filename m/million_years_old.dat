5|$|Older {{volcanic}} centres extend {{northwest of}} Ciomadul. With increasing distance they are 2.5–1.5 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> Pilisca centre, the 2.8–2.2 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> Cucu centre and the 4.3–3.6 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> Luci-Lazu and Sumuleu-Ciuc volcanic centres. South of Ciomadul the Murgul shoshonites were erupted 2.3–1.5 million years ago; they represent cryptodomes. Andesite lava flows from Pilisca underlie the Ciomadul deposits in some places.|$|E

5|$|Indraloris is {{a fossil}} primate from the Miocene of India and Pakistan {{in the family}} Sivaladapidae. Two species are now recognized: I.himalayensis from Haritalyangar, India (about 9 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old)</b> and I.kamlialensis from the Pothohar Plateau, Pakistan (15.2 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old).</b> Other {{material}} from the Potwar Plateau (16.8 and 15.2 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old)</b> may represent an additional, unnamed species.

5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is split}} into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western {{two thirds of the}} watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.|$|E

5|$|Studies of discs {{around other}} stars have also {{done much to}} {{establish}} a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation is a {{sequence}} of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> (Ma) at its base, and 146.8 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinha Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. In 1877, this formation {{became the center of}} the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope.|$|E
5|$|The Wabigoon subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{made up of}} metavolcanic-metasedimentary intrusions. These metamorphosed {{rocks are}} volcanically derived greenstone belts, and are surrounded and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths. The subprovince's greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic batholiths and felsic plutons aged from 3,000 to 2,670 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bulk of {{the volcano}} was formed in the Quaternary, with {{activity}} commencing in the Miocene. Five million years ago, the first latiandesites were erupted.

5|$|The {{presence}} of {{significant amounts of}} dust around the star implies a young age {{of the system and}} led to debate about whether it had joined the main sequence or was still a pre–main sequence star However, when the star's distance was measured by Hipparcos it was revealed that Beta Pictoris was located further away than previously thought and hence was more luminous than originally believed. Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account, it was found that Beta Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and was not a pre–main sequence star after all. Analysis of Beta Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group suggested that they are around 12 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> However more recent studies indicate that the age is roughly double this at 20 to 26 <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b>|$|E
