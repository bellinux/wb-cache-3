40|$|We {{introduce}} an algebraic proof {{system that}} <b>manipulates</b> multilinear arithmetic formulas. We {{show that this}} proof system is fairly strong, even when restricted to multilinear arithmetic formulas of a very small depth. Specifically, we show the following: 1. Algebraic proofs <b>manipulating</b> depth 2 multilinear arithmetic formulas polynomially simulate Resolution, Polynomial Calculus (PC) and Polynomial Calculus with Resolution (PCR) proofs; 2. Polynomial size proofs <b>manipulating</b> depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for the functional pigeonhole principle; 3. Polynomial size proofs <b>manipulating</b> depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas for Tseitin’s graph tautologies. By known lower bounds, this demonstrates that algebraic proof systems <b>manipulating</b> depth 3 multilinear arithmetic formulas are strictly stronger than Resolution, PC and PCR, and have an exponential gap over bounded-depth Frege for both the functional pigeonhole principle and Tseitin’s graph tautologies. We also illustrate a connection between lower bounds on multilinear proofs and lower bounds on multilinear arithmetic circuits. In particular, we show that (an explicit) superpolynomial size separation between proofs <b>manipulating</b> general arithmetic circuits and proofs <b>manipulating</b> multilinear arithmetic circuits implies a super-polynomial size lower bound on multilinear arithmetic circuits for an explicit family of polynomials...|$|R

40|$|Nanson’s and Baldwin’s voting rules {{select a}} winner by {{successively}} eliminating candidates with low Borda scores. We show that these rules {{have a number}} of desirable computational properties. In particular, with unweighted votes, it is NP-hard to <b>manipulate</b> either rule with one manipulator, whilst with weighted votes, it is NP-hard to <b>manipulate</b> either rule with a small number of candidates and a coalition of manipulators. As only a couple of other voting rules are known to be NP-hard to <b>manipulate</b> with a single manipulator, Nanson’s and Baldwin’s rules appear to be particularly resistant to manipulation from a theoretical perspective. We also propose a number of approximation methods for <b>manipulating</b> these two rules. Experiments demonstrate that both rules are often difficult to <b>manipulate</b> in practice. These results suggest that elimination style voting rules deserve further study...|$|R

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Critical Discourse Studies on 30 October 2015, available online: [URL] there has been interest in examining how language {{is involved in the}} phenomenon of 'manipulation'. This paper suggests that investigators, rather than treating 'manipulation' as an entity, should examine how communicators might engage in discursive acts of <b>manipulating.</b> To this end a distinction is made between <b>manipulating</b> information and <b>manipulating</b> people. Examples of both types, taken from the Portuguese Parliamentary Celebration of the April Revolution of 2004, are examined in depth to show how acts of <b>manipulating</b> can be performed in different ways. By focussing on acts, we show that supposed 'cognitive control' over the audience's minds is not necessarily involved in manipulating; it is shown how investigators can provide evidence that manipulators act 'knowingly' when they mislead. We argue that the study of <b>manipulating,</b> and the distinction between <b>manipulating</b> information and people, provides a critical approach to the topic of political oratory. © 2013 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
