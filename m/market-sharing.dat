These agreements prevent firms from entering each other´s market. The set of <b>market-sharing</b> agreements defines a collusive network, which is under suspicion by antitrust authorities.

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{emergence}} of brand-shares and the entry/exit dynamics among competing brands in new repeat-purchase categories. In such new categories, <b>market-shares</b> are strongly affected by retailer distribution-decisions. Because, at the aggregate level, such decisions are spread out over time, {{the success of a}} manufacturer in obtaining distribution from adopting retailers may positively depend on its brand's <b>market-share</b> to date. This creates a temporary positive feedback between a brand's <b>market-share</b> and its distribution over the growth-stage of the category. This feedback, along with how manufacturers influence their brand's <b>market-share</b> and distribution, is hypothesized to drive {{the emergence of}} the market structure. The authors use a logically consistent model of this feedback to quantify how a brand's coupled <b>market-share</b> and distribution evolve and to help answer several questions about the relative efficiency of influencing share (pull) vs. seeking distribution (push). This model also allows to study changes in the strength of feedback and in the manufacturer's influence on its <b>market-share</b> as the new category moves from its growth it its mature stage. Estimation on data from the U. S. ready-to-drink tea category suggests that positive feedback between <b>market-share</b> and distribution exists and that it is limited to the early growth stage of the category. This makes that the effects of a change in <b>market-share</b> or in distribution on the subsequent dynamics of <b>market-shares</b> depend on the maturity of the category. Whereas early-on in the life-cycle of the category, small changes in <b>market-share</b> or distribution generate long-term larger changes in <b>market-share,</b> later such momentum is absent. In this context, it is discussed how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable <b>market-share...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Market-share</b> {{liability}} {{has been}} one of the most controversial doctrines in tort law, with a strong plurality of courts rejecting the doctrine on the ground that it radically departs from the fundamental principle of causation. Courts that have adopted this liability rule, though, believe they are adhering to the principle of causation. In the first case to adopt <b>market-share</b> liability, the California Supreme Court claimed that the liability rule is grounded upon an extension of alternative liability, a doctrine that has been accepted by virtually all jurisdictions. The court never adequately explained how alternative liability can be modified to yield <b>market-share</b> liability, and the only explanation provided by torts scholars involves redefining the tort right to permit compensation for tortious risk, conditional upon the occurrence of injury, rather than for the injury itself. However, courts do not conceptualize the tort right in these terms, for otherwise the doctrine of <b>market-share</b> liability would be uncontroversial. As this Article shows, <b>market-share</b> liability can be derived from alternative liability in a manner that neither redefines the tort right nor departs from the principle of causation. Alternative liability permits the plaintiff to prove causation against the group of defendants. This characterization of the causal rule has been recognized by some torts scholars, but has never been justified. The Article shows that evidential grouping is a defensible principle implicit in numerous cases involving analogous causal problems, including the asbestos cases. Evidential grouping not only explains the doctrine of alternative liability, it shows how a modification of that liability rule yields <b>market-share</b> liability largely for reasons given by the California Supreme Court. This conceptualization of alternative liability and <b>market-share</b> liability also explains the otherwise puzzling liability rule adopted by courts in the asbestos cases. Due to this doctrinal unity, the widespread acceptance of alternative liability should make <b>market-share</b> liability more widely acceptable...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{effectiveness}} of two different antitrust policies by characterizing the network structure of <b>market-sharing</b> agreements that arises under those settings. <b>Market-sharing</b> agreements prevent firms from entering each other's market. The set of these agreements defines a collusive network, which is pursued by antitrust authorities. This article shows that under a constant probability of inspection and a penalty equal to a firm's limited liability, firms form collusive alliances where {{all of them are}} interconnected. In contrast, when the antitrust policy reacts to prices in both dimensions - probability of inspection and penalty - firms form collusive cartels where they are not necessarily fully interconnected. This implies that more competitive structures can be sustained in the second case than in the first case. Notwithstanding, antitrust laws may have a pro-competitive effect in both scenarios, as they give firms in large alliances more incentives to cut their agreements at once. market-sharing; economic networks; antitrust authority; oligopoly...|$|E

40|$|Whatbeganin 1957 as a {{temporary}} restriction on imports ofJapanese cotton textiles into the United States has evolved over 30 years into a complex <b>market-sharing</b> agreement involving all major trading countries and all categories of textile and apparel trade. The MultifiberArrangement (MFA) is a major experiment {{in the management of}} international trade. However, the use of discriminatory quotas in the MFAisa serious violation ofthe principles ofGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that have governed most trade since World War II. The quotas involve substituting political forces for economic forces in the determination oftrade. The arrangement has imposed high costs on consumers in importing countries, and it has interfered with the United States ’ foreign policy goal of promoting economic development in low-income countries. The MFA has also been criticized by proponents oftextile protection for failing torestrain import growth sufficiently. The time is right toreevaluate this experiment in managed trade and to determine whether to continue the <b>market-sharing</b> approach of the MFA or to return textile trade to compliance with the general rules of the GATT. Description and Purpose of the Arrangement The Multifiber Arrangement, an agreement among 42 exporting and importing countries, regulates trade in textiles and apparel. The stated objectives ofthe MFA are the expansion and liberalization of textile trade and the avoidance ofdisruption in import markets.

The case of a dominant supplier that distributes its product through retailers that also sell substitute products is considered. It is found that when the supplier's contracts can only depend on how much a retailer purchases of its product (own-supplier contracts), intra- and interbrand competition cannot simultaneously be dampened. However, competition on all goods can simultaneously be dampened when <b>market-share</b> contracts are feasible. Compared to own-supplier contracts, the use of <b>market-share</b> contracts increases the dominant supplier's profit and, if demand is linear, lowers consumer surplus and welfare.

In a dynamic setting with complete information and learning-by-doing, short-term <b>market-share</b> discounts and long-run contracts are more pro fitable to the dominant supplier than simple two-part tariff s or quantity discounts.

Firms would gain if these contracts were prohibited, but are caught in a prisoner’s dilemma if they are permitted. In this latter case, allowing firms to offer also <b>market-share</b> discounts unambiguously weakens competition, reducing efficiency and harming consumers. However, starting from a situation where exclusive contracts are prohibited, the effect of <b>market-share</b> discounts (which include exclusive contracts as a limiting case) is ambiguous. common agency; exclusionary contracts; market share discounts; price competition...|$|R

These results are driven by the optimal strategy of a firm on its turf, monopolization or <b>market-sharing,</b> which in turn depends on consumer heterogeneity in flexibility.

40|$|How do {{changes in}} {{competitive}} intensity affect trade patterns? Models of collusive arrangements in spatially separated markets generate testable {{predictions of the}} effects of collusion on price, trade patterns and concentration. We exploit a quasi-natural experiment associated with increased anti-trust enforcement activity {{over the last two decades}} to test these predictions. In particular, we analyze detailed trade data linked to descriptive information from seven international cartels which collapsed as a consequence of increased antitrust enforcement activity. Because antitrust activity is highly unlikely to affect spatial patterns of demand and supply (other than through its effect on the competitive environment), enforcement induced changes that are ideally suited to study the effect of competition on trade patterns. We confirm significant declines in prices following the breakup of these seven cartels. Contrary to conventional wisdom, and consistent with the more recent <b>market-sharing</b> oligopoly trade models, we find no significant change in spatial patterns of trade following cartel breakup; in particular, there is no significant change in the effect of distance on trade.

In particular, we show that in certain cases, even extremely small fluctuations can cause these dynamics to spin out of control and move to states of much higher social cost, whereas in other cases these dynamics are much more stable even to large degrees of fluctuation. We also consider the resilience of these dynamics to a small number of Byzantine players about which no assumptions are made. We show again a sharp contrast between different games. In certain cases (e. g., fair cost-sharing, set-covering, job-scheduling) even a single Byzantine player can cause best-response dynamics to transition to states of substantially higher cost, whereas in others (e. g., the class of β-nice games which includes routing, <b>market-sharing</b> and many others) these dynamics are much more resilient. ...|$|E
