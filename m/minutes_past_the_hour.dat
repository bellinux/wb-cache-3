5|$|Monday to Saturday {{services}} are half-hourly {{in each direction}} until 20:00, with an hourly service provided after 20:00 and on Sundays. The first weekday service departs at 05:20 from Tweedbank with the last service leaving Edinburgh at 23:54. Departure times from Edinburgh are usually at 24 and 54 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> while from Tweedbank trains depart at 28 and 58 minutes past the hour; individual timings may vary by a minute or so. The trains starting close to on the hour do not call at Stow except in the peaks and evenings; the Sunday service stops at Stow. Most services operate between Edinburgh and Tweedbank {{except for a few}} morning peak services that continue to Glenrothes with Thornton via the Fife Circle Line and a few evening peak services that originate at Glenrothes with Thornton.|$|E
25|$|The new {{timetable}} {{concentrated on}} key points at Oxted, East Grinstead and the Ashurst-Groombridge-Birchden triangle. It also introduced {{the concept of}} a regular hourly service. Off-peak services now departed Victoria for East Grinstead and Tunbridge Wells West at 8 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> and from Tunbridge Wells West for Victoria at 47 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> A push-and-pull service worked the section from Tunbridge Wells West via Edenbridge Town, connecting at Oxted with London trains. A push-pull service was also introduced between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, also providing connections on the main line in both directions. London trains were scheduled to cross in the High Level for a few minutes each hour, ensuring that at a certain time each hour all three trains were together in the station. At Groombridge connections were made with Brighton and Eastbourne services.|$|E
25|$|Headlines {{are usually}} {{provided}} at 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> {{with a full}} bulletin after the bottom-of-the-hour headlines. There are also extended sports bulletins per day, entitled Sportsday or Sport Today (when simulcasting with BBC World News) broadcast at 00:45, 01:45, 02:45, 03:45, 13:30, 18:30, 19:30 (weekends only), 22:30 (weekdays only). Each bulletin is read by a single sports presenter, {{with the exception of}} Saturday Sportsday, which is double headed.|$|E
5000|$|For {{times that}} are an exact minute, [...] "precisely" [...] is {{substituted}} for the seconds {{portion of the}} announcement. Similarly, announcements for times between <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> and one <b>minute</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> substitute [...] "o'clock" [...] for the (zero) minutes. Other operators run their own speaking clocks, with broadly similar formats, or redirect to BT's service.|$|R
50|$|News is at {{the core}} of the scheduling. A five-minute {{bulletin}} is generally transmitted at one <b>minute</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> with a two-minute summary on the half-hour. Sometimes these are separate from other programming, or alternatively made integral to the programme (such as with The Newsroom, Newshour or Newsday). As part of the BBC's policy for breaking news, the Service is the first to receive a full report for foreign news.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2011, the Zweckverband SPNV-Nord {{transport}} authority {{announced that}} DB Regio West {{had won the}} tender for the local network called [...] "RE Südwest E-Traktion". From December 2014 to December 2029, an hourly service (RE 1) is being operated on the Koblenz-Kaiserslautern route, continuing every two hours to Mannheim.

25|$|Rivette {{was buried}} on 5 February 2016 in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris, {{not far from}} François Truffaut's grave. Bonitzer, Marignac and Narboni all spoke at the funeral. Rivette's sister and nephews also attended. Véronique Manniez-Rivette told the funeral goers that just as angels are said to sing during moments of silence at twenty <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> Rivette had died at 12:20pm. The March 2016 issue of Cahiers du Cinema was {{dedicated}} to him. In May 2016 the Cinémathèque française announced that Rivette's first three short films had been rediscovered by his widow and were being restored and then screened at the Festival Coté Court that June.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} three hours of the program (or in some markets, the first 3½ hours, {{extending}} into the first half-hour of Todays fourth hour), local affiliates are offered a five-minute window at :25 and :55 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> to insert a local newsbreak (which usually also includes a local forecast, and in large and mid-sized markets, a brief traffic report) and local advertisements, although the show provides additional segments for those affiliates who do not provide such a news insert (certain NBC affiliates that produce an additional morning newscast for a sister station or digital subchannel may pre-tape the local inserts aired during {{the first one to}} two hours of Today to focus production responsibilities on their local broadcast).|$|E
25|$|Before BBC News {{moved to}} Broadcasting House, an hourly {{business}} update was included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit. There were two shifts, from 08:30–14:00 and 14:00–23:00, presented by Penny Haslam, Maryam Moshiri, Ben Thompson, Adam Parsons, Susannah Streeter, Joe Lynam, Sara Coburn or Sally Eden. News Channel updates were usually broadcast at 40 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> between 08:00 and 23:00. The 21:40 round-up was often earlier and the 22:40 bulletin is an extended round-up of the day's business news. Until May 2009, the business updates on the BBC News Channel were broadcast {{from one of}} the London Stock Exchange's studios in central London. From then until March 2013 the bulletins were provided from the channel's studio at BBC Television Centre. The business updates were axed in March 2013 as part of the BBC's Delivering Quality First plan. But after complaints returned in November 2013. Stock market updates now only appear during the quarter-to-the-hour headlines, but it was changed after complaints in November with Ben Thompson and Victoria Friz are the main presenters sharing 08:00–14:00 or 14:00–18:00 between them. With Alice Baxter, Jamie Robertson, Aaron Heslehurst and Sally Bundock offer relief. There is normally an extended bulletin at 16:45 when the main business stories of the day are discussed on Afternoon Live.|$|E
50|$|The {{responsible}} {{authority for the}} provision of transport services in regional traffic is the Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe (VVO). After all transport services were retendered, they have been provided by the Städtebahn Sachsen since 12 December 2010. The services have been operated as SB72 and SE19 since then. It has a full-day regular-interval hourly service with trains crossing in Glashütte. On the weekends, the timetable remains unchanged with a two-hour cycle. In order to connect with the S-Bahn in Heidenau, the timetable has an unusual symmetry minute, which is approximately at 14 <b>minute</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> Köttewitz, Weesenstein, Burkhardswalde-Maxen, Mühlbach (b Pirna), Oberschlottwitz, Bärenhecke-Johnsbach, Bärenstein (b Glashütte/Sachs) and Hartmannmühle stations are request stops. As in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> additional direct trains are still operated between Dresden Hbf and Kurort Altenberg, only stopping at selected stations.|$|R
50|$|On March 28, 2011, Worldwide Exchange {{underwent}} a major overhaul. The first 50 {{minutes of the}} program were initially broadcast from Asia and Europe, with the United States leg of the show starting at 50 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> first <b>hour.</b> <b>The</b> three anchors were together for just 20 <b>minutes,</b> from :50 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> first <b>hour</b> to :10 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> second <b>hour.</b> Also, <b>the</b> Asian leg of Worldwide Exchange was no longer featured after :10 <b>past</b> <b>the</b> second <b>hour,</b> to which <b>the</b> show was broadcast only from Europe and the United States from that point forward.|$|R

The first passenger carrying train comprising C1 stock to use the line was a railtour on 15 March hauled by 50 025 Invincible. It was organised by the Southern Electric Group and ran from Paddington to [...] A preview service of electric trains ran on 27 April 1986 and the full timetabled service commenced on 12 May 1986. The next day, a wrong-side failure occurred involving three signals between Tonbridge and Hastings. Contractors had made errors in the wiring of the signal heads. With the inauguration of electric services, a half-hourly service was operated, with trains departing from Charing Cross at 15 and 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> Those departing at xx:15 called at , Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, High Brooms, Tunbridge Wells, Wadhurst, Battle, St Leonards Warrior Square and Hastings, taking 84 minutes. Those departing at xx:45 called at Waterloo East, London Bridge, Orpington, Sevenoaks, , Tonbridge and then all stations to Hastings, taking 99 minutes. The Royal Train visited the line on 6 May, conveying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. It was stabled at Wadhurst whilst she ate lunch. The train was hauled by a Class 73 diesel-electric locomotive. Upon electrification, services were operated by 4CEP, 4CIG and 4VEP electric multiple units. Class 508 electric multiple units also operated services on the line. When these units were withdrawn in the mid-2000s, they were replaced by Class 375 Electrostar, Class 465 Networker and Class 466 Networker units.|$|E

2500|$|Between 06:00 and 08:30 on weekdays, the {{programme}} is simulcast on BBC News. During the simulcast, {{the sports}} news is at 06:10, 06:35, 07:35 and 08:35. In addition, live sports bulletins are broadcast from sporting locations, such as Royal Ascot and Wimbledon, with the presenter interviewing key sporting figures. Business updates are presented at 06:10, when the main business {{stories from the}} newspapers are also discussed, and at 06:20 06:50, 07:20 07:50 08:20 and 08:50, either from the studio, or out on location.

2500|$|From [...] to , ABC's Monday Night Football {{coverage}} {{began at}} 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, with game kickoff typically occurring at seven <b>minutes</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> Coverage was moved one hour earlier to 8:00p.m. Eastern Time in , with a pre-game show titled Monday Night Blast, hosted by Chris Berman from the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore preceding {{the start of}} the game at 8:20p.m. This was done mainly to address ABC's inability to find a suitable 8:00p.m. lead-in program for MNF since MacGyver ended its run in 1992 (not even two other series from MacGyvers production company Paramount Television – The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and The Marshal – saw success, despite the former's ties to Paramount's Indiana Jones film series), and to allow stations to start their late local newscasts nearer to their regular times. Poor ratings caused this experiment to be dropped after one season, with MNF once again moving to 9:00p.m. in , though in many NFL markets, the 8:00p.m. (Eastern Time) hour from 1999 to 2006 was replaced by affiliates with locally produced and programmed sports discussion and coaches shows, with ABC programming in that hour moved to late night or weekend slots; {{by the end of the}} ABC run, the 8:00p.m. timeslot was filled with either newsmagazines and short-lived reality television programs which failed to make any ratings headways due to affiliate pre-emptions.|$|E

A moment's vision of Paula moving to swift tunes on the arm of a person or persons unknown was enough to impart the impetus required.
