40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the use of <b>mobile</b> <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> {{as a means of}} improving access to dental care among primary school children in Southern Thailand by reducing the opportunity cost of service use to parents. Parents' willingness to pay (WTP) is measured for three different services provided in a community hospital <b>dental</b> <b>clinic</b> and a school-based mobile clinic. Although the service setting does not affect significantly the WTP for treatment directly, the estimated positive association between WTP and income is modified by setting. The results indicate that the potential for mobile clinics to increase utilization of services among primary school children is associated with parents' income, with the difference in valuation of dental services between the two settings being less among lower income parents than higher income parents. However, even among lower income parents our results indicate that the potential for increasing service utilization among children depends on the improvements in access associated with the mobile clinic not being achieved at the opportunity cost of lower levels of effectiveness.

Their route took them through Cape Nome, Solomon, Bluffs, White Mountain School, Moses, Dime Creek, and Candle, each village giving her a welcoming all-night party. Meusebach-Zesch stayed in Kotzebue for a month. At Noorvik they stayed overnight with an Inuit family in a barabara, a semisubterranean sod housing. Kiana was the final clinic. Returning, they witnessed the aurora borealis at Kotzebue, and spent the night at a barabara built inside a snow bank.

40|$|Almost all dental Colleges run a <b>mobile</b> <b>dental</b> {{operation}} for {{people living in}} far inaccessible areas who {{are not able to}} avail <b>dental</b> care. <b>Mobile</b> <b>dental</b> <b>clinics</b> provide a mode of reaching the unreached by delivering dental care in areas where alternative i. e. private practitioners and fixed clinics are unavailable or inaccessible. Oral diseases account for high morbidity in the community which is compounded by the gross mal-distribution of provision of oral health services in India. In order to ensure accessibility to basic oral health services innovative models of service delivery are being explored. In this context the health economics of mobile oral health care is critically evaluated in this paper. Thus a cost analysis was undertaken to determine the operating expenses for the existing <b>mobile</b> <b>dental</b> unit.

40|$|Objective: The aged {{are prone}} to biological, social, and {{psychological}} problems, especially those residing in the rural areas. The rural aging population in contrast to their urban counterparts is illiterate, poor, and ignorant; cumulative {{is the fact that}} the youth are leaving rural areas for money and better opportunity to urban areas. An educational and motivational program to increase prosthodontic awareness was therefore undertaken and it was studied whether this translated into an increased demand for prosthodontic services. Materials and Methods: The study area consisted of a group of six villages collectively known as "Sarora" situated in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. The study population was divided on the basis of age, sex, education, and economic status and comparisons were made in between these groups. Interview and clinical examination were the tools of the study. Data were collected before and after the educational program and was subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The educational program led to more subjects adopting tooth brushing and neem twig chewing as a method of oral hygiene maintenance. The prosthodontic need fulfillment increased from 3. 5 % before the program to 13. 6 % after education and motivation.

40|$|Background Dental caries {{remains a}} {{significant}} public health problem, prevalence being linked {{to social and}} economic deprivation. Occlusal surfaces of first permanent molars are the most susceptible site in the developing permanent dentition. Cochrane reviews have shown pit and fissure sealants (PFS) and fluoride varnish (FV) to be effective over no intervention in preventing caries. However, the comparative cost and effectiveness of these treatments is uncertain. The primary aim of the trial described in this protocol is to compare the clinical effectiveness of PFS and FV in preventing dental caries in first permanent molars in 6 - 7 year-olds. Secondary aims include: establishing the costs and the relative cost-effectiveness of PFS and FV delivered in a community/school setting; examining the impact of PFS and FV on children and their parents/carers in terms of quality of life/treatment acceptability measures; and examining the implementation of treatment in a community setting. Methods/design The trial design comprises a randomised, assessor-blinded, two-arm, parallel group trial in 6 – 7 year old schoolchildren. Clinical procedures and assessments will be performed at 66 primary schools, in deprived areas in South Wales. Treatments will be delivered via a <b>mobile</b> <b>dental</b> <b>clinic.</b> In total, 920 children will be recruited (460 per trial arm). At baseline and annually for 36 months dental caries will be recorded using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) by trained and calibrated dentists. PFS and FV will be applied by trained dental hygienists. The FV will be applied at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. The PFS will be applied at baseline and re-examined at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months, and will be re-applied if the existing sealant has become detached/is insufficient. The economic analysis will estimate the costs of providing the PFS versus FV. The process evaluation will assess implementation and acceptability through acceptability scales, a schools questionnaire and interviews with children, parents, dentists, dental nurses and school staff. The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of children developing new caries on any one of up to four treated first permanent molars. Discussion The objectives of this study have been identified by the National Institute for Health Research as one of importance to the National Health Service in the UK. The results of this trial will provide guidance on which of these technologies should be adopted {{for the prevention of}} dental decay in the most susceptible tooth-surface in the most at risk children...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) BACKGROUND: The {{majority}} of South African citizens {{are dependent on}} the State Health Care system for their wellbeing. Dental services {{are part of this}} system. The first line of intervention for oral disease is the primary oral health services. The National Norms and Standards for Primary Health Care sets out in detail the services to be offered by state dental clinics. This document also lists the equipment and materials that public dental clinics should be furnished with in order to deliver prescribed services. Despite this, most public dental clinics do not deliver the full spectrum of services {{due to the lack of}} materials and equipment. The end result is that patients do not receive the ideal treatment and treatment choices are based on the availability of equipment and material instead of clinical appropriateness. There was a need to determine to what extent the primary oral health clinics comply with the National Norms and Standards for Primary Health Care. The launch of the green paper of the National Health Insurance in 2011 stated that the NHI is a tool to ensure that healthcare to the entire South African population is of an equal standard. The Umgungundlovu District is one of the sites identified as a pilot district for the NHI. Prior to 1994 there was a two tiered health system in South Africa, the private health system and the public health system. It is this historical model that has shaped the current system. It was the socio-economic status of an individual that dictated within which of the two tiers treatment was sought. AIM: To determine whether public dental clinics in the Umgungundlovu District are equipped to deliver the oral health services prescribed by the Primary Health Care Package for South Africa protocol. METHODOLOGY: A cross sectional study was conducted in the Umgungundlovu district which is in KwaZulu Natal to establish which of the prescribed dental services are offered at the clinic. There are 11 dental clinics in the Umgungundlovu District and one <b>mobile</b> <b>dental</b> <b>clinic.</b> All clinics and the mobile clinic were included in the study. Physical inspection and a checklist were used to determine which equipment and materials were available at dental clinics of the Umgungundlovu district and to determine compliance with the National Norms and Standards for Primary Health Care. RESULTS: Dental services were provided at all the 12 dental facilities in the Umgungundlovu district. None of the clinics had 100 % of required instruments, materials and equipment. Half of the clinics had more than 50 % of required instruments, materials and equipment. Tooth-brushing programs and fluoride mouth rinsing programs were offered by 41. 67 % of the clinics, fissure sealant applications by 66. 67 % and topical fluoride application by 25 % of the clinics. In addition, while all offered oral examination and emergency pain and sepsis care (including extractions) only half were able to take bitewing radiographs, 58. 33 % to carry out simple fillings of 1 - 3 tooth surfaces, 66. 67 % to provide atraumatic restorative treatment (ART). CONCLUSION: Lack of materials, instruments and equipment, the irregular supply of materials, instruments and equipment and the late supply of materials, instruments and equipment was found to limit the dental treatment offered by the clinics. None of the 12 clinics in the Umgungundlovu district were found to be compliant with the Primary Health Care Package for South Africa – a set of norms and standards document. Availability of dental services was limited in the dental clinics, except at the Edendale Dental Hospital Departmen...|$|E
