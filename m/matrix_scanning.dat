Initial public recognition {{came from the}} Westinghouse Educational Foundation Science Talent Search group, a Science Service organization. [...] The paper entry was named in the [...] "Honors Group" [...] publicized to universities on January 25, 1978. [...] The paper was subsequently invited and presented at the Iowa Academy of Science at the University of Northern Iowa. [...] The operational prototype was displayed at the Eastern Iowa SEF on March 18 and obtained a top [...] "Physical Sciences" [...] award and IEEE recognition. The project was again displayed at the 29th International SEF at the Anaheim Ca. Convention Center on May 8-10. [...] The ¼-inch thin miniature flat panel modular prototype, scientific paper, and full screen (tiled LED matrix) schematic with video interface were displayed at this event. It received awards by NASA and General Motors Corporation. [...] This project marked {{some of the earliest}} progress towards the replacement of the 70+ year old high-voltage analog CRT system (cathode-ray tube technology) with a digital x-y scanned LED matrix driven with a NTSC television RF video format. Mitchell's paper projected the future replacement of CRTs and included foreseen application to battery operated devices due the advantages of low-power. Displacement of the electromagnetic scan systems included the removal of inductive deflection, electron beam and color convergence circuits and has been a significant achievement. The unique properties of the light emitting diode as an emissive device simplifies <b>matrix</b> <b>scanning</b> complexity and has helped the modern television adapt to digital communications and shrink into its current thin form factor.|$|E

In the data processing phase, the set of xyz data obtained from the measurement is triangulated, and necessary details are regularized in order to reach requested resolution. This enables the user to perform zooming in the data processing phase, with no need of performing further measurements.|$|E

40|$|Many {{cellular}} signaling pathways induce {{gene expression}} by activating specific transcription factor complexes. Conventional {{approaches to the}} prediction of transcription factor binding sites lead to a notoriously high number of false discoveries. To alleviate this problem, we consider only binding sites that are conserved in man-mouse genomic sequence comparisons. We employ two alternative methods for predicting binding sites: exact matches to validated binding site sequences and weight <b>matrix</b> <b>scans.</b> We then ask the question whether there is a characteristic association between a transcription factor or set thereof to a particular group of genes. Our approach is tested on genes, which are induced in dendritic cells in response to the cells’ exposure to LPS. We chose this example because the underlying signaling pathways are well understood. We demonstrate the benefit of conserved predicted binding sites in interpreting the LPS experiment. Additionally, we find that both methods for the prediction of conserved binding sites complement one another. Finally, our results suggest a distinct role for SRF in the context of LPS-induced gene expression...|$|R
