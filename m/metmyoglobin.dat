The absorption peak of <b>metmyoglobin</b> at 409 mµ disappeared when substrate was added to normal or antimycin-inhibited preparations, {{and was replaced by}} a new maximum at 423 to 424 mµ, identified as due to the oxidation to ferrylmyoglobin. Further investigation revealed that the oxidation of <b>metmyoglobin</b> took place with the simultaneous oxidation of reduced flavoprotein. Hydrogen peroxide, formed by the reaction of reduced flavoprotein with oxygen, was considered to be the probable intermediate for the oxidation of <b>metmyoglobin</b> in experiments in which catalase was added as a competitor for the oxidant. When DPNH was added to the reaction mixture, the reductant acted to resynthesize the ferri-derivative by reaction with ferrylmyoglobin.

However, on re-addition of the precipitate further reduction to oxymyoglobin took place. Dialysis of the muscle extract prior to heating markedly inhibited the reduction but addition of NADH to the dialysate permitted further reduction. The precipitate plus NADH caused oxymyoglobin formation {{in the presence of}} <b>metmyoglobin</b> but neither the precipitate nor NADH alone induced this formation.

40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} and myoglobin oxidation in muscle foods {{occur in}} a concurrent manner and each process appears to enhance the other. During oxidation of oxymyoglobin, both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide are produced and further react with iron to produce hydroxyl radical. The hydroxyl radical {{has the ability to}} penetrate into the hydrophobic lipid region and hence facilitates lipid oxidation. The prooxidant effect of oxymyoglobin on lipid oxidation is concentrationdependent. At equimolar concentrations, oxymyoglobin shows higher prooxidative activity towards lipid than <b>metmyoglobin.</b> However, the catalytic activity of <b>metmyoglobin</b> is promoted by hydrogen peroxide. The reaction between hydrogen peroxide and <b>metmyoglobin</b> results in the formation of two active hypervalent myoglobin species, perferrylmyoglobin and ferrylmyoglobin, which are responsible for lipid oxidation. Additionally, lipid oxidation results {{in a wide range of}} aldehyde products, which are reported to induce the oxidation of oxymyoglobin. <b>Metmyoglobin</b> formation is generally greater in the presence of unsaturated aldehydes than their saturated counterparts of equivalent carbon chain length. In addition, increasing chain length of aldehydes, from hexenal through nonenal, results in the increased <b>metmyoglobin</b> formation. Moreover, aldehydes alter myoglobin redox stability by increasing oxymyoglobin oxidation, decreasing the <b>metmyoglobin</b> reduction via enzymatic process, and enhance the prooxidant activity of <b>metmyoglobin.</b> Therefore, the oxidation of both lipid and myoglobin directly affect the quality and acceptability of muscle foods and the lowering of such a phenomenon can enhance the shelf-life stability of those foods...|$|E

The reactions were studied under pseudo-first order conditions with hydrogen peroxide present in excess, in one case, and with <b>metmyoglobin</b> present in excess, in another case. Second order rate constants were calculated frotn the slope of the lines constructed from plots of observed pseudo-first order rate constants versus concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The rate constants of the reaction were independent of the pH of the reaction within the pH range of 5. 0 to 8. 5, but within the pH range of 8. 5 to 11. 0, the rate constants of the reaction decreased with increasing pH. The pH dependence of the rate constants for the reaction between <b>metmyoglobin</b> and hydrogen peroxide was fit to a mechanism involving a single pK, in the protein. From the spectra of <b>metmyoglobin,</b> taken in buffers prepared at pH values within the entire range of the protein’s stability, there appeared to be two different forms of <b>metmyoglobin.</b> One form existed at pH below 8. 5 and the other form existed above pH of 8. 5.

Ferrylmyoglobin and/or its free radical form are regarded as powerful oxidizing agents capable of promoting oxidation of essential cellular constituents, particularly cell membranes. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ubiquinol on the formation and survival of ferryl species of myoglobin and on <b>metmyoglobin</b> itself. The addition of a threefold molar excess of hydrogen peroxide to a solution of <b>metmyoglobin</b> induces the rapid formation of a compound with the spectral characteristics of ferrylmyoglobin.

Ubiquinol- 1, furthermore, is also capable of protecting <b>metmyoglobin</b> against oxidation when added in the solution before hydrogen peroxide. Ubiquinol- 1, indeed, is effective at both limiting the maximal ferrylmyoglobin level attained (59 % inhibition) and accomplishing complete removal of the ferryl form (in about 15 min).

The overall {{objective of the}} current research was {{to better understand the}} role of mitochondria in beef color. The results suggest that mitochondria have the ability to regenerate reducing equivalents when substrates such as succinate and lactate are available. This NADH produced via lactate-LDH-NAD resulted in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, conversion of oxy- to deoxymyoglobin, and <b>metmyoglobin</b> reduction (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT The central {{question}} to be discussed in this paper is whether the structure established for sperm whale myoglobin in the crystalline state {{is the same as}} that of the protein in solution. As judged by its ultraviolet optical rotatory dispersion, the helical content of <b>metmyoglobin</b> in solution does not differ from that in the crystal, 77 per cent. Although an uncertainty of about-t- 5 per cent must attach to this result, it excludes many alternative arrangements of the polypeptide chain. The folding of the chain may be further restricted to the basic form seen in the crystal if the dimensions of the molecule in solution and the interactions of specific chemical groups are taken into account. Since the rotatory dispersion of <b>metmyoglobin</b> is constant with respect to ionic strength, and since the dispersions of reduced and oxymyoglobin reveal no change in helical content upon their formation from <b>metmyoglobin,</b> one may infer that the structure of the protein is largely maintained both as it dissolves and during its reversible combination with oxygen. The crystallographic model of myoglobin thus offers a structural basis for attempting to explain its physiological function in solution. The relevance of this conclusion to the crystal-solution problems presented by other species of protein is then best seen in the light of common factors that govern the equilibrium of all proteins between crystal and solution...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} between <b>metmyoglobin</b> {{and hydrogen}} peroxide produces both a ferryl-oxo heme and a globin-centred radical(s) {{from the two}} oxidizing equivalents of the hydrogen peroxide. Evidence has been presented for localization of the globin-centred radical on one tryptophan residue and tyrosines 103 and 151. When the spin-trapping agent 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) {{is included in the}} reaction mixture, a radical adduct has been detected, but the residue at which that adduct is formed has not been determined. Replacement of either tryptophans 7 and 14 or tyrosines 146 and 151 with phenylalanine has no effect on the formation of DMPO adduct in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide. When tyrosine 103 is replaced with phenylalanine, however, only DMPOX, a product of the oxidation of the spin-trap, is detected. Tyrosine- 103 is, therefore, the site of radical adduct formation with DMPO. The spin trap 2 -methyl- 2 -nitrosopropane (MNP), however, forms radical adducts with any recombinant sperm whale <b>metmyoglobin</b> that contains either tyrosine 103 or 151.

The reaction of ascorbate with ferryl- or met-myoglobin resulted in ascorbyl radical production. The {{interaction of}} ascorbate with oxymyoglobin proceeded with formation of ascorbyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and an overall oxidation of oxymyoglobin to <b>metmyoglobin.</b> The latter reaction proceeded via an oxoferryl complex intermediate - corresponding to ferrylmyoglobin and identified by {{treatment of the}} reaction mixture with Na 2 S. These observations are consistent with a concerted electron transfer mechanism, whereby the two electrons required for the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide are donated by ascorbic acid and the heme iron. The antioxidant and prooxidant aspects of these redox transitions are {{discussed in terms of}} their kinetic properties...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} films cast from didodecyldimethyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB) microemulsions {{containing}} the protein myoglobin (Mb) onto pyrolytic graphite electrodes gave good electron-transfer properties {{when used in}} these same microemulsions. The films became thinner during the first 10 min after initial insertion into the microemulsion. A film 3 ̆c 1 μm thick remained {{on the surface of}} the electrode in DDAB microemulsions and exhibited direct electron transfer between the electrode and the Fe(III) /Fe(II) redox couple of myoglobin. Mb-DDAB films could be used for nearly a week in an unstirred DDAB/water/dodecane (13 / 28 / 59) microemulsion. The position of the Soret electronic absorbance band suggests that Mb in these films may be partly denatured. Mb-DDAB films were used to facilitate redox reactions of polar and non polar solutes in DDAB microemulsions, as illustrated by the reductions of polar trichloroacetic acid and the non polar oxygen. ^ A major question addressed by this thesis was whether electrochemical methods could be used to form the well-known ferrylmyoglobin (MbFe(IV) = O) species. Such ferrylmyoglobin were characterized spectroscopically. Results reported in this thesis shows that MbFe(IV) = O was generated via electrochemical reduction of <b>metmyoglobin</b> (MbFe(III)) in the presence of oxygen in pH 7. 3 buffer and in the DDAB microemulsion. Reduction of <b>metmyoglobin</b> at - 0. 4 V vs. SCE catalyzed the reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide at the electrode. The electrogenerated hydrogen peroxide in turn oxidized MbFe(III) in solution to give MbFe(IV) = O. This complex reduction-oxidation process converted nearly all of the 30 μM MbFe(III) in a spectroelectrochemical cell to MbFe(IV) = O in about 15 min. in pH 7. 3 buffer, and in 18 min. in the microemulsion. Characteristic iron heme absorbance bands near 421, 548, and 584 nm were used to identify the product as MbFe(IV) = O. Confirmation was provided by reducing this species to <b>metmyoglobin</b> with ascorbate. The electrochemical method produced ferrylmyoglobin analogous to that formed by the chemical reaction of <b>metmyoglobin</b> with hydrogen peroxide, but with a controllable rate of hydrogen peroxide production. ...|$|E
