It {{was followed}} in 1994 with Vanya on 42nd Street, a filmed version of her ongoing Uncle Vanya workshop production, directed by Louis Malle. Moore's performance of Yelena was described as [...] "simply outstanding" [...] by Time Out, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops <b>multiple</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in Todd Haynes' low-budget film Safe (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, Empire magazine writes that Safe [...] "first established [...] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation." [...] The film historian David Thomson later described it as [...] "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s," [...] and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, [...] "They all came out at once, and I suddenly had this profile. It was amazing." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitivities</b> (MCS) syndrome, {{also known}} as {{idiopathic}} environmental intolerance, is a controversial diagnosis that encompasses {{a wide range of}} waxing and waning, subjective symptoms referable to more than one body system and provoked by exposure to low levels of chemicals, foods, or other agents in the environment. Although MCS has been studied extensively, a unifying mechanism explaining the illness remains obscure, and clinicians are divided as to whether such a medical entity exists separately from psychosomatic syndromes. MCS is an adult diagnosis; there is little reference to pediatric cases in the scientific literature. In this case from the Pediatric Environmental Health Subspecialty Unit at Boston’s Children’s Hospital, I present the case of a preschool child who had suffered from milk allergy and poor weight gain as an infant, and then later developed asthma, allergic symptoms, sinusitis, headaches, fatigue, and rashes precipitated by an expanding variety of chemicals, foods, and allergens.

We also explore possible triggers, the potential linkage between MCS and other disorders, and the lifestyle alterations produced by MCS. The first phase of the study consisted of a random sampling of 1, 582 individuals from the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area to determine the reported prevalence of a hypersensitivity to common chemicals. In this phase, 12. 6 % of the sample reported a hypersensitivity. Further questioning of individuals with a hypersensitivity indicated that 13. 5 % (1. 8 % of the entire sample) reported losing their jobs because of their hypersensitivity. The second phase was a follow-up questioning of the respondents who initially reported hypersensitivity. In this phase, we found that individuals with hypersensitivity experience a variety of symptoms and triggers. A significant percentage (27. 5 %) reported that their hypersensitivity was initiated by an exposure to pesticides, whereas an equal percentage (27. 5 %) attributed it to solvents. Only 1. 4 % had a history of prior emotional problems, but 37. 7 % developed these problems after the physical symptoms emerged. This suggests that MCS has a physiologic and not a psychologic etiology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is 3 -fold: a) to review briefly the neuropsychological tests that have been used to {{evaluate}} the effects of neurotoxicants; b) to identify individual factors that may create heightened sensitivity to neurotoxicants; and c) to discuss test parameters that will increase the sensitivity of neuropsychological tests for detecting symptoms in low-level exposure situations. While the body of literature on neurobehavioral toxicology has increased dramatically during the past 10 years, it remains difficult to discern which tests are most effective in detecting behavioral effects even among workers with significant exposures. Few investigators have evaluated the interactions between individual differences, such as gender and psychiatric function, and exposure to neurotoxicants. Detection of behavioral performance decrements among uniquely susceptible populations such as those with sensitivities to low-level exposures (e. g., <b>multiple</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitivities)</b> will require more difficult tests than are frequently used in current neuropsychological test batteries.

40|$|Environmental {{exposures}} to very {{low levels of}} airborne chemicals are associated with adverse symptoms, often affecting multiple organ systems, in the phenomenon of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (CS). Recent surveys suggest a significant prevalence of chemically sensitive subjects in the United States, but the mechanism linking exposure to symptoms remains unclear, despite the advancement {{of a variety of}} theoretical models. In many of these models, exposure of the nasal respiratory system to an airborne agent {{is the first step in}} the pathway leading to symptoms. In this article, we advance the hypothesis that interactions between environmental chemicals and the vomeronasal organ (VNO) may play a role in the etiology of CS. The VNO, a bilateral, tubular organ located in the nose, serves in animals as part of a sensitive chemosensory system; however, evidence suggesting that the VNO retains a functional role in the adult human is controversial. Reported characteristics of the human VNO relevant to CS, including location, prevalence, selective <b>sensitivity</b> to airborne <b>chemical</b> exposure, and capacity to produce systemic effects, are discussed within the context of this ongoing debate.

40|$|What {{do we know}} 2 <b>Multiple</b> <b>Chemical</b> <b>Sensitivities</b> (MCS) affects between 12. 6 % and 33 % of the {{population}} and involves sensitivity to and illness reactions from exposures to chemicals in ambient air.

The condition is often initiated by one large chemical exposure, a series of low-level exposures, or presence during remodeling (with exposure to fresh paint, carpet, and other chemicals). More women than men may be affected. Life impacts include the loss of work, a decline in finances, difficulty finding safe housing, a lack of medical care, psychological upset, and the need to negotiate disability status. Qualitative researchers have discussed themes of isolation, loss of feelings of productivity, identity changes, and the need to cope with disbelief and delegitimization from others.

40|$|In {{this review}} I {{describe}} {{the development of}} environmental medicine as a specialized field of clinical medicine in Germany. New scientific societies were founded, based on traditions of public hygiene and occupational medicine, {{as a reaction to}} environmental issues concerning human health. Environmental medicine issues were also addressed by independent "critical" physicians. The first institutions to accept patients were centers for environmental medicine affiliated with research institutions and/or with the public health service. Medical professional organizations, particularly the German General Medical Council, described the need for and formulated conditions for additional qualification for doctors in environmental medicine, including a 200 -hr course. This course and a qualifying exam were passed by about 3, 000 doctors, mainly from the public health service and from occupational medicine. Unfortunately, few general physicians in primary outpatient care were similarly trained. To date, no representative study has been conducted on environmental patients, but I include in this review a typical list of patients' complaints.
