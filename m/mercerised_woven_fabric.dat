The enhancement of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> in HAH sandwich panel further strengthens the sandwich panel especially in ballistic tests. Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> showed extensive pull out (rupture of yarns) when less than 6 layers of fabric impacted by ballistic projectile at a velocity of 293 m/s. Sandwich panel consisting of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> incorporated with aluminium honeycomb showed no pull out when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 312. 5 m/s. However, when sandwich panel arrangement {{was in the}} following order: 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric,</b> 1 layer of HAH, 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> and a final layer of HAH, Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> pull out was observed when impacted by a ballistic projectile at a velocity of 277. 8 m/s. This indicated that the ballistic projectile was impacting on 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> (followed by another 3 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric)</b> at a time instead of 6 layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> based on {{the arrangement of the}} sandwich panel. The overall sandwich panels for both arrangements had the same amount of materials but one failed the ballistic test and the other passed. One possible reason behind the improved ballistic test is that the areal density of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> is the highest when the layers of Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> are assembled together. Therefore, it is crucial to have ballistic projectile entrapped within the Kevlar <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> layers before prioritising the arrangement of sandwich panel...|$|R

The results prove that the manner of fabric deformation during relaxation depends upon the multilayer fabrics structure.

Multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> with longer float length show higher crinkled, and its deformation behavior is non-linear. Thus, connected deformations are closely related to the stretch potential and influence multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> draping and fitting of the garment.
