It is a major stakeholder in several international <b>megascience</b> projects, including the ongoing construction of both the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in France and the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. The Russian Federation also hosts the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, which employs over 1 000 researchers from the Russian Federation and further afield and receives nearly the same number of temporary foreign visitors each year.|$|E
50|$|The {{recommendation}} to coordinate international {{efforts in the}} new field of Neuroinformatics was first made in the report on Bioinformatics elaborated {{under the aegis of}} the then OECD <b>Megascience</b> Forum in 1998. Following extensive discussions in the Neuroinformatics Working Group of the Global Science Forum chaired by Dr Stephen Koslow, the proposal to create an International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility, as well as a funding Programme in International Neuroinformatics (PIN), was then presented in 2002. This project was endorsed by OECD science ministers at their meeting in January 2004. Sixteen countries (Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Victoria, Australia), as well as the European Commission, then elaborated the working documents that form the legal basis for the INCF and the PIN (see below).|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be {{the next}} {{particle}} accelerator built to serve the world's high-energy physics community at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research. Reusing the 26. 7 -km circumference tunnel and infrastructure of the existing LEP collider, the LHC will make use of advanced technology - high-field superconducting magnets operated in superfluid helium - to push the energy frontier up by an order of magnitude, while remaining economically feasible. The LHC demonstrates on a grand scale several typical features of <b>megascience</b> projects, such as the need for international funding, world-wide co-operation and integration in the local environment, which we review in the following...|$|E
40|$|The Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) is a Chinese <b>megascience</b> {{project that}} aims to build the largest single dish radio {{telescope}} in the world. Given its multiple simultaneous beam formation, phased array feed (PAF) is widely used to extend {{the field of view}} and enhance the survey speed of the radio telescope. In this study, a broadband and low cost PAF element using cross-dipole antenna at L-band is designed based on the requirement of the FAST. The antenna is fed by two microstrip baluns which have high performance and is easy to manufacture compared to the traditional coaxial balun. A simple system model is also introduced to evaluate the PAF performance. The measured results of the fabricated element and the simulations of the system performance validate the effectiveness of element design...|$|E
40|$|At {{the modern}} stage of global {{economic}} system (GES) development creating new organizational forms of mutual {{use of the}} benefits of the V and VI technological modes by participants of the megaeconomic interactions has been intensified, and their desire to enlarge the share in global markets on this basis. <b>Megascience</b> centers (MSC) have become organizational forms of such a kind in the field of scientific and innovative activity. MSC are large-scale objects of scientific and research profile at megaeconomy level, which have a particularly strong material and technical groundwork and are based on international collaboration of public and private capital of its member countries. The purpose of the MSC creation is obtaining breakthrough scientific results that change the structure of GES on the basis of progressive general purpose technology (GPT), including nanotechnology. Stable cooperation of participants is of critical importance for the efficient operation and prospects of MSC development, but instability of present political and economic conjuncture, and strengthening unfair global competition become a catalyst for emergence and escalation of contradictions in MSC’s functioning mechanism, and increasing the risk of scientific megaprojects successful implementation. The article identifies main exogenous political, economic, investment and fiscal factors that form unfavorable environment of MSC contemporary development in Russia...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} by Neuroinformatics, which is a new national and international activity. Neuroinformatics is a growing field defined in {{a report from the}} OECD <b>MegaScience</b> Forum. Neuroinformatics is interdisciplinary, combining research in neuroscience and informatics (including computation) with the aim to develop and apply advanced tools and approaches needed for understanding the brain. In the study of the competence and flexibility of the brain, neuroinformatics research is uniquely placed at the intersection of medical, biological, and behavioural science, the physical sciences, computer science, mathematics and engineering. The resultant synergy from combining these approaches is expected to accelerate scientific and technological progress, resulting in major medical, social, and economic benefits. I discuss neuroinformatics in view of information infrastructure research, with open, enabling, shared, heterogeneous and socio-technical properties. Realization of a neuroinformatical information infrastructure involves fundamental changes in neurocientific research practice. There will be a need for standardized ways to structure and annotate data and tools. In addition quality criteria are needed to facilitate sharing across neuroscientific communities. I have analyzed Neural Systems and Graphics Computing Laboratory (NeSys), in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Oslo, to exemplify the practical aspects of the neuroinformatical vision. I conclude by giving recommendations on future activities in neuroinformatics...|$|E
40|$|The International Workshop on Cold Moderators for Pulsed Neutron Sources {{resulted}} from the coincidence of two forces. Our sponsors in the Materials Sciences Branch of DOE's Office of Energy Research and the community of moderator and neutron facility developers both {{realized that it was}} time. The Neutron Sources Working Group of the <b>Megascience</b> Forum of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development offered to contribute its support by publishing the proceedings, which with DOE and Argonne sponsorship cemented the initiative. The purposes of the workshop were: to recall and improve the theoretical groundwork of time-dependent neutron thermalization; to pose and examine the needs for and benefits of cold moderators for neutron scattering and other applications of pulsed neutron sources; to summarize experience with pulsed source, cold moderators, their performance, effectiveness, successes, problems and solutions, and the needs for operational data; to compile and evaluate new ideas for cold moderator materials and geometries; to review methods of measuring and characterizing pulsed source cold moderator performance; to appraise methods of calculating needed source characteristics and to evaluate the needs and prospects for improvements; to assess the state of knowledge of data needed for calculating the neutronic and engineering performance of cold moderators; and to outline the needs for facilities for testing various aspects of pulsed source cold moderator performance...|$|E
40|$|The <b>megascience</b> {{platforms}} Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), Catalogue of Life (CoL), Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), International Barcode of Life (iBOL), International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and JSTOR Plant Science, all {{belong to}} a group of global players that harvest, process, repurpose and provide biodiversity data on all kinds of organisms. Each of these platforms primarily focus on one data domain, for instance, taxonomy and classification, occurrence, morphology, ecology, and molecular data. The present contribution describes aspects of processing and provision of biological research data on these platforms, focusing on the technical implementation of data exchange, copyright issues, and data sharing policies as well as their implications for data custodians, owners, providers, and publishers. With the exception of JSTOR Plant Science, most international initiatives seek long-term business models and funding mechanisms to provide online data openly and free of charge. For example, currently GBIF depends on governmental commitments for its funding, and CoL is financed by EU or national grants, as well as being based on Species 2000, a British non-for-profit company, and ITIS. These business models are compared with that of JSTOR Plant Science, the commercial portal of the Global Plant Initiative (GPI). All initiatives currently meet challenges of sustainability with regard to data curation as well as software development for maintaining the complexity of their services. All platforms discussed here also harvest and provide mycological and lichenological research data...|$|E
40|$|Various {{data are}} {{collected}} for 15 member {{countries of the}} Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) {{that have to do}} with the practising of astronomy: (1) using the report of the Astronomy expert meeting of the <b>Megascience</b> Forum of the OECD, the level of astronomy funding, size of the research communities, relative commitment to ground-based versus space-based astronomy, etc.; (2) from other sources the size of the population, Gross National Product and size of the total research community; (3) from the paper of Schubert et al. (1989) data on publication and citation scores of these countries in astronomy and the total research effort (excluding social and economic sciences). Using these data the 15 countries have been ranked on: (1) the relative level of astronomy funding; (2) the relative level of performance in astronomy; (3) the correspondence between funding and performance in astronomy; (4) the relative level of performance of the total science effort; and (5) the performance in astronomy relative to that in all sciences. The results of this study have been summarized in table 10 below. Other interesting results that can be inferred from the data collected in this paper are: (1) one out of every 75, 000 inhabitants of these OECD countries is an astronomical researcher; (2) each citizen of these countries spends on average 2. 5 $ per year on astronomical research (either from the ground or in space); (3) the average budget per researcher amounts to roughly 200, 000 $ per annum; (4) the average budget for astronomy amounts to 0. 016 % of the Gross National Product and of order 1 % of the total budget for civilian R & D; (5) an astronomical researcher from these countries produces on average 1. 7 papers each year and these papers receive on average ten citations in the first five years; (6) researchers in science (excluding economic and social sciences) make up 0. 08 % of the population in these countries and one in about 65 of these researchers works in astronomy or astrophysics; (7) most countries spend about one-third of their astronomy budget on salaries, one-sixth on basic support and half on observing facilities (in a ratio one to two for ground-based versus space) ...|$|E
