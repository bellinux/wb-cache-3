40|$|ABSTRACT: Evidence that noninvasive {{intermittent}} positive-pressure ventilation (NiIPPV) improves exercise {{capacity in}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is limited. The effectiveness of different ventilators {{in this setting}} has not been studied. Three bilevel pressure support ventilators (Bipap S/T 30, Nippy 2 and Vpap II ST), applied via a mouthpiece, were compared during submaximal treadmill exercise in eight subjects with COPD. Subjects walked to exhaustion with each of the ventilators and while breathing through the mouthpiece alone, in random order. In addition, four unencumbered walks were performed. The unencumbered distance (mean¡SD) walked was 259 ¡ 123 m. With the mouth-piece alone this decreased to 211 ¡ 96 m and fell further to 145 ¡ 76 m with NiIPPV. There was no difference between the brands of ventilator. At the break-point of exercise, significant increases were seen in tidal volume and minute ventilation in the ventilator walks compared with the mouthpiece alone. Noninvasive intermittent positive-pressure ventilation increased ventilation but did not improve exercise capacity in the subjects in this study. No significant differences were seen between the ventilators. The effectiveness of this technique and the optimal <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> require further clarification...|$|E

40|$|Topic of this diploma {{thesis is}} the usage <b>of</b> {{professional}} <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and control applied {{by social workers}} in practice. Theoretical part consists of a description <b>of</b> history <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and control in social work area, assistance and control {{in the context of}} a systematic approach and the risk of abusing of power by social workers while realising controls of clients. Furthermore, the diploma thesis mentions the helper syndrome and the occupational burnout syndrome that is common in social professions and, in connection to that, the importance of maintaining a certain psycho-hygiene and the significance of supervision. The aim of this diploma thesis is the monitoring <b>of</b> professional work <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and control by social workers directly engaged with the clients. In accordance with this goal, there were three research questions established relating the goal of the diploma thesis. Social workers answered questions questioning them how they use the assistance and control in the direct engagement with the clients and how they perceive the distinction between the assistance and control in their practical experience. In order to achieve the goal, there was used a qualitative research that was implemented by using the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> a semi-structured interview. Data analysis was evaluated by using the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> the categorization of data. In conclusion, it can be stated that the goal of the diploma thesis, alongside with the research questions, were achieved. Based on the results, two hypotheses were established. The first one is that social workers are not aware of the professional work <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> control and <b>assistance</b> in practice, the second is that the unfamiliarity with these methods causes less effectivity level of their performance. Outcomes of this diploma thesis may be used as a study material for a theoretical teaching and as a feedback for social workers as this diploma thesis brings the information about which work methods they are using in their practice...|$|R

40|$|Psychological trauma {{results from}} {{exposure}} to an inescapable stressor that overwhelms a person's ability to cope. During the period of perceived threat a defensive process of denial and suppression frequently operates to control a person's emotional response to the situation. Emergency services personnel in particular, may actively employ a task- oriented approach to traumatic incidents: and suppress their anxiety and fear {{in order to maintain}} concentration and undertake their duties most effectively. In psychological terms, this behaviour may be seen as purposeful, adaptive dissociation. However, recent studies of emergency services personnel reveal that there are possible long-term risks associated with the experiencing dissociation during a traumatic situation. While the ability to control emotional response may be viewed as an effective way of coping during an intense or traumatic situation, there is an inherent danger that this inhibition of emotions may become the source of long term psychological and physiological disturbance. Psychological debriefing is a popular <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> for emergency services personnel following a traumatic incident. It is designed to promote the cognitive and emotional processing of a traumatic event. During a debrief, participants describe the traumatic experience (including their reactions and emotions) in order to begin to integrate and master key features of the experience. While there is abundant anecdotal evidence suggesting that psychological debriefings can be beneficial, there have also been conflicting reports as to their actual effectiveness. Investigators have indicated that rigorous investigation of the effectiveness of psychological debriefing and its role in post-trauma recovery is urgently required. In particular, such investigations need to provide a clear answer to the question 'Is psychological debriefing related to the prevention of PTSD symptoms and associated psychological sequelae?' In this study, an investigation was undertaken of 96 emergency services personnel involved in the response to the 'Port Arthur massacre', a critical incident in which a lone gunman randomly killed 32 visitors in a popular tourist venue in southern Tasmania. All participants were individually interviewed on two occasions: eight months after and twenty months after the incident. Two key findings from the research project we presented. Firstly, experiencing dissociative symptoms {{at the time of the}} incident was predictive of long-term psychological and physiological distress. Secondly, within the group of emergency services personnel who experienced dissociation at the event, those who disclosed their related thoughts and feelings at the subsequent group debriefings showed significantly less long-term psychological distress. The results of this study offer insight into how the impact of biological chances caused by a traumatic event can be modified by the psychological processing of that event. The results support the suggestion that following a traumatic situation, a person needs to process and integrate the memory of that event if he or she is to 'recover' from his or her reaction to the situation. Psychological debriefing appears to provide an opportunity for the necessary psychological processing to commence and assist emergency services personnel in managing what might otherwise develop into PTSD...|$|E

Hence, this paper describes a study that investigates the double-click interactions of older and younger adults and presents data that can help inform the development <b>of</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance.</b> Twelve older adults (mean age = 63. 9 years) and 12 younger adults (mean age = 20. 8 years) performed click and double-click target selections with a computer mouse. Initial results show that older users make approximately twice as many errors as younger users when attempting double-clicks. For both age groups, the largest proportion of errors was due to difficulties with keeping the cursor steady between button presses. Compared with younger adults, older adults experienced more difficulties with performing two button presses within a required time interval. Understanding these interactions better is a step towards improving accessibility, and may provide some suggestions for future directions of research in this area...|$|R

To assess expected reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality relative risks (RR). Material and methods. In this open, parallel study, 169 relatively healthy male smokers aged 18 - 60 years {{were randomly assigned to}} free choice vs admission of Nicorette gum (2 / 4 mg) or inhaler (10 mg). At baseline, all participants smoked ≥ 15 cig/d, for ≥ 3 years. The intervention phase lasted 3 months; follow-up evaluations were made at 3, 6 and 12 months after nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) initiation. Results. Twelve-month results were obtained for 152 subjects (response rate 89. 9 %). Point prevalence abstinence and reduction (smoking ≤ 50 % of basic daily cigarette amount) rates were 19. 7 % and 35. 5 %, respectively. Neither abstinence, nor reduction rates depended on Nicorette form (gum vs inhaler), or on choice vs admission factor. The main predictors of long-term efficacy were nicotine dependence severity and contacts with other smokers. NRT was not associated with negative dynamics in objective health parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, ECG parameters, body weight, and body mass index) or self-evaluation of health. Both Nicorette forms seemed to be safe and well-tolerated. At 12 months, the expected mean RR reduction for CVD mortality reached 19 %, for total mortality – 21 %. Conclusion. In Russian clinical settings, NRT efficacy and safety are similar to that demonstrated in numerous international trials.

It is doubtful that assistance can be justified for resource efficiency reasons. This is argued to be so when the cause of the downturn in industry returns is due to temporary factors, such as drought, and when it is due to long-term trend factors, such as economic growth. While an industry slump can cause welfare problems, most households are able to use contingency strategies, e. g. savings, or resort to existing welfare programs, e. g. unemployment benefits. Direct income grants are preferable to output and input subsidies as means <b>of</b> providing welfare <b>assistance.</b> Political Economy,...|$|R

To meet this need, bibliometric tools within online subscription databases, search engines, and software applications offer indices, graphs, and other exciting data that can make a strong case for tenure across the disciplines. Because libraries offer access to these resources and librarians have the expertise in usage, these tools can be effectively shared with faculty via workshops, online research guides, and individual assistance. Promotion and tenure outreach offers major benefits to both faculty and librarians. Faculty acquire access to online tools that can show comprehensive scholarly impact and elevate their case for tenure; and librarians can demonstrate their value by acting as a partner in research with faculty on a different level beyond the traditional <b>method</b> <b>of</b> resource <b>assistance.</b> In the LIS literature, promotion and tenure outreach has not been specifically defined as such until this study...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> {{learning}} <b>assistance</b> {{based on a}} set of student models in group learning environments. Our system makes student models {{in the same way as}} intelligent tutoring systems do and gets pseudo students to join in learning to assist learners. By referring to student models, pseudo students induce learners to revise incorrect part and to repair missing part of other learners' knowledge. Pseudo students also assist learners to join in discussion. We also propose the minimum number of the necessary pseudo students to cover the proposed <b>assistance.</b> Outline <b>of</b> Group Learning Environment Figure 1 shows the outline of our group learning environment. It has aspects of both groupwares and intelligent tutoring systems. It provides learners the following facilities as a groupware system. 1 fl Private Windows: Learners should get their ideas into shape before they discuss about a given problem. Private windows are work spaces, in which learners visualize their ideas. Becaus [...] ...|$|R
