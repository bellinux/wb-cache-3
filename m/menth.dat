40|$|Case I: A man, aged 75 years {{a public}} copyst, {{who came to}} our {{hospital}} on November 2, 1937; on his left upper limbs a swelling was noticed by {{him for the first}} time on March of this year. For these few days, it became a sucklingheads size gradually, and he complains occaisionally nervous suffering at its locality. This swelling which is hard, bordered on its surroundings distinctly, and prominent from the skin-surface conically. Its colour is chiefly dark-deep red and light-deep red in places. On its surface, there are two walnut-size ulcers with gangrenous substances at its, bottom. The swelling combines with its lower substratum, so that it can not be removed. No connection is found between the swelling and the femur by roentgen photograph. By the patho-histological examination it is diagnosed as polymorphic cell sarcoma. No healing effect is noted with roentgen treatment 2560 r. (filter Zn. 0. 6 mm Al. 3. 0 mm) combined with radium-needle treatment 6336 mg. h. Case 2 : A man, aged 77 years, a farmer who had been operated for the round cell sarcoma of the ethomoid bone cells nine months ago, came to our hospital on July 12, 1937, with hard swellings on his right outer canthus, right chin, right side of his neck, right supraclavicular fossa and left lower, limbs. They are not attached either to their upper skins or lower substrata. Their surfaces are normal in colour and smooth. Their sizes are ranged from the sparrow-egg to the walnut. By the potho-histological examination, it is diagnosed as the round cell sarcoma. All these swellings were taken away by operation. Three <b>menths</b> after the operation, twice the same swellings appeared on his right outer canthus and right supraclavicular fossa; and the former was removed operatively while the latter showed complete healing by treating with roentgen rays. Five months later, thrice the swellings as former appeared on his left upper buttock and right supraclavicular fossa, but the former became small spontaneously and was removed operatively and the latter treated with roentgen rays 1200 r.

40|$|ABSTRACT Il 2 ̆ 7 lixed-machine {{heterogeneous}} computing (HC) environments utilize a distributed {{suite of}} different high-performance machines, interconnected with high-speed links to perform different computationally intensive applications that have diverse comput ational requirements. HC environments are {{well suited to}} meet thl: computational dell-tands of large, diverse groups of tasks. The problem of mapping (defined as matching and scheduling) these tasks onto the machines of a distributed HC environment has been shown, in general, to be NP-complete, requiring the development of heuristic techniques. Selecting the best heuristic to use in a given enviroi <b>menth,</b> owever, remains a difficult problem, because comparisons are often clouded by different underlying assumptions in the original studies of each heuristic. There fore; a collection of eleven heuristics from the literature has been selected: a,dapted, in plementeda, nd anaiyzed under one set of common assumptions. It is assumed that the heuristics derive a, mapping statically (i. e., off-line). It is also assumed that a meta-task (i. e., a set of independent, non-communicating tasks) is being mapped, and that {{the goal is to}} minimize the total execution time of the metla-task. The eleven heuristics examined are Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, MininLlum Clompletion Time, Min-min, hllax-min, Duplex? Genetic i-Ilgorithm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Simulat. ed. Annealing, Tabu, and Ax. This study provides one even basis for comparisor] and insights into circumstances where one technique will out perform another. The evaluation procedure is specified, the heuristics are defined, and then comparison results are discussed. It is shown that for the ca. ses studied here, the relat,ively simple Min-min heuristic performs well in comparison to the other techniques...|$|E
40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the queueing problems addressed in the COST 257 action on "Impacts of new services on the architecture and performance of broadband networks". Typically, these problems arise in modelling the behavior of the queues appearing in multiplexers, tra#c shapers, resequencing units or at the output ports of switching elements. In the report, the evident distinction is made between discrete-time models and continuous-time models, but also between very specific models with long range dependence characteristics as opposed to the classical queueing models. First, an overview is given of the work of COST 257 on classical discrete-time queueing models. Some general relationships for discrete-time single-server queues with a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queueing discipline are introduced and four specific discrete-time models are presented. Three models are analyzed by means of a generating-functions approach, for the other model an iterative algorithm is used. Second, two classical continuous-time queueing models are discussed. Next, queueing problems related to long range dependent input processes are addressed. Also, the queueing analysis of some specific network elements is discussed. Finally, {{an overview of}} miscellaneous COST 257 temporary documents, in some sense related to queueing, is given. This interim report is based on technical documents of COST 257 members and experts. Contributions of the following authors have been used: I. Adan, C. Blondia, H. Bruneel, T. Daniels, B.
