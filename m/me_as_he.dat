500|$|... "I {{jumped into}} bed {{with him and he}} climbed on top of <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> climaxed, he shuddered so loudly I was afraid he would wake up Michael and Marlon, who were {{sleeping}} three feet away in the next bed. Or at least I thought they were sleeping. As I was slipping out of the room, I heard Michael say to Jermaine, 'Nice job. Now, can we please get some sleep?'" ...|$|E
500|$|One {{day when}} we were living at Kawaihae my {{grandmother}} went to Hulihee to see Kuakini, who was not well. I went with her and when Kinau saw me he chased <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> always did. I think {{he did not like}} me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot's {{death was}} {{the end of a long}} journey for me. I had only ever wanted to play Dame Agatha's true Poirot [...] He was as real to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had been to her: a great detective, a {{remarkable}} man, if, perhaps, just now and then, a little irritating.|$|E
60|$|ROSE. I suppose so, else <b>he</b> wouldn't treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> done. He's after that--that--He didn't {{ought to}} treat <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if I was dead.|$|R
6000|$|The giant stood awhile {{looking at}} <b>me,</b> and, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stood, Indaba-zimbi {{walked across the}} ring behind <b>me,</b> muttering <b>as</b> <b>he</b> passed, [...] "Keep cool, Macumazahn, and wait for him. I will make it all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Asks {{me if he}} is going!' exclaimed Fledgeby. 'Asks <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> didn't {{know his}} own purpose! Asks <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> hadn't got his hat on ready! Asks <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if his sharp old eye--why, it cuts like a knife--wasn't looking at his {{walking-stick}} by the door!' ...|$|R
2500|$|After the Inter-Allied {{conference in}} London (6–8 August 1917), at which Lloyd George had urged the {{creation}} of a common Allied General Staff, Robertson again joined with Foch in claiming that there was not time to send heavy guns to Italy for a September offensive. Robertson wrote to Haig (9 August) that Lloyd George would [...] "put up (the useless) Foch against <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did Nivelle against you in the Spring. He is a real bad 'un." [...] Haig, at the urging of Whigham (Deputy CIGS), wrote to Robertson (13 August) congratulating him at the way he had “supported the sound policy” in London, but complaining that Macdonogh’s “pessimistic estimates” of German losses might cause “many in authority to take a pessimistic outlook” whereas “a contrary view, based on equally good information (sic), would go far to help the nation on to victory”.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was {{for most people}} who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought of next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
60|$|He looked startled, {{and fixed}} a hazy eye on <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat down.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not really}} so idiotic {{as you think}} it is," [...] she said. [...] "Suppose I allowed Mr. Brent {{to make love to}} <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he's</b> very willing to do, would you be {{sufficiently}} interested to compete." ...|$|R
60|$|Traddles {{looked at}} <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> {{wondered}} what I was talking about.|$|R
60|$|My {{navigator}} threw a quick, jealous {{glance at}} <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> distrusted {{the nature of}} the question.|$|R
60|$|He {{bent forward}} again eagerly towards <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke; looking more {{inquisitive}} and more cunning than ever.|$|E
60|$|Presently he came {{opposite}} to me, and, to my dismay, paused, sniffing at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had at Nandie.|$|E
60|$|I got him the ale before I {{announced}} him. He {{winked at}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{put it to}} his lips.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dick {{secretly}} {{shook his}} head at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> thought there was no getting over this.|$|R
50|$|Bubble: Indeed I ha' no reason; {{for they}} say <b>he</b> is <b>as</b> like <b>me</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>he</b> can look.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Creakle whispered, 'Hah! What's this?' {{and bent}} his eyes upon <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> would have burnt {{me up with}} them.|$|R
60|$|With {{those words}} he {{slipped out of}} the room, and left <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had found me, in the dark.|$|E
60|$|He handcuffed <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke. Resistance was hopeless. I {{could only}} make {{an appeal to}} his mercy, on Alicia's account.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘No, sir,’ says Alick simply.—‘There’s few {{can beat}} me at a lie,’ was his {{engaging}} commentary to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> recounted the affair.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} <b>me</b> keenly <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, and I {{was aware that}} I reddened under his {{prolonged}} gaze.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn’t ha’ minded so much if it ’adn’t ha’ {{been for}} that boy. He used to pass <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>’e</b> went {{off of a}} evening, with a little sly smile on ’is ugly little face, and {{sometimes}} when I {{was standing at the}} gate he’d give a sniff or two and say that he could smell beer, and he supposed it came from the Bear’s Head.|$|R
6000|$|The Ape-man {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> {{expected}} something. I perceived the pause was interrogative. [...] "He comes {{to live with}} you," [...] I said.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{paused and}} looked at <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> paused, I felt my old self revive again more {{completely}} than ever with a rush.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thursday.--The {{bookseller}} {{has found}} a second-hand copy of the French Trials, and has sent them to <b>me</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> expresses it) 'on approval'.|$|E
6000|$|His {{head was}} thrown back, {{so that he}} looked under his {{spectacles}} at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> cried hollowly: [...] "They might have stoned you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just wot I thought, miss," [...] {{said the}} complaisant Mr. Smith; [...] "but I s'pose {{there was nobody}} else, and he wanted 'is message to go for fear you should get {{worrying}} the police about 'im or something. He wants it kep' quiet, and 'is last words to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>'e</b> left <b>me</b> was, 'If this affair gets known I shall never come back. Tell 'em to keep it quiet.'" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> {{wondered}} who on earth I was, but I am sure he saw my soul {{in my face}} and trusted me.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw his}} leg across it, and, sitting astride, he leaned his elbows {{over the back}} and glowered at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> meant to frighten me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! Call me what I am!--what {{he called}} me just now!--but do not take me away! Strike <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> struck me!--anything but parting!' ...|$|E
60|$|He shot a furtive {{glance at}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, {{and with his}} long, lean {{forefinger}} he combed his beard in a nervous fashion.|$|E
60|$|Through the beaming {{smile with}} which he {{regarded}} <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> reasoned thus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing.|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{make any}} remark, having no taste for {{conversation}} just then, but only looked at poor Marût, who lay by <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> was sleeping.|$|R
6000|$|My guide {{looked up}} benevolently at <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> felt it {{his duty to}} quiet my fears, {{and said in a}} {{soothing}} tone, [...] "O, no, no, no!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' said she; 'that {{little brown}} {{man who came}} out here and looked at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> were {{determined}} to know me {{the next time he}} saw me.' ...|$|R
