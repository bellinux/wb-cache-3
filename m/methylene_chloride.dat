Over recent years {{there have been}} increasing reports of methaemoglobinaemia related to recreational drug use. There have been 25 articles describing methaemoglobinaemia related to recreational use of volatile nitrites (poppers) and more recently, four reports of methaemoglobinaemia in association with recreational cocaine use. In this article we discuss the mechanisms by which methaemoglobinaemia occurs {{in relation to the}} use of both volatile nitrites and cocaine, and summarize the published cases of recreational drug-related methaemoglobinaemia. The volatile nitrites can cause methaemoglobinaemia directly through their activity as oxidizing agents.

40|$|In this contribution, photodiffrential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) and in situ time-resolved {{steady state}} fluorescence spectroscopy {{are used to}} study the initiation mechanism of the three-component systems: 1) <b>methylene</b> blu-methyldiethanolamine/diphenyliodonium <b>chloride</b> (MB/MDEA/DPI), 2) eosin Y/MDEA/DPI (EY/MDEA/DPI), and 3) eosin Y, spirit soluble/MDEA/DPI (EYss/MDEA/DPI). Kinetic studies reveal that the photopolymerization behavior for eosin dyes is quite similar to that observed for methylene blue. The fastest polymerization rate is obtained when all three components are present, the next fastest with the dye/amine pair, and the slowest with the dye/iodonium pair. In the MB/MDEA/DPI system, it is concluded that the primary photochemical reaction involves electron transfer from the amine to the dye. We suggest that the iodonium salt reacts with the resulting dye-based radical (which is active only for termination) to generate the original dye and simultaneously produce a phenyl radical that is active in initiation. Moreover, oxygen is found to quench the triplet state of the dye leading to retardation of the reaction. In the eosin/MDEA/DPI system, experimental {{results showed that the}} two eosin dyes function quite similarly in the three component system eosin/MDEA/DPI. We propose a sequence of steps in which the dye is rapidly oxidized by DPI in a reaction that is not highly efficient at producing initiating radicals. However, the dye may also be reduced by MDEA producing active initiating amine radicals. Another active radical may be produced if the reduced dye radical is further reduced to its leuco form by an additional molecule of amine. Additionally, the reduction of the bleached dye radical (formed via reaction with DPI) by the amine has a two fold effect. First it regenerates the original eosin dye, and second, it produces an active amine radical in place of the less active dye radical. Dual cell UV-visible absorption spectroscopy yielded no evidence for the formation of a ground state complex between the eosin dyes and the iodoniurn salt...|$|R

The rutile calcined at 1027 K exhibits the highest specific rate constants. Exposure to γ-radiation increases photocatalytic activity of the dispersed TiO 2.

40|$|During {{the course}} of study of {{reversed}} phase ion partition chromatography, {{it was observed that}} non-ionic substances such as alcohols, ester, and ketones undergo chromatographic separation in some as yet undefined association with cationic dyes (<b>methylene</b> blue <b>chloride</b> or brilliant green). Detection of non-chromophore trace level compounds has been a major problem in liquid chromatography {{due to the lack of}} a universal detector. Refractive index detector, although a universal detector lacks sensitivity. The U. V. absorbance detector is the work horse of liquid chromatography. Its major drawback is its lack of universality. It is often desirable to extend the utility of this detector to compounds toward which they are normally insensitive. This research was directed to developing the U. V. -Visible absorbance detector into a 'universal detector'. Using a mixture of methanol/water or dioxane/water solvent containing 1 x 10 ⁻⁴ M cationic dye such as the mobile phase it was shown to separate on Partisil ODS or on Zorbax ODS a series of C₂-C₅ alcohols and other neutrals at submicrogram levels with good base line separation. The alcohols carry with them some dye which must come from the presaturated dye ODS column. The dye peaks are detected spectrophotometrically at λ maximum of dye and becomes a measure of the eluting alcohol concentration. Normally, these aliphatic alcohols have a poor sensitivity either with refractive index or U. V. absorbance detector. This novel mode of detection and separation of trace quantities of alcohols and other neutral species represents a significant increase in sensitivity and should be widely applicable. The experimental data on which these separations are based, poses very interesting questions. For example, is there a specific kind of interaction between the alcohol and the dye or do the alcohols distribute between the Partisil ODS and mobile phase in their customary fashion and dissolve some of the immobilized dye because of their local excess concentration? Furthermore why do the slopes of the linear calibration curves obtained for each of the alcohols vary with the particular alcohol?
