25|$|Boulez's first {{recordings}} {{date from}} {{his time with}} the Domaine Musical in the late 1950s and early 1960s and were made for the French Vega label. They document his first thoughts on works which he would subsequently re-record (such as Varèse's Intégrales and Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No.1), as well as pieces to {{which he did not}} return in the studio (such as Stravinsky's Renard and Stockhausen's Zeitmaße). They also include two of his five recordings of Le <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (with contraltos Marie-Thérèse Cahn in 1956 and Jeanne Deroubaix in 1964). In 2015 Universal Music brought together the recordings from this period in a 10-CD set.|$|E
25|$|Born in Montbrison in the Loire {{department}} of France, {{the son of}} an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as Music Director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing {{an important role in the}} development of integral serialism and controlled chance music. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as Le <b>Marteau</b> sans maître, Pli selon pli and Répons. His commitment to the modernist project and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist, a reputation which softened in later years.|$|E

25|$|Between 1966 and 1989 he {{recorded}} for Columbia Records (later Sony Classical). Among the first projects were the Paris Wozzeck (with Walter Berry) and the Covent Garden Pelléas et Mélisande (with George Shirley and Elisabeth Söderström). He made a highly praised recording of Le Sacre du printemps with the Cleveland Orchestra {{and a number}} of recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, including rarities such as Berlioz's Lélio and the first complete recording of Mahler's Das klagende Lied. The LSO also contributed to the Webern edition which Boulez supervised, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. When he took up his posts with the New York Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras, and later the Ensemble Intercontemporain, he made most of his recordings with them. A particular focus of the Columbia years was a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg, including Gurrelieder, Moses und Aron, Erwartung and Pierrot lunaire, but also less well-known works such as Die Jakobsleiter and the unaccompanied choral music. As for Boulez's own music, there were two further recordings of Le <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (with Yvonne Minton in 1972 and Elisabeth Laurence in 1985), a first recording of Pli selon pli (with Halina Łukomska as soprano soloist) and recordings of Rituel and Éclat/Multiples. In 2014 Sony Classical issued Pierre Boulez—The Complete Columbia Album Collection on 67 CDs.|$|E
500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le <b>marteau</b> sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music".|$|E
500|$|He {{founded the}} Warsaw National Theatre, the first Polish public theatre, and {{sponsored}} {{many of its}} expenses, actors and an associated ballet school. He remodeled the Ujazdów Castle and the Royal Castle in Warsaw, and erected the elegant Royal Baths in Warsaw's most romantic park. He was deeply involved with {{the details of the}} architectural projects, and his eclectic style became known as the [...] "Stanisław Augustus style", a term coined by Polish art historian Władysław Tatarkiewicz. His chief architects included Domenico Merlini and Jan Kamsetzer. He was also a patron of numerous painters, many of them on personal retainer. They included Poles Anna Rajecka, Franciszek Smuglewicz, Jan Bogumił Plersch, Józef Wall and Zygmunt Vogel, as well as foreign painters, namely Marceli Bacciarelli, Bernardo Canalatto, Jean Pillement, Ludwik <b>Marteau</b> and Per Krafft the Elder. His retinue of sculptors was led by Andrzej Le Brun, and included Giacomo Monaldi, Franciszek Pinck and Tommaso Righi. Jan Filip Holzhaeusser was his court engraver and designer of many commemorative medals. According to a 1795 inventory, his art collection, spread throughout numerous buildings, contained 2,889 pieces, including ones by Rembrandt, Rubens, van Dyck and others. His plan to create a large painting gallery in Warsaw was interrupted by the dismembering of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth; nonetheless, most of the paintings he ordered can now be seen at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. Poniatowski also planned to fund an Academy of Fine Arts, but this dream was also never realized.|$|E

In the late 20th century, modernist and contemporary composers found new ways to use marimba: notable examples include Leoš Janáček (Jenufa), Carl Orff (Antigonae), Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Hans Werner Henze (Elegy for Young Lovers), Pierre Boulez (Le <b>marteau</b> sans maître) and Steve Reich.|$|E
2500|$|At the ISCM Festival in Baden-Baden on 18 June 1955, after fifty rehearsals, Hans Rosbaud {{conducted}} the first performance of Boulez's best-known work, Le <b>Marteau</b> sans maître. A nine-movement cycle for alto voice and instrumental ensemble based on poems by René Char, {{it was an}} immediate, international success. William Glock wrote: [...] "even at a first hearing, though difficult to take in, it was so utterly new in sound, texture and feeling {{that it seemed to}} possess a mythical quality like that of Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some music {{theorists have}} criticized {{serialism}} {{on the basis}} that the compositional strategies employed are often incompatible with the way information is extracted by the human mind from a piece of music. Nicolas Ruwet (1959) {{was one of the first}} to criticise serialism through a comparison with linguistic structures, citing theoretical claims by Boulez and Henri Pousseur, and taking as specific examples bars from Stockhausen's Klavierstücke I & II, and calling for a general re-examination of Webern's music. Ruwet specifically names three works as exempt from his criticism: Stockhausen's Zeitmaße and Gruppen, and Boulez's Le <b>marteau</b> sans maître [...]|$|E
2500|$|Boulez's strongest {{achievement}} in {{this method is}} Le <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (The Hammer without a Master, 1953–55), a [...] "keystone of 20th-century music". Three short poems by René Char form the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (Bel Édifice et les pressentiments is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring. The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, xylorimba, vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, {{to which he had}} always been attracted.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "striptease" [...] {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1938, though [...] "stripping", {{in the sense}} of women removing clothing to sexually excite men, seems to go back at least 400 years. [...] For example, in Thomas Otway's comedy The Soldier's Fortune (1681) a character says: [...] "Be sure they be lewd, drunken, stripping whores". [...] Its combination with music seems to be as old. [...] A conclusive description and visualization {{can be found in the}} 1720 German translation of the French La Guerre D'Espagne (Cologne: Pierre <b>Marteau,</b> 1707), where a galant party of high aristocrats and opera singers has resorted to a small château where they entertain themselves with hunting, play and music in a three-day turn: ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Marteau's</b> {{research}} specialism is the [...] "development {{and evaluation}} of interventions to change behaviour (principally diet, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption) to improve population health and reduce health inequalities, with a particular focus on targeting non conscious processes." ...|$|R
60|$|Quite {{unconscious}} of his danger, bruin {{continued to}} reach {{down into the}} vat with unwearied determination. His efforts were rewarded with success, for he presently appeared {{on the edge of}} the vat with a fine salmon in his embrace. Now was Jack's opportunity. He raised his piece, but remembering <b>Marteau's</b> remark about the bear's difficulty in eating salt salmon, he postponed the fatal shot until he should have studied this point in natural history.|$|R
2500|$|Later {{writers have}} {{continued}} both lines of reasoning. Fred Lerdahl, for example, outlines Ruwet's subject further {{in his essay}} [...] "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems" [...] Lehrdahl has in turn been criticized for excluding [...] "the possibility of other, non-hierarchical methods of achieving musical coherence," [...] and for concentrating on the audibility of tone rows , and the portion of his essay focussing on Boulez's [...] "multiplication" [...] technique (exemplified in three movements of Le <b>Marteau</b> sans maître) has been challenged on perceptual grounds by Stephen Heinemann (1998) and Ulrich [...] Ruwet's critique has also been criticised for making [...] "the fatal mistake of equating visual presentation (a score) with auditive presentation (the music as heard)" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{graduation}} in 1911, Georgescu {{moved to}} Berlin, having unexpectedly won {{a grant to}} study there through his performance in a recital at the Romanian Athenaeum. [...] He enrolled in the Berlin Hochschule für Musik and continued his studies of cello with the prominent cellist Hugo Becker, as well as entering into studies of composition and conducting. [...] Becker, much sought as a teacher, was reluctant at first, but in time, through Georgescu's persistence, recognized that Georgescu had the makings of an unusually fine, if not yet sufficiently disciplined, cellist. [...] Later, Georgescu would credit Becker {{as the most important}} formative influence in his musical development. [...] Georgescu began his professional career soon thereafter, replacing Becker in 1910 as cellist in the <b>Marteau</b> Quartet. [...] He performed throughout Europe with this group for the next four years.|$|E

German machine-guns to the east, in the [...] strong points and Bois en V, on the west slope of Mont Sans Nom, fired into the flank of the French attack {{and the rest of}} the day was spent capturing the German defences in these areas. The 20th Regiment captured redoubts around Bois du Chien, after fighting all day and then began preparing a dawn attack Le Casque. The 45th Division attacked Mont Blond, by advancing between the Prosnes–Nauroy track, Bois de la Mitrailleuse and Bois <b>Marteau,</b> to the south-east of Mont Perthois but was held up in the evening of 17 April, at the , which lay on the road from Prosnes, at the junction with the Nauroy–Moronvilliers road, midway between Mont Blond and Mont Haut.|$|E
