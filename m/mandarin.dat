5000|$|... ”I {{think my}} colleagues in {{theology}} and exegesis {{are open to the}} charge that they have become <b>mandarins,</b> who speak only to other <b>mandarins</b> about topics which are of interest only to <b>mandarins</b> in a style of discourse which is gibberish to any except <b>mandarins,</b> and one sometimes wonders about them too. Scholarship is and ought to be a form of public service and not an expensive enterprise dedicated to the production of a few more <b>mandarins</b> who can spend a leisurely life in the production of other mandarins”.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mandarins</b> (Les <b>Mandarins)</b> is a 1954 roman à clef by Simone de Beauvoir, {{for which}} she won the Prix Goncourt, awarded to {{the best and most}} imaginative prose work of the year, in 1954. The <b>Mandarins</b> was first {{published}} in English in 1956 (in a translation by Leonard M. Friedman).|$|R
5|$|In 1882 Stowe {{purchased}} {{a plot of}} land in <b>Mandarin</b> on the St. Johns to build the <b>Mandarin</b> Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left <b>Mandarin</b> forever {{to spend the rest}} of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the <b>Mandarin</b> church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination with plants and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across. She died in 1896.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mandarin</b> square: <b>Mandarin</b> squares {{were large}} {{embroidered}} badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam. It was embroidered with detailed, colourful animal or bird insignia indicating {{the rank of}} the official wearing it. <b>Mandarin</b> squares were first authorized for wear in 1391 by the Ming Dynasty. The use of squares depicting birds for civil officials and animals for military officials was {{an outgrowth of the}} use of similar squares, apparently for decorative use, in the Yuan Dynasty. The original court dress regulations of the Ming Dynasty were published in 1368, but did not refer to badges as rank insignia.|$|E
5|$|Outside Taiwan, POJ {{is rarely}} used. For example, in Fujian, Xiamen University uses a romanization known as Bbánlám pìngyīm, based on Pinyin. In other areas where Hokkien is spoken, such as Singapore, the Speak <b>Mandarin</b> Campaign is {{underway}} to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non-Mandarin varieties {{in favour of}} switching to <b>Mandarin</b> instead.|$|E

50|$|Because of his preaching, the <b>Mandarins</b> {{wanted to}} imprison him {{because some of}} the local Chinese disliked foreign {{religious}} beliefs. Soon, his son was captured by the <b>Mandarins</b> and died in 1813. Zhang Dapeng heard of his son's death and fled to Sichuan. Finally, Zhang Dapeng was captured and was imprisoned in the year 1814. On 12 March 1815, Zhang Dapeng was killed by the <b>Mandarins</b> at the age of 61.|$|R
50|$|Amaral also placed stricter {{controls}} on the lorcha traffic and {{tried to stop the}} <b>mandarins</b> from collecting customary dues from the Tanka people who lived on boats in the harbour, since Macau was a free port. The <b>mandarins</b> retained two customs houses, one at the Inner Harbour (Praia Pequena) and one at the Outer Harbour (Praia Grande). They refused to close them at Amaral's request, so on 5 March he proclaimed them closed. The <b>mandarins</b> still did not budge and, on 13 March, they were forcibly expelled. Amaral informed the <b>mandarins</b> of Zhongshan that if they ever visited Macau they would be received as foreign dignitaries.|$|R

5|$|Years later, {{six months}} after the Battle of New York, Stark's {{experiences}} during the alien invasion are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the <b>Mandarin</b> has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in a <b>Mandarin</b> attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the <b>Mandarin,</b> who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack along with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the <b>Mandarin.</b> Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.|$|E
50|$|Like all citrus fruit, <b>mandarins</b> {{hybridize}} readily {{with other}} citrus. Many fruit sold as <b>mandarins</b> {{are in fact}} hybrids with some pummelo (C. maxima) ancestry, and are thus on a continuum with clementines, sweet and sour oranges, and grapefruit.|$|R
5000|$|Pure <b>mandarins</b> seem {{to divide}} into two groups; an edible group, {{including}} the Nanfengmiju, and an [...] "acidic" [...] group, which is too sour to be edible {{but which is}} widely used as rootstock and grown for juice; this includes Sunki, Shekwasha, and Cleopatra <b>mandarins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mandarin's White Light Ring {{approached}} Mole Man {{in order}} to help it and the other rings have revenge on Tony Stark where he became Mandarin-Six. Mole Man and the other <b>Mandarins</b> later travelled to Svartalfheim {{in order to}} confront Malekith the Accursed, who had hunted down other three <b>Mandarins</b> and had taken their rings from them. The <b>Mandarins</b> thwarted any attempt of Malekith to hide or flee, as the rings could locate each other. Malekith made a pact with Iron Man (who was also at the time in Svartalfheim to retrieve the rings) disposed of his ring and escaped to safely, as he could no longer be tracked. Following their failure to kill Malekith, the <b>Mandarins</b> resumed their own paths. The <b>Mandarins</b> joined forces once more to help Mole Man's plan to create ring-powered weapons with which destroy cities from their base in Sinister London. A test was thwarted by the Fantastic Four. Before they could release one of the actual machines, Iron Man pinned them down along with the Trojan Guard and Abigail Burns. The <b>Mandarins</b> failed to escape as Iron Man's ally Dark Angel used magic to prevent them from teleporting. After the other Mandarin's are defeated, Mole Man's ring declared him the Prime-Mandarin. Instead, Mole Man abandoned his ring and retreated.|$|R

5|$|Born into {{a family}} of <b>mandarins</b> from Hà Tĩnh Province, Phan {{continued}} his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor Tự Đức of the Nguyễn Dynasty, gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position {{that allowed him to}} criticise his fellow <b>mandarins</b> and even the emperor. As the head of the censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt <b>mandarins.</b>|$|R

5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to <b>Mandarin</b> learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both <b>Mandarin</b> and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in <b>Mandarin.</b> This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E

5|$|Four major Chinese-speech {{groups are}} {{represented}} in Indonesia: Hokkien, <b>Mandarin,</b> Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree of mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 <b>Mandarin</b> speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E

40|$|The Mediterranean {{fruit fly}} (Medfly), Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) is a pest of citrus {{in parts of}} Western Australia. Three citrus cultivars: Valencia oranges, Eureka lemons and Imperial <b>mandarins,</b> as well as non-citrus control fruits, were {{examined}} for attractiveness and suitability to Medfly {{in the field and}} in the laboratory using choice and no-choice experiments. Oranges were more susceptible to Medfly than <b>mandarins</b> and lemons. Punctures in the skin {{had a significant impact on}} the degree of infestation in both citrus and non-citrus control fruit. Artificial infestation and larval survivorship were used to investigate the suitability of each cultivar to Medfly under laboratory conditions. Oranges and <b>mandarins</b> were suitable for the development of Medfly, but lemons were a poor host. When each cultivar was in season, field cage trials demonstrated that infestation occurred in oranges and <b>mandarins</b> but not in lemons...|$|R

5|$|Killian has {{manipulated}} American {{intelligence agencies}} regarding the Mandarin's location, luring James Rhodes– the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot– {{into a trap}} to steal the armor. With Harley's help, Stark traces the <b>Mandarin</b> to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the <b>Mandarin</b> is actually an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who says he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real <b>Mandarin,</b> using Slattery as a cover. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, {{in order to gain}} Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts. Killian kills Hansen when she has a change of heart and tries to stop him.|$|E
