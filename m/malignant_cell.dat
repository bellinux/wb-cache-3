500|$|The <b>malignant</b> <b>cell</b> in AML is the {{myeloblast}}. In normal hematopoiesis, the myeloblast is an immature {{precursor of}} myeloid white blood cells; a normal myeloblast will gradually mature into a mature white blood cell. In AML, though, a single myeloblast accumulates genetic changes which [...] "freeze" [...] the cell in its immature state and prevent differentiation. Such a mutation {{alone does not}} cause leukemia; however, when such a [...] "differentiation arrest" [...] is combined with other mutations which disrupt genes controlling proliferation, {{the result is the}} uncontrolled growth of an immature clone of cells, leading to the clinical entity of AML.|$|E

30|$|PET–CT has {{the ability}} to measure the avidity of <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> by glucose, since the {{intracellular}} transport of glucose labeled with 18 -FDG ([18 F] Fluoro- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose) is higher in <b>malignant</b> <b>cells.</b> The low permeability of the membrane limits the back-diffusion of FDG during the examination, keeping the FDG within the <b>malignant</b> <b>cells,</b> which allows for their detection (Schulte et al. 1999).|$|R

500|$|The {{principal}} medicinal {{difference between}} astatine-211 and iodine-131 (a radioactive iodine isotope {{also used in}} medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high-energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70µm through surrounding tissues; an average-energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2mm. The short half-life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the [...] "tumor burden is low and/or <b>malignant</b> <b>cell</b> populations are located {{in close proximity to}} essential normal tissues." [...] Significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine-211 atoms bound per cell.|$|E
500|$|Further {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} acute myeloid leukemia occurred rapidly with the development of new technology. In 1877, Paul Ehrlich developed a technique of staining blood films which allowed him to describe in detail normal and abnormal white blood cells. Wilhelm Ebstein introduced the term [...] "acute leukemia" [...] in 1889 to differentiate rapidly progressive and fatal leukemias from the more indolent chronic leukemias. The term [...] "myeloid" [...] was coined by Franz Ernst Christian Neumann in 1869, as {{he was the first to}} recognize white blood cells were made in the bone marrow (Greek: µυєλός, myelos = (bone) marrow) as opposed to the spleen. The technique of bone marrow examination to diagnose leukemia was first described in 1879 by Mosler. Finally, in 1900, the myeloblast, which is the <b>malignant</b> <b>cell</b> in AML, was characterized by Otto Naegeli, who divided the leukemias into myeloid and lymphocytic.|$|E
500|$|Biologically, Hsp90A {{differs from}} Hsp90B in that Hsp90A is {{presently}} understood {{to function as}} a secreted extracellular agent in wound healing and inflammation in addition to its intracellular roles. These two processes are often hijacked by cancer allowing for <b>malignant</b> <b>cell</b> motility, metastasis and extravasion. [...] Current research in prostate cancer indicates that extracellular Hsp90A transduces signals that promote the chronic inflammation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. [...] This reprogramming of the extracellular milieu surrounding malignant adenocarcinoma cells is understood to stimulate prostate cancer progression. [...] Extracellular HSP90A induces inflammation through the activation of the NF-κB (RELA) and STAT3 transcription programs that include the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. [...] Coincidentally NF-κB also induces expression Hsp90A., thus providing a model where newly expressed Hsp90A would also be secreted from the stimulated fibroblast thereby creating positive autocrine and paracrine feedback loops resulting in an inflammatory storm at the site of malignancy. [...] This concept requires further attention as it may explain the correlation of increased levels of Hsp90A in the plasma of patients with advanced stages of malignancy.|$|E

2500|$|Autologous HSCT {{requires}} the extraction (apheresis) of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) {{from the patient}} and storage of the harvested cells in a freezer. The patient is then treated with high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy {{with the intention of}} eradicating the patient's <b>malignant</b> <b>cell</b> population at the cost of partial or complete bone marrow ablation (destruction of patient's bone marrow's ability to grow new blood cells). [...] The patient's own stored stem cells are then transfused into his/her bloodstream, where they replace destroyed tissue and resume the patient's normal blood cell production. Autologous transplants have the advantage of lower risk of infection during the immune-compromised portion of the treatment since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of patients experiencing rejection (and graft-versus-host disease is impossible) is very rare due to the donor and recipient being the same individual. These advantages have established autologous HSCT as one of the standard second-line treatments for such diseases as lymphoma.|$|E
2500|$|An {{increased}} risk of HPV+OPC is observed more than 15 years after HPV exposure, pointing to a slow development of the disease, similar to that seen in cervical cancer. Relative to HPV-OPC, the oncogenic molecular progression of HPV+OPC is poorly understood. [...] The two main viral oncoproteins of the high risk HPV types are E6 and E7. These are consistently expressed in <b>malignant</b> <b>cell</b> lines, and if their expression is inhibited the malignant phenotype of the cancer cells is blocked. Either of these oncoproteins can immortalise cell lines, but are more efficient when both are expressed, since their separate molecular roles are synergistic. The E6 and E7 oncogenes become integrated into host-cell DNA, and the oncoproteins they express interfere {{with a variety of}} predominantly antiproliferative cellular regulatory mechanisms. They bind to and inactivate the best known of these mechanisms, the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and retinoblastoma protein pRB (pRb) leading to genomic instability and then cell cycle deregulation (see Chung et al., 2016 Fig. 35.2). Further, yet to be elicited, mechanisms are required for the final steps of malignant transformation of HPV infected cells.|$|E

40|$|In vitro {{study of}} the {{interaction}} of macrophages with lymphocytes {{has led to an}} abundance of reports in which macrophages are said to exert either stimulatory or inhibitory influences (1 - 4; additional references cited in 5).

40|$|Detection of <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> from <b>malignant</b> {{effusion}} {{is crucial}} to establish or adjust therapies of patients with cancer. The conventional qualitative detection in malignant pleuroperitoneal effusion is cytological analysis, which is time-consuming and complicated. Therefore, a faster and more convenient detection strategy is urgently needed. In this study, we report a rapid method to detect <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> from <b>malignant</b> pleuroperitoneal effusion (hydrothorax and ascites) of patients using IR- 808, a tumor-targeted near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent heptamethine dye (tNRI dye), which exhibited superior labeling efficacy without specific conjugation to biomarkers. The targeted imaging performance toward <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> using IR- 808 was confirmed by comparing with normal cells, and the fluorescence stability assay of IR- 808 in malignant effusion was performed from 1 h to 48 h. In order to save time and dose, the incubation time and concentration were optimized to 10 min and 5 mu M, which were used to detect <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> from 28 clinical samples of malignant pleuroperitoneal effusion. The results revealed that IR- 808 could be internalized selectively by <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> of samples, and these <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> could be easily distinguished from normal cells under a fluorescence microscope. The positive rates between cytological analysis and the IR- 808 staining method were 86 % (24 / 28) and 79 % (22 / 28), respectively. An excellent concordance level (Kappa = 0. 752, P < 0. 001) was observed between the two methods.

40|$|Bacterial toxins {{including}} {{staphylococcal enterotoxins}} (SEs) have {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs). Here, we investigate SE-mediated interactions between nonmalignant T <b>cells</b> and <b>malignant</b> T-cell lines established from skin and blood of CTCL patients. The <b>malignant</b> CTCL <b>cells</b> express MHC class II molecules that are high-affinity receptors for SE. Although treatment with SE has no direct effect on {{the growth of the}} <b>malignant</b> CTCL <b>cells,</b> the SE-treated CTCL cells induce vigorous proliferation of the SE-responsive nonmalignant T cells. In turn, the nonmalignant T cells enhance proliferation of the <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> in an SE- and MHC class II–dependent manner. Furthermore, SE and, in addition, alloantigen presentation by <b>malignant</b> CTCL <b>cells</b> to irradiated nonmalignant CD 4 + T-cell lines also enhance proliferation of the <b>malignant</b> <b>cells.</b> The growth-promoting effect depends on direct cell-cell contact and soluble factors such as interleukin- 2.

40|$|Summary. -Normal and {{neoplastic}} {{cells from}} 4 species (man, rat, mouse and hamster) were examined for {{their dependence on}} exogenous L-arginine in tissue culture. The <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> required a higher concentration of L-arginine in the medium than their normal counterparts (with similar doubling times) to maintain optimal proliferation. Complete arginine deprivation resulted in equal growth inhibition of normal and <b>malignant</b> <b>cells,</b> but more rapid cytolysis of the <b>malignant</b> <b>cells.</b> Deprivation of L-arginine, followed 24 h later by rescue with L-arginine, allowed normal cells to proliferate, but the reproductive capacity of the <b>malignant</b> <b>cells</b> was irreversibly impaired. Since the cytotoxic activity of LPS-activated macrophages {{was associated with the}} release of arginase and was abrogated by excess L-arginine, it is suggested that the biological basis for the selective effects of such macrophages may reside in the L-arginine dependence of the target cells.
