Lately, sulphur emissions from the maritime industry have come under scrutiny and new regulations has come into effect. SECA 2015 is a sensitive area consisting of North Sea, Baltic Sea and English Channel and regulates the sulphur content in fuels to maximum 0, 1 percent in <b>marine</b> <b>fuels.</b> SECA 2015 is the start of an era with new regulations and directives to be implemented in the future.

The thesis is based on literature from different sources and three semi-structured interviews with the refineries Preem AB and St 1 and also with the customized consulting company Maritime-Insight. The result indicates that the two refineries in Sweden were very well prepared for SECA 2015 and that the price- and market impact was manageable. However, it will require a well-formulated strategy and a long-term plan for the future to meet the global directives.

40|$|In 1999 a {{decision}} was made that would prove to have dramatic consequences over a decade later. The decision was made by the Council of the European Union, and addresses the issue concerning sulphur content in <b>marine</b> <b>fuels.</b> In 2015, the maximum sulphur content allowed in <b>marine</b> <b>fuels</b> within the European sulphur emission controlled area (SECA) will be lowered from the current limit of 1. 0 % to 0. 1 %. To comply, shipping companies are burdened with dramatic cost increases, derived from either switching to cleaner fuel or new technology investments. By combining a theoretical framework with a case study, this thesis will investigate the possibility to compensate the increased costs, associated with using cleaner fuel, by utilizing the concept of slow steaming. Although very difficult to attain exact data to calculate the economic effect of slow steaming, good estimations can be achieved and the theoretical result indicates that a 10 - 15 % reduction in cruise speed could compensate for 50 - 80 % the increased costs. There are however several factors which complicate an implementation of slow steaming, these factors will be discussed in the thesis. MSc in Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|R

The study also includes a synthesis of knowledge on alternative <b>marine</b> <b>fuels.</b> Liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas and biomass based methanol (NG-MeOH, Bio-MeOH) as well as renewable energy based hydrogen are included. Ten different criteria spanning over economic, technical, environmental and social aspects are considered e. g., fuel price, operational cost, fuel supply, climate change, acidification and safety. As a common group the stakeholders put economic criteria highest, followed by social, environmental and technical criteria. The ranking of the fuels differs somewhat between the four different stakeholder groups. Renewable hydrogen followed by Bio-MeOH or LNG is the most preferred fuel for all groups and NG-MeOH the least preferred - except for the ship owners where LNG is most preferred.

In this study the environmental performance of two potential future <b>marine</b> <b>fuels,</b> methanol and dimethyl ether (DME), are evaluated and compared to present and possible future <b>marine</b> <b>fuels.</b> Methanol and DME produced from natural gas was shown to be associated with a larger energy use and slightly more emissions of greenhouse gases in the life cycle when compared to HFO, MGO and LNG. Use of methanol and DME results in significantly lower impact when considering the impact categories particulate matter, photochemical ozone formation, acidification and eutrophication compared to HFO and MGO without any exhaust abatement technologies and of the same order of magnitude as for LNG.
