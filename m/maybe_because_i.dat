She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I think <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|E

5000|$|In {{the concept}} album La buona novella (The Good News) (1970), De André {{gives us the}} {{ultimate}} expression of his religious vision, making a clear humanization of the divine. In a 1998 concert at the Teatro Brancaccio in Rome, De André made the following statements about the album: When I wrote La buona novella it was 1969. At {{the time we were}} in the very middle of the students' protests, and less attentive people, which are always the majority among us - comrades, friends, people of the same age as me - regarded that record as anachronistic. They told me: [...] "What's this? We go fighting inside universities and outside universities against abuses, and you instead tell us the story, which moreover we already know, of Jesus Christ's preachings?" [...] And they did not realize that the Good News was meant to be an allegory, it was an allegory that consisted in a comparison between the better and more sensible instances of the revolt of '68, and some instances, certainly higher from a spiritual point of view, but similar from an ethical-social point of view, raised by a gentleman, 1969 years before, against the abuses of power, against the abuses of authority, in the name of egalitarianism and universal brotherhood. That man was called Jesus of Nazareth. And I think he was, and remains, the greatest revolutionary of all time. When I wrote the album I didn't want to venture into roads or paths that would be difficult for me to travel on, such as metaphysics or even theology, first of all because I don't understand anything about those, secondly because I always thought that if God did not exist we should invent Him, which is exactly what Man has done ever since he set foot on Earth. [...] Probably the characters in La buona novella lose a bit of sacralization, but I think, and I hope, particularly to the benefit of their better and greater humanization. [...] The attitude taken by De André against the political use of religion and the Church hierarchy is often sarcastic and highly critical about their contradictory behaviour, such as, for example, in the songs Un blasfemo, Il testamento di Tito, La ballata del Miché and the last verses of Bocca di rosa. I feel myself religious, and my religion is to feel part of a whole, in a chain that includes all creation and so to respect all elements, including plants and minerals, because, in my opinion, the balance is exactly given from the well-being in our surroundings. My religion does not seek the principle, {{you want to call it}} creator, regulator or chaos makes no difference. But I think that everything around us has its own logic and this is a thought to which I turn when I'm in difficulty, perhaps giving the names I've learned as a child, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> lack the imagination to find out other ones. [...] After the kidnapping, the religious vision of De André had a new development; While I was abducted, it helped me to find faith in men, just where there wasn't faith in God. I have always said that God is a human invention, something utilitarian, a patch on the fragility ... But, however, with the kidnapping something has changed. I've not changed my mind, but it is certain that today swearing at least embarrasses me.|$|E

40|$|Age {{and lack}} of time was a {{constant}} problem for my family and a personal concern for myself growing up, <b>maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am {{the only person in}} my family under the age of 55. Lack of energy became neglect for my family’s 142 -year-old farm and 40 -year-old tire business. Growing up, I became all too familiar with visions of decay in what once had been a thriving place of growth and order. My aging family’s lack of energy was a main ingredient in the state of decay but economic flux and failure {{to keep up with the}} times were also to blame. Witnessing this decline planted a seed of desire to see progress and a way out from the current state of things. “Ad-hocism” and off-the-cuff construction using materials that were readily at hand to solve utilitarian problems became a wellspring of inspiration and creative opportunity for me. Growing up, fences, roofs, mailbox stands, gate latches, and feed troughs name but a few of the things made from old tires I found; from tarps made from inter-tubes to chairs made of steel wheels, the list could go on. As an artist, I continue the essence of my family’s ingenuity combined with my physical and mental need to improve and build. In some of my recent sculptures, I make use of tire parts linked and woven into forms that simultaneously seem to be on the verge of falling apart while having a noticeable structural integrity. I hope to portray to the viewer a foretaste of the atmosphere from which the resources came and a sense that a new possibility for the materials is being found. The idea of struggle and acceptance of limitations and failures in the construction process can be seen in my work and serve as important references to the reality of what is possible as I quest for new possibilities. These intentions spill over into my ceramic work with the tower-like forms built from loops of clay, mimicking the shape of tires. Juxtaposing play, structure, and defiance against forces that overwhelmingly oppose their creation is a goal of mine. I strive to create works that have an open ending or a kind of ambiguous existence, leaving the viewer free to impose their own narrative on the forms. As guiding rails to that narrative, I implant elements of hope, somberness, playfulness, and urgency. An influence on this approach is historic Cabinets of Curiosity that speak on the nature of wonder and humanities desire to both understand and not know. Indeed wonder is very often found in the things we feel a kind of connection to without having an understanding. Alwyn O’Brien‘s ceramic work has also been an influence of mine in terms of its playfulness, fragility and urgency. Sterling Ruby and Leonardo Drew are also large influences on my work due to the raw and unkempt aesthetic of their sculptures along with conceptual themes of masculinity and its fragility.

40|$|I got {{my first}} camera when I was in third grade—a Brownie Hawkeye flash model with a snazzy little camera case. The {{instruction}} manual provided six simple steps for taking successful pictures. Hold the camera steady, supporting it underneath. Then, with the sun behind your back or over your shoulder, locate the subject in the finder. At the instant of exposure, hold your breath and press the shutter release with a gentle squeezing action (Brownie Hawkeye Instruction Manual). The camera came with two rolls of film, each with 16 frames. I eagerly used them up and sent the exposed film off for developing and printing. <b>Maybe</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn’t hold my breath or squeeze the shutter release quite gently enough—I don’t know—but when the prints came back, I had (according to the manual) “fumbles”: double-exposures, complete blurs, specks on the images, a few close-ups of my finger or the camera strap, and plenty of shots where the subject was cut-off. I did have pictures, but not one that was good. Cameras now are nothing like my Brownie Hawkeye, but if you still point and shoot like I do, you have surely noticed that the beautiful sunset you see with your own eyes is nothing like the digital image you end up with. That’s because creating breathtaking photography {{is up to the}} photographers who are, in the words of Ansel Adams, blazing the poetry of the real (1930) – using shadow and light, focus, compositional elements, perspective, texture, and tone to illuminate what we see (and sometimes don’t see). For the longest time, we have used a point and shoot mentality in writing, too. You remember [...] . follow the directions for writing a paper, hold your breath when you turn it in, then get it back in a few days with your “fumbles” clearly marked in red pen. Think about it. How much better would your writing have been if you had known how to create the illusion of motion or sound, manipulate the volume or inflection in a reader’s voice, make the reader your accomplice, or persuade her to think like you? That is the work of writing after all—to hold its own {{in the absence of the}} author, blazing the real of time and space. Knowing how to write well is not just the province of published authors anymore. It can’t be—too much is at stake. Workshop teachers take seriously this call to action, teaching the qualities of good writing every single day. In Blazing the Real, their students demonstrate that good writing comes from a deeper understanding of craft, of what writers know and do. These young writers understand that very specific, tangible details help them effectively express big, sometimes abstract concepts. They understand the power of creating intimacy with a reader by using second-person address. They understand that reflecting on topics immediately relevant to their own lives, stirs emotions that resonate broadly. And, they even understand how to manipulate the conventions of writing to provoke their audiences to respond in particular, intended ways. Breathe in the beauty of Blazing the Real—the splendor of meticulously crafted photographs inspired by the writing in each of four chapters, the artistry of language both written and drawn that is influenced by the work of real writers. And know, we are a very long way from point and shoot. -Susan C. Adamson[URL]...|$|E
