25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail,</b> which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve {{made up of a}} skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} three or four hours' sail Geoffrey and Lionel {{acquired}} much nautical knowledge. They learned {{the difference between the}} mainmast and the mizzen, found that all the strong ropes that kept the masts erect and stiff were called stays, that the ropes that hoist sails are called halliards, and that sheets is the name given to the ropes that restrain the sails at the lower corner, and are used to haul them in more tightly when sailing close to the wind, or to ease them off when the wind is favourable. They also learned that the yards {{at the head of the}} main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>sails</b> are called gaffs, and those at the bottom, booms.|$|R
5000|$|Victory Chimes {{was built}} at Bethel, Delaware in 1900 by George K. Phillips Co. She was named Edwin and Maud after the {{children}} of her first Captain, Robert E. Riggen.The traditional [...] "ram" [...] rig was a standing jib, flying jib, staysail (also called a forestaysail), foresail, mainsail and spanker (or mizzen), which Victory Chimes carries today. The heads of the fore, main and <b>mizzen</b> <b>sails</b> are supported by gaffs and the feet are laced to booms ... The standing rigging is steel wire. Standing rigging was minimal on rams, to enable deck cargo to be stowed on uncluttered decks.She was designed to carry general cargo in the Chesapeake Bay. She was built with a centerboard, and a shallow draft for work in the Bay. Her centerboard, replaced in 1965, [...] "draws 7 feet 6 inches with the centerboard up and 18 feet with the centerboard down." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ketches {{are similar}} to a sloop, {{but there is a}} second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the rudder post. The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail.</b> A ketch can also be [...] with two head sails.|$|E

Her current sails are a jib, foresail, mainsail and topsail on the mainmast, and a <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> on the mizzen-mast aft. Initially engined in 1943, she has been powered since 1980 by a Ford diesel. more recently the barge has been fitted with a bowsprit.|$|E
2500|$|Buller went ashore {{during the}} Peace of Amiens, and was elected as Member of Parliament for East Looe in 1802, {{but with the}} {{outbreak}} of hostilities again in 1803, {{was appointed to the}} 80-gun [...] and employed in the blockade of the French and Spanish Atlantic ports. He was made a Colonel of Marines on 28 April 1805, and was assigned to the fleet under Sir Robert Calder and took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. During the battle Buller found himself isolated {{from the rest of the}} fleet due to the patchy fog and failing light, and was surrounded by five enemy ships. He fought them off, forcing the Spanish 84-gun San Rafael to strike, and afterwards sending the Maltas boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun Firme. Malta had suffered considerably during the battle, having her mizzen top mast and <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> yard shot away, and her mizzen and main masts damaged. Her rigging and sails were cut up, with her casualties amounting to five dead and forty wounded.|$|E
50|$|The large {{fore-and-aft sail}} on the {{mainmast}} is the mainsail, while the <b>sail</b> on the <b>mizzen</b> mast is the <b>mizzen.</b> These <b>sails</b> may be {{any type of}} fore-and-aft sail, in any combination. Most modern ketches are Bermuda rigged, but other possible rigs on a ketch include gunter rigs and gaff rigs. The Scots Zulu, for example, had a dipping lug main with a standing lug mizzen.|$|R
50|$|Sailing Fifies had two masts {{with the}} {{standard}} rig consisting of a main dipping lug <b>sail</b> and a <b>mizzen</b> standing lug <b>sail.</b> The masts were positioned far forward and aft on the boat to give the maximum clear working space amidships. A large fifie could reach just over 20 metres in length. Because of their large sail area they were very fast sailing boats.|$|R
50|$|Built by J. & G. Forbes of Sandhaven in 1901, she is 21 metres {{long and}} of carvel construction, using larch {{planking}} on larch and oak frames. First registered at Fraserburgh in 1902, she operated initially as a sailing lugger with a main dipping lug <b>sail</b> and a <b>mizzen</b> standing lug <b>sail.</b> There {{would have been}} a crew of around eight to work the nets which were set at dusk and hauled in at dawn. Once the haul was complete, a swift return to port would ensure the best prices for the earliest-sold catches.|$|R
2500|$|The Portuguese {{were able}} {{to fend off the}} smaller crafts with hand grenades, but they made little effect on the {{floating}} tower, which grappled the poop deck. Up to this point the Portuguese casualties had been few, with only four or five Portuguese along with a few Africans and lascars killed, while the Japanese dead were estimated at several hundred. However, six hours into the fighting, a shot from the tower-junk hit a fire pot that a Portuguese soldier was about to throw, smashing it onto the gunpowder at his feet. This started a conflagration that spread through the deck and set the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> ablaze. Pessoa and his men retreated to the forecastle, where they realized {{that they did not have}} enough men to simultaneously fight the fire and the Japanese boarders. At this point Pessoa ordered the ship's magazine to be set on fire since he would rather die than surrender. When the ship's purser hesitated, Pessoa cast away his sword and shield and picked up a crucifix, then he exclaimed: [...] "Blessed be thou, oh Lord, since thou willest that all this should end!" [...] He then told his crew to save themselves as he went down to start the fire himself. The Nossa Senhora da Graça then blew up in two successive explosions, split into two, and sank with cargo, crew, and boarders alike. The Japanese killed all they could see swimming in the water, but a few survivors made it onto the shore to safety. André Pessoa's body, however, was never found.|$|E

[...] Geoffrey exclaimed, [...] "Master Lirriper's {{going to}} London in a ketch -- a ship {{with a big}} <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail,</b> you know -- and he has offered to take us with him and show us London. And father has said yes, and it's all settled {{if you have no}} objection; and of course you haven't." ...|$|E
50|$|A lugger is a two-masted vessel, {{with for}} each mast a sail plan {{similar to a}} gaff rig. The lug sails it uses, however, do not have gaffs, that attach {{directly}} to its masts. Instead, the spars are allowed to move forward and aft of the mast and are managed {{through a series of}} lines that attach to the yards and to the corners of the sails. Each sail {{may or may not have}} a boom along its foot. In Scotland, when constructed with a main dipping lug <b>sail</b> and a <b>mizzen</b> standing lug <b>sail,</b> such vessels are known as fifies, sailing fifies, or herring drifters; they were often used for herring fishing.|$|R
60|$|The {{boat was}} {{provided}} with a light mast, which could be stepped or unstepped at pleasure, {{and there were two}} stays of twisted leather, one fastening to each side of the boat. An iron ring with a cord travelled up and down the mast, the halliard running through a small block, as Luka had been able to obtain a sheave at Turukhansk. The sail was a lug made of sheeting, oiled, and the boat carried beside a triangular sail of very much smaller dimensions and stouter cloth for heavy weather. She also carried a small <b>mizzen</b> mast and <b>sail.</b> In rough weather the cockpit could be completely covered with a light apron with openings where the rowers sat, with a sort of collar, which could be lashed tightly round their waists. The edges of this apron could be lashed down over the gunwale round the cockpit. When completed the canoe itself, with its mast and sails, weighed but sixty pounds, and could be carried with ease by one person on his shoulder.|$|R
50|$|The Abdy Beauclerk was {{the first}} of five Watson Beach or Aldeburgh class {{lifeboats}} built. She was built in 1931 by J. Samuel White in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Some stations around the coast such as Aldeburgh required a larger heavier boat than other motor life boats such as the Liverpool class. The flat nature of the foreshore at some stations precluded the use of slipways and with no suitable harbour facilities to hand it was not possible for stations such as Aldeburgh to keep a heavy Watson or Barnett-class lifeboat on station. The beach design was 41 feet long and 12 foot 3 inches wide and weighed just under 16 tons. The wide beam of the lifeboat made up for her shallow draught. She was fitted with twin screws, with the propellers housed in tunnels to protected them when being launched or hauled back up the beach. The lifeboat was powered by two 35 horse power Weyburn petrol engines which produced a top speed of 7.5 KT and gave her a range of 122 miles. Although this class of twin engine lifeboats no longer carried sails, the Aldeburgh crew requested that this lifeboat be fitted with a <b>mizzen</b> mast and <b>sail</b> as they preferred to have this arrangement.|$|R
60|$|Having said it, he {{closely watched}} the swarthy face now overspread with pallor, {{to see the}} truth or {{falsehood}} of his guess reflected there. But now the retreating Spaniard {{had come to the}} middle of the quarter-deck, where the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> made a screen to shut them off from the eyes of the Englishmen below. His lips writhed in a snarling smile.|$|E
60|$|About twelve noon, {{however, the}} vessel's motion was {{observed}} to be considerably less, and the sailors were enabled to walk upon deck {{with some degree}} of freedom. But, to the astonishment of every one, it was soon discovered that the floating light was adrift! The windlass was instantly manned, and the men soon gave out that there was no strain upon the cable. The <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail,</b> which was bent for the occasional purpose of making the vessel ride more easily to the tide, was immediately set, and the other sails were also hoisted in a short time, when, in no small consternation, we bore away about one mile to the south-westward of the former station, and there let go the best bower anchor and cable in twenty fathoms water, to ride until the swell of the sea should fall, when it might be practicable to grapple for the moorings, and find a better anchorage for the ship.|$|E

50|$|Both the ketch and the yawl {{have two}} masts, {{with the main}} mast foremost; the {{distinction}} usually being that a ketch has the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post, whereas on a yawl, it is aft of the rudder post. But the balance of sail area can be an overriding characteristic. If 20% {{or more of the}} sail area is in the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> the rig would be termed a ketch. This is particularly true on center cockpit yachts. Compared to a ketch, a similar size yawl's <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> is much smaller than the main, because of the limitations of the mizzen sheet. So on a ketch, the dual purpose of the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> is to both propel and balance the vessel, while on a yawl, the smaller mizzen mainly serves the purpose of trim or balance. Yawls tend to have mainsails almost as large as those of comparable sloops.|$|E
5000|$|A square-topsail ketch carries {{one or more}} square-rigged topsails (commonly two, {{an upper}} and a lower topsail) on its mainmast, in {{addition}} to its mainsail, <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> and jibs.|$|E
50|$|The lowest and {{normally}} largest sail on a mast is the course sail of that mast, and {{is referred to}} simply by the mast name: Foresail, mainsail, <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail,</b> jigger sail or more commonly forecourse etc.|$|E
5000|$|The Jewel {{made one}} voyage, from its {{shipyard}} in Oman 5000 kilometers to its berth in Singapore, following an ancient trade route, in stages, via Galle in Sri Lanka. The captain was Saleh al Jabri, with 25 years of sailing experience. Illustrations {{show that the}} ships were square-rigged, but the virtually nothing was known of their rigging. The sails were handmade from canvas. The main sail was 81 square metres and weighed over 150 kilograms. The second mast bore a smaller <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail.</b> [...] "Mizzen" [...] is an Arabic word that means balance. The <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> is used, in part, to steer the ship. A crew of at least eight is needed to manage the sails.|$|E
50|$|Ketches {{are similar}} to a sloop, {{but there is a}} second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the rudder post. The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail.</b> A ketch can also be Cutter-rigged with two head sails.|$|E
50|$|When in port, the ensign {{should always}} be flown from {{the staff at the}} stern. This is traditional, because in former times the gaff was then lowered along with the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail.</b> The only ensign ever flown from the {{starboard}} spreader or yardarm is that of a nation being visited.

50|$|The usual rig {{consists}} of a gunter-rigged mainsail set on the main mast, a <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> set on the mizzen mast sheeted to a bumpkin and a foresail. The tan-coloured sails are all boomless to avoid possible head injury from a gybing boom. The original Drascombe Lugger had a lug sail to start with; this was changed to a gunter mainsail but the name was kept.|$|E
5000|$|Brails, in a sailing ship, {{are small}} lines used {{to haul in}} or up the edges (leeches) or corners of sails, before furling. On a ship rig, these brails are most often found on the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail.</b> The command is, hale up the brails, or, brail up the sails. The word brail comes from Middle English brayle, from Anglo-French braiel belt, strap, brail, {{alteration}} of Old French braiuel belt, probably ultimately from Latin braca pant.|$|E
50|$|Her masts did {{not break}} nor did any yards or {{anything}} else fall down, so nothing was dragging to the side. Some sails were left until they were blown out, but others were shortened or cut off by the crew; the headsail had to be cut with knives before it would blow out. When she sank, she still had set {{about a third of}} the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> and some tarpaulin in the shrouds of the mizzen mast.|$|E
5000|$|Both the yawl and the ketch {{have two}} masts, {{with the main}} mast foremost. On classic yacht types with long {{overhangs}} and inboard rudders, the distinction is simple: a ketch has the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post, whereas on a yawl, it is aft of the rudder post. [...] For boats with shorter overhangs or outboard rudders the distinction is more usefully determined by comparing the purposes and relative sizes of the mizzens. Compared to a ketch, a similar size yawl's <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> is {{much smaller than the}} main, and is usually situated very far aft, behind the helm station. On a ketch, the principal purpose of the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> is to help propel the vessel as part of the working sail, the sail area being split up between two masts to ease handling. On a yawl, the smaller mizzen mainly serves the purposes of trim and balance, working more as an [...] "air rudder" [...] or trim tab than as a substantial part of the working sail. Yawls tend to have mainsails almost as large as those of sloops of comparable sized hulls.|$|E

Her current sails are a jib, foresail, mainsail and topsail on the mainmast, and a <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> on the mizzen-mast aft. Initially engined in 1943, she has been powered since 1980 by a Ford diesel. more recently the barge has been fitted with a bowsprit.|$|E
50|$|A {{small amount}} of lee helm can be counteracted with the rudder, but this {{introduces}} significant drag {{in the water and}} slows the boat. A {{small amount of}} lee helm can also be cured by raking the mast backward, reducing the size of the Jib on a Sloop rigged boat, or increasing the size of the <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> on a Yawl or a Ketch. Large amounts of lee helm can only be corrected by altering the placement of the mast(s) or keel/centerboard --- a non-trivial venture.|$|E
50|$|A yawl (from Dutch jol), in the United Kingdom {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a dandy, is a two-masted sailing craft similar to a sloop or cutter but with an additional mizzenmast (or mizzen mast) located well aft of the main mast, often right on the transom, or aft of the rudder post if the vessel has an inboard hung rudder. (A vessel with a larger mizzen located in a more forward position is called a ketch; see below: Yawl versus ketch.) The <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> (smaller than the mainsail) is hoisted on the mizzen mast.|$|E
50|$|The {{similarities}} between the Walga Rock image and a 19th-century two-masted steamer with a long segmented funnel, with its <b>mizzen</b> <b>sail</b> up (to keep its head into the wind) and with false gun ports, or rectangular ventilation ports are remarkable. Of the two-masted, flush decked (with no bridge or superstructure) colonial steamships operating in the north west of Australia, SS Xantho owned by the controversial pearler and pastoralist Charles Edward Broadhurst was of such import it is a likely possibility as {{the inspiration for the}} Walga Rock painting. http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/collections/maritime/march/shipwrecks/Xantho/Xantho.html.|$|E
