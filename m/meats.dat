5|$|Ancient Macedonia {{produced}} {{only a few}} fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, {{although there was no}} notice of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of <b>meats</b> into the dessert course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced <b>meats</b> served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians in the age of Demetrius I of Macedon.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{literature}} review focuses on <b>meat</b> tenderness and flavor, which {{are most important}} in determining <b>meat</b> quality, but difficultly predictable and maintained. <b>Meat</b> tenderness primarily relates to muscle tissues while <b>meat</b> flavor is mostly resulted from fatty tissues. Many {{studies have indicated that}} not only protein composition of muscle fibers but also handling and slaughtering conditions, genetic traits, and growth progress could affect <b>meat</b> tenderness. Surprisingly, there is somewhat connection between tenderness and flavor through marbling of <b>meat</b> cuts. The more marbling the <b>meat</b> cut has, the more flavorful and tender it is. Some clear understandings of those quality traits of <b>meat</b> are important to improve quality of <b>meat</b> and processed <b>meat</b> products. Key words: <b>meat</b> quality, <b>meat</b> tenderness, <b>meat</b> flavor, marbling, postmortem, connective tissues, fatty tissue...|$|R
40|$|New <b>meat</b> {{substitutes}} need to {{be recognized}} as alternatives to <b>meat.</b> We therefore investigated which category representations consumers have of <b>meat</b> and <b>meat</b> substitutes. Thirty-four non-vegetarian participants performed a free sorting task with 17 <b>meat</b> products and 19 commercially available <b>meat</b> substitutes, followed by similarity and typicality ratings. Results indicated that categorization was largely influenced by the taxonomic classification of <b>meat,</b> so by categories that refer to the animal source like ‘pork’, ‘beef’ etc. Hence, <b>meat</b> substitutes were grouped separately from non-processed <b>meat</b> products. However, there were categories (e. g. ‘pieces’ and ‘sausages’) that contained both <b>meat</b> substitutes and processed <b>meat</b> products, as these products were perceived to be very similar. New <b>meat</b> substitutes should have a certain resemblance to <b>meat</b> in order to replace <b>meat</b> on the plate. This can be achieved by either similarity in appearance or by referring to shared scripts/goals, such as a similar application in meals...|$|R
