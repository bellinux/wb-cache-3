5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} <b>measuring</b> <b>station,</b> Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|E

25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence <b>measuring</b> <b>station</b> where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} for an airport noise monitoring system is presented that comprises {{not only a}} number of <b>measuring</b> <b>stations,</b> but also a dedicated sound propagation model and an aircraft noise emission model. This approach enables estimation of noise levels in the whole area around the airport and {{not only at the}} location of the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations.</b> An additional advantage is that the locations of the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> can be chosen more freely. Traditionally the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> must be located near residential areas where the influence of other noise sources (such as cars or wind) cannot be eliminated. Better locations can be found that yield more reliable data and therefore more reliable noise levels. To update the sound propagation model frequently, the <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> not only <b>measure</b> noise levels, but also other parameters, like temperature and wind profile. The sound emission of the aircraft is derived from measurement results, complemented with a directional aircraft noise emission model. A tool was developed to visualize the power of combining data and models in this model-based monitoring system. The use of models opens possibilities for interesting applications such as i) short term noise forecasts, ii) scenario studies with various aircraft distributions and iii) enforcement of noise limits...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we augment the {{methodology}} of Chiera et al., [2010] to produce a multi-indicator model to predict pollution levels at <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> located in 36 European nations, based on observed persistent behaviour in air quality.

Unlike the single-indicator CFZG model, which used <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> from two locations only, we use <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> for pollutant signals which are geographically disparate, located in both rural and urban sites across 36 countries, all of which are registered with the European Environmental Agency.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} ambient air pollution on leaf characteristics of white willow, northern red oak, and Scots pine. Willow, oak, and pine saplings were planted at sixteen locations in Belgium, where nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), ozone (O- 3), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and particulate matter (PM 10) concentrations were continuously measured. The trees were exposed to ambient air during 6 months (April-September 2010), and, thereafter, specific leaf area (SLA), stomatal resistance (R-s), leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA), drop contact angle (CA), relative chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) were measured. Leaf characteristics of willow, oak, and pine were differently related to the ambient air pollution, indicating a species-dependent response. Willow and pine had a higher SLA at <b>measuring</b> <b>stations</b> with higher NO 2 and lower O- 3 concentrations.

40|$|A {{method for}} change {{detection}} {{in time and}} space domains based on wavelet MRA: Multi-Resolution Analysis is proposed. <b>Measuring</b> <b>stations</b> for carbon dioxide concentration are sparsely situated.

Thus relatively large change locations and time periods are detected. Through an experiment with 11 years of carbon dioxide concentration data starting from 1990 provided by WDCGG: World Data Center for Greenhouse Gasses, it is found that there exists seasonal change and relatively large changes are occurred in El Nino years.
