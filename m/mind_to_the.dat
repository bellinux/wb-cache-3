5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} book Schleiermacher gave {{religion}} an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation. This established the programme of his subsequent theological system. In the Monologen he revealed his ethical manifesto, in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit, and {{on the relationship of}} the <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sensual world, and sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society.|$|E
25|$|One open {{question}} regarding {{the nature of}} the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of the <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> physical brain and nervous system. Pre-scientific viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which considered the mind somehow non-physical. Modern views center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity. Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds. For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines.|$|E

25|$|In the 1993 case of Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs, the Court of Appeal of Singapore {{stated that}} {{validity}} of detention is {{not dependent on}} the subjective satisfaction of the authorities. Therefore, a court is entitled {{to determine whether there}} are objective grounds for the Minister's satisfaction that a person has been associated with criminal activities and that his or her detention is necessary. On the other hand, it was held by the High Court in Re Wong Sin Yee that the judicial process is unsuitable for reaching decisions on questions of public safety, peace and good order. Therefore, the court will not quash the Minister's decision to detain a person unless it is so outrageous in its defiance of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question to be decided could have arrived at it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} {{universe}} of Camelot, King Arthur showed David the broken Excalibur after reading books {{on how to}} make it whole, and when he asked David to help him find the other half, David realized where the portion of the dagger came from. As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each passing day, but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E

500|$|Philosophy of mind [...] is {{a branch}} of {{philosophy}} that studies {{the nature of the}} mind. The mind–body problem is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind, although other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness, and the nature of particular mental states. Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, the ontology of the mind, the nature of thought, and the relationship of the <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E

And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of <b>mind,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|... "Ode to Psyche" [...] is {{a poem by}} John Keats {{written in}} spring 1819. The poem {{is the first of}} his 1819 odes, which include [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] is an {{experiment}} in the ode genre, and Keats's attempt at an expanded version of the sonnet format that describes a dramatic scene. The poem serves as an important departure from Keats's early poems, which frequently describe an escape into the pleasant realms of one's imagination. Keats uses the imagination to show the narrator's intent to resurrect Psyche and reincarnate himself into Eros (love). Keats attempts this by dedicating an [...] "untrodden region" [...] of his <b>mind</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> worship of the neglected goddess.|$|E
500|$|In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, {{the deputy}} system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid {{engagement}} elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. [...] The {{treasurer of the}} Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't <b>mind)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] Henry Wood had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. [...] The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra.|$|E
