40|$|The {{concept of}} {{distributed}} moral responsibility (DMR) {{has a long}} history. When it is understood as being entirely reducible to the sum of (some) human, individual and already <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> actions, then the allocation of DMR, and hence of praise and reward or blame and punishment, may be pragmatically difficult, but not conceptually problematic. However, in distributed environments, it is increasingly possible that a network of agents, some human, some artificial (e. g. a programme) and some hybrid (e. g. {{a group of people}} working as a team thanks to a software platform), may cause distributed moral actions (DMAs). These are morally good or evil (i. e. <b>morally</b> <b>loaded)</b> actions caused by local interactions that are in themselves neither good nor evil (morally neutral). In this article, I analyze DMRs that are due to DMAs, and argue in favour of the allocation, by default and overridably, of full moral responsibility (faultless responsibility) to all the nodes/agents in the network causally relevant for bringing about the DMA in question, independently of intentionality. The mechanism proposed is inspired by, and adapts, three concepts: back propagation from network theory, strict liability from jurisprudence and common knowledge from epistemic logi...|$|E

Studying ritualistic behaviour in cases when bystanders become side participants as they stand up for victims of abuse fills a knowledge gap in pragmatics. A further merit of studying this phenomenon is that it provides insight into the reactive aspect of ritual behaviour, which is usually described in the field {{as a form of}} action rather than reaction. Furthermore, examining the <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> acts of rituals of outspokenness reveals the potentially complex relationship between aggression and normative behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Summary An {{increasing}} number of people think that people should be held responsible for their own health, for example by means of making unhealthily living people pay a higher health insurance premium. This thesis is written as a plea against the vision behind such an opinion. In this thesis, I distinguish different types of responsibility and explain to what type of responsibility premium differentiation on the basis of lifestyle makes an appeal. I assess whether the conditions for holding people responsible in that way rightfully, are met in case of unhealthy behaviour and reach the conclusion that this will not be the case most of the time. A closer look at premium differentiation reveals that there are more ethical objections to this idea, for instance that it will be <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> and will compromise the ideal that all people are given the opportunity to live life according to their own convictions and values, {{one of the most important}} ideals our democracy is based on. Furthermore, I assess whether preserving solidarity, doing justice, containing costs and improving people’s health are sound reasons to aim for measures holding people responsible for their own health, such as premium differentiation. The final conclusion is that there are no good reasons to propose premium differentiation, only reasons against it. It is unfair, unfeasible, arbitrary, <b>morally</b> <b>loaded,</b> unjust, ineffective and it can – from a moral point of view – have undesirable effects on the way society treats its sick and needy...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} part of a larger project to think about how some of the very {{sophisticated}} theories of image use and abuse – ideas about idolatry and the idol – that were developed within the medieval church might also have impacted on secular culture. While the transfer of the theory, language or iconography of idolatry to secular contexts is sometimes explicitly acknowledged, at other times it takes place in modes that are more subterranean – manifesting itself in underlying thought structures or linguistic or iconographic connotations. I shall argue that in these new contexts the medieval figure of the idol takes on many new implications, to the point that it stands in tension with the anti-idolatry discourses in which the notion of idolatry was originally formulated. In these new contexts the figure of the idol may well retain its complexity, its ‘bodiliness’, its opacity, its fascination and exoticism; it may well continue to raise questions about deadness and aliveness, about surface appearance and what might be ‘inside’; but it may no longer necessarily carry a <b>morally</b> negative <b>loading...</b>|$|R
40|$|The term 'teenage pregnancy' {{replaced}} the <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> terms 'illegitimate child' and 'unwed mother' around 1970. Instead {{of understanding the}} change in terminology as 'becoming more accurate', 'compelling more humane treatment' or simply as 'good', {{we should try to}} understand the meaning of the shift from treating pregnant adolescents as moral problems to treating them as scientific problems. Power organized around a moral discourse punished by exclusion, by placing its object {{on the other side of}} a moral boundary. Power organized around a scientific discourse on sexual desire makes its objects of knowledge visible and subject to unending inquiry. This paper explores the political implications of the emergence of this new form of power which disciplines its subjects not to obey the Law, but to become true to their own nature, a nature known by scientific experts. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of an unobtrusive research inquiry investigating the possible use and misuse of Alzheimer’s disease in public policy debate on the legalization of euthanasia. The component of the study being reported identified the problematic use of five key metaphors: the Alzheimer metaphor, which in turn was reinforced by three additional metaphors – the epidemic metaphor, the military metaphor, and the predatory thief metaphor; and the euthanasia metaphor. All metaphors {{were found to be}} <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> and used influentially to stigmatize Alzheimer’s disease and mediate public opinion supporting the legalization of euthanasia as an end-of-life ‘solution’ for people with the disease. It is contended that, in the interests of promoting intellectual honesty and giving proper recognition to the extraordinary complexity of the issue, the problematic use and influence of metaphoric thinking in the public debate about Alzheimer’s disease and euthanasia needs to be made transparent, questioned and challenged. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study aims at {{exploring}} how persons with hearing impairments, using cochlear implants, create and negotiate meaning {{in relation to}} soundscapes in modern society. Methods: Participants were contacted through national organisations for persons with hearing impairments. Data was gathered {{by means of a}} combination of interviews and an ethnological questionnaire. Results: For persons with cochlear implants, the process to (re) learn how to hear can be difficult, even painful. Hence, the process can be a personal investment: incentives involve increasing ones hearing, as well as a normative pursuit of able-bodiedness. Normative expectations concerning oral communication are contributing to experiences of various soundscapes, in turn rendering individual strategies <b>morally</b> <b>loaded.</b> Simultaneously, personal choice and responsibility are included as components in the process of creating and negotiating meaning. Conclusions: A person’s creation of meaning and the personal significance of the cochlear implant revolve around normative able-bodiedness, in turn entangled in the relationship between person and society. However, by using the cochlear implant in everyday practice, normative able-bodiedness is negotiated, sometimes even resisted...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the social implications of urban regeneration from an anthropological perspective centred on concepts of waste and value. It {{is concerned with}} the symbolic devaluation of people, their homes and communities on inner-city estates in south-east London. This process is of course nothing new, as the extensive literature on gentrification both in the UK and around the world, by anthropologists and social scientists in general, testifies. The originality of the thesis lies in connecting large scale urban regeneration programmes to small scale, everyday processes of dealing with waste in people’s homes, and communally on their estates. The ethnography connects these two levels by showing how those who live on estates often lack the most basic tools – such as lifts that work, or doors that open, or space in their kitchens – to engage in recycling themselves, meaning they are excluded and ‘othered’ from a <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> value-creating circuit which feeds into their symbolic representation as intrinsically worthless and ‘other’. Meanwhile, the very same residents engage in community building in their everyday lives, producing and reproducing their estates as sociable spaces they care deeply about, even though within the confines of a framework that only recognises value in what is privately, individually owned, epitomised in the ‘Right to Buy’ policy that has deeply affected housing estates in England for the past thirty years, residents' efforts are either misread or ignored by those in charge of the estates. The thesis thus challenges the misrepresentation of its main set of respondents – working class, poor, ethnically diverse inner-city dwellers - as valueless and as waste themselves, labels that are attached to them not just by media and popular culture, but also by officers, policies and politicians, who are interviewed and interrogated at length {{in the course of the}} thesis. Furthermore, it questions the alleged parallels between processes of urban regeneration and recycling. It is easy to understand why local authorities and developers would wish to adopt the <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> terminology of recycling and apply it to their programmes, presenting regeneration as related to recycling in its positive connotations of both improvement and recovery of the old, be it people or homes. The ethnography shows instead that regeneration in practice is more akin to wasting and buying new, in that established residents are moved out of their homes, which are then demolished, or wasted, and new middle class incomers are welcomed in – bought anew...|$|E
40|$|Philosophical {{conceptions of}} the {{relationship}} between risk and trust may be divided into three main families. The first conception, taking its cue from Hobbes, sees trust as a kind of risk assessment involving the expected behavior of another person, for the sake of achieving the likely benefits of cooperation. The second conception of trust sees it as an alternative to calculative risk assessment, in which instead of calculating the risks of relying on another person, one willingly relies on them for other reasons, e. g., habitual, social, or moral reasons. The third conception sees trust as a <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> attitude, in which one has a moral expectation that one takes it to be the responsibility of the trusted person to fulfill. In the context of interpersonal relationships this attributed moral responsibility creates spheres perceived to be free of interpersonal risk, in which one can pursue cooperative aims. In this chapter, we examine how these three views account for two prima facie relationships between risk and trust, and we look at some empirical research on risk and trust that employs these different conceptions of what trust is. We then suggest some future areas of philosophical research on the relationship between trust and risk...|$|E
40|$|For centuries, Aristotle’s ethos {{has been}} a crucial {{component}} of persuasive rhetoric, with flagrant violations of character extinguishing the credibility of speakers and rendering their messages ineffective. However, the 2016 US presidential election challenged the rhetorical value of good character and left voters unable to articulate feelings about perceived moral transgressions. In some ways, this inability to express what bothered many {{is tied to the}} various constraints of the first-year writing classroom, where instructors often oversimplify definitions of ethos in a way that removes a facet known as aretê—a concept defined as moral virtue and one especially beneficial for navigating morally complex and controversial conversations. This study argues for a revival of aretê in our classrooms as a way of helping students engage in and explore their own questions of morality, character, and ethos. Utilizing revised conceptions of ethos and aretê that incorporate modern notions of moral virtue, this study analyzed transcripts of the three presidential debates to quantify how and when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump employed <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> language. The results of the lexical analysis surfaced a reduced moral vocabulary, which illustrates the need for a more nuanced understanding of ethos and a larger aretiac lexicon in our classroom. What this research advocates for is not that we anchor every iteration of ethos in moral virtue, but rather that alternative conceptions are invited into the classroom as a way of helping students enact new identities and participate in new spheres...|$|E
40|$|In {{a book on}} {{preventing}} early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes in developing countries, the World Health Organisation (2011) declares that ‘adolescent pregnancy’ contributes to maternal, perinatal and infant mortality, and to a vicious cycle of poverty and ill-health. This statement reflects the common public assumption that ‘teenage pregnancy’ represents an individual, social, health, educational and financial risk that requires remediation. This kind of public perception is spurred by media coverage in which young girls with large protruding stomachs are etched in profile and stories of calamity are told (e. g. Time (21 June 2005) magazine). And yet {{the very notion of}} 'teenage pregnancy' is a relatively recent one. Depending on the country one talks about, it has been around since between the 1960 s and 1980 s. In the United States, for example, the rise of ‘teenage pregnancy’ as a social problem was associated with a shift in gendered power relations. Prior to the late 1960 s the <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> concepts of 'unwed mother' and 'illegitimate child' were used to describe young women who conceived. For the most part, young pregnant women were excluded from society, with the accompanying shame around the lack of proper conjugal arrangements. The use of the term 'teenage pregnancy' removed the implied moral judgment and replaced it with seeming scientific neutrality. Young pregnant women now became publicly visible and thus the object of scientific scrutiny (Arney & Bergen, 1984) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} what {{it means}} to be a professional, ethical educator. I argue that genuine moral agency grounded in open-mindedness provides conditions necessary for professional autonomy. I argue that trust in the <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> roles teachers take must be strengthened to counterbalance the erosion in professionalism and commodification of learning current in Western education sectors under policies geared to increasing national productivity and other instrumentalist approaches to the aims of education. I claim that being an ethical and professional teacher entails moral evaluation of both beliefs and actions such that these engender greater responsibility represented in the professional body rather than individual complicity. In doing so, I consider how these themes play out in various areas of teachers' work including policy frameworks and codes of conduct, teacher education, evidence-based practice, critical thinking and values education in pluralist democratic environments. The crux of my position is the claim that the epistemic and ethical dimensions of teachers' professional roles are inseparable and that an important moral dimension of teacher professionality and re-professionalisation is the critical and sophisticated enactment and interrogation of an ethics of belief that is cognisant of the teleology of the role and of broad-based morality. In theorising ways of being ethical educators William Carr's notion of interrogated educational praxis is coupled with Charles Taylor's radically questioning human agent. Teachers' ways of being are placed within the complexity of emerging systems and trust-oriented relations in which they are embedded. This is informed by moral and cognitive psychology, critical theories as per Heidegger and Derrida, neo-Aristotelian virtue theory and Deweyean conceptualisations of educational experience as growth. I test the claim that being an ethical educator entails an ethic of belief grounded in tolerance for uncertainty and active open-mindedness by considering the value of the virtues of ignorance...|$|E
40|$|Fertility {{problems}} affect one {{in seven}} couples in the UK (HFEA 2013) and as techniques improve {{in the field of}} ART, the number of couples becoming parents through this is increasing. Those who have undergone IVF will have faced greater psychological, physical and often financial demands which may alter the culture of parenting and heighten expectation for this group. In addition it may be that previous experiences of infertility (sense of failure and frustration, cyclical nature of hopes raised and dashed) and the associated interventions (high anxiety, medical intrusion, relinquishing of control) influence the transition to parenthood. For most couples, there is an assumption that once in a committed relationship, financially secure and living independently, having children will follow. Any difficulty with achieving this causes stress and distress. Individuals need to move from a sense of self as 'normal' to an acceptance of fertility issues. Burnett (2009) suggests the term 'struggling with infertility' as it implies an active rather than a passive state. For couples, it may be 'natural' to want a child but they face 'unnatural' ways to achieve this. IVF may provide couples with a child but it does not cure the problem - they remain a couple unable to conceive spontaneously. Jauniaux and Rizk (2011) describe IVF as a 'somatic answer to a subjective problem'. Hjelmstedt (2004) found that negative feelings associated with previous infertility continued to have an effect on some parents - on their sense of self and their parenting. Parenting itself is <b>morally</b> <b>loaded,</b> with parents subjected to societal pressures. This moral pressure may be even greater for those parents of a child conceived by IVF, an assumption that having actively sought parenthood, one should be obliged to be 'good' at it. Miller (2007) highlights how this moral pressure leads to a disjuncture between women’s experiences and existing discourses, this may be greater for those whose 'cost' of pregnancy was greater. The paper will expand upon these ideas of identity as individuals move from being a couple to being parents, but via IVF and the implications this may have on them and their parenting...|$|E
40|$|Rethinking free time: A {{study on}} boundaries, disorders, and {{symbolic}} goods Abstract This study critically examines the contested category called free time. It aims to provide insights into this key category in consumer research that is generally accepted without critical reflection. To accomplish this task, the study brings together theoretical perspectives from symbolic and critical anthropology, critical consumption studies, and feminist studies. Through the constructs of symbolic boundaries, orders/disorders, and symbols, the study examines free time, and the complex {{ways in which}} consumption takes part in its formation. The empirical fieldwork is carried out in Finland. The primary data consist of cultural talk produced by focus groups, and they are complemented by cultural materials and fieldwork notes. By drawing detailed attention to the boundaries of free time the study highlights the complexities and dynamics involved in this historically constructed category. It highlights {{the ways in which}} our everyday attempts to “be free” entail attempts to cope with idealized and <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> assumptions infused in different temporal categories. The study suggests that four symbolic battles can be identified: battle with temporal systems, battle with boundaries differentiating work and free time, dirty and clean free time, and waking and sleeping. This identification enlarges prevailing understanding of free time. A key contribution of the study is the suggestion that, ultimately, the sub-world called free time is a mental world. Boundaries serve to differentiate thoughts, to create a symbolic world that enables one to think about the right things at the right place, and at the right time. This suggestion makes us to question the dominant way to comprehend free time in terms of the absence of work, or the presence of leisure activities, or through time-space relation. Closely related, the study makes a contribution by calling attention to the role of memory, to forgetting and remembering. By highlighting the significance of the moral division, dirty and clean, it also challenges the image of free time as a unified category. Importantly, the study opens up the concept of free time by bringing sleeping to our attention. It suggests that sleeping constitutes a significant pleasure, not a mere necessity, and therefore, it should not be excluded from free time studies at the outset. The study also makes a contribution to symbolic consumption by suggesting a new role for consumption as manager of thoughts. While earlier studies have discussed the ways in which consumption serves to differentiate social groups, this study highlights the ways in which it also serves to differentiate and manage thoughts. Consumption hinders wrong thoughts from entering mind and so enables one to think differently. It is this very differentiation that seems to be, however, threatened in today’s societ...|$|E

Os resultados da pesquisa mostram que as intera????es apresentam uma macroorganiza????o estruturada em cinco atividades chave (ZIMMERMAN, 1984; 1992), sequencialmente negociadas: 1) abertura/identifica????o/alinhamento; 2) solicita????o; 3) sequ??ncia interrogativa; 4) resposta; e 5) fechamento, em que o grande par {{adjacente}} solicita????o/resposta se constitui na sequ??ncia central do evento. Percebe-se, tamb??m, uma forte orienta????o dos comunicantes para a solicita????o de uma viatura, e dos atendentes, para o envio de uma viatura como o produto final desse par adjacente central e da presta????o de servi??o dos atendimentos do 190. Quando a necessidade do envio de uma viatura ?? posta em d??vida, a rotina das pr??ticas de atender ?? desestabilizada, e o mandato institucional desse servi??o ?? questionado, gerando consequ??ncias interacionais para a conversa em andamento. A an??lise dos dados revela a orienta????o dos comunicantes para suas Categorias de Perten??a (SACKS, 1992; SCHEGLOFF, 1972; SELL; OSTERMANN, 2009) na produ????o de accounts narrativos (DE FINA, 2009) que buscam convencer os atendentes da legitimidade de sua solicita????o de ajuda. Orientados pelo conhecimento socialmente compartilhado do que se constituem em eventos moralmente sancion??veis, ao mesmo tempo em que vitimizam o comunicante, os accounts narrativos produzidos pelos comunicantes constroem uma rela????o de antagonismo entre ele e o seu agressor, o qual ?? responsabilizado pelos fatos reportados. A orienta????o dos participantes para determinadas Categorias de Perten??a tamb??m ?? revelada na formula????o do local para onde a viatura deve ser enviada. O engessamento provocado pelas limita????es do formul??rio eletr??nico de solicita????o de servi??o ?? materializado, por exemplo, na necessidade de informa????o do nome de um logradouro e de um numeral previamente cadastrados no software utilizado. Esse tipo de restri????o imp??e limita????es quanto ?? inser????o de outros formatos de endere??o ??? vigentes na organiza????o social atual, principalmente das camadas sociais menos favorecidas ??? e que divergem do formato padr??o, dificultando, assim, o acesso dessas pessoas ?? seguran??a p??blica. Verificou-se tamb??m que, para a manuten????o da intersubjetividade no atendimento telef??nico do 190, tanto o atendente, quanto o comunicante, precisam estar orientados para o atendimento das demandas impostas pelo software operacional, o que tornou poss??vel compreender que a investiga????o da intersubjetividade nos novos contextos tecnologizados demanda que o pesquisador alargue os campos semi??ticos (C. GOODWIN, 2000) investigados. Da mesma forma, os recursos lingu??stico-interacionais mobilizados pelos comunicantes, ao formularem o local para onde a viatura deve ser enviada, demonstra a sua falta de letramento quanto ??s pr??ticas sociais em quest??o. Esse estudo resultou em um curso de capacita????o de 50 horas/aula para a qualifica????o dos atendimentos telef??nicos desse servi??o de emerg??ncia e na implementa????o de um processo seletivo interno para o ingresso na fun????o de atendente, que tamb??m s??o discutidos no texto. This study analyzes {{two hundred}} telephone emergency calls between callers and call takers at Brigada Militar (190), in Porto Alegre, from an ethnographic (O???REILLY, 2009) perspective {{and based on}} Ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis (GARFINKEL, 1967; SACKS, 1992) and Membership Categorization Analysis principles (SACKS, 1992; SCHEGLOFF, 1972; SELL; OSTERMANN, 2009). The results of this research study show that the interactions present a macrostructure organized into five key activities that are sequentially negotiated (ZIMMERMAN, 1984; 1992) : 1) opening/identification/alignment; 2) request; 3) interrogative sequence; 4) response; and 5) closing, in which the adjacency pair request/response consists of the main sequence of the event. Callers??? strong orientation to the request for a police car and call takers??? orientation to the dispatch of a police car are also identified as the final product of this adjacency pair and of the provision of the service. When {{the need for the}} dispatch of a police car is questioned by a caller, the routine of the practices involved in the processing of the call is destabilized and the institutional mandate of 190 is questioned, and this fact brings in interactional consequences to the flow of the interactions. The analysis of the data reveals callers??? orientation to certain Membership Categories (SACKS, 1992; SCHEGLOFF, 1972; SELL; OSTERMANN, 2009) in the production of narrative accounts (DE FINA, 2009), which aim at convincing call takers of the legitimacy of their requests. Based on the socially shared knowledge of <b>morally</b> <b>loaded</b> events, {{at the same time that}} these narrative accounts victimize the caller, they also build an antagonistic relationship between caller and aggressor ??? with the latter being allegedly responsible for the facts being reported. Participants??? orientations to certain Membership Categories can also be seen in their formulation of the place to where the police car must be dispatched. The limitations imposed by the electronic form is materialized, for instance, in the need to insert the name of a street and a number, which can be retrieved from the database, in the address slot. This restriction limits the insertion of other formats of address ??? which can be found in the current social organization (especially in the less privileged social classes) ??? and which restricts the access of those people to public safety. It was also possible to notice that, the maintenance of intersubjectivity in emergency calls depends on callers??? and call takers??? orientation to meet the demands of the software, and this fact shows that the study of intersubjectity in new, technologized contexts demands that the researcher considers other semiotic fields (C. GOODWIN, 2000) in the investigation. At the same time, the linguistic resources mobilized by the callers when formulating the place where the police car must be sent to displays their illiteracy concerning the social practices of the modern world. This research resulted in a fifty-hour training program to qualify the call-taking services and in the implementation of an internal recruitment process for the position of call taker, which are also discussed in this work...|$|E
