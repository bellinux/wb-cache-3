5000|$|In Ewe drumming, {{the term}} <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> {{is not limited}} to one {{particular}} type of drum. A <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> can be an atsimevu, sogo, kroboto, totodzi, or an agboba; these are the only types of drums used as master drums, however. Different master drums are used in different pieces. For example, if a group is playing [...] "Agbadza" [...] (an old Ewe war dance), the master drummer plays the sogo. The <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> techniques and playing styles are generally the same regardless of which drum is used.|$|E
5000|$|The basic <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> {{is called}} a sogo (pronounced [...] "so-go)". Sogo is the drum that can always be a {{substitute}} for the <b>master</b> <b>drum.</b> It is also the actual [...] "correct" [...] <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> for some pieces. The sogo is a larger version of the kidi and is taller and fatter than the kidi. It can be played either with two wooden sticks, one hand and one stick, or both hands. This depends on the technique used in the piece being played. Depending on the piece, sometimes the sogo can play the same support role as the kidi. It produces a low tone and is usually played sitting down.or standing up.|$|E
50|$|An Ewe {{drumming}} ensemble {{consists of}} several drums, a bell, and a rattle. Each ensemble usually has a <b>master</b> <b>drum,</b> an iron bell called a gankogui, {{and a group}} of secondary drummers.|$|E
5000|$|Another type of <b>master</b> <b>drummer</b> is {{a person}} who leads other drummers in playing drum rhythms, e.g. in the French Caribbean styles, the <b>master</b> <b>drummer</b> may be called [...] "kamande" [...] in French Creole.|$|R

50|$|In {{almost all}} West African {{drumming}} ensembles, a lead drum or <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> leads the group. The master drummer tells the ensemble when {{to play and}} when to stop, he also plays signals telling the other players to change the tempo or the drumming pattern. In some West African drumming ensembles, the master drummer is to play the main theme of the piece and improvise. In Ewe drumming, the master drummer does drum dialogue with the kidi. It enriches the kidi phrase by filling in the empty spaces on the kidi’s part. The <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> can also improvise.|$|E
50|$|Palo {{music is}} played on long drums termed palos.The word palos means trees, and {{therefore}} all Dominican palos drums are instruments made from hollowed out logs. The {{head of the}} drum is made of cowhide and it {{is attached to the}} log portion with hoops and pegs in the Eastern region, or with nails in the Southwest. There is a <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> (palo mayor) which is the large, wide drum played with slimmer drums (alcahuetes) alongside: two in the East or three elsewhere. Palos are usually played with guiras, which are metal scrapers. They may also be played with maracas, or a little stick used to hit the <b>master</b> <b>drum,</b> called the catá. The Dominican region in which the palos are played determines the form, the number of the instruments, and how they are played.|$|E
50|$|A newer, lesser used <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> {{is called}} the agboba (pronounced ag-bo-bah or {{sometimes}} bo-bah). This drum was invented by the Ewe in the 1950s to play a newly invented piece called agahu. The agboba is the deepest sounding drum played by the Ewe. It has a fat body and is played leaning over on a stand similar to that for the atsimevu.|$|E

50|$|Another <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> {{is called}} atsimevu (pronounced ah-chee-meh-voo). The atsimevu is the tallest of the Ewe drums. It is around 4½ feet tall. To play the atsimevu, the drummer must lean {{it over a}} stand called a vudetsi, stand {{on one side of}} the drum—and play it with either two wooden sticks or one hand and one stick. The atsimevu makes a middle range sound with some bass in the sound.|$|E
50|$|Like many West African drums, the <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> and {{sometimes}} the kidi {{have the ability to}} speak the language. Most African languages are tonal, so by producing different sounds at different pitches on the drum, the drummer can imitate the tones of the language. Some African drums can even imitate consonants by hitting the drum with a stick or hand at different angles and with different parts of the stick or hand. The Ewe also play a pair of two drums called atumpan (pronounced ah-toom-pahn), which are used all over Ghana as talking drums. The atumpan player stands up and plays the drum with two sticks shaped like an L.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{exhibits}} a Latin feel. The main section is in 12/8 meter; {{this section employs}} an unusual polyrhythmic groove, with the piano and bass playing six beats per measure and the melody (and parts of the drum kit) playing four beats per measure. The result {{is that most of}} the instruments appear to be playing quarter-note triplets against the swing of the melody and drum kit. Drummer John Bonham plays a shuffle beat similar to the [...] "Purdie shuffle" [...] rhythm, along with a samba-style breakdown and hop-skip riff arrangement. A <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> track shows that the samba breakdown (2:25) was recorded separately.|$|E

Master Duang owned the mysterious drum called poeng mang, which {{is said to have}} been made by the skin of a {{beautiful}} woman named Thip. Ping falls in love with a beautiful girl who teaches him how to <b>master</b> <b>drum</b> skills but she is in fact the ghost living inside the drum. Meanwhile, an arrogant musician called Muan tries to convince all the students to leave Master Duang. Some students die horribly. Even if Muan is defeated by Ping during a drum contest, things get worse and the drum becomes not only an instrument of music but also an instrument of death.|$|E
5000|$|Billy Swan secured his own {{recording}} {{deal with}} Monument Records, {{after his return}} to Nashville in August 1973. From the time he secured the deal, Swan began composition of 'I Can Help' in a music room that his wife, Marlu, had converted from a closet inside the small duplex that they shared close to his city's Centennial Park. Swan has revealed that he used a 'Rock' preset, from his Rhythm <b>Master</b> <b>drum</b> machine, when writing the song; [...] "It played 16ths and sounded like a sock cymbal, so I just started playing these chords along with it, and the song came in about 20 minutes. I didn't always write that quickly, but from my experience the ones that come quickly are the good ones. 'Lover Please' was like that, and so was 'Everything's the Same'. With 'I Can Help' I actually wrote the three verses first, and since I needed something to put between {{the second and third}} verse I then came up with the bridge. The whole thing just came out of the air, including the words." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{tradition and}} change within the funeral music and funeral {{culture in the}} town of Dzodze located in southeastern Ghana. Dzodze is located {{in the heart of the}} southern Ewe cultural area in Ghana, an area extending approximately east to west from the Volta Lake to Aflao on the Togo boarder, and north from the coast to Avenor and Hevi. Dzodze is an autonomous duko (city/state), located to the north of the Anlo, the largest duko in the region, with whom they share many cultural features. In 1995, I was introduced to the Tagborlo family, an important family of drummers, singers, and dancers in Dzodze. I apprenticed with them as a drummer, joining them in playing at numerous funerals as well as ceremonies for the Yeve religious shrine for a period of nearly three years. 1 It was with this family that I learned the music of Agbadza-Ageshe, an important genre of funeral music. As I began studying the vugbewo 2 (drum language patterns) of the <b>master</b> <b>drum,</b> I was surprised to find that many of the phrases referred to things or events from contemporary life. Several of the vugbewo referred to really vulgar sexual rhymes/sayings, causing shock or embarrassment when I asked the meanings from the Western-educated Ewe who were assisting me with the translations. Looking at all of this,...|$|E
