5|$|The {{remainder}} of the game takes place in 1995. Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate La Fayette, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the Eurocopter Tiger helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova, who has been betrayed to Janus. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet {{the chief of the}} Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan – his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the <b>military</b> <b>archives</b> for interrogation. Bond eventually manages to escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya, and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery. Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus. There Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then hitches a ride on Trevelyan's ex-Soviet missile train, where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{suppressed the}} news to avoid alerting the Germans or harming morale on the home front. The extent {{and the intensity of}} the mutinies were disclosed {{for the first time in}} 1967 by Guy Pedroncini, in his Les Mutineries de 1917. His project had been made possible by the opening of most of the relevant <b>military</b> <b>archives</b> 50 years after the events, a delay that was in conformity with French War Ministry procedure. However, there are still undisclosed archives on the mutinies, which are believed to contain documents mostly of a political nature; they will not be opened to researchers until 100 years after the mutinies, in 2017.|$|E

25|$|Vitkauskas is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} history of Lithuania. On one hand, he loyally served in the Lithuanian Army for over two decades (1919–1940). On the other hand, he actively collaborated with the Soviet regime that arrested and executed many Lithuanian officers. Opinions range widely: from a traitor and a sleeper Soviet agent to a desperate man who contemplated suicide (according to Jonas Černius) and mourned the loss of independence (according to his daughter). Historians further point out that Vitkauskas destroyed most sensitive and damning <b>military</b> <b>archives</b> before turning them to the Soviets. An objective evaluation is not possible due to lack of archival data (most relevant archives are kept in Russia).|$|E
25|$|Awarded a scholarship, Hayward went on {{to pursue}} a Ph.D. degree, also at University of Canterbury, again under the {{supervision}} of Vincent Orange. His topic was an analysis of German air operations during the eastern campaigns of World War II, based on unpublished German archival sources. In 1994, the U.S. Air Force Historical Research Agency, located within the Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, awarded him a research fellowship to conduct research for his dissertation in its archives. He subsequently received a research fellowship from the Federal Government of Germany which enabled him to conduct primary research in the German <b>Military</b> <b>Archives</b> in Freiburg, Germany. Hayward was awarded his Ph.D. in 1996. His dissertation, Seeking the Philosopher's Stone: Luftwaffe Operations during Hitler's Drive to the East, 1942–1943 became the basis of his first book, , which was acclaimed upon its publication in 1998.|$|E
