2500|$|A <b>match</b> <b>wagon</b> or {{match truck}} (also {{known as a}} [...] "barrier vehicle" [...] / wagon in Britain and [...] "transition car" [...] in North America) has {{different}} kinds of couplings at each end. If a pair of match wagons is used, a rake of wagons using coupling A can be inserted into a train otherwise using coupling B.|$|E
50|$|Idler flatcars {{are also}} used to mount one kind of coupler on one end and another kind on the other end. {{this is called a}} <b>match</b> <b>wagon</b> or barrier vehicle.|$|E
50|$|A barrier vehicle (BV), barrier wagon, <b>match</b> <b>wagon</b> or {{translator}} {{coach is}} used to convert between non-matching railway coupler types. This allows locomotives to pull railway vehicles or parts of a train with {{a different type of}} coupler.|$|E
2500|$|... use a <b>match</b> <b>wagon(s)</b> {{which has}} {{different}} couplings at either end.|$|R
50|$|<b>Match</b> <b>wagons</b> can {{overcome}} incompatibilities {{at the price}} of extra deadweight. Similarly with coupling adapters.|$|R
50|$|From 1972 {{the fleet}} was further expanded, with wagons 201-350 being {{constructed}} brand-new as GJFs, and with steel bodies roughly <b>matching</b> <b>wagons</b> 101-200.|$|R

50|$|The main {{maintenance}} depot was at Birkenhead North, {{dedicated to the}} units. Careful attention allowed them to remain in good condition right up to their final withdrawal in 1985, unlike some other units {{elsewhere in the country}} at this time. Every four years, major overhauls, including full repaints, were conducted at Horwich Works, near Bolton. Along with other North-West EMUs, a set would be formed up at Birkenhead North with a <b>match</b> <b>wagon</b> and hauled by locomotive to Horwich. Until 1962, sets were hauled to Horwich via the West Kirby to Hooton Line and, later on, the route was via the Mid-Wirral Line.|$|E
50|$|The vans {{were used}} with <b>matching</b> ballast <b>wagons</b> in semi-permanent consists, {{and used for}} reballasting the {{metropolitan}} network.|$|R
50|$|They were {{converted}} from former Brake Gangwayed (BG) vehicles in 1968 {{to supplement the}} Class 419 Motor Luggage Van fleet. However, following the decline of boat train traffic, they were all stored in 1975. After a period in use as <b>match</b> <b>wagons</b> for transferring new Class 432 and 491 units from York Works, they were all taken into departmental stock initially as stores vans, but later as breakdown train tool vans.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} design, these wagons {{are closely related}} to the four-axled {{standard}} open wagon. For example, even the major dimensions of the UIC-standardized rolling roof <b>wagon</b> <b>matches</b> its open <b>wagon</b> counterpart, the Class Ea(o)s: ...|$|R
50|$|Bolsters {{could be}} fixed in place, or be removable. Some {{had as many}} as five bolsters. Some designs had {{multiple}} sockets and a pair of bolsters could be moved between them. The bolsters could even be allowed to swivel around a central locating pin, and curved steel rubbing strips on the wagon deck. The design of bogie bolster wagons had developed from earlier timber wagons: these were short four-wheeled wagons, each carrying a single swivelling bolster. A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of <b>match</b> <b>wagons</b> to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons. The long, but relatively lightweight, bogie bolster replaced this with a single wagon.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the first}} ICE1 power cars were {{commissioned}} in late 1989, the intermediate cars {{were not yet}} available. Instead, they were coupled to retired couchette cars (type yl) that were homologated for 200km/h. These were fitted with special couplings for compatibility to the power cars. Usually, Class 110 locomotives served as Angstlok {{as well as for}} pulling the train on the return trip. For braking tests, the locos were sometimes coupled between two power cars, with <b>match</b> <b>wagons</b> on both sides. The test runs usually started at the Opladen repair workshop and used lines in the vicinity. Fast runs at up to 200km/h were to Bielefeld and Bremen. Because of time pressure, some power cars ware used for tests that had not yet been accepted by Bundesbahn. For longer test runs, two [...] "dummy trainsets" [...] comprising eleven couchette cars and ten InterCity cars (type Bm235) respectively were used to replace the missing intermediate cars.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1969, Opel three- and four-speed {{transmissions}} (three-speed standard, others optional); Powerglide {{were added}} (now four transmissions); mechanical fuel pump replaced by in-tank electric pump; power steering option; base [...] "11" [...] style notchback trim upgraded to <b>match</b> hatchback and <b>wagon</b> carpet and headliner.|$|R
50|$|Rovos Air was {{established}} in 2002 by Rohan Vos, the owner of Rovos Rail, the operator of the prestigious Pride of Africa. The company operated tourist traffic between Pretoria and Victoria Falls offering passengers a nostalgic flight in yesterday's aircraft, {{such as the one}} shown on the right, being fully refurbished and fitted with luxury seats to <b>match</b> the saloon <b>wagon</b> in their train.|$|R
50|$|During {{its peak}} years, Dover had a <b>match</b> factory, a <b>wagon</b> making business, two grist mills, two blacksmiths, an Inn and Stage Coach Station, livery stable, General Store, three cheese {{factories}}. When looking at output figures, {{two of the}} largest cheese factories in the US were in Dover. The stone house cheese factory, built between 1856 and 1865 still stands today. The stone 1878 Sage Inn & Stage Coach Station, and the General Store built in 1900 also survive.|$|R
50|$|In May 1989, {{locomotive}} 2109 was repainted in turquoise to haul a <b>matched</b> set of <b>wagons</b> for the Technorame train. This {{train was}} sponsored by the regional government of Wallonie and traveled around French-speaking Belgium displaying various high-tech items to the public for several months. At the end of this contract it re-entered regular service on both freight and passenger trains while still wearing its special colors. This continued for at least two months before it was repainted in the normal colors for the class.|$|R
2500|$|Towards evening a hawker named Gloster camped, as usual, at the station. When {{he went to}} {{the kitchen}} with his assistant, a station hand told him that the Kellys were there, to which Gloster replied, [...] "I wish they were, it would be Â£2,000 in my pocket." [...] Kelly looked up and said, [...] "What is that you say?" [...] Gloster, without waiting to give an explanation, rushed towards the wagon, and Kelly and Joe Byrne {{followed}}. McCauley was worried for the safety of Gloster and followed them. Upon reaching his wagon, the hawker searched for his revolver, but was [...] "covered" [...] by the bushrangers, and McCauley threatened, [...] "Look out Gloster, you will be shot", at the same time appealing to Kelly not to shoot him. Gloster turned and said, [...] "Who are you?" [...] Kelly replied, [...] "I am Ned Kelly, son of Red Kelly, as good a blood as any in the land, and for two pins I would put a <b>match</b> to your <b>wagon</b> and burn it." [...] The stationhands, Gloster, and Beecroft were all placed in the storeroom, under guard. The Kellys stole new suits and a revolver from Gloster's stock as they wanted to look presentable at the bank. They offered the hawker money for them to which he refused. After sunset the hostages were allowed some fresh air. Time passed quietly until two o'clock in the morning, and at that hour the outlaws gave a peculiar whistle, and Steve Hart and Joe Byrne rushed from the building. [...] McCauley was surrounded by the bushrangers and Kelly said, [...] "You are armed, we have found a lot of ammunition in the house." [...] After this episode the outlaws retired to sleep.|$|R
