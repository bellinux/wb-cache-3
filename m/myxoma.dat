5|$|Serpins {{are also}} {{expressed}} by viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (<b>myxoma),</b> are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E

25|$|Research by Australian Antarctic Division scientists, {{published}} in the 13 January 2009 edition of the British Ecological Society's Journal of Applied Ecology, suggested {{that the success of}} the feral cat eradication program has allowed the rabbit population to increase, damaging the Macquarie Island ecosystem by altering significant areas of island vegetation. However, in a comment {{published in}} the same journal other scientists argued that a number of factors (primarily a reduction {{in the use of the}} <b>Myxoma</b> virus) were almost certainly involved and the absence of cats may have been relatively minor among them. The original authors examined the issue in a later reply and concluded that the effect of the <b>Myxoma</b> virus use was small and reaffirmed their original position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Myxomas</b> {{are more}} common in women. About 10% of <b>myxomas</b> are passed down through {{families}} (inherited), as in Carney syndrome, where several other abnormalities are observed, such as skin <b>myxomas,</b> pigmentation, endocrine hyperactivity, schwannomas and epithelioid blue nevi. Such tumors are called familial <b>myxomas.</b> They tend to occur {{in more than one}} part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age than other <b>myxomas.</b>|$|R
30|$|Among CNC patients, heart <b>myxomas</b> {{occur at}} any age (median age at detection, 20 Â years), {{although}} {{at a younger age}} when compared with sporadic cardiac <b>myxomas.</b> They may be multicentric and can be found in all cardiac chambers [5, 19]. The presenting signs and symptoms derive from cardiac or embolic events, such as embolic strokes. Heart <b>myxomas</b> and emboli deriving from them are the main cause of morbidity and mortality of CNC patients. Frequently, CNC patients with heart <b>myxomas</b> have two or more operations for recurrent tumours [19, 20].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} our study was to compare the imaging {{features}} of atrial <b>myxomas</b> and thrombi using CT and to assess the accuracy of CT for determining the origin of <b>myxomas</b> in comparison with surgical findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2006 until June 2008, 23 patients (15 women, eight men; mean age, 63 +/- 14 years) with atrial <b>myxomas</b> (n = 13) and thrombi (n = 11) who underwent dual-source CT coronary angiography were included in this retrospective study. Two independent and blinded readers evaluated quantitative (CT attenuation and size) and qualitative (location, origin, shape, mobility, prolapse, and calcifications) parameters at CT. The shape and origin of <b>myxomas</b> were compared with the findings at surgery. RESULTS: No significant differences regarding the CT attenuation of <b>myxomas</b> in comparison with thrombi were found (43 +/- 14 HU vs 57 +/- 30 HU; p = 0. 23). <b>Myxomas</b> were significantly larger than thrombi (33 +/- 16 mm vs 21 +/- 7 mm; p < 0. 05). The lesions were found equally in {{the left and right}} atria (p = 0. 11). The origin (p < 0. 001), shape (p < 0. 05), mobility (p < 0. 01), and occurrence of prolapse (p < 0. 01) differed significantly between the lesions. Calcifications did not differ between the lesions (p = 0. 2). In comparison with surgery, the origin of <b>myxomas</b> was correctly evaluated by CT in 11 of 13 patients (fossa ovalis, n = 5; interatrial septum, n = 4; and lateral atrial wall, n = 2), whereas CT misclassified the origin of two <b>myxomas</b> (posterior and lateral wall left atria at CT vs fossa ovalis at surgery). CONCLUSION: Atrial <b>myxomas</b> and thrombi can be differentiated by their distinguishing features of size, origin, shape, mobility, and prolapse. CT is accurate in determining the origin of <b>myxomas</b> but may fail in some cases...|$|R

25|$|Such {{research}} has included targeting the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Australia by engineering rabbit zona pellucida glycoproteins into a recombinant <b>myxoma</b> virus. This approach has induced marginal reduction of fertility in laboratory rabbits {{with some of}} the glycoproteins. Further improvement of efficacy is necessary before such an approach is ready for field trials. Research has also targeted the house mouse (Mus domesticus) in Australia by engineering murine zona pellucida antigens into a recombinant ectromelia virus and a recombinant cytomegalovirus. The latter approach has induced permanent infertility when injected into laboratory mice. However, there is some attenuation of efficacy when it is actually transmitted virally.|$|E
25|$|Many viruses encode {{proteins}} that can inhibit apoptosis. Several viruses encode viral homologs of Bcl-2. These homologs can inhibit proapoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK, which {{are essential for}} the activation of apoptosis. Examples of viral Bcl-2 proteins include the Epstein-Barr virus BHRF1 protein and the adenovirus E1B 19K protein. Some viruses express caspase inhibitors that inhibit caspase activity and {{an example is the}} CrmA protein of cowpox viruses. Whilst a number of viruses can block the effects of TNF and Fas. For example, the M-T2 protein of <b>myxoma</b> viruses can bind TNF preventing it from binding the TNF receptor and inducing a response. Furthermore, many viruses express p53 inhibitors that can bind p53 and inhibit its transcriptional transactivation activity. As a consequence, p53 cannot induce apoptosis, since it cannot induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins. The adenovirus E1B-55K protein and the hepatitis B virus HBx protein are examples of viral {{proteins that}} can perform such a function.|$|E
40|$|Cardiac <b>myxomas</b> are {{significant}} causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Their genetic background is presently unknown. Recently, linkage analysis in cardiac <b>myxomas</b> of Carney complex patients {{has indicated that}} 2 p 16 and 17 q 2 might carry genes responsible {{for the development of}} hereditary cardiac <b>myxomas.</b> Less is known about sporadic cardiac <b>myxomas.</b> To date, cytogenetic analysis has been performed on 13 sporadic cases, and no specific rearrangement has been deduced. We studied 15 sporadic cardiac <b>myxomas</b> and reviewed the literature. Ten of the present cases revealed abnormal karyotypes with clonal and nonclonal rearrangements including dicentric chromosomes and telomeric associations. No cytogenetic evidence was found for a role of 2 p 16 in the development of sporadic cases. Region 17 q 2 was involved in structural rearrangements, but to a lesser extent than other regions. Structural rearrangements involving regions 12 p 1 and 17 p 1 are more frequently present and might therefore harbor genes important for the development of sporadic cardiac <b>myxomas.</b> (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Myxomas</b> are {{the most}} {{significant}} cardiac tumors, {{not only because of}} their frequency but also because the potential for total cure after surgical removal is high.

5000|$|Some {{symptoms}} of <b>myxoma</b> {{may be associated}} with the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) by the <b>myxoma.</b> [...] High levels of IL-6 {{may be associated with}} a higher risk of embolism of the <b>myxoma.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although a <b>myxoma</b> is not cancer, {{complications}} are common. Untreated, a <b>myxoma</b> {{can lead}} to an embolism (tumor cells breaking off and traveling with the bloodstream), which can block blood flow. <b>Myxoma</b> fragments can move to the brain, eye, or limbs.|$|E
40|$|Neoangiogenesis is {{involved}} in the development and progression of malignant tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors have been designated a central part in this process. Since the significance of the assessment of angiogenesis in soft tissue tumors is still a matter of debate, we investigated the vascularisation of cardiac <b>myxomas</b> and compared it with pulmonary artery sarcomas (PAS). Angiogenesis in 18 PAS and 20 <b>myxomas</b> was assessed by morphometry. An immunohistochemical analysis of growth factors and their receptors, HIF- 1 alpha and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) was performed. Results showed that microvessel density (MVD) in PAS was significantly higher at the border of necrosis versus the areas without necrosis but no difference was observed between PAS and <b>myxomas.</b> Vascular surface area (VSA) and intervascular distances showed a higher vascularisation at the border of necrosis compared to <b>myxomas,</b> which was not significant. VEGF expression was higher in PAS compared to <b>myxomas</b> and was prominent at the sites of necrosis. HIF- 1 alpha expression was marked at the border of necrosis in PAS but was absent in <b>myxomas.</b> Infiltration of the macrophages was significantly higher in <b>myxomas</b> compared to the sarcomas. VEGFR- 2 expression was detected in a subset of tumor cells and in blood vessels mainly at the tumor periphery, whereas VEGFR- 1 was weakly expressed in the tumors but prominent in the macrophages in cardiac <b>myxomas.</b> PDGF receptors and their ligands are strongly present in <b>myxomas</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} in the sarcomas. In conclusion, benign and malignant cardiovascular tumors with a different pathophysiology develop a comparable vascularisation. Hypoxia appears to be the strongest inducer of neoangiogenesis in the sarcomas. The expression of receptor tyrosine kinases of the VEGF family provides a basis for an adjuvant therapy...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMazabraud's {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} the combination of one or more intramuscular <b>myxomas</b> and fibrous dysplasia of bone. The diagnosis is important given the increased risk of malignant transformation of the bone lesions. We report a case in a 56 -year-old patient with a 14 -year follow-up during which multiple surgical procedures were required to remove <b>myxomas</b> (present at more than 15 sites). The resected <b>myxomas</b> were large and progressive. Unique features in this case include the long follow-up and the number of <b>myxomas</b> considerably above the average for this disease. Eighty other cases of Mazabraud's syndrome have been reported. The condition predominantly affects middle-aged women (mean age, 44 years). The bone lesions may be monostotic or polyostotic. Mazabraud's syndrome may be difficult to distinguish from soft-tissue sarcoma or neurofibromatosis. Identification of the underlying genetic abnormality provides diagnostic confirmation, as shown in our patient.

50|$|The {{significance}} {{between the}} difference of the two has now been elucidated with study of the rabbit-lethal <b>myxoma</b> virus.

However, inoculation of the <b>myxoma</b> virus in many species of rabbit shows that only one species of rabbit is affected, the rest being completely unharmed by the virus (lack of even viral shedding). This has been determined to {{be a result of}} the <b>myxoma</b> virus's inability to suppress other species' interferon expression, and hence resulting in the interferon in turn suppressing the <b>myxoma</b> virus.|$|E
