Significant secondary walls within the great precinct sub divide the land, notably the south wall of the <b>Dripping</b> <b>Pan.</b> The precinct walls have otherwise generally been removed for housing development, the railway and a car park near the Mount. Fragments of the Great Gate (circa. 1200 AD) exist in a rearranged form adjacent to the east end of St John’s Church. The destruction of the walls has continued in recent years following the grant of Planning Permission by Lewes District Council to Lewes Football Club to demolish a section of the longest surviving extent of the structure along Ham Lane in 2006 for unrealised business objectives whilst a further adjacent length subsequently delaminated and fell in 2008 with repairs started in late 2009.|$|R

Army vehicle maintenance shops typically use <b>drip</b> <b>pans</b> and absorbing materials, mostly clay-based compounds, to clean up spills. The use of absorbents (sorbents) to clean spills is the preferred alternative by DOD and Army installations. The U. S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) conducted this study to evaluate and summarize {{the properties of the}} many commercially available absorbing materials. This study concludes that no single solution exists to control oil drips and clean up small oil spills at Army motor pools. Most installations require a combination of <b>drip</b> <b>pans,</b> sorption pads, and sorbing loose material. The study further found that: 1. While election of sorbents is specific to installation and application, in general, cellulose products are the best choice, followed by synthetic products. 2. Disposal of the saturated sorbents is a critical factor in selecting sorbents. Regulatory requirements and cost are key elements in deciding disposal procedures. 3. Training is required for all Army staff on characteristics of different products and their applications to avoid wrong applications that may result in environmental problems...|$|R
