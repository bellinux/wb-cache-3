2500|$|Much {{credit for}} the [...]357's early {{development}} is given to hunter and experimenter Elmer Keith. Keith's early work in loading the [...]38 Special to increasingly higher-pressure levels {{was made possible by}} the availability of heavy, target-shooting-oriented revolvers like the Smith & Wesson [...]38-44 [...] "Heavy Duty" [...] and [...] "Outdoorsman", [...]38-caliber revolvers built on [...]44-caliber frames. [...] The [...]38-44 HV load used the [...]38-Special cartridge loaded to a much higher velocity than standard [...]38-Special ammunition. [...] The [...]38-44 revolvers were made by using a [...]44 Special size gun with the barrel bored to accept [...]357-caliber bullets (the true bullet diameter of the [...]38 Special) and the cylinder bored to accept [...] cartridges (where the name “38 Special” originated). [...] Since the frame, cylinder, and barrel were much stronger than the standard [...]38 Special components, it was capable of withstanding much higher pressures. [...] The [...]38-44 HV round, while no longer available, was in most cases the equal of the later [...]357 Magnum, which works at more than double the pressure of standard [...]38 Special. [...] The [...]357 Magnum addresses the safety issues which earlier cartridges had by lengthening the case by approximately , preventing the high-pressure [...]357 cartridge from chambering (fitting) in a firearm designed for the shorter, lower-pressure [...]38 Special. [...] Elmer Keith also contributed the Keith-style bullet, which increased the mass of bullet located outside the cartridge case, while leaving more room inside the case for powder. The Keith bullet also employed a large, flat <b>meplat,</b> thus enabling rapid energy transfer for greater wounding properties. At the same time, this bullet design does not deform like a hollow point, and as a result achieves greater penetration. These characteristics of the Keith bullet make it very suitable for hunting applications as well as for target shooting.|$|E
50|$|Pointing the meplats {{involves}} {{pressing the}} bullets into a special die. This decreases {{the size of}} the <b>meplat</b> which increases the ballistic coefficient and reduces drag, time of flight and wind drift. Some target shooters sort their bullets by weight, point their bullets and then trim them to the same <b>meplat</b> width to ensure the greatest possible consistency.|$|E
50|$|For special {{purposes}} the 7U1 subsonic cartridge with a {{black and}} green painted <b>meplat</b> and CAP cartridge for underwater were developed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meplats</b> {{are often}} used to {{increase}} the bullet's wounding ability.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Meplat</b> (from the French word [...] "méplat" [...] meaning [...] "flat") is the {{technical}} {{term for the}} flat or open tip on the nose of a bullet. The shape of the <b>meplat</b> is important in determining how the bullet moves through the air. In particular {{the size and shape}} of the <b>meplat</b> has a significant effect on the ballistic coefficient of a bullet. If the meplats on a group of bullets are uneven, the trajectory of the bullets will vary which will cause the bullets to strike the target at different vertical locations. Bullets of the same weight which have similar-shaped meplats will travel through the air in nearly identical fashion, making it easier to group shots together or hit a target multiple times. For this reason, competitive shooters and snipers often trim or point their meplats to uniform shape.|$|E
50|$|Cartridge, Ball, F1A1 tip: 5.56×45mm with {{optimized}} projectile {{having a}} modified boat tail length and <b>meplat</b> diameter, redesigned case thickness, new primer cup design, and AR2210V01 propellant.|$|E
50|$|To {{control the}} {{expansion}} of a bullet, <b>meplat</b> design and materials are engineered. The <b>meplat</b> designs are: flat; round to pointed depending on the ogive; hollow pointed which can be large in diameter and shallow or narrow in diameter and deep and truncated which is a long narrow punched hole {{in the end of}} a monolithic-solid type bullet. The materials used to make bullets are: pure lead; alloyed lead for hardness; gilding metal jacket which is a copper alloy of nickel and zinc to promote higher velocities; pure copper; copper alloy of bronze with tungsten steel alloy inserts to promote weight.|$|E
50|$|Coincidentally, {{the shape}} of the nose of an {{axisymmetric}} projectile that gives it the least possible aerodynamic drag at hypersonic speeds always has a <b>meplat,</b> the diameter of which depends on the length of the nose.|$|E
50|$|Trimming the <b>meplat</b> {{decreases}} the bullet's ballistic coefficient, increasing drag {{and making it}} more susceptible to wind drift. So even though the grouping will be tighter, the time of flight and wind drift will be slightly greater.|$|E
5000|$|Originally Keith {{specified}} a <b>meplat</b> {{that was}} 65% of the bullet caliber, but later increased it to a 70% <b>meplat.</b> The other distinguishing {{characteristics of a}} [...] "Keith-style" [...] SWC are a double radius ogive, beveled crimp groove, three equal width driving bands, wide square bottomed grease groove, and a plain base with sharp corners. The wide forward driving band helps keep the bullet aligned as it jumps across the cylinder gap. Because of the three wide equal width driving bands, the total bearing surface is greater than half the overall length of the bullet. This large bearing surface helps the Keith-style SWC to be an inherently accurate bullet, and minimizes leading from gas blow-by. The wide square bottom grease groove holds ample lubricant.|$|E
50|$|A hollow-point {{boat-tail}} bullet is a match-grade bullet {{design that}} uses {{the concept of a}} teardrop-shaped tail to give it a lower drag coefficient and make it produce less turbulence in its wake. Only the base of the bullet has a boat tail-like shape - the <b>meplat</b> is still pointed. Some hollow-point boat-tail bullets with longer, more aerodynamic profiles are known as very-low-drag bullets.|$|E
50|$|Rounds of {{the same}} caliber but with different-shaped meplats {{sometimes}} cannot be loaded into the same firearm. The <b>meplat</b> {{plays an important role}} in the loading of weapons whose ammunition is guided into the chamber by a mechanism (e.g., auto-loading, lever action or bolt action), though this usually is not important in weapons whose rounds are chambered by hand (e.g., single shots, double rifles, drillings and revolvers) rather than by a mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree to}} which {{permanent}} and temporary cavitation occur {{is dependent on the}} mass, diameter, material, design and velocity of the bullet. This is because bullets crush tissue, and do not cut it. A bullet constructed with a half diameter ogive designed <b>meplat</b> and hard, solid copper alloy material may crush only the tissue {{directly in front of the}} bullet. This type of bullet (monolithic-solid rifle bullet) is conducive to causing more temporary cavitation as the tissue flows around the bullet, resulting in a deep and narrow wound channel. A bullet constructed with a two diameter, hollow point ogive designed <b>meplat</b> and low-antimony lead-alloy core with a thin gilding metal jacket material will crush tissue in front and to the sides as the bullet expands. Due to the energy expended in bullet expansion, velocity is lost more quickly. This type of bullet (hollow-point hand gun bullet) is conducive to causing more permanent cavitation as the tissue is crushed and accelerated into other tissues by the bullet, causing a shorter and wider wound channel. The exception to this general rule is non-expanding bullets which are long relative to their diameter. These tend to destabilize and yaw (tumble) soon after impact, increasing both temporary and permanent cavitation.|$|E
5000|$|For bullets {{designed}} for target shooting, {{some such as}} the Sierra [...] "Matchking" [...] incorporate a cavity in the nose, called the <b>meplat.</b> This allows the manufacturer to maintain a greater consistency in tip shape and thus aerodynamic properties among bullets of the same design, {{at the expense of}} a slightly decreased ballistic coefficient and higher drag. The result is a slightly decreased overall accuracy between bullet trajectory and barrel direction, as well as an increased susceptibility to wind drift, but closer grouping of subsequent shots due to bullet consistency, often increasing the shooter's perceived accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|Lost River Ballistic Technologies (statement of Mr. Warren Jensen) {{stated that}} [...] "the [...]408 CheyTac {{is the first}} bullet/rifle system that {{utilizes}} {{what they call a}} balanced flight projectile. To achieve balanced flight the linear drag has to be balanced with the rotational drag to keep the very fine nose (<b>meplat)</b> of the bullet pointed directly into the oncoming air. It should result in very little precession and yaw at extreme range and allows accurate flight back through the transonic region. This is hard to achieve for small arms projectiles. Mathematically you are at a great disadvantage trying to achieve balanced flight with a lead core non mono metal bullet. The rotational mass/surface area ratio is too high."https://books.google.com/books?id=SSHpsKbW1cIC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21 ...|$|E
5000|$|The basic SWC design {{consists}} of a roughly conical nose, truncated with a flat point (called a <b>meplat),</b> sitting on a cylinder (A at right). The base of the cone is slightly smaller in diameter than the cylinder, leaving a sharp shoulder. The flat nose punches a clean hole in the target, rather than tearing it like a round nose bullet would, and the sharp shoulder enlarges the hole neatly, allowing easy and accurate scoring of the target. The SWC design offers better external ballistics than the wadcutter, as its conical nose produces less drag than the flat cylinder. A typical modification is to alter the conical section to make the sides concave, to reduce the bullet mass, or convex, to increase it. B shows a concave sided SWC, typical of a lightweight [...]45 ACP bullet used in [...] bullseye shooting. The concave sides reduce the bullet weight, and thus the recoil, while keeping the overall length of the bullet long enough to feed reliably in a semi-automatic pistol such as the M1911 commonly found in bullseye competitions.|$|E
5000|$|Winchester {{discontinued}} the Black Talon line {{completely in}} 2000. The “Ranger SXT” ammunition sold later by Winchester {{is very similar}} to the Black Talon though without the black Lubalox coating on the bullet. Among shooters, a running joke is that SXT stands for “Same eXact Thing", though the official branding is “Supreme eXpansion Technology”. However, there are differences in the anatomy of the bullets which become apparent when carefully examined side by side. The hollow point cavity dimensions and angles of the <b>meplat</b> were altered to enhance reliability of expansion, though the basic [...] "reverse taper" [...] design pioneered by the Black Talon was retained. This [...] "reverse taper" [...] refers to the bullet's jacket being thicker at the tip than toward the base, enhancing rigidity which allows the sharp petals to remain largely perpendicular to the wound path, unlike traditional designs where the expanding jacket petals would peel back almost completely behind the expanded lead mushroom. This difference is obvious after firing into ballistic gelatin.In 2007 Winchester updated their Ranger SXT line and renamed it Ranger T-Series. Besides further dimensional changes to the hollow point for reliable expansion, the distinctive perpendicular petals were made longer yet more rounded at the tips to retain stiffness.|$|E

40|$|Six-degrees-of-freedom {{trajectory}} modelling {{which is}} used within the PHANTOM/MAN wound ballistics code and in-house GTRAJ 6 DOF exterior ballistics code requires accurately predicted aerodynamic coefficients to determine impact conditions. This paper describes a method of using CFD simulations to pre-determine aerodynamic coefficients for projectile configurations with varying ogive shape and length, <b>meplat,</b> afterbody length, and boattail length and angle at selected Mach numbers. Storing these matrix data in an aeroprediction database and in conjunction with ballistic range test data, the TRIPLE AP (A 3 P) engineering code can quickly determine aerodynamic coefficients, stability characteristics, trajectories, and other information for the projectile designer {{in a matter of}} seconds. This is illustrated with the quadratic-yaw drag coefficient for which experimental data are less abundant than for other coefficients such as the zero-yaw drag coefficient. By implementing the CFD results within the TRIPLE AP (A 3 P) database we were able to reduce the error in predicted static aerodynamic coefficients to about 5 - 8 % for Mach numbers from 0. 4 to 5...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a popular}} trend among handgun hunters towards heavier bullets, {{with the goal of}} {{increased}} penetration. While a 300 grain bullet in either a. 44 Magnum or a. 45 Colt will shoot through a deer from pretty much any angle, many hunters dream of hunting larger game, and {{spend a lot of time}} thinking about even heavier bullets to obtain similar performance on elk, moose, buffalo and the like. This door to this level of revolver performance was opened by J. D. Jones back in the early 1980 s when he introduced his cast bullet designs, and most notably the 320 grain SSK. 44 Magnum bullet. At that point in time, most bullet manufacturers were limiting their. 44 bullets to 250 - 265 grains. J. D. saw a need for well-designed heavier bullets and answered that need by developing the JDJ line of bullet moulds. In the years that have passed since, others have followed suit with their own designs. The question then arises as to when does more weight become too much weight for the. 44 Magnum? The "conventional wisdom " is that a 300 grain bullet (either cast or jacketed) is the optimum "heavy bullet " weight for the. 44 Magnum, and that anything heavier compromises terminal performance by limiting muzzle velocity. Is this really true, or is it just more gun-shop hot air? The 320 grain SSK has an excellent reputation, having taken everything from elk to elephant, but are some of the newer. 44 heavyweights even better? There are commercial. 44 Magnum loads that go up to 350 grains, and commercial hardcast bullets that allow the handloader to go as heavy as 405 grains. For example, Randy Garrett uses 310 grain bullets (with a. 320 " <b>meplat)</b> at 1325 fps in his Sledgehammer. 44 Magnum loads (Garrett Cartridges). Cor-Bon has hardcast heavyweight loads featuring a 305 grain flat-point penetrator at 1300 fps, and a 320 grainer at 1270 fps. Buffalo Bore offers a 305 grain LBT LFN at 1325 fps, and has a commentary on their website about overly large meplats and how they can limit penetration. These are some of the 300 + grain loads that are marketed for all. 44 Magnum revolvers, there are also heavier loads marketed specifically for the Ruger Super Redhawk that are too long for th...|$|E
