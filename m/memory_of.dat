40|$|International audienceTwo studies {{tested the}} impact of autobiographical recall of general versus {{specific}} academic success or failure on actual task performance. As expected, {{it was found that}} general <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> failure and specific <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> success resulted in worse performance than general <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> success and specific <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> failure. In Study 1, this performance pattern was obtained on a standard math test. In Study 2, it was replicated on a test of intellectual ability, and a mediation by fear of failure was documented. The present findings offer direct evidence that autobiographical <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> success and failure impact actual performance and also reveal the role <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> specificity in this influence.

40|$|International audienceAutobiographical {{memories}} {{are a major}} feature of mental life in humans. However, research {{on the influence of}} autobiographical recall on actual behaviour is scarce. We predicted and found that general <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> failure and specific <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> success resulted in worse performance than general <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> success and specific <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> failure. This performance pattern was mediated by task appraisal, suggesting that autobiographical <b>memories</b> (<b>of</b> failure and success) impact performance by shaping the perception of the upcoming task. Combined with the fact that these effects occurred even when the content <b>of</b> autobiographical <b>memories</b> was unrelated to the upcoming task, the present research represents an important step forward in understanding how autobiographical recall influences actual behaviour...|$|R
