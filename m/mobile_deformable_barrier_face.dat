40|$|Side-impact {{safety of}} {{passenger}} cars is assessed in Europe in a full-scale test using a moving barrier. The {{front of this}} <b>barrier</b> is <b>deformable</b> and represents the stiffness of an 'average' car. The EU Directive 96 / 27 /EC on side impact protection has adopted the EEVC Side Impact Test Procedure, including the original performance specification for the <b>barrier</b> <b>face</b> when impacting a flat dynamometric rigid wall. The requirements of the <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>face,</b> as laid down in the Directive, are related to geometrical characteristics, deformation characteristics and energy dissipation figures. Due to these limited requirements, many variations are possible in designing a <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>face.</b> As a result, several <b>barrier</b> <b>face</b> designs are in the market. However, research institutes and car manufacturers report significant differences in test results when using these different devices. It appears that the present approval test {{is not able to}} distinguish between the different designs that may perform differently when they impact real vehicles. Therefore, EEVC Working Group 13 has developed a number of tests to evaluate the different designs. In these tests the <b>barrier</b> <b>faces</b> are loaded and deformed in a specific and/or more representative way. <b>Barrier</b> <b>faces</b> of different design have been evaluated.

40|$|In {{the next}} 20 years {{the share of}} small {{electric}} vehicles (SEVs) will increase especially in urban areas. SEVs show distinctive design differences compared to traditional vehicles. Thus the consequences of impacts of SEVs with vulnerable road users (VRUs) and other vehicles will be different from traditional collisions. No assessment concerning vehicle safety is defined for vehicles within European L 7 e category currently. Focus of the elaborated methodology is to define appropriate test scenarios for this vehicle category to be used within a virtual tool chain. A virtual tool chain has to be defined for the realization of a guideline of virtual certification. The derivation and development of new test conditions for SEVs are described and are {{the main focus of}} this work. As key methodology a prospective methodical analysis under consideration of future aspects like pre-crash safety systems is applied. The studies show that certain collision types will be reduced in numbers and in average collision severity. Based on the evaluation following tests are proposed. Frontal: oblique (30 °), test speed 35 km/h, 1, 300 kg <b>Mobile</b> Progressive <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (MPDB); Side: 90 °, Advanced European <b>Mobile</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (AE-MDB), barrier speed 40 km/h; Pedestrian safety: seven pedestrian impact locations, 2 speed ranges, four different percentiles.

The focus of the presented work is on SEVs in L 7 e category, for which no specific, urban area relevant safety regulations are available.

The work performed to date {{has focused on the}} structural performance of vehicles, with the aim of providing a safe environment {{for the protection of the}} occupants in which intelligent restraint systems of the future could operate. This paper outlines the present understanding of compatibility for frontal impact collisions and reports the current state of development of three possible test procedures to address the fundamental issues, namely structural interaction, frontal stiffness matching and passenger compartment strength. Recent advances in the development of a <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>face</b> for the full-width test to assess structural interaction, using high-resolution load cell wall measurements, are described. Analysis of the load cell wall data collected in EuroNCAP tests, to address the frontal stiffness problem, is reported together with initial work to investigate the repeatability of the passenger compartment strength test.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of structural interaction {{has been identified}} as the main challenge of the unresolved problem of frontal crash compatibility. With this background, two questions are raised: Does a better structural interaction correspond with higher safety and crash compatibility? Are current test approaches able to evaluate structural properties? Considering the structural mechanics of collisions, it is hypothesized that a poor structural interaction does not necessarily result in lower safety and should be considered together with compartment strength and restraint systems. This hypothesis is confirmed by reviewing some crash results from other studies. A spring-mass vehicle model is also used to verify the hypothesis. Finally, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted to find the answers to the two questions. For this study three different variations of a vehicle model are created, which represent different structural properties of the passenger car fleet. The crash performance of these models is analyzed in different car-to-car and car-to-barrier tests. Results of the car-to-car tests show that better structural interaction often makes the vehicle more aggressive. Generally, better structural interaction increases crash pulse and reduces intrusions. Depending on vehicle design and crash configuration, the intrusions or the crash pulse become more important as to why good or poor structural interaction cannot be overall related to more crash compatibility or occupant safety. Our criticism of the current assessment approaches for frontal crash compatibility is the establishment of a direct link between good structural interaction and higher safety. These approaches do not consider the effect of higher crash pulses due to the better structural interaction. Our recommendation is to assess the partner protection through metrics about intrusions and crash pulse of the partner, without direct {{assessment of}} the structural interaction. Instead, the test configuration should be able to reflect structural properties in intrusions or crash pulse. Results of the car-to-barrier tests show that the Progressive <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> can reflect structural issues correctly. However, the developed metrics for this barrier result in incomprehensive interpretations. Results of the tests with other barriers are inconsistent with the structural properties of the vehicles. Finally, an exemplary test concept with the Advanced European <b>Mobile</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> is presented as an alternative assessment approach. Simulation results of the proposed assessment approach show good consistency with the crash performance of the vehicles in the car-to-car tests. Combination of this test concept with the Full-Width Rigid Barrier test can be used to assess the safety and crash compatibility of passenger cars...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the project}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) was to define an {{integrated}} set of test procedures and associated metrics to assess a vehicle’s frontal impact protection, which includes self- and partner- protection. For {{the development of the}} set, two different full-width tests (full-width <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [FWDB] test, full- width rigid barrier test) and three different offset tests (offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [ODB] test, progressive <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [PDB] test, moveable <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> with the PDB <b>barrier</b> <b>face</b> [MPDB] test) have been investigated. Different compatibility assessment procedures were analysed and metrics for assessing structural interaction (structural alignment, vertical and horizontal load spreading) as well as several promising metrics for the PDB/MPDB barrier were developed. The final assessment approach consists of a combination of the most suitable full-width and offset tests. For the full- width test (FWDB), a metric was developed to address structural alignment based on load cell wall information in the first 40 ms of the test. For the offset test (ODB), the existing ECE R 94 was chosen.

40|$|Objective: To improve vehicle {{safety in}} frontal collisions, the crash {{compatibility}} between the colliding vehicles is crucial. Compatibility aims to improve both {{the self and}} partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Methods: Within the Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research (FIMCAR) project, different frontal impact test procedures (offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [ODB] test as currently used for Economic Commission for Europe [ECE] R 94, progressive <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test as proposed by France for a new ECE regulation, moveable <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test as discussed worldwide, full-width rigid barrier test as used in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 208, and full-width <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test) were analyzed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test program and numerical simulations. Results: The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full-width test procedure with a deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current offset test as a frontal impact assessment approach that also addresses compatibility. Conclusions: By adding a full-width test to the current ODB test it is possible to better address the issues of structural misalignment and injuries resulting from high acceleration accidents as observed in the current fleet. The estimated benefit ranges from a 5 to 12 percent reduction of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from frontal impact accidents. By using a deformable element in the full-width test, the test conditions are more representative of real-world situations with respect to acceleration pulse, restraint system triggering time, and deformation pattern of the front structure. The test results are therefore expected to better represent real-world performance of the tested car. Furthermore, the assessment of the structural alignment is more robust than in the rigid wall test. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

40|$|Automotive safety {{regulations}} vary {{in different parts}} of the world. Dynamic side impact regulations, for example, are different than the ones in Europe. United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the European Union (EU) have each produced their own distinct testing procedures such as different <b>deformable</b> <b>barriers,</b> impact configurations and anthropomorphic test devices (dummies). Although both test procedures have the same final objective, estimate occupant responses in side impact, they differ greatly in execution. One of the main differences in testing is the Moving <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (MDB) used. The US MDB is designed to represent an average midsize vehicle in the US market, while the European MDB represents a mid size vehicle in Europe. The objective of this paper is to develop a finite element model representing the US <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> for use in side impact simulations. Special emphasis is made on using the various available material models in LS-DYNA and the correct adhesive properties to predict the correct behavior of the honeycomb material. These models are validated to available full-scale tests. As known by many researchers, the main difficulty of MDB modeling is the prediction of the barrier complex failure modes. In side impact tests, the severe shear deformation of the honeycomb material, full densification of barrier edge, rupture of aluminum cover sheets, and tearing of honeycomb blocks are often observed. This complex pattern of honeycomb material failure mode makes it difficult to predict. Numerical instabilities, such as negative volume, sever hourglassing, and inaccurate predictions are often experienced...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} load cell moving <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (LCMDB) tests as a means of assessing frontal impact compatibility between vehicles. An LCMDB is employed to enable assessment of relevant partner-protection characteristics in addition to self-protection performance in a front-to-front crash test. The ability to control key characteristics of compatibility in LCMDB tests enables force measurements on the load cell wall to be used to assess structural interaction, frontal force level and passenger compartment strength. In this study, LCMDB tests have been conducted with various deformable elements to determine how well they correlated with fixed barrier tests or vehicle-to-vehicle tests. Firstly, barrier load cell data measured in a full-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test are compared with data measured in a full width <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (FWDB) test at 56 km/h. In addition, some compatibility metrics such as average height of force (AHOF) and force distribution are compared. Secondly, an offset-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted to evaluate the passenger compartment strength for small cars in an overload condition. Force measurements of the load cell wall are compared with data obtained from an offset <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB) test at 64 km/h. Finally, an oblique-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted and the test results are compared with vehicle-to-vehicle tests and with fixed oblique barrier tests at 50 km/h in terms of the vehicle and occupant kinematics.
