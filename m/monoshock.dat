25|$|The Yamaha YZ450F won the AMA Supercross Championship {{two years}} in a row, in 2008 with Chad Reed, and 2009 James Stewart. Yamaha was the first to build a {{production}} <b>monoshock</b> motocross bike (1975 for 250 and 400, 1976 for 125) {{and one of the first}} to have a water-cooled motocross production bike (1977 in works bikes, 1981 in off-the-shelf bikes). Yamaha's first Motocross competition four-stroke bike, the YZ400F, won the 1998 USA outdoor national Championship with factory rider Doug Henry.|$|E
25|$|A {{lack of a}} drive {{had left}} Alboreto in a {{difficult}} situation and he later admitted he contemplated retirement – an option of which his family were very much in favour. Soon enough, however, he was offered a drive at his former employer Tyrrell, which he accepted. Thanks to Alboreto's Marlboro backing, the team managed to fund his wages. The relationship between Alboreto and team boss, Ken Tyrrell, soon turned sour. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Alboreto was told to drive the 1988 model Tyrrell 017, due to the newer 018 model not being completed. Team-mate Jonathan Palmer was chosen to drive the new <b>monoshock</b> 018. Meanwhile, the Italian {{would have to wait}} until the following day for the 018 and so he decided not to accept this. The result was Alboreto boycotting the Thursday practice session. This lack of professional behaviour did not impress the team, and finishing in fifth position during the race did not help the 32-year-old's cause. He also finished 3rd at the next race in Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Rear Suspension: Uni-Trak rising rate <b>monoshock,</b> {{adjustable}} preload.|$|E
5000|$|The 2012 Mastretta MXT {{was officially}} {{introduced}} to the international motoring press at the Los Angeles motor show in November 2011. In production, it is constructed on a tube-frame monocoque chassis, using double wishbone suspension pieces front and rear, carrying coil springs and <b>monoshocks.</b> Carbon-fiber body elements and aluminum elements in the chassis contribute to a low curb weight of 930 kg. The engine is Ford's Duratec in-line 4-cylinder, with an announced power output of [...] and 348Nm of torque connected to a 5-speed manual gearbox.|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s, Von LMO {{collaborated with}} the San Francisco area bands <b>Monoshock</b> and OATS. Both were very short-lived.|$|E
50|$|Started bacing: Mid 1974 at 14 years old. His father {{brought him}} a <b>monoshock</b> BMX bicycle and he tried out racing.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, {{motorcycle}} rear suspension design and performance underwent tremendous advances. The primary goal and {{result of these}} advances were increased rear wheel travel, as measured in the how far the rear wheel could move up and down. Before this period of intense focus on rear suspension performance, most off-road motorcycles had rear wheel travel of about 3.5 - 4 inch (9 - 10 cm). At {{the end of this}} period, most of these motorcycles had rear wheel travel of approximately 12 inch (30 cm). At the beginning of this period, various rear suspension designs were used to reach this degree of performance. However, {{by the end of this}} period, a design consisting of using only one shock absorber (instead of two) was universally accepted and used. Motorcycles with only one shock absorber are called <b>monoshock</b> motorcycles. The performance of <b>monoshock</b> motorcycles was vastly superior to twin shock motorcycles. Accordingly, this design distinction is readily used to categorize motorcycles. With the exception of Bentley and Draper system (New Imperial and Brough machines) and the HRD (later Vincent) system both developed and patented in the 1920s it is only since the 1980s that <b>monoshock</b> motorcycles have been the norm, the term [...] "twinshock" [...] is now used to categorize vintage motorcycles. This distinction is important in that it provides classes used for vintage motorcycle competition. For example, vintage motocross races are held for older motocross motorcycles. To prevent the better-performing <b>monoshock</b> motorcycles from dominating the competition, there are separate competition classes for <b>monoshock</b> and twinshock motorcycles, which prevents them from competing directly against each other.|$|E
50|$|The FJR1300 uses a {{five-speed}} {{manual gearbox}} with wide ratio gears. Final drive is via shaft, encased within the swingarm, which has <b>monoshock</b> suspension with remote quick-set two position adjustable pre-load.|$|E
50|$|The RSV 1000 R Factory {{comes with}} fully {{adjustable}} Öhlins Racing rear <b>monoshock</b> and adjustable Öhlins steering damper, blue anodized forged aluminium wheels, frame finished in black, and carbon fibre parts.|$|E
5000|$|The DT50M {{was fitted}} with twin rear shocks and 19"/17" [...] {{front and rear}} wheels, this is in {{contrast}} to the later model DT50MX, which had larger 21"/18" [...] wheels and a <b>monoshock</b> rear suspension.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the maintenance-free lifters, the Madura had a self-adjusting hydraulically actuated clutch, and a low-maintenance, shaft final drive. The rear suspension was a sophisticated <b>monoshock</b> arrangement that used a single rear swingarm tube to carry the driveshaft as well.|$|E
50|$|BMW's {{patented}} telelever front suspension {{appears at}} first glance to be conventional telescopic fork, but the fork tubes contain neither springs nor damping. Instead, a wishbone and an inboard <b>monoshock</b> perform suspension duties, and the forks serve to locate the front wheel and control steering.|$|E
5000|$|The TRX has a half fairing, clip-on {{handlebars}} and mildly rear-set footrests. The {{front forks}} are conventional telescopics, and the rear suspension is a rising-rate <b>monoshock</b> unit. There is meagre provision {{to carry a}} passenger, and MCN declared: [...] "comfort’s not brilliant for the pillion".|$|E
50|$|Modenas ACE 115 has {{launched}} their new model after the Modenas CT. The concept of this bike is scooter with moped which mean the bike have 2 characteristics. This bike also has new feature on it, {{there is a}} vertical <b>monoshock</b> like that on the Ducati Panigale.|$|E
50|$|The main {{features}} are rear <b>monoshock</b> rear suspension, a manual five-speed short gear ratio transmission, dual camshaft engine, lightweight chassis construction, 17 inch alloy cast wheels and front disc brake, {{most of which}} are rarely found in underbones. Some suzuki FX125s were supplied with spoked wheels.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{consists}} of a tubular steel trellis. For the suspension, an Öhlins 43 mm upside-down fully adjustable fork {{is used for the}} front while a fully adjustable <b>monoshock</b> also from Ohlins is mounted {{on the left side of}} the rear wheel. Total wheelbase is 1425 mm (56.1 in).|$|E
50|$|The Himalayan {{features}} a half-duplex split cradle frame. Suspension is telescopic {{in the front}} while the rear is provided with <b>monoshock</b> suspension. Front forks are 41 mm with 200 mm of travel and the rear suspension offers 180 mm of travel. The motorcycle has a ground clearance of 220 mm.|$|E
50|$|A {{cousin to}} the Hawk GT, the NTV 600 'Revere' was {{available}} in Europe from 1988 to 1997. It had an integrated steel frame, larger fuel tank (19 litres or 4.2 imperial gallons), a lower and stubbier silencer, shaft drive, single-sided alloy swinging arm at rear with adjustable <b>monoshock</b> and a centre stand. It was seen as expensive for what was on offer.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Uddevalla, Sweden, Andersson began {{racing in}} the motocross world championships for the Husqvarna factory, {{finishing}} second behind Suzuki's Joël Robert in the 1971 250cc motocross world championship. For the 1972 season, Andersson {{was hired by}} the Yamaha to help develop their new motorcycle with its innovative rear suspension using a single shock absorber called a <b>monoshock.</b> He again came in second place to Robert. By the 1973 season, Yamaha's <b>monoshock</b> suspension outclassed the competition, taking Andersson to his first world championship ahead of Adolf Weil and Heikki Mikkola [...] Andersson {{was a member of the}} victorious Swedish 1974 Motocross des Nations team that included Bengt Aberg, Ake Jonsson and Arne Kring. In 1975, Andersson placed second once more behind Puch's Harry Everts. For the 1976 season, he signed to ride for the Montesa factory in the 250 class, and in 1977, he rode a Montesa in the 500cc class. He returned to Husqvarna in the 1978 and 1979 seasons in the 500cc class.|$|E
50|$|Classic classes {{exist for}} vintage bikes. Classes include pre-1965 or pre-1967 {{motorcycles}} (typically British), {{as well as}} newer vintage events for observed trials motorcycles with two rear shock absorbers. In most cases, twin-shock motorcycles were manufactured between 1967 and 1985 and are typically Japanese or Spanish. A recent addition has been a class for air-cooled <b>monoshock</b> bikes, this covers machines up to around 1990.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Hallman {{was hired}} by the Yamaha factory to help them develop new motocross bikes. He was {{instrumental}} in Yamaha's decision to purchase the patent for an innovative single shock rear suspension that would eventually be called the <b>monoshock</b> suspension. The suspension design helped Håkan Andersson win the 1973 250cc motocross world championship for Yamaha and would go on to revolutionize the sport.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail light}} of the B2 {{features}} a reflector {{on each side of}} the rear lens. The internals of the lens are also different between the two models. The tail light lens feature identical mounting, so they can be interchanged. The B1 was only released in 1981 and the B2 in 1982, after that, the dual shock 1100 models ended and the <b>monoshock</b> GPz1100(ZX1100-A1) were released.|$|E
5000|$|A {{special edition}} model was the R1100S Sport, {{which was a}} {{standard}} R1100S fitted with an optional [...] "Sport" [...] pack comprising stiffer suspension via a taller rear <b>monoshock,</b> a steering damper, and a wider rear wheel and tyre. [...] Bike magazine commented: [...] "The basic R1100S is good value, but we're not convinced that the high spec Sport version offers any real benefit for road riders".|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha IT250H was an enduro {{motorcycle}} made by Yamaha {{starting in}} 1981. It has an air-cooled single cylinder two-stroke engine with six speed gearbox. Front suspension is 32 mm telescopic forks, with rubber boots. Rear suspension is <b>monoshock</b> and aluminium swingarm. Brakes are single acting, half width drums at both ends. The IT {{was made for}} enduro use, although it was used with success for trail riding and motocross.|$|E
5000|$|The RSV Tuono Factory {{is a high}} spec model {{based upon}} the Aprilia RSV Mille R. Compared to the {{standard}} RSV Tuono it has increased engine performance ( [...] @ 9500 rpm), forged alloy wheels, gold anodized Öhlins Racing front forks, fully adjustable Öhlins Racing rear <b>monoshock,</b> a fully adjustable Öhlins Racing steering damper, radially mounted Brembo brake calipers and it extensively uses carbon fiber parts for weight reduction.|$|E
50|$|In most respects, the MT-07 is a {{conventional}} middleweight roadster. It uses a compact tubular backbone frame, albeit with some echoes of a trellis frame. Its rear <b>monoshock</b> unit is placed horizontally within the subframe {{to give a}} shorter wheelbase, to save weight and to lower the centre of gravity. Front forks are conventional telescopic items, whereas its 3-cylinder sibling, the MT-09, has USD forks. Anti-lock braking is available as an option.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame is}} as big as the Multistrada 1000 DS frame, but is {{different}} at the rear, where the single sided swing arm {{has been replaced by a}} double sided swing arm. Suspension features Marzocchi 43 mm upside down front forks and a Sachs rear <b>monoshock</b> with adjustable preload and rebound. The braking system has a rear disk and two 300 mm front disks with floating callipers operated by a new front master cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Styling cues are {{borrowed}} from the 2007 CB600F Hornet. The engine is a detuned version of the 2007 CBR1000RR engine and produced about [...] at the rear wheel. The front suspension uses a 43 mm inverted HMAS cartridge-type telescopic fork with stepless preload with compression/rebound adjustments and 4.3 in travel. The rear is a <b>monoshock</b> with gas-charged HMAS damper featuring 10-step preload and stepless rebound damping adjustment and 5.0 in axle travel.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Honda repositioned the CBX {{into the}} sport touring {{category}} with the CBX-B, detuning {{the engine and}} adding Pro-Link <b>monoshock</b> rear suspension, air-adjustable 39 mm front forks, a fairing and panniers with a stronger frame to support these additions. The CBX was given beefier dual ventilated front brake discs to help bring to a stop the bike's increased weight. The 1982 model CBX-C model differed little from the 1981 model, having only some changes to paint and trim.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{consists}} of a tubular steel frame with load-bearing engine. A hydraulic 50 mm diameter upside-down fork by Marzocchi with 170 mm of travel guides the front. The rear wheel is held by a single-sided swingarm with progressive linkage, which is damped by a Sachs-Boge <b>monoshock</b> with a progressively-acting lever system and 155 mm of travel. Power is transferred to the rear wheel via a shaft integrated into the single-sided swingarm with two joints and an anti-torque reaction support.|$|E
50|$|The Yamaha YZ450F won the AMA Supercross Championship {{two years}} in a row, in 2008 with Chad Reed, and 2009 James Stewart. Yamaha was the first to build a {{production}} <b>monoshock</b> motocross bike (1975 for 250 and 400, 1976 for 125) {{and one of the first}} to have a water-cooled motocross production bike (1977 in works bikes, 1981 in off-the-shelf bikes). Yamaha's first Motocross competition four-stroke bike, the YZ400F, won the 1998 USA outdoor national Championship with factory rider Doug Henry.|$|E
50|$|The Saxon-Motodd (marketed as Telelever by BMW) has a {{wishbone}} that mounts to {{the frame}} and supports the <b>monoshock</b> unit. This relieves the forks of any braking and suspension forces. With a Telelever, the trail and castor angle (rake) increases during braking instead of decreasing as with traditional telescopic forks. BMW's boxer twins have been equipped with Telelever forks since 1994, but some newer boxers like the BMW R nineT have reverted to conventional telescopic forks for aesthetic and packaging reasons.|$|E
