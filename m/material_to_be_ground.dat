50|$|In case of {{continuously}} operated ball mill, the <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> is fed {{from the}} left through a 60° cone and the product is discharged through a 30° cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed), from {{near the top of}} the shell. In doing so, the solid particles in between the balls and ground are reduced in size by impact.|$|E
5000|$|A ball mill, {{a type of}} grinder, is a {{cylindrical}} device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores, chemicals, ceramic {{raw materials}} and paints. Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis, partially filled with the <b>material</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> plus the grinding medium. Different materials are used as media, including ceramic balls, flint pebbles and stainless steel balls. An internal cascading effect reduces the material to a fine powder. Industrial ball mills can operate continuously, fed {{at one end and}} discharged at the other end. Large to medium-sized ball mills are mechanically rotated on their axis, but small ones normally consist of a cylindrical capped container that sits on two drive shafts (pulleys and belts are used to transmit rotary motion). A rock tumbler functions on the same principle. Ball mills are also used in pyrotechnics and the manufacture of black powder, but cannot be used in the preparation of some pyrotechnic mixtures such as flash powder because of their sensitivity to impact. High-quality ball mills are potentially expensive and can grind mixture particles to as small as 5 nm, enormously increasing surface area and reaction rates.|$|E

40|$|Roller mills are {{extensively}} used {{in flour}} mills togrind wheat into flour. Wheat kernels fall into thegrinding zone formed {{by a pair}} of rolls rotatingtoward each other at different speeds and <b>are</b> subjected <b>to</b> grinding action. Flour milling involves several pairs of rolls used in sequence. From the first to the last pair of rolls, the roll gap is set successively narrower as the particle size of the feed stock becomes smaller. For size reduction, mechanical energy <b>is</b> needed <b>to</b> break the <b>material,</b> distribute material, and overcome friction between the moving parts of the machine. The energy consumed for breaking solid materials has been studied by many researchers including Von Rittinger (1867), Kick (1885), and Bond (1952). Von Rittinger stated that the energy for size reduction <b>was</b> proportional <b>to</b> the newly created surface area. Algebraically, this relationship can be expressed as: E = K × ∆S (1) where E = energy required for size reduction, K = specific surface coefficient, and ∆S = newly created surface area. The energy, E, and specific surface coefficient, K, have a high dependence on physical properties of the <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> and the operational parameters of the roller mill. The physical properties include variety, wheat kernel hardness, moisture content, and kernel size and weight. The mill operational parameters are feed rate, roll diameters and roll surface corrugations, roll grinding action, roll gap, fast roll speed, and roll speed differential. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the effects of physical properties of wheat kernels and the operational parameters of a first-break roller mill on the power and energy requirements for size reduction; and (2) develop prediction models for power and energy requirements when grinding wheat of known physical characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{extraction}} is {{a frequent}} procedure in biological research. For preparation of plant cell extracts, plant <b>materials</b> usually have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground</b> and homogenized <b>to</b> physically break the robust cell wall, but this step is laborious and time-consuming when {{a large number of}} samples are handled at once. Results We developed a chemical method for lysing Arabidopsis cells without grinding. In this method, plants are boiled for just 10 minutes in a solution containing a Ca 2 + chelator and detergent. Cell extracts prepared by this method were suitable for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. This method <b>was</b> also applicable <b>to</b> genomic DNA extraction for PCR analysis. Our method <b>was</b> applied <b>to</b> many other plant species, and worked well for some of them. Conclusions Our method is rapid and economical, and allows many samples <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared simultaneously for protein analysis. Our method is useful not only for Arabidopsis research but also research on certain other species. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} which uses a multiply resonant TE_ 1 _ 0 _p rectangular waveguide cavity coupled by inductive irises at each end and operating in the transmission mode to measure the complex permittivity of medium to low loss dielectric materials at all its resonant frequencies. The main advantage here is that, for e. g. in the 7 GHz to 13 GHz range, a cavity of length 220 mm <b>is</b> long enough <b>to</b> resonate {{at a number of}} fairly evenly spaced frequencies over the dominant mode frequency range for a given waveguide size, corresponding to different p values, e. g. for p = 4 to 16, giving 13 resonant frequencies f_r_p. Insertion of a sample completely filling the cross-section of the waveguide in an appropriate position near the centre can shift the f_r_p and decrease the Q_p of all of these modes without their f_r_p becoming confused. With a pair of measurements over the frequency range by network analyzer, one on the empty cavity and one on the cavity plus sample, #epsilon#_r* can be determined at these 13 frequencies. A further practical advantage is that, for <b>materials</b> that have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ground,</b> the sample cutting and fitting in a rectangular waveguide is much easier than for circular disc samples. A fully rigorous calculation of the f_r and Q values of such a resonator with real metal walls and practical circuit coupling has not appeared in the literature, and such an analysis has not been made here, because it represents too large a step in too many aspects of the theory simultaneously. However, the differences between measured f_r and Q values of empty cavities and those calculated by the simplest standard analysis are easily detected with modem equipment, and <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient <b>to</b> cause considerable uncertainty in final #epsilon#_r* values. Therefore, an approach of increasing in steps the sophistication of experiment and analysis until the differences <b>were</b> reduced, enough <b>to</b> give acceptable confidence in the #epsilon#_r* values was taken. In the course of this, new results <b>were</b> attained relevant <b>to</b> the extension of the standard theory of empty cavities to sample filled cavities, the effects of circuit coupling on wall loss or higher mode interaction on iris to iris or iris to samples and the calculation of Q_E by stored energy/external circuit dissipation. Experiments made and the results achieved over the frequency range 7 GHz- 13 GHz on a range of medium and low loss <b>materials</b> characterised <b>to</b> varying degrees by other workers by other methods are presented and compared to those characterisations. Conclusions are drawn on the accuracy and utility of the new method compared to previous ones for various purposes.
