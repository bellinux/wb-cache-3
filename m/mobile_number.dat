40|$|There is a {{great concern}} about the {{potential}} for people to leak private information on OSNs, but few quantitative studies on this. This research explores the activity of sharing <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> on OSNs, via public profiles and posts. We attempt to understand the characteristics and risks of <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> sharing behaviour on OSNs and focus on Indian <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers.</b> We collected 76, 347 unique <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> posted by 85905 users on Twitter and Facebook and analysed 2997 numbers, prefixed with + 91. We observed, most users shared their own <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> to spread urgent information; and to market products and escort business. Fewer female users shared <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> on OSNs. Users utilized other OSN platforms and third party applications like Twitterfeed, to post <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> on multiple OSNs. In contrast to the user's perception of numbers spreading quickly on OSN, we observed that except for emergency, most numbers did not diffuse deep. To assess risks associated with <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> exposed on OSNs, we used numbers to gain sensitive information about their owners (e. g. name, Voter ID) by collating publicly available data from OSNs, Truecaller, OCEAN. On using the numbers on WhatApp, we obtained a myriad of sensitive details (relationship status, BBM pins) of the number owner. We communicated the observed risks to the owners by calling. Few users were surprised to know about the online presence of their number, while a few others intentionally posted it online for business purposes. We observed, 38. 3 % of users who were unaware of the online presence of their number have posted their number themselves on the social network. With these observations, we highlight {{that there is a need}} to monitor leakage of <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> via profile and public posts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploratory study to critically investigate the exposure of Indian <b>mobile</b> <b>numbers</b> on OSNs...|$|R

25|$|Customer {{attrition}} merits {{special attention}} by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This {{is due to}} the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Number</b> Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have churn rates ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} divided into {{multiple}} zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries). Government and several private players run local and long distance telephone services. Competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India {{are one of the}} cheapest in the world. The rates are supposed to go down further with new measures to be taken by the Information Ministry. Call drop fine: Telcos warn of raising tariff. In September 2004, the number of mobile phone connections crossed the number of fixed-line connections and presently dwarfs the wireline segment by a ratio of around 20:1. The mobile subscriber base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012. India primarily follows the GSM mobile system, in the 900MHz band. Recent operators also operate in the 1800MHz band. The dominant players are Airtel, Reliance Infocomm, Vodafone, Idea cellular and BSNL/MTNL. There are many smaller players, with operations in only a few states. International roaming agreements exist between most operators and many foreign carriers. The government allowed <b>Mobile</b> <b>number</b> portability (MNP) which enables mobile telephone users to retain their mobile telephone numbers when changing from one mobile network operator to another.|$|E

After Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) forbids Stan to smoke in the house, he secretly smokes out of the window whilst the family is out, accidentally causing a small fire when the cigarette is not stubbed out properly.

When the police arrive, Stan takes the blame and is arrested. Mick later collects him and returns him to Walford.|$|E
