5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 <b>micrometers</b> in diameter.|$|E

In the Galactic plane the 205 <b>micrometer</b> line of N(+) generally follows the 158 <b>micrometer</b> C(+) line distribution, but the intensities scale as I(N(+) 205 <b>micrometer)</b> varies as I(C(+) 158 <b>micrometer)</b> (exp 1. 5) toward the inner Galaxy. The high Galactic latitude intensity of the 158 <b>micrometer</b> fine-structure transition from C(+) is I(C(+) 158 <b>micrometer)</b> = (1. 43 +/- 0. 12) x 10 (exp - 6) csc (absolute value of b) ergs/sq cm s sr for absolute value of b greater than 15 deg, and it decreases more rapidly than the far-infrared intensity with increasing Galactic latitude. C(+) and neutral atomic hydrogen emission are closely correlated with a C(+) cooling rate of (2. 65 +/- 0. 15) x 10 (exp - 26) ergs/s.

The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ.

We derive the stellar mass loss rates (M_loss) of these 21 <b>micrometer</b> sources from their dust infrared (IR) emission, using the " 2 -DUST" radiative transfer code for axisymmetric dusty systems which allows one to distinguish the mass loss rates of the AGB phase (Ṁ_̇ȦĠḂ) from that of the superwind (_̇M_SW) phase.
