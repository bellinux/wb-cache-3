The coupling joins roller coupling with <b>membrane</b> <b>coupling</b> reasonably to ensure the coupling working well in large misalignment condition. Fatigue stress for common coupling and roller-metallic <b>membrane</b> <b>coupling</b> are analyzed by CosmosWorks software.

In this study, <b>membrane</b> <b>coupling</b> protein transglutaminase (TG) catalysis protein cross-linking was investigated under different conditions {{to find out}} the best treatment. We found that the optimal conditions for protein recovery involved catalyzing whey protein cross-linking with TG (40 U/g whey proteins) at 40 °C for 60 min at pH 5. 0. Under these conditions, the recovery rate was increased 15 – 20 %, lactose rejection rate was decreased by 10 %, and relative permeate flux was increase 30 – 40 % compared to the sample without enzyme treatment (control). It was noticeable that the total resistance and cake resistance were decreased after enzyme catalysis. This was mainly due to the increased particle size and decreased zeta potential.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{inspection}} is {{the primary}} technique {{for the detection of}} planar flaws within the nuclear industry. Current inspections are typically limited to the application of rigid wedge, single element transducers to components with regular surface geometry. This thesis addresses some of the limitations of this approach and develops new methods and techniques that are suitable for application in an industrial environment. Inspection modelling is a cost effective technique for inspection design and qualification; {{it can be used to}} aid understanding of the inspection process, and provides valuable insight into inspection data interpretation. In this work semianalytical and numerical modelling tools have been used to accurately and efficiently simulate the ultrasonic inspection of large complex components. Modelling tools have also been applied to aid in the design of a <b>membrane</b> <b>coupled</b> conformable phased array device. The <b>membrane</b> <b>coupled</b> array is a low-cost, robust device that uses a conventional phased array coupled to the outer surface of the component under test via a water path encapsulated by low-loss membrane. Early design of this device was performed by Long and Cawley at Imperial College, London. The work reviewed in this thesis discussed the further development of this <b>membrane</b> <b>coupled</b> device and its application for the inspection of a specific target application component. The target application is a safety critical, thick-walled stainless steel section of pipework that contains an austenitic weld. The current inspection of this component is carried out by first removing the component weld cap and then mechanically raster scanning a large number of rigid wedge single element transducers. Weld cap removal is an expensive time consuming task that can lead to excessive wall thinning and the exposure of small surface breaking defects. The motivation for this work is to provide complete inspection of the weld and heat affected zone with the weld cap in place. It is also designed to improve inspection speed and accuracy, and to reduce the amount of user intervention required to complete the inspection in a hostile environment Inspection results from the 2 nd and 3 rd generation <b>membrane</b> <b>coupled</b> device on multiple test-pieces representative of the target application are presented. These results demonstrate that the <b>membrane</b> <b>coupled</b> device can be used to detect defects in locations that cannot be inspected using conventional techniques. The amount of scanning required can be significantly reduced, simplifying the inspection and helping to improve inspection speed by over 60 % in comparison to the single element approach.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast tool {{that can be}} used during the preliminary design of isotropic and composite stiffened panels subjected to axial compression. It consists of two modules, one for the analysis and one for the optimization. The analysis is performed by implementing an analytical formulation to obtain the linearized buckling load and to study the nonlinear postbuckling field. In particular, closed-form solutions are derived for the linearized local and global buckling loads, and a semi-analytical procedure is implemented {{for the study of the}} nonlinear local postbuckling field. The optimization is based on genetic algorithms and allows taking into account buckling and postbuckling requirements with reduced computational time. Two examples regarding the minimum weight optimization of an isotropic panel and a composite panel are discussed and verified by means of finite element eigenvalue and nonlinear analyses. The total time required for the analysis and the optimization is of the order of a few minutes, and the difference between the analytical and numerical results is below 9 % for the buckling load and below 3 % for the postbuckling stiffness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} novel physical models for sound synthesis of membrane percussion instruments. First, a model for tension modulation in a struck circular membrane is discussed, which simulates the dynamic variations of partial frequencies occurring at large amplitude vibrations of the membrane. It is shown that the model, which is derived from a more general theory of nonlinear elastic plates, can be efficiently integrated into a modal synthesis engine. Novel models for two relevant sound production mechanisms in membrane percussions are then proposed, i. e. coupling between two membranes through enclosed air in two-headed percussions, and string-membrane coupling. Both {{are based on a}} lumped modeling approach and can be straightforwardly connected to the nonlinear membrane model. By virtue of this modular approach, individual elements (circular linear/nonlinear membranes, impact force, <b>membrane</b> <b>coupling</b> through air, string-membrane coupling) can be combined to form different instruments.

40|$|SummaryThe light-sensing {{organelle}} of the vertebrate rod photoreceptor, {{the outer}} segment (OS), is a modified cilium containing ∼ 1, 000 stacked disc membranes that are densely packed with visual pigment rhodopsin.

Our results suggest that discs are formed and matured in a process that involves specific phospholipid-directed vesicular membrane targeting. Rhodopsin-laden vesicles in the OS axonemal cytoplasm fuse with nascent discs that are highly specialized with abundant phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate (PI 3 P). This <b>membrane</b> <b>coupling</b> is regulated by the FYVE domain-containing protein, SARA, through its direct interaction with PI 3 P, rhodopsin, and SNARE protein syntaxin 3.

40|$|The {{behaviors}} of biological systems depend on complex networks of interactions between {{large numbers of}} components. The network of interactions that allows biological cells to detect and respond to external gradients of small molecules with directed movement is an example {{where many of the}} relevant components have been identified. This behavior, called chemotaxis, is essential for biological functions ranging from immune response in higher animals to the food gathering and social behavior of ameboid cells.

40|$|Abstract. A novel full Eulerian fluid-elastic <b>membrane</b> <b>coupling</b> method on {{the fixed}} Cartesian {{coordinate}} mesh is proposed {{within the framework}} of the volume-of-fluid approach. The present method is based on a full Eulerian fluid-(bulk) structure coupling solver (Sugiyama et al., J. Comput. Phys., 230 (2011) 596 – 627), with the bulk structure replaced by elastic membranes. In this study, a closed membrane is considered, and it is described by a volume-of-fluid or volume-fraction information generally called VOF function. A smoothed indicator (or characteristic) function is introduced as a phase indicator which results in a smoothed VOF function. This smoothed VOF function uses a smoothed delta function, and it enables a membrane singular force to be incorporated into a mixture momentum equation. In order to deal with a membrane deformation on the Eulerian mesh, a deformation tensor is introduced and updated within a compactly supported region near the interface. Both the neo-Hookean and the Skalak models are employed in the numerical simulations. A smoothed (and less dissipative) interface capturing method is employed for the advection of the VOF function and the quantities defined on the membrane. The stability restriction due t...|$|E
