5|$|Martino Zaccaria married, {{probably}} {{some time before}} 1325, Jacqueline de la Roche. An earlier conjecture of Karl Hopf about a first <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> daughter of George I Ghisi, heir to the lordship of Tinos and Mykonos, has since been discarded.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E

Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done {{in order to ensure}} that Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (perhaps in the aftermath of a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E

The movie was filmed between late May and early August 2010 in various locations in Tennessee, Georgia, and California. It was released on April 22, 2011 and received mixed critical reviews.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Zenobia's {{descendants}} were Roman nobility {{during the}} reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have been the result of a reported <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is the relation of saint Zenobius of Florence with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{contemporaneous}} Philippe de Commines, Matthias's subjects feared their King in {{the last}} years of his life because he rarely showed mercy towards those he suspected of treachery. He had Archbishop Peter Váradi imprisoned in 1484 and ordered the execution of his Chancellor of Bohemia Jaroslav Boskovic in 1485. He also imprisoned Nicholas Bánfi, a member of a magnate family, in 1487, although he had earlier avoided punishing the old aristocracy. Bánfi's imprisonment seems to have been connected to his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> daughter of John the Mad, Duke of Glogau because Matthias tried to seize this duchy for John Corvinus. John the Mad entered into an alliance with the Duke of Münsterberg Henry of Poděbrady, and declared a war on Matthias on 9 May. Six month later, the Black Army invaded and occupied his duchy.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{postponement}} {{because of}} the death of her maternal uncle, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Victoria married Prince Louis on 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt. Her father did not approve of the match; in his view Prince Louis had little money and would deprive him of his daughter's company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father's displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria's father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d'affaires in Darmstadt. His <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> divorcee who was not of equal rank shocked the assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria's father was forced to seek an annulment of his own marriage.|$|E
5|$|After his succession, Charles quarrelled {{with the}} Parliament of England, {{which sought to}} curb his royal prerogative. Charles {{believed}} in the divine right of kings and thought he could govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical absolute monarch. His religious policies, coupled with his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Roman Catholic, generated the antipathy and mistrust of reformed {{groups such as the}} English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters, who thought his views too Catholic. He supported high church ecclesiastics, such as Richard Montagu and William Laud, and failed to aid Protestant forces successfully during the Thirty Years' War. His attempts to force the Church of Scotland to adopt high Anglican practices led to the Bishops' Wars, strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments and helped precipitate his own downfall.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} over the clan's origins, Samuel undoubtedly descended from a distinguished family, since an unnamed sister of Stephen I, who had in 1000 or 1001 been crowned the first King of Hungary, {{was given in}} <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> member of the Aba clan around 1009. However, historians still debate whether Samuel himself or Samuel's father married the royal princess. If Samuel was her husband, {{he must have been}} born before 990 and converted either from Judaism or paganismto Christianity when he married Stephen I's sister. His Christian credentials are further evidenced by Samuel's establishment of an abbey at Abasár which was recorded by Hungarian chronicles. According to Gyula Kristó and other historians, Samuel's conversion coincided with the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger encompassing his domains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Artabanus III, two Jewish commoners and brothers, Anilai and Asinai from Nehardea (near modern Fallujah, Iraq), led a revolt against the Parthian {{governor}} of Babylonia. After defeating the latter, the two were granted the right to govern the region by Artabanus III, who feared further rebellion elsewhere. Anilai's Parthian wife poisoned Asinai out of fear he would attack Anilai over his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gentile. Following this, Anilai became embroiled in an armed conflict with a son-in-law of Artabanus, who eventually defeated him. With the Jewish regime removed, the native Babylonians began to harass the local Jewish community, forcing them to emigrate to Seleucia. When that city rebelled against Parthian rule in 35–36AD, the Jews were expelled again, this time by the local Greeks and Aramaeans. The exiled Jews fled to Ctesiphon, Nehardea, and Nisibis.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII's first {{marriage}} had {{its origins in}} 1502 when his elder brother, Arthur, died. Their father, Henry VII, then betrothed Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> brother's wife. The couple married in 1509 and {{after a series of}} miscarriages, a daughter, Mary, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as a sure sign of God's anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an annulment. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings.|$|E

5|$|In 1290, Edward's {{father had}} {{confirmed}} the Treaty of Birgham, {{in which he}} promised to marry his six-year-old son to the young Margaret of Norway, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. Margaret died later that year, bringing {{an end to the}} plan. Edward's mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence. Edward I was distraught at his wife's death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor on her death. Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure a lasting peace with France, but war broke out in 1294. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> daughter of the Count of Flanders, but this too failed after it was blocked by King Philip IV of France.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th {{century the}} Lower Ward was rebuilt in stone by Reynold Mohun; this {{was paid for}} in part by Reynold {{commuting}} his tenants' ongoing duty to repair the castle walls into a single, one-off financial payment to their lord, and partially through his <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rich local heiress. A survey of the castle in 1266 described the Upper Ward {{on the top of}} the motte as containing a hall with a buttery, a pantry, a kitchen, a bakehouse, the chapel of Saint Stephen and a knight's hall, guarded by three towers. The Lower Ward included a granary, two towers and a gatehouse; one of the towers, called the Fleming Tower, was used as a prison. The castle stables lay outside the defences, further down the slope. By the end of the 13th century some of the castle's roofing had been covered in lead, while other parts still used wooden shingles.|$|E
5|$|Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...

The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor in leading roles, with Rani Mukerji appearing in an extended special appearance. The music was composed by Jatin Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava, with lyrics penned by Sameer and Anil Pandey. The background score was composed by Babloo Chakravarty.

5|$|Mary's {{animated}} and personable nature {{made her}} {{popular with the}} Dutch people, and her <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Protestant prince was popular in Britain. She was devoted to her husband, but he was often away on campaigns, which led to Mary's family supposing him to be cold and neglectful. Within months of the marriage Mary was pregnant; however, {{on a visit to}} her husband at the fortified city of Breda, she suffered a miscarriage, which may have permanently impaired her ability to have children. She suffered further bouts of illness that may have been miscarriages in mid-1678, early 1679, and early 1680. Her childlessness would be the greatest source of unhappiness in her life.|$|E
5|$|The Turks, {{based in}} the Caucasus, responded by sending 40,000 of their men to ravage the Persian empire in 626, marking {{the start of the}} Third Perso-Turkic War. Joint Byzantine and Göktürk {{operations}} were then focused on besieging Tiflis, where the Byzantines used traction trebuchets to breach the walls, one of the first known uses by the Byzantines. Khosrow sent 1,000 cavalry under Shahraplakan to reinforce the city, but it nevertheless fell, probably in late 628. Ziebel died {{by the end of that}} year, however, saving Epiphania from <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> barbarian.
