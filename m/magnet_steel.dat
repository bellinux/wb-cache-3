5000|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, Haydon then built several models of miniaturized induction motors {{in his own}} workshop. In so doing, he quickly learned {{that he was not}} going to find the solution to the problem by using a normal Squirrel-cage rotor. He failed a few times, but his failures finally led to the realization that the performance characteristics he was seeking might be obtained by using permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>steel</b> for the rotor instead of the original squirrel cage induction type rotor. He built many models and finally accomplished the desired operating characteristics. This motor design is covered by Patent No. 1,935,208 [...] and related patents.This motor was capable of oscillating continuously when connected to a hair spring. It would also run synchronously in one direction without the hair spring. This made it usable either independent of, or dependent on, the frequency of current supplied by the local utility company.|$|E

In this study, a unit cell model is assumed considering periodic character of the actual core under plane strain condition in the z direction. Using this simple model, the effects of the diameter and width of the core are discussed. Also, the effects of the numbers of the slit and embossing interlocking are analyzed. It is found that around the slits the core should be considered as zero elastic modulus because no tangential stress exists. Also, a simple evaluation method is proposed to estimate the effective elastic modulus by applying the rule of mixture to the simple model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{permanent}} magnet motors {{are widely used}} in wide industrial fields because they are suitable for compact mechanical system. The motor core is usually manufactured from magnetic steel sheet with press machine. However, usually {{most parts of the}} plate are scalped, and only small percent of the sheet is used for the core. The spiral accumulating core system is suitable for manufacturing the core more ecologically because in this system more than 50 % of the <b>magnet</b> <b>steel</b> sheet can be used. In this study, therefore, the effective Young’s modulus of the spiral accumulating core is considered in order to find out a good method to fix the core. In this analysis, effective Young’s modulus of spiral accumulating core used for {{permanent magnet}} motor is considered by the application of the finite element method to 3 D models, whose layers and slits are periodically arranged. Then, effects of slits, layers and embossing interlockings on effective Young’s modulus are analyzed. Finally, a convenient method of calculation based on rule of mixture is newly proposed for estimating the effective Young’s modulus of the real spiral accumulating core...|$|E

The particle trajectories are measured by high precision drift tubes located before and after the arms of the magnet. Moreover, the <b>magnet</b> <b>steel</b> is instrumented with Resistive Plate Chambers that ease pattern recognition and allow a calorimetric measurement of the hadronic showers. In this paper we review {{the construction of}} the spectrometers. In particular, we describe the results obtained from the magnet and RPC prototypes and the installation of the final apparatus at the Gran Sasso laboratories. We discuss the mechanical and magnetic properties of the steel and the techniques employed to calibrate the field in the bulk of the magnet. Moreover, results of the tests and issues concerning the mass production of the Resistive Plate Chambers are reported.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{permanent}} magnet motors {{are widely used}} in many industrial fields because they are suitable for compact mechanical system. The motor core is usually manufactured from magnetic steel sheet with press machine. However, usually {{most parts of the}} plate are scraped, and only small percent of the sheet is used for the core. The spiral accumulating core system is suitable for manufacturing the core more ecologically because in this system more than 50 % of the <b>magnet</b> <b>steel</b> sheet can be used. In this study, therefore, the effective Young’s modulus of the spiral accumulating core is considered in order to find out a good method to fix the core. In this analysis, the finite element method is applied to 3 D models, whose layers and slits are periodically arranged. Stress and thickness distributions are also analyzed in the bending process. When the spiral core is manufactured through spiral accumulating system with plate-bending process, the thickness change should be minimized because that may deteriorate dimensional accuracy of the spiral core. Also residual bending stress is investigated because that may cause an electric loss. The results indicate that plastic zone is limited at localized regions and therefore an electric loss is not very large. The effective Young’s modulus of the 3 D dimensions model of the real spiral accumulating core is estimated about 127. 5 GPa...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{temperature}} control system {{is one of the}} most important subsystems of the strapdown airborne gravimeter. Because the quartz flexible accelerometer based on springy support technology is the core sensor in the strapdown airborne gravimeter and the <b>magnet</b> <b>steel</b> in the electromagnetic force equilibrium circuits of the quartz flexible accelerometer is greatly affected by temperature, in order to guarantee the {{temperature control}} precision and minimize the effect of temperature on the gravimeter, the SGA-WZ {{temperature control system}} adopts a three-level control method. Based on the design experience of the SGA-WZ- 01, the SGA-WZ- 02 temperature control system came out with a further optimized design. In 1 st level temperature control, thermoelectric cooler is used to conquer temperature change caused by hot weather. The experiments show that the optimized stability of 1 st level temperature control is about 0. 1 ˝C and the max cool down capability is about 10 ˝C. The temperature field is analyzed in the 2 nd and 3 rd level temperature control using the finite element analysis software ANSYS. The 2 nd and 3 rd level temperature control optimization scheme is based on the foundation of heat analysis. The experimental results show that static accuracy of SGA-WZ- 02 reaches 0. 21 mGal/ 24 h, with internal accuracy being 0. 743 mGal/ 4. 8 km and external accuracy being 0. 37 mGal/ 4. 8 km compared with the result of the GT- 2 A, whose internal precision is superior to 1 mGal/ 4. 8 km and all of them are better than those in SGA-WZ- 01...|$|E

This, however, is not the case; for hard <b>steel,</b> or a <b>magnet</b> in the helix, is not so effectual as soft iron; nor does it make any difference how the magnet is placed in the helix, and for very simple reasons, namely, that the effect does not depend upon a permanent state of the core, but a change of state; and that the <b>magnet</b> or hard <b>steel</b> cannot sink through such a difference of state as soft iron, at the moment contact ceases, and therefore cannot produce an equal effect in generating a current of electricity by induction (34. 37.).|$|R

The total number of unit magnets produced per year in a large plant amounts to several hundreds of millions, since the small magnet weighing 4 mg in a high quality material as Cobalt-Rare Earth and used in electric watches, till the big 40 kg magnet, directly cast in Ticonal 600, for the stator of an electric generator. The same 107 factor in the weight {{can be found in the}} coercivities of ferromagnetic materials, going from 10 - 2 Oe for very soft materials to 105 Oe for very hard materials. This review deals with the various hard materials now in production, illustrated by a few new laboratory results. If the old theory of pinned Bloch walls, initially developed for <b>magnet</b> <b>steels,</b> comes back again for cobalt-rare earths alloys substituted with copper and iron, the origin of the properties of most modern hard materials is interpreted in terms of single domain fine — particle theory : in one case, magnetization reversal is governed, either by a shape anisotropy (Ticonals, powder magnets) or a crystal anisotropy (platinum-cobalt alloy, hard ferrites) — in the other case, it is governed by nucleation of reversed domains or unpinning of Bloch walls (sintered cobalt-rare earths magnets). The study of first magnetization curves, as well as intrinsic curves or recoil curves, is very useful to distinguish between various mechanisms of coercivity, and is illustrated here by new results obtained on high coercivity materials, as Ticonal 2000 ((BHmax) = 6. 5 × 106 G. Oe), Sermalloy P, Plasto-Ferrite magnets Ferriflex 10 very well oriented ((BH) max = 2. 0 x 106 G. Oe) and Cobalt-Rare Earth Coramag. Although an increase in coercivity is usually followed by a decrease in remanence, this does not appear in intermetallic compounds based on transition and rare earth metals, thus allowing very high specific energies.
