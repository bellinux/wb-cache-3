40|$|BACKGROUND: Tinea pedis and tinea <b>manuum</b> in {{children}} are more common than previously recognized. Clinical presentations of dermatophyte infections may vary {{in children}} and {{may be difficult to}} diagnose. OBJECTIVE: To show the necessity of potassium hydroxide preparations and/or fungal cultures in assessing suspicious cases of cellulitis in children who may have dermatophyte infections. PATIENTS: We describe 4 children with inflammatory tinea pedis or tinea <b>manuum</b> who were initially misdiagnosed as having bacterial cellulitis. INTERVENTION: A potassium hydroxide examination was performed on 3 patients. Fungal cultures were performed on 2 patients. RESULTS: Inflammatory/bullous dermatophyte infections were detected by potassium hydroxide examination in all 4 patients and all 4 children successfully responded to topical antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate that inflammatory tinnea pedis/manuum can masquerade as cellulitis in children. Early potassium hydroxide examination can allow appropriate antifungal treatment to be initiated before fungal culture results are finalized...|$|R

2500|$|So far we {{have spoken}} only {{of the office of}} Prime {{properly}} so called, which ends like the other Little Hours.

Direct and sanctify"), and a blessing. This addition to Prime is a legacy bequeathed by the monks to the secular clergy.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a survey on dermatophytoses, 14, 619 clinical specimens taken from outpatients with symptoms suggestive of tinea and referred to a Medical Mycology laboratory in Tehran, Iran, were analyzed by direct microscopy and culture. In total, 777 dermatophyte strains recovered in culture were randomly identified by a formerly established RFLP analysis method based on the rDNA ITS regions. For confirmation of species identification, 160 isolates representing the likely entire species spectrum were subjected to ITS-sequencing. Infection was confirmed in 5, 175 collected samples (35. 4 %) by direct microscopy and/or culture. Tinea pedis was the most prevalent type of infection (43. 4 %), followed by tinea unguium (21. 3 %), tinea cruris (20. 7 %), tinea corporis (9. 4 %), tinea <b>manuum</b> (4. 2 %), tinea capitis (0. 8 %) and tinea faciei (0. 2 %).

50|$|When the hyphae of the fungi burrow {{into the}} skin and release enzymes to digest keratin, they may irritate nerve endings and cause the host to itch, which may elicit the scratch reflex, which directs the host to scratch. Scratching {{directly}} transfers fungi and dead skin particles that are infested with the fungi to the fingers and under the finger nails. From there they can be transmitted {{to other parts of}} the host's body when the host touches or scratches those. Scratching also damages skin layers, making it easier for the fungi to spread at the site of the infection. If the fungi and infested debris are not washed from the fingers and fingernails soon enough, the fungi can also infect the skin of the fingers (tinea <b>manuum),</b> and burrow underneath and into the material of the fingernails (tinea unguium). If left untreated, the fungi continue to grow and spread.|$|R

Trichophyton rubrum has also been known to cause folliculitis in which case it is characterized by fungal element in follicles and foreign body giant cells in the dermis. A T. rubrum infection may also form a granuloma. Extensive granuloma formations may occur in patients with immune deficiencies (e.g. Cushing syndrome).
