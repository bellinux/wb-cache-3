The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964.

5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a <b>mixed</b> <b>bag,</b> both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to validate a new system of breath-by-breath expired gas analysis to both an artificial working model of lung ventilation and gas exchange {{as well as to the}} Douglas bag technique. In addition, comparisons will be made between expired fractions, ventilation, and computations of VO 2, VCO 2, and RER between the new system and a commercial mixing chamber system (ParvoMedics) for repeated measurements at rest, steady state and non-steady state cycle ergometry exercise. Post acquisition processing involved custom developed software (LabVIEW), where time to gas equilibration within the <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> was determined, as well as differences in equilibrated gas fractions. All testing procedures were repeated 5 times for parametric statistical analyses. Gas concentration (%) results for the compliant 2 L <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> was the only method to yield data not significantly different between alveolar and measured. Alveolar % oxygen was significantly lower than <b>mixing</b> <b>bag,</b> <b>mixing</b> chamber, and ParvoMedics. The most responsive method was the <b>mixing</b> <b>bag,</b> with significantly lower % gas data for oxygen for breaths 2 to 5 compared to the mixing chamber and ParvoMedics. The ParvoMedics and <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> yielded similar results after breath 6, but data were significantly higher than for alveolar air. The slope data for breaths 0 to breaths 2 was significantly (p < 0. 05) lower for the ParvoMedics system compared to the <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> and <b>mixing</b> chamber. The mean temporal distribution of 1 L ventilation maneuvers from the <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> turbine was 0. 999 ± 0. 142 L, with a range of 0. 96 to 1. 03 L. The mean ventilation (STPD) from the ParvoMedics (pneumotach) was significantly lower (p = 0. 0027) than the <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> turbine. For VE (p = 0. 097), VO 2 (p = 0. 786), and VCO 2 (p = 0. 178) were not significantly different in the main effect for method and the Intensity x Method interaction (VE: p = 0. 721, VO 2 : p = 0. 059, VCO 2 : p = 0. 406). As expected, there was a significant difference for the intensity main effect (p < 0. 0001). For FEO 2 (p < 0. 0001) and FECO 2 (p < 0. 0001) there were significant findings for the main effects of intensity. However, the Intensity x Method interaction showed no significant differences in FEO 2 and FECO 2. RER was significantly different in the main effect for method (p = 0. 024), intensity (p = 0. 0006), and Intensity x Method interaction (p = 0. 005). The expired oxygen and carbon dioxide had significant main effects and interactions (p < 0. 001). All mean differences between alveolar and mouth end tidal gas % values across 6 breaths were significant (p < 0. 01). The mean individual computed dead space volumes were 2. 5 ± 0. 13 L. The results suggested that the new 2 L <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> is capable of accurately reproducing specific gas fractions from reference calibration gas. The new 2 L <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> allowed expired air to wash out through the bag. This system, in combination with including anatomical dead space (ADS) as a factor in the determinations, gives more accurate measurements and calculations than a traditional mixing chamber. Additionally, the new <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> method has unique aspects that are advantageous to the operation and validity of the system. Although the new system is not used in commercial systems of expired gas analysis indirect calorimetry (EGAIC), this system provides enhanced accuracy and validity.

25|$|The {{influence}} of the gun and other technology. The introduction of firearms was important, but guns on African battlefields were often of indifferent quality, and traditional weapons and tactics sometimes compared favorably with them. Indeed, Africans {{were well aware of}} the deficiencies of trade muskets and often demanded better quality than that offered. Most guns imported from Europe had not been test fired by the manufacturer to check for imperfections in bore and breach, although this was essential in the era of hand-forged barrels. Proven guns had proof-marks, and counterfeits flourished in the Africa trade. Firearms were thus a <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> on the ground, and the success of consolidating native powers like the Merina in Madagascar or the Zulu were due more to changes in indigenous organization, leadership and tactics, than to firearms. As the decades rolled on however, improvements to firearms, and other technology such as disease control (the cinchona bark to suppress malaria for example), and steamships were to give Europeans a decisive military edge on the continent.|$|E
40|$|Questions: Mixed litter may {{decompose}} {{at different}} rates to single-species litter, leading to differences in ecosystem functioning and decomposition. Studies {{of the effects of}} different litter species and combinations are rare in tropical forests and absent from African forests. Therefore we investigated: (1) Are there differences in litter decomposition in two forest types differing in tree diversity; and (2) is litter decomposition diversity-dependent? Location: Old-growth moist evergreen tropical forest Dja Faunal Reserve, southeast Cameroon. Methods: We calculate decomposition rates (leaf litter fall/leaf litter standing crop) along a tree diversity gradient in two forest types (naturally occurring low-diversity monodominant and adjacent higher-diversity mixed forest). Both forests experience the same climate on the same soil type; the former is dominated by a single species, Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (De Wild.) J. Léonard, probably due to lack of a long-term disturbance and has similar edaphic factors. Decomposition experiments were conducted in both forest types using single and <b>mixed</b> species litter <b>bags</b> of standard high-quality (bay leaves; Laurus nobilis L.) and low-quality (G. dewevrei) litter over 9 months. Results: The estimated decomposition rate in mixed forest was four times faster than in monodominant forest, and not significantly correlated with local quadrat-scale tree species diversity. The litter bag experiment showed that decomposition of high-quality leaves was faster than low-quality leaves (k values: 2. 0 yr− 1 vs 0. 6 yr− 1). Decay rates for each single species litter type were not significantly different in both forest types. However, G. dewevrei litter in <b>mixed</b> <b>bags</b> decomposed faster than in single-species <b>bags</b> in <b>mixed</b> forest, suggesting an impact of litter mixing on decomposition. In addition, bay litter in <b>mixed</b> <b>bags</b> decomposed faster in mixed than in monodominant forests across the three study sites. Conclusion: The observed difference in litter decomposition rate between low-diversity monodominant and adjacent high-diversity forest is more likely due to dominance of low-quality G. dewevrei litter, rather than low-diversity of the litter itself...|$|R
