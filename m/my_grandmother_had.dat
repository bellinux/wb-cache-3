[...] In [...] a 2000 study of Coward, Jean Chothia instances surreal exchanges in the play, such as: [...] "Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a camel?" [...] "Frequently.

The recollection, or the fancy of this success most probably encouraged her to take a share in the present scheme; and I have always supposed that she got us all together on that occasion in order to help the great project along.|$|E

60|$|The {{very day}} {{my sister and}} I left Satanstoe, there was an {{interesting}} interview between my grandmother and myself, {{that it may be}} well to relate. It took place in the cool of the morning, before breakfast, indeed, and previously to the appearance of any {{of the rest of the}} party; for Tom Bayard and his sister had again ridden across the country to pass the night and see us off. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> requested me to meet her thus early, in a sort of little piazza, that modern improvements had annexed to one end of the old buildings, and in which we both appeared accordingly with the utmost punctuality. I saw by a certain sort of importance that my good grandmother wore in her countenance, that she had weighty matters on her mind, and took the chair she had set for me with some little curiosity to learn what was to follow. The chairs were placed side by side, or nearly so, but looking different ways, and so close together that, when seated, we were quite face to face. <b>My</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> on her spectacles, and she gazed wistfully through them at me, parting the curls on my forehead, as had been her wont when I was a boy.

By his side was a table, on which lay the morning paper and some books which <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> sent out to him.

The Prairiefire led the line, as the oldest chief, and the one most distinguished in council. Flintyheart was second, while the others were arranged by some rule of precedency that was known to themselves. As soon as the line had formed, it commenced its march; my uncle, the interpreter, and myself walking at the side of Prairiefire, while Miller, followed by half-a-dozen of the curious from the Nest House and the farm, followed in the rear.|$|E

He probably remembered that the landlord, or upper servant of an English hotel, is apt to make his appearance with the soup, and to disappear as that disappears. So it was with John; after removing the soup, he put a dumb-waiter near my uncle, touched a carving-knife or two, as much as to say [...] "help yourselves," [...] and quitted the room. As a matter of course, our dinner was not a very elaborate one, it wanting two or three hours to the regular time of dining, though <b>my</b> <b>grandmother</b> <b>had</b> ordered, in my hearing, one or two delicacies to be placed on the table that had surprised Patt.
