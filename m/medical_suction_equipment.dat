Studies have also shown that it has a direct impact on mortality and morbidity as a result of sleep deprivation which affects the immunity of critically ill patients. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} measure levels of environmental noise in a six- bed, open-plan general medical intensive care unit (MICU). Methods: Levels of exposure to environmental noise were assessed in the intensive care unit of King Fahad Hospital of the University (KFHU) where measurements of environmental noise were taken using calibrated sound level meter during shifts of working days and weekends. Results : Statistical analysis revealed that there were no significant differences between noise levels in the morning, evening and night shifts of working days and weekends in the ICU of KFHU (p value = 0. 155, 0. 53 and 0. 711) respectively. There was no significant difference between overall level of exposure to noise in the working days and weekends as well (p-value= 0. 71). However, the assessed levels of exposures to noise were still higher than stipulated international standards. Conclusion : Some sources of environmental noise, such as the use of oxygen, <b>suction</b> <b>equipment</b> or respirators are unavoidable.

We produced three clearly visible bright labels which provided simple prompts to the operator. Two wards and two sampling periods were used in a randomised controlled design. Medical, nursing and allied healthcare staff participated. A scenario of a vomiting patient was given and staff were asked to use emergency suction. This was timed. On the control ward, 5 / 10 staff members were able to successfully suction on day 1 and the mean time spent trying to activate suction was 43 seconds. On the second sampling day 6 were able to successfully suction and the mean time taken was 50 seconds. On the intervention ward, 7 / 10 staff members were able to suction with a mean time of 53 seconds spent. Post-intervention, all 10 staff members successfully suctioned with an average time of 30 seconds. The intervention gathered strongly positive feedback. These interventions are being incorporated into sustainable systems changes. Poor equipment design is a needless distraction during an emergency in a busy ward setting.

40|$|Nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural lands can pollute groundwater, and {{the degree}} of pollution caused significantly depends on agricultural practices implemented on farms. Field studies required to evaluate the effects of various agricultural management strategies on nitrate leaching are expensive and time consuming. As a result, it is suggested to use crop models to simulate the effects of management practices on nitrate leaching. Plant growth models such as DSSAT software package can simulate daily plant growth and development, and also are capable of simulating daily nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake by plants. However, it is required to evaluate the performance of any model before using it for any specific region. In this study, the performance of nitrogen balance model of DSSAT software package was evaluated to simulate nitrate leaching from the root zone of silage maize at different levels of applied water and nitrogen fertilizer. The experiment consisted of three levels of nitrogen fertilizers, including zero, 150 and 200 kg N ha- 1 and four levels of applied water 0. 7 SMD (soil moisture depletion), 0. 85 SMD, 1. 0 SMD and 1. 13 SMD. Nitrate-nitrogen leaching from 36 plots at the 60 cm depth during the growing period was measured by soil moisture <b>suction</b> <b>equipment</b> (ceramic <b>suction</b> cups, CSC). After calibrating the model by using field data, its performance was evaluated to simulate nitrate leaching. Maximum amount of N leaching 8. 4 kg N ha- 1 was obtained from over irrigation treatment with the application of 150 kg nitrogen per hectare. The model simulated nitrate leaching for this treatment as 7. 8 kg N ha- 1. The model consistently underestimated the nitrate leaching; however, it followed the behavior of nitrate leaching during the growing season. In deficit irrigation treatments, the nitrate leaching was very low and close to zero and the model simulated the same result accordingly. The results showed that the model, in addition to phenological stages and performance indicators, can simulate nitrate leaching from the root zone and could be used to evaluate the effects of various irrigation and fertilizer management strategies on nitrate leaching...|$|R
40|$|Trifolium spumosum L. (bladder clover) is {{an aerial}} seeding annual legume that {{is adapted to}} fine-textured soils {{throughout}} the Mediterranean Basin. This article {{is the first of}} two papers that describe the process of domestication of T. spumosum as a new species to commercial agriculture. This paper describes a broad range of investigations into the ecology, agronomy and rhizobiology of this new species. Through a series of five experiments, we have tested the general hypothesis that T. spumosum accessions demonstrate a range of sought-after agronomic traits and offer an alternative to annual Medicago spp. for ley farming systems in the medium to low rainfall areas of the mixed crop/livestock zone of southern Australia. T. spumosum presents seeds {{at the top of the}} canopy in heads that do not readily shatter, so seed can be harvested using conventional cereal harvesters instead of the specialist <b>suction</b> <b>equipment</b> required for harvest of seed from annual T. subterraneum and Medicago spp. T. spumosum was found to be relatively fecund and had high levels of biomass production in comparison to the other annual legumes that were tested. The species also demonstrated high levels of within-season hardseededness (remaining hard in summer and softening in autumn) so seedbanks would be protected from summer rainfall events. In addition, T. spumosum showed high levels of between-season dormancy, which allows the species to carry a seedbank through a cropping phase or series of poor seasons. A herbicide experiment showed that clover species varied in tolerances, with T. spumosum the least sensitive of all of the legumes tested to Flumetsulam. A cross-inoculation experiment to measure symbiotic effectiveness revealed that WSM 1325 (current clover strain) surpasses WSM 409 (previous strain) in its relationship with the annual clovers of contemporary interest, while being highly effective at nitrogen fixation with T. spumosum. The results of this study and an associated investigation into feeding value indicate that T. spumosum offers a productive alternative to annual Medicago spp. on fine-textured soils.

40|$|Introduction: The holmium laser has {{revolutionized}} {{the practice of}} minimally invasive endoscopy for kidney stones. Recently, a novel, rigid handpiece for use in percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) that couples the holmium laser with suction has been developed. To date, limited data exist regarding the usability and ergonomics of such treatment systems. We thus sought to compare surgeon-rated usability with three different suction laser handpieces in a porcine model. Materials and Methods: We performed bilateral reverse PCNL on four female domestic farm pigs. After induction of general anesthesia, percutaneous access was obtained into each kidney by using biplanar fluoroscopy and 8 ?mm stones (plaster of Paris) were inserted into the calix or renal pelvis for treatment. Four surgeons tested the LASER Suction Tube (Karl Storz?, Germany), LithAssist? (Cook? <b>Medical),</b> and <b>Suction</b> Handpiece (HP) (Lumenis?, Israel) by {{using a combination of}} fragmentation (5 Joules/ 20 Hertz) and dusting (0. 8 Joules/ 80 Hertz) settings on the Lumenis pulse 120 H laser.

The mean time required for stone fragmentation was 8 ?min. The mean handling and suction efficiency scores were similar between devices. The Suction HP offered the best laser fiber visibility during lithotripsy.

40|$|Waterways {{and lakes}} in low-lying delta areas require regular {{dredging}} for maintenance. Reuse of dredged sediments {{has been proposed}} for various applications. However, directly after dredging the physical characteristics of these sediments make them generally unsuited for immediate reuse. They are often placed on land, where {{they are allowed to}} ripen through a combination of drainage, consolidation and evaporation. At a certain stage during the desiccation process cracks will develop, affecting the physical properties of the material. These include its strength, stiffness and hydraulic conductivity, as well as drainage, water infiltration and evaporation. The soil composition can be likewise altered by biochemical processes, which are stimulated by the ingress of oxygen through the cracked surface. Consequently, identifying how cracks develop in the soil is essential for understanding the behavior of the material. Much investigation has been performed studying desiccation cracks, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. It is known that the drying speed affects the final amount of cracks in a soil, which points out to the potential impact of rate effects in soil cracking. The effects of the drying rate might be related to variations in the tensile strength influenced by different shrinkage rates, as well as its impact on the suction development in the soil. In this thesis different sets of experiments were carried out to study the phenomenon of desiccation fracturing in soil. The first series of tests were carried out in a controlled laboratory environment to study the crack development in drying clay slurries under different initial and boundary conditions. The outcomes of those tests indicated that cracks can propagate in a different way than commonly assumed (namely under the surface) and that fracture characteristics strongly depend on the initial and boundary conditions. A second series of tests examined the combined effects of pull rates and high water contents on the tensile strength. Particle Image Velocimetry analysis was also carried out on pictures taken during the tests to examine the strains generated. It was found that the effect of pull rate on the tensile strength of the clay was negligible compared to the effect of the water content. Pull rate did affect the stiffness response of the soil. The findings revealed that the influence of the evaporation rate on soil fracturing might be related more to the rate dependency of the stiffness rather than to significant changes in tensile strength. The last series of experiments investigated the drying behaviour of a clay with different initial water contents and under different evaporative conditions. The small scale evaporation experiments carried out using commercially available <b>suction</b> measuring <b>equipment</b> with an adjusted test procedure. The results showed that the initial conditions have great influence on the drying performance of a soil, which can be partly attributed to the influence of the surface texture and the pore structure. It was observed that under certain circumstances, the evaporation of a soil surface can be higher than that of open water. The different evaporation rates had a marked effect on the water distributions with depth within the soil. The evaporation rate also produced a dynamic response of the soil water retention curve. At the end, a simple one-dimensional model was set up to try to capture the behavior observed during all the laboratory tests. It also served to analyze the consequences of different hypotheses about the material behaviour on the crack onset in a homogenous soil layer undergoing surface drying. Geo-engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Electrical energy {{plays an}} {{indispensable}} {{role in our}} contemporary society. However, we mostly realize its position in agriculture in a situation which often already entails irreversible consequences. Therefore, the thesis aims to assess the consequences of power blackout on agricultural farming. In connection with the selected objective, a question arises whether long-term power blackouts also constitute {{a serious threat to}} agricultural farms of South Bohemia? The theoretical part briefly describes electrical energy, its production and method of transmission. It also includes basic elements of the power system including its stability and safety. The chapter also acquaints the reader with the critical infrastructure of the Czech Republic and its legislative base. Then, it globally analyzes the term blackout. Given the topic of the thesis, it is necessary to mention the valuable work of the integrated rescue system which in addition to the basic obligations to ensure the protection of human life and property is required to provide missions to rescue animals in emergency situations. Finally, this chapter deals with the application of electrical energy in agriculture, including the characteristics of surveyed farms and a high degree of automation used in farming. The research part is based on the search of the current state of selected agricultural farms. The research was focused on the South Bohemian Region which makes no exception in relation to this issue. Used for the research was a qualitative method of data collection with the information obtained through the techniques of controlled interviews and the secondary analysis of data provided by competent employees of farms in South Bohemia. The results are then outlined in two planes. During recent years, breeding stations have been completely renovated, especially in the section of technological processes. Modern electronic devices which include e. g. automated milking, feeding, <b>suction</b> and washing <b>equipment,</b> heating of service water and heating, should ensure trouble-free operation in such farms. However, what the vast majority of farms is not adequately prepared for is to ensure their smooth operation even during a failure of the electrical system. A number of farms do not have an alternate source of electrical energy. The percentage of self-sufficient farms having on its premises a pumping station that can supply the local diesel-aggregate, is also negligible. Moreover, in case of a diesel-aggregate failure, no alternative source is available. A crucial problem arises in the category of poultry. The animals are situated in large-volume halls where all processes are controlled by fully automated control systems. An alternative source of electrical energy is a crucial element needed to ensure normal operation of the farms. Unless the established criteria are in compliance (ventilation, lighting, etc.), reaction of the animals becomes evident within tens of minutes. Any deviation results in rapid loss of animals. It is assumed that the resulting data will be used both for research purposes in the area of secondary impacts in case of electrical system failures and for objective assessment of the effectiveness in farming security within the current methods. The purpose is to educate the above entities...|$|R
40|$|Of 144 {{consecutive}} {{women who}} requested early induced abortion, 99 (68. 7 %) and 45 (31. 3 %) women chose RU 486 combined with ONO 802 (<b>medical</b> method) and <b>suction</b> evacuation (surgical method), respectively. Logistic regression analysis of covariates showed that age and marital status were {{significantly correlated with}} the acceptability and hence {{the choice of the}} medical method. There were also more working women in this medical group. Previous experience of induced abortion had no influence on the current choice of the abortion method. This group of women appeared to have a tendency of treating their disease with medication rather than with surgery if the condition would allow. They expressed fear about surgery. The long induction-abortion interval of three days will have to be tolerated, but the duration of bleeding should be minimised in order to improve the acceptability of the drug. RU 486 is an alternative abortion method which should be made widely available. | Of 144 consecutive women who requested 1 st trimester induced abortion at the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong, 99 (68. 7 %) chose a medical method consisting of RU- 486 (mifepristone) combined with ONO 802 (gemeprost) and 45 (31. 3 %) chose the surgical method of suction evacuation. The study intended to define the profile of women who would accept the RU- 486 tablets on day 1, and then on day 3, ONO 802 pessaries were inserted during 6 hours of hospitalization. Follow-up days were 15 and 43 from the day RU- 486 was taken. The median age of the medical group was 29 years vs. 33 years for the surgical group. 91 % of women in the surgical group were married compared with 67 % in the medical group. Significantly more nulliparous women (40 %) and single women below the age of 30 years preferred the medical method. The condom was used more often in the medical group (61 %), while oral contraceptive pills were used by 55 % of women in the surgical group. Significantly more women in the medical group preferred medication to surgery. On day 3, 88 women reported headache, tenderness of breasts, sleep disturbance, palpitation, and weakness, however, only 5 women had intolerable symptoms, and 1 woman was hospitalized because of severe abdominal pain. On day 3, 67 (68 %) of women said they were not worried because their abortion had not yet occurred, while 32 women (32 %) were worried because they were skeptical about the efficacy of the drug. Comments on days 8, 15, and 43 indicated that 80 women would choose medical abortion again including 4 women who had to undergo suction evacuation because of failed medical abortion. 12 women required subsequent suction evacuation because of incomplete or missed abortion. Single, young, nulliparous Chinese working women are likely to accept RU- 486 and ONO 802. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
