The forum was devised as a pilot project aimed at testing the value of intercultural discussions between established migrant communities (in this case, mainly represented by post-WWII Greek and Italian migrants) and members of new and emerging communities (comprising migrants from Indonesia, Sierra Leone and Egypt) ...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} partnership is {{to raise awareness of}} the link between Tuberculosis and housing. The focus is on the London Borough of Brent, as it has the highest rate of TB of any London Borough, after Newham, with 101.12 new cases per 100,000 of population. The majority of those cases occur among minority communities.|$|R
40|$|How do {{cyberculture}} and cyberspace get “postcolonialized, ” appropriated for specific, politically {{useful and}} significant purposes? Lisa Law (2003) reading the online {{version of the}} <b>Migrant</b> <b>Forum</b> in Asia argues that the heterogeneity, contestability and contingency of the project’s cybercultural domain makes for a cyber-public space. Employing Nancy Fraser’s notion of competing publics, Law proposes that the diversity and politics of representation of this Forum enables a new configuration of community in cyberspace. I see an (Indian) {{example of such a}} cyber-public emerging in the Cybermohalla Project, a collaborative project of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) and the nongovernmental organization, Anku...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{cultural}} interpretation of transnational solidarities that Asian political activists are generating through electronic telecommunications networks. Its {{focus is on}} the experiences of the <b>Migrant</b> <b>Forum</b> in Asia [MFA], a network of non-government organizations that question issues of human rights, citizenship and working conditions of labour migrants in the Asian region. MFA’s networking activities are being transformed as email enables daily conversations across multiple national borders, and new ‘imagined’ communities of political action have emerged. English has been chosen as the language of solidarity, and photographs have become important in communicating activities and ideas. These media are innovative modes of transnational communication and shape political spaces that exist in symbiotic relation to the ‘real’. Attention to these practices, spaces and the symbolic meanings activists attach to these communities helps to illuminate a cultural politics of transnational activism in this region...|$|R
5000|$|One {{important}} NGO {{working on}} the regional level is Migrant-Rights.org, an organisation created in 2007 which draws attention to abuses of migrant workers in the Gulf region, works together with governments to effect legislative and policy changes, informs migrants workers and gives them a voice. The organisation publishes regular reports on migrant workers' rights violations, on legislative changes within the Gulf states, and on personal stories from migrant workers. They also provide detailed information, numbers and infographics. Additionally, they published a graph including all the different organisations and civil society groups they are connected with, including organizations for the general protection of migrant workers and location-specific organizations. Another organisation is the <b>Migrant</b> <b>Forum</b> Asia, a regional network of NGOs, trade unions, associations and individuals created {{for the protection of}} migrant workers' rights and the promotion of their wellbeing. They have reported on multiple issues involving Asian migrant workers in the Gulf region.|$|R
50|$|Kav LaOved {{operates}} {{in tandem with}} other non-government organizations (NGOs) such as Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Hotline for migrant worker, and Physicians for Human Rights - to change policy on matters of principle. Among others, the association {{is involved in the}} Forum for Enforcement of Worker Rights which focuses on the rights of contract-workers, in the Mandatory Pension Coalition, the <b>Migrant</b> Workers <b>Forum,</b> and in a joint project with some branches of the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU).|$|R
5000|$|One {{example of}} a {{national}} organisation is Lawyers for Human Rights International, an India-based NGO which campaigns {{for the protection of}} Indian migrant workers overseas. One of the main objectives of the NGO is to raise awareness about human rights abuses taking place in the GCC. Furthermore, in 2003 the UAE chapter of the Migrante International was created, an alliance of Filipino migrant worker organizations across the world. The objectives of the organisation are mainly to strengthen labor protection, and to increase penalties for recruitment agencies which violate Filipino laws and for employers who violate UAE labor laws. The organisation additionally provides services such as training, legal advice, counseling and temporary shelter for Filipinos who experience abuse from their employers. Two other organisations active in Bahrain are the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, focusing on migrant workers' rights amongst other issues, and the Migrant Workers Protection Society, created in 2005 to assist migrant workers in receiving full human rights protection. An {{example of a}}n individual initiative is the development of a smartphone app for migrant workers, created by an Indian journalist in Oman in 2016 together with the <b>Migrant</b> <b>Forum</b> Asia. On downloading, the app, called MigCall, saves ten helpline telephone numbers which provides access to services in six different languages. During registration, the user must also supply an emergency contact number. In case of an emergency, the user can press the SOS button in the app and a message will be sent to the emergency contact, while the user's GPS location will be sent to the closest Indian embassy or consulate. In February 2016, the app had been downloaded 12.000.000 times.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Johannesburg {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} migrant {{population}} and a range of urban health challenges. Locally informed and implemented responses to migration and health that are sensitive to the particular needs of diverse migrant groups are urgently required. In the absence of a coordinated response to migration and health in the city, the Johannesburg <b>Migrant</b> Health <b>Forum</b> (MHF) – an unfunded informal working group of civil society actors – was established in 2008. We assess the impact, contributions and challenges of the MHF on the development of local-level responses to migration and urban health in Johannesburg to date. In this Commentary, we draw on data from participant observation in MHF meetings and activities, a review of core MHF documents, and semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 MHF members. The MHF is contributing to the development of local-level migration and health responses in Johannesburg in three key ways: (1) tracking poor quality or denial of public services to migrants; (2) diverse organisational membership linking the policy process with community experiences; and (3) improving service delivery to migrant clients through participation of diverse service providers and civil society organisations in the Forum. Our findings indicate that the MHF has a vital role to play in supporting the development of appropriate local responses to migration and health in a context of continued – and increasing – migration, and against the backdrop of rising anti-immigrant sentiments...|$|R
40|$|These curated {{proceedings}} present {{what was}} discussed during the Ethnic <b>Migrant</b> Media <b>Forum,</b> a one-day event hosted by the Department of Communication Studies at Unitec Institute of Technology’s Mt Albert campus in 2014. It is also an attempt to provide an analysis of {{what was discussed}} by identifying a number of emerging themes. This publication brings together the curated statements by ethnic media practitioners, academics, and industry representatives involved with ethnic media in New Zealand, presenting a host of issues on ethnic media’s role within the country’s bicultural and multicultural context and organised around the three key themes: 1) Defining ethnic, migrant, diasporic media – what does it mean, who is it, what communities does it represent? 2) Roles and aims of ethnic media – why does ethnic media matter, who does it matter for and what role does ethnic media play in NZ? 3) Impact, challenges and potential – how can ethnic media be used more effectively, what are the challenges and potential? An introductory chapter by forum organisers and this publication’s editors, A/Prof. Evangelia Papoutsaki and Dr Elena Kolesova, presents a background context against which these themes are situated, while Dr Peter Thompson from Victoria University contributes a discussion chapter that brings in a different perspective. Selected information presented by Niche Media {{at the start of}} the forum is presented in infographics.
