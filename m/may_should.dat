2500|$|Corbyn's {{election}} campaign featured rallies {{with a large}} audience and connected with a grassroots following for the party, including appearing on stage {{in front of a}} crowd of 20,000 at the Wirral Live Festival in Prenton Park.

2500|$|A common {{application}} is to natural resource investments. [...] Here, the underlying asset is the resource itself; {{the value of}} the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the price of the commodity in question. [...] The value of the resource is then the difference between {{the value of the}} asset and the cost associated with developing the resource. Where positive ("in the money") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a call option. [...] A [...] <b>may</b> (<b>should)</b> therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or other standard techniques) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the real options framework.

2500|$|In April 2007, {{during a}} speech by May to a London, Ontario United Church of Canada, she said that [...] "In the eyes of history, John Howard, George Bush, and Stephen Harper will be judged more {{culpable}} than Neville Chamberlain." [...] "We have {{a moral obligation to}} our Lord and Father to ensure we don't destroy the creation that was given to us. Through the power of our Lord and Jesus Christ, we can meet this moral obligation," [...] said May. She condemned Prime Minister Stephen Harper's stance on climate change, comparing it to [...] "a grievance worse than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of the Nazis." [...] The statement drew criticism from the Canadian Jewish Congress and opposition parties. While Opposition leader Stéphane Dion refused to respond to Harper's request for him to distance himself from May and these remarks during Question Period, Dion did state to reporters outside Commons that <b>May</b> <b>should</b> withdraw the remarks, and that the Nazi regime is beyond any comparison. May said she was having [...] "a lousy week" [...] because of the federal government's weak action plan on the environment, was standing by her comments.|$|E

The Court of Spain has twice represented to us lately that the pirates have grown so bold that vessels have been carried off, even when coasting from one Spanish port to another. Visconti is specially watching the coast near Tunis, and you will therefore perhaps do better to proceed farther west, for every village from Tunis to Tangier is little better than a nest of pirates. I should imagine that you will find ample employment there during your three months' cruise. When I say that you are free to choose your own cruising ground, I do not mean that you should go up the Levant, or to the east of the Mediterranean, but that you are not bound to keep close along the African coast, but <b>may,</b> <b>should</b> you obtain any information to warrant your doing so, seek the pirates along the shores of Spain, Sardinia, Corsica, or Sicily.|$|E
60|$|The {{library at}} Osbaldistone Hall was a gloomy room, whose antique oaken shelves bent beneath {{the weight of}} the {{ponderous}} folios so dear to the seventeenth century, from which, under favour be it spoken, we have distilled matter for our quartos and octavos, and which, once more subjected to the alembic, <b>may,</b> <b>should</b> our sons be yet more frivolous than ourselves, be still farther reduced into duodecimos and pamphlets. The collection was chiefly of the classics, as well foreign as ancient history, and, above all, divinity. It was in wretched order. The priests, who in succession had acted as chaplains at the Hall, were, for many years, the only persons who entered its precincts, until Rashleigh's thirst for reading had led him to disturb the venerable spiders, who had muffled the fronts of the presses with their tapestry. His destination for the church rendered his conduct less absurd in his father's eyes, than if any of his other descendants had betrayed so strange a propensity, and Sir Hildebrand acquiesced in the library receiving some repairs, so as to fit it for a sitting-room. Still an air of dilapidation, as obvious as it was uncomfortable, pervaded the large apartment, and announced the neglect from which the knowledge which its walls contained {{had not been able to}} exempt it. The tattered tapestry, the worm-eaten shelves, the huge and clumsy, yet tottering, tables, desks, and chairs, the rusty grate, seldom gladdened by either sea-coal or faggots, intimated the contempt of the lords of Osbaldistone Hall for learning, and for the volumes which record its treasures.|$|E

60|$|That charmer {{made her}} appearance, it would seem, {{about the year}} 1705, when Pope was seventeen. Letters of his are extant, {{addressed}} to a certain Lady M——, whom the youth courted, and to whom he expressed his ardour in language, to say no worse of it, that is entirely pert, odious, and affected. He imitated love compositions {{as he had been}} imitating love poems just before—it was a sham mistress he courted, and a sham passion, expressed as became it. These unlucky letters found their way into print years afterwards, and were sold to the congenial Mr. Curll. If any of my hearers, as I hope they <b>may,</b> <b>should</b> take a fancy to look at Pope’s correspondence, let them pass over that first part of it; over, perhaps, almost all Pope’s letters to women; {{in which there is a}} tone of not pleasant gallantry, and, amidst a profusion of compliments and politenesses, a something which makes one distrust the little pert, prurient bard. There is very little indeed to say about his loves, and that little not edifying. He wrote flames and raptures and elaborate verse and prose for Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; but that passion probably came to a climax in an impertinence and was extinguished by a box on the ear, or some such rebuff, and he began on a sudden to hate her with a fervour much more genuine than that of his love had been. It was a feeble, puny grimace of love, and paltering with passion. After Mr. Pope had sent off one of his fine compositions to Lady Mary, he made a second draft from the rough copy, and favoured some other friend with it. He was so charmed with the letter of Gay’s, that I have just quoted, that he had copied that and amended it, and sent it to Lady Mary as his own. A gentleman who writes letters à deux fins, and after having poured out his heart to the beloved, serves up the same dish rechauffé to a friend, is not very much in earnest about his loves, however much he may be in his piques and vanities when his impertinence gets its due.|$|E
