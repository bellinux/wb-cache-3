5|$|However, one {{particular}} incident in Kasi {{had a profound}} impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused <b>meals</b> <b>at</b> choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.|$|E
5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before <b>meals.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E

Chromic oxide {{was used as}} inert digestibility marker. Higher ADC values of DM and energy were, respectively, 0. 862 and 0. 881 for corn gluten meal, 0. 811 and 0. 888 for poultry by-product meal; 0. 729 and 0. 731 for feather meal; 0. 666 and 0. 754 for fish meal; 0. 578 and 0. 642 for soybean meal; 0. 476 and 0. 652 for meat <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> 450. 0 g/kg; 0. 352 and 0. 449 for cottonseed <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> 380 g/kg; and 0. 251 and 0. 324 for cottonseed <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> 280. 0 g/kg. The highest average mineral availability was for poultry by-product meal (0. 582), and the lowest calcium and phosphorus availability were recorded for cottonseed <b>meal</b> <b>at</b> 280. 0 g/kg. Therefore, poultry by-product meal {{appears to be the}} best ingredient for using in Nile tilapia diets...|$|R
5|$|Thi {{lived in}} the American capital until 1975, {{when he moved to}} Arkansas. He {{lived in the}} {{southern}} state for a short period before settling in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He worked in a variety of jobs and occasionally made speeches at universities and to Vietnamese American organizations and meetings. According to his relatives, Thi remained popular among the Vietnamese American community, most of whom had come to the US after the fall of Saigon and were stridently anti-communist. His family said their refugee compatriots often recognized him, and usually refused to let him pay for <b>meals</b> <b>at</b> their restaurants. Thi's second marriage, to Oanh Nguyen, ended in divorce. They had five children, four sons and a daughter. He later remarried, to Catherine Nguyen, who bore him a daughter. In all, Thi had six children and 12 grandchildren. He died at the Hospice of Lancaster County from heart ailments on 23 June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their <b>meals</b> <b>at</b> the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

25|$|Dining cars first {{appeared}} in the late 1870s and into the 1880s. Until this time, the common practice was to stop for <b>meals</b> <b>at</b> restaurants along the way (which led to the rise of Fred Harvey's chain of Harvey House restaurants in America). At first, the dining car was simply a place to serve meals that were picked up en route, but they soon evolved to include galleys in which the meals were prepared.|$|E

With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot <b>meals</b> <b>at</b> any hour, reliably.|$|E
