50|$|The <b>Military</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Classification</b> (MLC) is {{a system}} of {{standards}} used by NATO to classify the safe amount of load a surface can withstand. Load-carrying capacity is shown in whole numbers for vehicles, bridges, roads, and routes. Vehicles are classified by weight, type, and effect on routes. Bridges, roads, and routes are classified by physical characteristics, type and flow of traffic, effects of weather, and other special conditions.|$|E
40|$|A major {{consideration}} {{in planning and}} executing military deployments is determining the routes available for moving troops and equipment. Part of this planning means ensuring {{that all of the}} bridges along the routes are able to support the specialized equipment needed. Because few trained and experienced bridge analysts are available, an automated tool is required to assist military engineers and planners in quickly and accurately determining the capacity or <b>Military</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Classification</b> of bridges. This tool must be flexible enough to handle various types of bridges, run on multiple platforms (Sun UNIX and PC Windows), be usable by engineers with various levels of experience, and be able to utilize various analysis methods depending on the amount of information available...|$|E
50|$|Route {{reconnaissance}} is {{the intelligence}} {{assessment of the}} operational environment in reconnaissance operations of routes for military use, including methods of reconnoitering and classifying them for other troops. In a tactical area of responsibility during combat operations {{the primary purpose of}} conducting route reconnaissance is to find and report all enemy forces that can interfere with movement along a route, and to identify the limit of direct-fire range and terrain that dominates the route. Route reconnaissance includes creation of reconnaissance overlays to identify land and water features, bridge reconnaissance and classification, road reconnaissance and classification, special terrain reconnaissance such as that used during cross-country movement, at the landing areas, on the inland waterways, or when using footpaths and trails, engineer reconnaissance, and use of military route signs (standard signs, sign lighting, bridge signs). A significant part of route reconnaissance is the ability to identify choke points that prohibit military traffic by using conversion factors and tables to identify non-standard surfaces or inadequate load bearing in structure. To do so, <b>Military</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Classifications</b> are used for standard vehicles of a given armed force. Route reconnaissance is typically conducted by a foot, horse or vehicle-mounted route reconnaissance patrol, sometimes with aid of aerial reconnaissance aircraft. The patrol would include regular reconnaissance elements and a combat engineering team.|$|R

40|$|A major {{consideration}} {{in planning and}} executing military deployments is determining the routes available for moving troops and equipment. Part of this planning ensures {{that all of the}} bridges along the routes can support the specialized equipment needed. Because few trained and experienced bridge analysts are available, and automated tool is required to help military engineers and planners quickly and accurately determine the capacity, or the <b>military</b> <b>load</b> <b>classification,</b> of bridges. However, because detailed information about each bridge may not always be available, the tool also needs to include alternative methods for estimating bridge capacities. SMART BRIDGE, developed by Argonne National Laboratory, provides this capacity. The tool consists of a collection of modules that interact with each other to accommodate various bridge types, analytical techniques, and database functions. 5 refs., 6 figs., 2 tabs...|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{the lowest}} bridge {{classification}} number (regardless of vehicle type or conditions of traffic flow) sets the <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> of a route. If no bridge {{is located on}} the route, the worst section of road governs the route's classification. Vehicles having higher <b>load</b> <b>classifications</b> than a particular route are sometimes able to use that route if a recon overlay or a special recon shows that a change in traffic control, such as making a bridge a single-flow crossing, would permit use of the route by heavier traffic.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{signature}} analysis of power appliance {{is the core}} of nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) where the detailed data of the appliances used in houses are obtained by analyzing changes in the voltage and current. This paper focuses on developing an automatic power load event detection and appliance classification based on machine learning. In power load event detection, the paper presents a new transient detection algorithm. By turn-on and turn-off transient waveforms analysis, it can accurately detect the edge point when a device is switched on or switched off. The proposed <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> technique can identify different power appliances with improved recognition accuracy and computational speed. The <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> method is composed of two processes including frequency feature analysis and support vector machine.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in modeling cognitive events from electroencephalogram (EEG) data is finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, {{as well as to}} inherent noise associated with such data. Herein, we propose a novel approach for learning such representations from multi-channel EEG time-series, and demonstrate its advantages in the context of mental <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> task. First, we transform EEG activities into a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images, as opposed to standard EEG analysis techniques that ignore such spatial information. Next, we train a deep recurrent-convolutional network inspired by state-of-the-art video classification to learn robust representations from the sequence of images. The proposed approach is designed to preserve the spatial, spectral, and temporal structure of EEG which leads to finding features that are less sensitive to variations and distortions within each dimension. Empirical evaluation on the cognitive <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> task demonstrated significant improvements in classification accuracy over current state-of-the-art approaches in this field.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{development}} of smart grids, especially the vast deployment of smart meters, enables users to access their energy {{data on a}} much more detailed scale. This has promoted considerable interest in nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) research. It is hoped that NILM techniques can separate energy-consumption data into individual appliance levels, thereby aiding customers who want to save energy or cut back usage. For this dissertation, we implemented a novel NILM system based on a support vector machine (SVM), an edge symbol analysis method (ESA), and principal power component analysis (PPCA). Our research uses a set of power load disaggregation methods, which constitute {{the most important part}} of our NILM system. Furthermore, our system automatically monitors a household power consumption and the power consumption of individual devices. We have developed the means to automatically detect a power-load event and the means to classify appliances based on machine learning. Our methods involve a new transient-detection algorithm. By analysing turn-on and turn-off transients, it can accurately detect the points when a device is switched on or switched off. The proposed <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> technique can identify different power appliances with better recognition accuracy and computational speed. The <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> method comprises two items: frequency feature analysis and a support vector machine. Our results indicate that by incorporating the new edge detection and turn-on, turn-off transient signature analyses into our NILM, more information is revealed than by traditional NILM methods. The <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> method achieved more than 90 percent recognition rate. We also propose a multiple class support vector machine to recognize different appliances. The approach consists of two stages. In stage one, feature analysis is applied to power signals. In stage two, a trained classifier based on SVM was applied to identify different appliances. Our experiment results on real data give better performance compared to other studies that have used supervised classification for household power-appliance monitoring. Our contributions also focus on feature extraction and pattern analysis for whole-house power <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> and disaggregation. Specifically, after finding a specific power event (such as a switch-on or switch-off) and clustering data in terms of power factor, the optimized features can be obtained from our algorithm by looking at harmonics of active/reactive power and using eigenvalue feature analysis. The experiments, based on real world data, give higher recognition accuracy and faster computational speed, and represent a promising approach for distinguishing different loads effectively...|$|R

40|$|As the {{frequency}} gap between main memory and modern microprocessor grows, the implementation {{and efficiency of}} on-chip caches become more important. The growing latency to memory is motivating new research into load instruction behavior and selective data caching. This work investigates the <b>classification</b> of <b>load</b> instruction behavior. A new <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> method is proposed that classifies loads into those vital to performance and those not vital to performance. A limit study is presented to characterize different types of non-vital loads and to quantify the percentage of loads that are non-vital. Finally, a realistic implementation of the non-vital <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> method is presented and a new cache structure called the Vital Cache is proposed {{to take advantage of}} non-vital loads. The Vital Cache caches data for vital loads only, deferring non-vital loads to slower caches. Results: The limit study shows 75 % of all loads are non-vital with only 35 % of the accessed data space being vital for caching. The Vital Cache improves the efficiency of the cache hierarchy and the hit rate for vital loads. The Vital Cache increases performance by 17 %. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of smart power grids, communication network technology and sensor technology, {{there has been an}} exponential growth in complex electricity load data. Irregular electricity load fluctuations caused by the weather and holiday factors disrupt the daily operation of the power companies. To deal with these challenges, this paper investigates a day-ahead electricity peak load interval forecasting problem. It transforms the conventional continuous forecasting problem into a novel interval forecasting problem, and then further converts the interval forecasting problem into the classification forecasting problem. In addition, an indicator system influencing the electricity load is established from three dimensions, namely the load series, calendar data, and weather data. A semi-supervised feature selection algorithm is proposed to address an electricity <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> forecasting issue based on the group method of data handling (GMDH) technology. The proposed algorithm consists of three main stages: (1) training the basic classifier; (2) selectively marking the most suitable samples from the unclassified label data, and adding them to an initial training set; and (3) training the classification models on the final training set and classifying the test samples. An empirical analysis of electricity load dataset from four Chinese cities is conducted. Results show that the proposed model can address the electricity <b>load</b> <b>classification</b> forecasting problem more efficiently and effectively than the FW-Semi FS (forward semi-supervised feature selection) and GMDH-U (GMDH-based semi-supervised feature selection for customer classification) models...|$|R
