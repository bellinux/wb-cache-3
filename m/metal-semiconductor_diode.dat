50|$|G.W. Pickard {{received}} a patent in 1906 on a point-contact rectifier using silicon. In 1907, George W. Pierce published {{a paper in}} Physical Review showing rectification properties of diodes made by sputtering many metals on many semiconductors. The use of the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> rectifier was proposed by Lilienfeld in 1926 {{in the first of}} his three transistor patents as the gate of the metal-semiconductor field effect transistors.The correct theory of the field-effect transistor using a metal/semiconductor gate was advanced by William Shockley in 1939.|$|E
50|$|The first {{theory that}} {{predicted}} the correct direction of rectification of the metal-semiconductor junction {{was given by}} Nevill Mott in 1939. He found the solution for both the diffusion and drift currents of the majority carriers through the semiconductor surface space charge layer which has been known since about 1948 as the Mott barrier. Walter H. Schottky and Spenke extended Mott's theory by including a donor ion whose density is spatially constant through the semiconductor surface layer. This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor space-charge layer under the metal {{is known as the}} Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939. Although it gives the correct direction of rectification, it has also been proven that the Mott theory and its Schottky-Davydov extension gives the wrong current limiting mechanism and wrong current-voltage formulae in silicon metal/semiconductor diode rectifiers. The correct theory was developed by Hans Bethe and reported by him in a M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Report dated November 23, 1942. In Bethe's theory, the current is limited by thermionic emission of electrons over the metal-semiconductor potential barrier. Thus, the appropriate name for the <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> should be the Bethe diode, instead of the Schottky diode, since the Schottky theory does not predict the modern <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> characteristics correctly.|$|E
50|$|The MESFET {{differs from}} the common {{insulated}} gate FET or MOSFET in {{that there is no}} insulator under the gate over the active switching region. This implies that the MESFET gate should, in transistor mode, be biased such that one does not have a forward-conducting <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>diode</b> instead of a reversed-biased depletion zone controlling the underlying channel. While this restriction inhibits certain circuit possibilities as the gate must remain reverse-biased and cannot therefore exceed a certain voltage of forward bias, MESFETs analog and digital devices work reasonably well if kept within the confines of design limits. The most critical aspect of the design is the gate metal extent over the switching region. Generally the narrower the gate modulated carrier channel the better the frequency handling abilities, overall. Spacing of the source and drain with respect to the gate, and the lateral extent of the gate are important though somewhat less critical design parameters. MESFET current handling ability improves as the gate is elongated laterally, keeping the active region constant, however is limited by phase shift along the gate due to the transmission line effect. As a result, most production MESFETs use a built up top layer of low resistance metal on the gate, often producing a mushroom-like profile in cross section.|$|E

The diode was kink-shaped at the metal-semiconductor interface. It was shown that (1) larger negative V(sub g) blocked I(sub d) more effectively in the negative V(sub d) region, resulting in the rectifying I(sub d) -V(sub d) characteristics, and that (2) positive V(sub g) allowed I(sub d) in the both V(sub d) polarities, resulting in the non-rectifying characteristics. The negative V(sub d) was the Schottky reverse direction, judging from the negligible I(sub d) behavior for a wide region of - 4 V (is less than) V(sub d) (is less than) 0 V, with V(sub g) = - 4 V. Such negative V(sub g) would attract positive charges from the metallic electrodes (charge reservoir) to the nanotube and lower the nanotube Fermi energy (E(sub F)). With larger negative V(sub g), the experiment showed that the Schottky forward direction (V(sub d) (is greater than) 0) had a smaller turn-on voltage and the Schottky reverse direction (V(sub d) (is less than) 0) was more resistant to the tunneling breakdown. Therefore, the majority carriers in the transport would be electrons since they can see a lower tunneling barrier (shallower built-in potential) in the forward direction when E(sub F) is lowered, and a thicker tunneling barrier (Schottky barrier) in the reverse direction due to {{the reduction in the}} electron density when E(sub F) is lowered...|$|E

A Schottky barrier is usually formed at the Gr/Si heterojunction, which consequently shows the typical rectifying behavior of a metal-semiconductor Schottky diode. The Schottky barrier height strongly depend on the fabrication method and on the quality of the interface. Compared to a <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>diode,</b> the Gr/Si heterojunction presents important new peculiarities. The vanishing density of states of graphene at the Dirac point enables energy Fermi tuning and hence Schottky barrier height modulation by a single anode-cathode bias [1, 2]. Hence, the Gr/Si heterojunction can function as a two terminal barristor. Furthermore, graphene can be used as anti-reflecting and transparent layer, and can facilitate photo-charge separation and transport, thus enabling optoelectronic applications for the Gr/Si heterojunction [1, 2].

These selenium rectifiers were used (and are still used) to convert alternating current to direct current in electrical power applications.

The isolation of IMPATT diodes on a single chip by means of bombardment with high doses of protons has been investigated and found not to cause degradation of these devices. Deep levels characteristically found in the very thin n type layers of FET structures grown on semi-insulating substrates have also been examined.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{quantify}} the key design parameters such as the load capacity, actuation force, positioning repeatability, and reliability for droplet-based electrowetting actuators. Due {{to the fact that}} surface tension dominates gravity at both the mesoscale and microscale, droplet-based actuators can provide adequate force in manipulation tasks at those scales. Electrowetting, which uses an electric field to modulate the apparent surface tension of the liquid-ambient, provides a method to actuate droplets, which in turn transports the object carried by the droplet. Most previous electrowetting actuation efforts have concentrated on manipulating droplets in a closed two-plate configuration. In these configurations, a voltage potential is applied between a series of electrodes. The droplets can merge, split, and mix with only a voltage input, and without any external machinery. While some mechanical actuation demonstrations have been done, limited studies have been performed to investigate the key actuation performance characteristics of droplet-based actuators carrying solid objects. Design criteria for using droplets to carry solid components are still not well defined. The first part of this work provides fundamental understanding of the forces in electrowetting-based droplet actuation. The actuation force during electrowetting was experimentally validated according to the governing relation (Young–Lippmann equation) on a custom-designed testing apparatus. The results from the experiments show that the electrowetting actuation force is independent of surface tension below saturation, but the peak force is proportional to surface tension. Higher surface/interfacial tension would increase the actuation force in the horizontal direction, as well as the speed of the actuator. The second part of the dissertation demonstrates two actuation configurations based on electrowetting. The first actuator uses a droplet to carry a solid object and can be actuated in discrete steps to function as a micro-stepping linear motor. By implementing a leaky dielectric coating, the droplet/substrate contact area acts as an electrical diode. By varying the duty cycle of a square waveform, a range of droplet/part equilibrium position combinations are established. The underlying actuation mechanism was investigated and the position versus duty cycle relation was shown to be symmetrical but non–linear around the center of the electrodes. In contrast to the conventional electrowetting control scheme, the proposed actuation method required no feedback control loop while achieving a repeatability of less than 0. 8 % of the droplet diameter. Positioning matched a theoretical model based on idealized electrical elements to within 2. 5 % of the droplet diameter. The second type of electrowetting actuation uses <b>metal-semiconductor</b> <b>diodes</b> (Schottky diodes) in place of electrochemical diodes. This configuration uses only one pair of electrodes to actuate the droplet over a large distance (5 X or more the droplet diameter). While the actuation concept had been previously demonstrated, the reliability of the diodes were shown to be insufficient. The new diodes actuated without degradation under repeated actuation (2000 cycles). Comparing this to electrochemical diodes, a 50 % reduction in actuation voltage was also accomplished by Schottky diodes. The measured maximum speed also increased from 32 mm/s (electrochemical diodes) to 240 mm/s (Schottky), a 7. 5 fold improvement. The last part of this dissertation used numerical simulations to investigate the load bearing capability and the stiffness variation of droplet-based actuators. The vertical force and stiffness - which are the primary figure of merit in designing droplet-based actuators are quantified. Three types of loading conditions were analyzed using simulation software and a simple analytical equation is shown to provide a useful approximation of the droplet force and stiffness. The results were further used in various case studies to demonstrate the optimal design strategy when using an electrowetting driven droplet as a fluidic bearing...|$|R

The density of the threading dislocations was reported relatively low. In this thesis, we further examined the material, electrical and optical characteristics of nearly relaxed InAs/GaP heterojunctions. In spite of the large lattice mismatch (∼ 11 %) and high density of 90 ° edge-type dislocations, the electrical characteristics were surprisingly good. The resulting I-V characteristics of both the isotype and anisotype junctions showed low leakage currents and high breakdown voltages in reverse bias and nearly ideal, Schottky-barrier like, forward bias characteristics with ideality factors of 1. 1 or less.

When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal <b>metal-semiconductor</b> Schottky-barrier <b>diode.</b> The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly {{enough to cover the}} Schottky clamped TTL ICs using platinum silicide Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{improvement}} in Pt/n-GaN <b>metal-semiconductor</b> (MS) Schottky <b>diode</b> characteristics {{by the introduction of}} a layer of HfO 2 (5 nm) between the metal and semiconductor interface. The resulting Pt/HfO 2 /n-GaN metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) Schottky diode showed an increase in rectification ratio from 35. 9 to 98. 9 (@ 2 V), increase in barrier height (0. 52 eV to 0. 63 eV) and a reduction in ideality factor (2. 1 to 1. 3) as compared to the MS Schottky. Epitaxial n-type GaN films of thickness 300 nm were grown using plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE). The crystalline and optical qualities of the films were confirmed using high resolution X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements. Metal-semiconductor (Pt/n-GaN) and metal-insulator-semiconductor (Pt/HfO 2 /n-GaN) Schottky diodes were fabricated. To gain further understanding of the Pt/HfO 2 /GaN interface, I-V characterisation was carried out on the MIS Schottky diode over a temperature range of 150 K to 370 K. The barrier height was found to increase (0. 3 eV to 0. 79 eV) and the ideality factor decreased (3. 6 to 1. 2) with increase in temperature from 150 K to 370 K. This temperature dependence was attributed to the inhomogeneous nature of the contact and the explanation was validated by fitting the experimental data into a Gaussian distribution of barrier heights.

Hot electron based optoelectronic devices have {{been regarded as}} cost-e ective candidates to their conventional counterparts. The efficiency of conventional optoelectronic devices that rely on semiconductor photo-absorbers are mainly limited by the energy bandgap of the semiconductor. On the other hand, hot electron devices can overcome this limitation via the photoemission" mechanism. Absorbed photons give their energy to free electrons of the metal and these high energy (") electrons {{can be used to}} generate photocurrent in proper device configurations. High optical re ection from metals has remained as the main drawback of this photocurrent generation scheme but this problem has recently been addressed by the use of surface plasmons. Optical energy can be tightly confined to a metal layer or metal nanostructures in the form of surface plasmons, and the decay of surface plasmons in metals generates hot electrons. In this work, we study mechanisms of surface plasmon excitation, surface plasmon decay, hot electron generation and hot electron photoemission for photocurrent generation. We demonstrate novel device architectures and plasmon excitation structures. We demonstrate the use of such layers for plasmon enhanced hot electron based photodetectors and photovoltaic devices. A <b>metal-semiconductor</b> Schottky junction <b>diode</b> structure is used as hot electron photodetector. A double metal-insulator-metal (MIM) architecture is proposed as a hot electron photovoltaic device. Full wave electromagnetic simulations of these device structures are conducted to provide insight into the surface plasmon assisted hot electron generation process and give future directions in this field. by Fatih Bilge Atar.

The compounds synthesised and studied included 5, 14 -dihydro- 5, 7, 12, 14 -tetraazapentacene(L 5 H[sub] 2), dibutyldihydro- 5, 7, 12, 14 -tetraazapentacene (L 5 Bu[sub] 2 H[sub] 2), 7, 16 -dihydro- 5, 7, 9, 14, 16, 18 -hexaazaheptacene(L 7 H[sub] 2), 7, 20 -dihydro- 5, 7, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22 -octaazanonacene (L 9 H[sub] 2), dibutyldihydro- 5, 7, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22 - octaazanonacene (L 9 Bu[sub] 2 H[sub] 2), “Polyquinoxaline"(poly[1, 6 -dihydropyrazino(2, 3 -g) -quinoxaline- 2, 3, 8 -triyl- 7 (2 H) -ylidene- 7, 8 -dimethylidene) and the dibutyl-substituted (poly[1, 6 -dihydropyrazino(2, 3 - g) -quinoxaline- 2, 3, 8 -triyl- 7 (2 H) -ylidene- 7, 8 -dimethylidene). Some alkyl-substituted oligomers were also made, so as to increase their solubility in organic solvents. Both liquid phase and solid phase synthesis {{have been used in}} preparing these compounds, the latter being done in an attempt to produce the compounds in their purest form. In the case of L 7 H[sub] 2, this method gave the first successful synthesis of the compound. A number of techniques, such as FTIR, solid-state NMR and Visible / Ultraviolet spectroscopy have been used in characterising both the synthesised compounds and the first in the "quinoxaline" series of compounds phenazine (L 3), which is commercially available. For solutions of the oligomers in concentrated sulphuric acid, the HOMO-LUMO absorption bands in the UV-visible decreased monotonically with the number of rings. The electrochromic properties of vacuum evaporated thin films of dihydrotetraazapentacene (L 5 H[sub] 2) and dihydrohexaazaheptacene (L 7 H[sub] 2) have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry. These investigations suggest that L 7 H[sub] 2 thin films exhibit similar intermediate redox states to L 5 H[sub] 2 films. Two-point electrical conductivity measurements have been carried out on pressed powder pellets of doped and undoped oligomers, substituted oligomers and ladder polymers. The electrical conductivities showed marked increases of five to six orders of magnitude as a result of doping the materials with hydrogen chloride vapour. The final major part of the project was the first fabrication of <b>metal-semiconductor</b> Schottky <b>diode</b> devices based on vacuum-evaporated thin films of dihydrotetraazapentacene (L 5 H[sub] 2). Schottky diode devices on L 5 H[sub] 2 films were successfully made using a range of metal contacts (Sn, Cu. AI, Pb, Au and Ag). Electrical measurements on various metal-doped L 5 H[sub] 2 films gave I-V characteristics indicative of a Schottky barrier formed at a metal/n-type semiconductor interface. These electrical device measurements were mathematically modelled to determine the magnitude of the Schottky barriers at the various metal-semiconductor interfaces. This information and the electrochromic redox measurements on L 5 H[sub] 2 thin films have helped to characterise the charge-transfer processes in these oligomer thin films...|$|R
