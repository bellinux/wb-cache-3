500|$|The tragedy Sardanapalus by George Gordon Byron {{published}} in 1821 and produced in 1834 {{is set in}} Assyria, 640 B.C., under King Sardanapalus. The play deals with the revolt against the extravagant king and his relationship to his favourite slave <b>Myrrha.</b> <b>Myrrha</b> made Sardanapalus appear {{at the head of}} his armies, but after winning three successive battles in this way he was eventually defeated. A beaten man, Myrrha persuaded Sardanapalus to place himself on a funeral pyre which she would ignite and subsequently leap onto - burning them both alive. The play has been interpreted as an autobiography, with Sardanapalus as Byron's alter ego, Zarina as Byron's wife Anne Isabella, and Myrrha as his mistress Teresa. At a more abstract level Myrrha is the desire for freedom driving those who feel trapped or bound, as well as being the incarnation of Byron's dream of romantic love. Byron knew the story of the mythical Myrrha, if not directly through Ovid's Metamorphoses, then at least through Alfieri's Mirra, which he was familiar with.

Wolfson phrases and interprets the relation of the play Sardanapalus and the myth of Myrrha:Although Byron's own play evades the full import of this complicated association, Myrrha's name means that it name's referring to incest, red. cannot be escaped entirely - especially since Ovid's story of Myrrha's incest poses a potential reciprocal to the nightmare Byron invents for Sardanapalus, of sympathy with the son who is the object of his mother's 'incest'.|$|E
40|$|The Belgian nuclear {{research}} institute (SCK•CEN) is developing <b>MYRRHA.</b> <b>MYRRHA</b> is a flexible fast spectrum research reactor, conceived as an {{accelerator driven system}} (ADS). The configuration of the primary loop is pool-type: the primary coolant and all the primary system components (core and heat exchangers) are contained within the reactor vessel, while the secondary fluid is circulating in the heat exchangers. The primary coolant is Lead Bismuth Eutectic (LBE). The recent nuclear accident of Fukushima in 2011 changed the requirements {{for the design of}} new reactors, which should include the possibility to remove the residual decay heat through passive primary and secondary systems, i. e. natural convection (NC). After the reactor shut down, in the unlucky event of propeller failures, the primary and secondary loops should be able to remove the decay heat in passive way (Natural Convection). The present study analyses the flow and the temperature distribution in the upper plenum by applying laser imaging techniques in a laboratory scaled water model. A parametric study is proposed to study stratification mitigation strategies by varying the geometry of the buffer tank simulating the upper plenum...|$|E
5|$|The Metamorphoses of Ovid {{has been}} {{illustrated}} by several artists through time. In 1563 in Frankfurt, a German bilingual translation by Johann Posthius was published, featuring the woodcuts of renowned German engraver Virgil Solis. The illustration of <b>Myrrha</b> depicts <b>Myrrha's</b> deceiving her father {{as well as}} her fleeing from him. In 1717 in London, a Latin-English edition of Metamorphoses was published, translated by Samuel Garth and with plates of French engraver Bernard Picart. The illustration of <b>Myrrha</b> was entitled The Birth of Adonis and featured <b>Myrrha</b> as a tree delivering Adonis while surrounded by women. In 1857 French engraver Gustave Doré made a series of illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, the depiction of <b>Myrrha</b> showing her in the eighth circle of Hell.|$|R
5|$|Several metamorphosing insects' {{scientific}} names reference the myth. <b>Myrrha</b> is a genus of ladybug beetles, {{such as the}} 18-spot ladybird (<b>Myrrha</b> octodecimguttata) Libythea <b>myrrha,</b> the club beak, is a butterfly native to India. Cupido <b>myrrha</b> is a rare species of butterfly named by Herrich-Schäffer found on Mount Erciyes in south-eastern Turkey. Catocala <b>myrrha</b> is a synonym for a species of moth known as married underwing. In total the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum lists eight Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) with the <b>myrrha</b> name.|$|R
5|$|<b>Myrrha</b> {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, <b>Myrrha's</b> being madness. <b>Myrrha's</b> {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in <b>Myrrha's</b> contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|R
5000|$|The Hebrew word used {{to denote}} this incense is מור = [...] "mōr." [...] Maimonides, {{following}} a lead by Rabbi Saadia Gaon, believed this incense {{to have been}} musk (Moschus moschiferus), the aromatic substance which exudes from a gland on the male musk deer. From ancient times down to our present time, an incense has been made from it. Still, {{with respect to the}} Holy Incense, musk is largely thought of today as being an erroneous designation. Nahmanides (RAMBAN), in his commentary on Exodus 30:23, gives plausible arguments why the [...] "mōr" [...] in the Holy Incense can only be the gum resin myrrh (Commiphora <b>myrrha,</b> syn. Balsamodendrum <b>myrrha)</b> rather than the musk absolute. While quoting from the Midrash Rabba, he notes that the [...] "mōr" [...] is said to emit its fragrant odor only when put to heat, whereas the musk absolute already has a sweet odor before it is put to the fire. He quotes also from an early rabbinic source which says that [...] "mōr," [...] when it clings to vessels, serves as an interposing object between the water and the vessel, preventing its valid immersion in a ritual bath (Heb. miqwah). RAMBAN notes that this can only apply to the gum resin myrrh, which is sticky, but NOT to musk absolute taken from the musk deer.|$|R
