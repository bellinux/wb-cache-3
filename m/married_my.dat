5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he <b>married</b> <b>my</b> stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
500|$|I had to {{deal with}} the loss of my mother and then {{had to deal}} with the guilt of her being gone and then I {{had to deal with}} the loss of my father when he <b>married</b> <b>my</b> stepmother. So I was just one angry {{abandoned}} girl. I'm still angry. The part of me that goes around saying [...] "Fuck you! Fuck you!" [...] is the part that's covering up the part that's saying [...] "I'm hurt!" [...] I guess all of this came through in the video.|$|E
500|$|Prior to her {{marriage}} to Miller, Jolie began a relationship with model-actress Jenny Shimizu {{on the set of}} Foxfire (1996). She later said, [...] "I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't <b>married</b> <b>my</b> husband. I {{fell in love with her}} the first second I saw her." [...] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people. In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, [...] "Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1828, Johnson was an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for re-election, owing {{in part to}} {{his relationship with the}} octaroon slave Julia Chinn, with whom he lived in a common-law marriage. Although members of his own district seemed little bothered by the arrangement, slaveholders elsewhere in the state were not so forgiving. In his own defense, Johnson said, [...] "Unlike Jefferson, Clay, Poindexter and others I <b>married</b> <b>my</b> wife under the eyes of God, and apparently He has found no objections." [...] (Note: The named men were suspected or known to have similar relationships with slave women.) According to Henry Robert Burke, what people objected to was Johnson trying to introduce his daughters to [...] "polite society". People were used to planters and overseers having relationships with slave women, but they were expected to deny them.|$|E
500|$|Lovato had no {{interest}} in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother. She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He was mean, but {{he wanted to be a}} good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom <b>married</b> <b>my</b> stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [...] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'." [...] She has written multiple songs about him. Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.|$|E
2500|$|While {{assimilation}} was {{a crucial}} part of the Carlisle School's plan, it was also looked at controversially by some Native Americans who felt they were pushed to marry interracially. As Katherine Ellinghaus notes in her book, “There was considerable resistance to the school’s unspoken policy regarding interracial marriage.” On the Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center, this also proves evident. Isaiah Wasaquam, a member of the Ottawa Nation, echoes controversy in an application to Carlisle when he answers a question about his marriage proudly, “it has been nearly ten years since I <b>married</b> <b>my</b> Race.” [...] Research suggests this was a subtle hint to the school’s officials to prove that they have married their own race. Most likely, this backlash by the Native’s {{is due to the fact}} that the school was trying to, “take the Indian out of the man.” Additionally, Cathleen Cahill proves that the Carlisle School matches the time in history that enveloped such assimilation, [...] "During the closing decades of the nineteenth century, the federal government's strategies for changing Indian societies tacitly encouraged interracial marriage." [...] Although this unwritten rule of interracial marriage was never proven, the conversation remains ongoing regarding the controversiality of this occurrence.|$|E
