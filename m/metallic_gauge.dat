In particular, it reports the capacitive with the piezoresistive transduction schemes {{in terms of}} the overall sensor performance. The developed model is clearly in accordance with the general experimental observations obtained for NEMS-based mass detection. The piezoresistive devices are much sensitive (up to 10 zg/?Hz) than capacitive ones (close to 100 zg/?Hz) since they can work at higher frequency.

40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed technique of synchronous differential temperature measurements (Titov & Malinovsky 2005), {{the existence of}} the thermal surface energy (TSE) and of thermal hysteresis effect has been demonstrated in <b>metallic</b> <b>gauge</b> blocks (GB). The TSE (described here) is observed if there are inputs of energy and momentum of external electromagnetic (EM) field to material artefact and the heat source is not symmetrically located relative to the artefact surface. The TSE, linearly related to the Poynting vector of the EM field, presents the energy of the oriented motion of the coupled field-particles system inside artifacts. The TSE results in a thermal hysteresis effect, which is irreversible in time and has no symmetry in space. As the principle of superposition is shown not to be valid for EM fields in case of TSE, the hysteresis loop for the continuous sweep in time converts into a spiral, in which the form and the magnitude of the each cycle are slightly different from the ones of the adjacent cycles. In confirmation of the preceding theoretical result (Stroud et al 1972), the number of influence parameters in case of the field-particle system is found to be absolutely enormous, so that the thermal evolution process has, practically, infinite number of the existence and manifestation modes. Our studies present also an experimental confirmation of the basic results of the series of theoretical papers, initiated by R. H. Dicke (1954), in which the interaction of the ensemble of atoms with the electromagnetic field is analyzed...|$|E
30|$|Strain gauges are piezoresistive sensors, that is, their {{resistance}} changes {{when they are}} stretched or compressed. The {{most common type of}} strain <b>gauge</b> is the <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauge,</b> which consists of a very fine wire arranged in a grid pattern. The wire is bonded to a thin and flexible substrate, which is then attached to the test specimen. As the test specimen is deformed, the thin wire in the gauge is stretched or compressed, thus changing its length and consequently its electrical resistance[23]. Other types of strain gauges are based on semiconductor materials, like silicon.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs), {{established in}} nanoscale range, {{are one of}} the most studied materials since their discovery, in Japan by S. Iijima in 1991. Due to their excellent electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, it is predicted that CNTs can be used in a wide field of technological applications. The aim of this thesis is to produce a CNT strain gauge due to this material offers higher sensitivity than <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges,</b> between other advantages. When manufacturing a CNT strain gauge, there are two major factors that have to be taken into consideration, and namely a homogenous layer and the reproducibility of the sensor. The inkjet printing could be one of the most appropriate methods to obtain the above-mentioned characteristics. During the last years, this method has become very popular because its non-contact liquid deposition, defined material requirements, repeatability, scalability and direct writing. The present work gives an overview of the deposition of fluid suspensions containing CNT on different substrates, with a variation of the contact angle, using a Dimatix DMP- 2831 drop-on-demand (DoD) piezo-inkjet printer. In order to print CNTs with the DMP, the production of a required ink was necessary to avoid the clogging of the nozzles and to facilitate the printing process. For the dispersion, deionized water has been mixed with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) in different concentrations. Afterwards, a separation of bundled and unbundled CNTs was carried out through a centrifugation process. According to the change of the some parameters, more homogeneity and closed layer were obtained by optical characterization with PET treated, higher substrate temperature, higher number of layers, shorter distance between deposited drops and higher printing frequency. Moreover, more conductivity was measured for these parameters. Finally, higher sensitivity than in <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges</b> was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Reinforced {{and plain}} {{polymers}} are highly elastic. In order to measure strain of parts made of these, strain sensors {{have to be}} highly elastic too. Such sensors, certainly for cyclic loading conditions with high amplitudes, are not available. Pseudoelastic shape memory alloys are used to realise high performance strain sensors with high elasticity. These sensors can be elastically strained up to 80, 000 µm/m. In cyclic loading conditions strain levels or amplitudes of about 20, 000 µm/m are possible. The high elasticity stems from the stress-induced phase transformation of the SMA.

40|$|In {{the field}} of Structural Health Monitoring, there is growing {{interest}} in continuous volume measurements of material properties using embedded sensors organized in wireless sensor networks (1, 2, 3). In this work we propose a novel, highly reproducible piezoresistive sensor based on Carbon Nanotube (CNT) networks deposited on polymer {{to be used for}} embedded strain monitoring and crack detection in concrete. We highlight the originality of the fabrication process and describe the modalities for signal conditioning and for integration into a RFID-based wireless sensor network. We have achieved the first reported strain gauge fabricated by direct inkjet printing of CNTs on polymeric substrates, namely Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE). The strain gauge we propose is of interest for its flexibility and sensitivity (Gauge Factor) which is higher than that of metallic sensors. For these reasons we believe that the proposed strain gauge is a promising alternative to the rigid <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges</b> currently on the market. The method is based on the dispersion of CNTs in a solution of 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, with sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate added as surfactant to enhance the solution’s wettability on the polymer. The solution is used as ink to print resistive layers of randomly oriented CNTs on polymer. We optimized the printing and the rinsing process for maximum control of the resistivity and uniformity of the CNT layers. The sensors show a Gauge Factor (GF) of 2. 54 which is superior to commercial <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges</b> by 25 %. Our technology is characterized by its high reproducibility, with only a 6. 8 % variation of GF values for different sensors fabricated on ETFE. Tests on multiple loading cycles prove the repeatability of the measurements over several loading cycles. Our results suggest that such devices could be used in real life applications. With this goal in mind, we compare several electronic circuits for signal conditioning (from Wheatstone bridge with amplification chain to Sigma-Delta conditioner) in order to select the more appropriate for embedded sensing in concrete. The application dictates two constraints on the electronics: low power consumption and small dimension. We suggest that a configuration based on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is the optimum solution given the imposed constraints (4, 5). We propose an architecture that can be exploited in conditioning elements sensitive to other parameters of interested for SHM as humidity and pH sensors (6). Although the sensor has its own intrinsic merits, our project presents a complete system (sensor with conditioning electronics) which is innovative, original and intended for a practical application of great importance to modern societies...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} strain-sensitive thin films based on {{chemically}} reduced graphene oxide (GO) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) without adding any further surfactants. In {{spite of the}} insulating properties of the thin-film-based GO due to the presence functional groups such as hydroxyl, epoxy, and carbonyl groups in its atomic structure, a significant enhancement of the film conductivity was reached by chemical reduction with hydro-iodic acid. By optimizing the MWCNT content, a significant improvement of electrical and mechanical thin film sensitivity is realized. The optical properties and the morphology of the prepared thin films were studied using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The UV-Vis spectra showed the ability to tune the band gap of the GO by changing the MWCNT content, whereas the SEM indicated that the MWCNTs were well dissolved and coated by the GO. Investigations of the piezoresistive properties of the hybrid nanocomposite material under mechanical load show a linear trend between the electrical resistance and the applied strain. A relatively high gauge factor of 8.5 is reached compared to the commercial <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges.</b> The self-assembled hybrid films exhibit outstanding properties in electric conductivity, mechanical strength, and strain sensitivity, which provide a high potential for use in strain-sensing applications.|$|R

While <b>metallic</b> foil <b>gauges</b> {{usually have a}} gauge factor slightly over 2, single crystalline silicon demonstrates intrinsic gauge factors as high as 200. Although silicon is an intrinsically stiff and brittle material, flexible and even stretchable strain gauges have been achieved by integrating thin silicon strips on soft and deformable polymer substrates. To achieve a fundamental understanding of the large variance in gauge factor and stretchability of reported flexible/stretchable silicon-on-polymer strain gauges, finite element and analytically models are established to reveal {{the effects of the}} length of the silicon strip, and the thickness and modulus of the polymer substrate. Analytical results for two limiting cases, i. e., infinitely thick substrate and infinitely long strip, have found good agreement with FEM results. We have discovered that strains in silicon resistor can vary by orders of magnitude with different substrate materials whereas strip length or substrate thickness only affects the strain level mildly. While the average strain in silicon reflects the gauge factor, the maximum strain in silicon governs the stretchability of the system. The tradeoff between gauge factor and stretchability of silicon-on-polymer strain gauges has been proposed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|PZT driven {{resonant}} micromirrors offer {{advantages of}} large scan angles and decreasing power consumption {{due to the}} benefits of resonant driving and high torque delivered by PZT actuators. Therefore they are entering into different application fields recently, for example as laser projection or head-up displays.

In course of its fabrication a non-woven polystyrene membrane made by electro spinning was used as filtering mesh for CNT aqueous dispersion. Produced semi-product like filtering membrane with entrapped carbon nanotubes was stuck using solvent of PS on polystyrene test specimen. The electrical resistance of final laminate is sensitive to tensile strain when elongation leads to increase of macroscopic electrical resistance.

Changes in resistance were found to be reversible, reproducible and deformation can by monitored in real time. Finally, sensitivity to strain can be quantified by means of a gauge factor, GF, which defines sensitivity of strain gauge as a relative resistance change divided by the applied strain. Measured GF for PS/CNT laminates reaches relatively high values, compared with ones of commonly used <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges,</b> serving for values of around 13 and applied tensile deformation in range 0. 1 - 0. 6 %.

Different ranges are considered to correctly define the behaviour and fields of application of the device, and to compare the performances with the data typically available in literature for strain sensors. Using the micro-bending setup we extracted a gauge factor of 17. 8 +/- 4, which is well above the typical value for commercially available flexible <b>metallic</b> strain <b>gauges</b> on polyimide substrates. A specific setup is also presented to analyze the behaviour of the sensor with respect to macroscopic bending. We evaluated the change of {{the resistance of the}} sample varying the bending angle in the range of 0 - 60 degrees both in the inward and in the outward direction. We demonstrated in both cases a linear dependence of the resistance with respect to the bending angle, and furthermore a high reproducibility with low hysteresis.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of precision agriculture technologies {{and an increasing}} demand for higher quality grape products {{has led to a}} growing interest in Precision Viticulture. Actually, cultural monitoring is the most important application in PV systems: it requires specific technologies able to investigate the cultural conditions. To this aim, typically remote sensing surveys are adopted. These, anyhow, involve technical, economical and organisational barriers hampering a wide diffusion of their application. In order to overcome these problems, it would be necessary to substitute and/or integrate remote sensing information with alternative ground sensing technologies, to be employed directly inside the vineyard. This paper considers a commercial optical sensor, the GreenSeeker, useful in ground sensing surveys, and it compares its performances in monitoring vine with results obtained by a multispectral digital camera used as a tester. The experimentation was carried out in a greenhouse, on an artificial row including 15 grapevines (Cabernet Sauvignon variety).

The multispectral digital camera, normally used for remote sensing survey in agriculture, was considered as a test. Results demonstrate a strength correlation (R 2 = 0. 97) between the NDVI values measured through the two methods. This shows the same behaviour of the two tools, according to crop vigour and stress conditions induced into the plants.

The magnitude and pattern of spontaneous potentials from explants of telencephalon of 15 day chick embryos (measured using external bare platinum electrodes) and some aspects of their "normal " behavior during 12 days in vitro are also described. No change was noted in these potentials with change of amplifiers, recorders, or electrodes. The response of the potentials to change in temperature and proportionate composition of the atmosphere around the explant was such as {{to suggest that the}} potentials arise {{as a result of a}} living process. The changes brought about by the administration of anesthetics, strychnine, brucine, and barbiturates were those that might be anticipated in a normal functional activity of the central nervous system. It is concluded that these potentials are a true physiological phenomenon and arise from living cells of the central nervous system. In 1959, spontaneous potentials were first demonstrated from explants of chick cerebellum in vitro (1). These potentials differ in magnitude and time parameters from previously reported, non-spontaneous, resting, and evoked potentials in nervous tissue (9 - 13).

In this study, {{the influence of}} chest wall mechanics on respiratory system is assessed by the evaluation of inspiration pressure-volume curve (PV curve) under three different situations: closed-chest, open-chest and isolated lung. The PV curve parameters in each situation allow us to further understand {{the role played by}} different chest wall elements in the respiratory function. Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar rats (236 ± 29 g) were used. The animals were weighted and then anesthetized with xylazine 2 % (0, 5 mL/kg) and ketamine 10 % (0, 9 mL/kg), exsanguinated and later tracheostomized with a <b>metallic</b> cannula (14 <b>gauge).</b> The cannula was connected to an automatic small animal insufflator. This setup was connected to a pressure transducer (32 samples/s). The 24 animals were randomly separated in three groups: (i) closed chest, (ii) open chest and (iii) isolated lung. The rats were insufflated with 20 mL quasi-statically (constant speed of 0, 1 mL/s). Insufflated volume and measured pressure data were kept and PV curves were obtained for all animals. The PV curves were fitted (non-linear least squares) against the sigmoid equation (1) to obtain the sigmoid equation parameters (a,b,c,d). Elastance measurements were obtained from linear regression of pressure/volume measurements in a 0, 8 s interval before and after the calculated point. Results: The parameters a, b and c showed no significant change, but the parameter d showed a significant variation among the three groups. The initial elastance also varied between open and closed chest, indicating the need of a higher pressure for the lung expansion, {{as can be seen in}} Table 1.

The similar initial elastance for the isolated lung and closed chest may be explained by the specific method used for the isolated lung experiment. As the isolated lung is supported by the trachea vertically, the weight of the tissue may have a similar effect of the residual negative pressure in the thorax, responsible for maintaining the residual volume...|$|R
