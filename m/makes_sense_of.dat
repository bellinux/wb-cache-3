5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E

Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is {{about being able to}} leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

40|$|Online {{communities}} are popular sites for collective sensemaking. This study explores sensemaking {{in one such}} community following the closure of Olint Corp, a highly successful Jamaican investment club. After Olint’s disbanding, Jamaicans reconnected through online communities to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> their financial losses, to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Olint – seen variously as an altruistic endeavour, a global currency trader, or Ponzi scheme – and to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> themselves as enterprising investors. This narrative inquiry unveils their rich, multi-voiced, fragmented storying of Olint and its founder, once praised as a ‘financial messiah’...|$|R
500|$|For Kuhn, {{the choice}} of {{paradigm}} was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more [...] "portraits" [...] against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process {{as much as a}} logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> them. That is, {{the choice of}} a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, the coherentist {{approach}} to science, {{in which a}} theory is validated if it <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> observations {{as part of a}} coherent whole, became prominent due to W. V. Quine and others. Some thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould seek to ground science in axiomatic assumptions, such as the uniformity of nature. A vocal minority of philosophers, and Paul Feyerabend (1924–1994) in particular, argue {{that there is no such}} thing as the [...] "scientific method", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly supernatural ones. Another {{approach to}} thinking about science involves studying how knowledge is created from a sociological perspective, an approach represented by scholars like David Bloor and Barry Barnes. Finally, a tradition in continental philosophy approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.|$|E

2500|$|For {{a native}} signer, sign {{perception}} influences how the mind <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> their visual language experience. For example, a handshape may vary {{based on the}} other signs made before or after it, but these variations are arranged in perceptual categories during its development. [...] The mind detects handshape contrasts but groups similar handshapes together in one category. Different handshapes are stored in other categories. [...] The mind ignores some of the similarities between different perceptual categories, {{at the same time}} preserving the visual information within each perceptual category of handshape variation.|$|E

[...] A few years later in 1993, Itō explicitly played out the metaphor of poet as shamaness in her long narrative poem , in which she takes a story recorded from a shamaness in Tsugaru in the early 20th century and refashions it into a dramatic new myth of healing from sexual abuse and self-discovery.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} in Paris, Guillén had come under the {{influence}} of Paul Valéry. [...] Valéry was closely associated with the ideal of pure poetry and Guillén later recalled him saying that “Pure poetry is what is left after the elimination of everything that is not poetry.” [...] He was also inspired by Valéry’s belief that a poet should only write one book – Un, qui est le bon et le seul de son être - a remark that <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Guillén’s career, both of the accretive process that led ultimately to the finished Cántico, and also of the impulse that led him to combine all his published poetry into one collection Aire nuestro in 1968. [...] He also translated four of Valéry’s poems, including the celebrated [...] "Le Cimetière marin," [...] into Spanish. [...] However, in Language and Poetry, he also recorded a debt to the poetic rigour of Góngora, showing that he could trace this concern for stylistic purity back much further than Valéry.|$|E
2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{generally}} hold that, when Genesis {{describes the}} creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for [...] "day" [...] (yôm) can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the specific context of Genesis 1, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as [...] "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is a glaring exegetical fallacy to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to {{a long period of time}} in Genesis 1) and apply it to a completely different one (yom referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).|$|E
