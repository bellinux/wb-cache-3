40|$|Aggregate shape, texture, and grading have a {{significant}} effect on the performance of fresh concrete. Aggregate blends with well-shaped, rounded, and smooth particles require less paste for a given slump than blends with flat, elongated, angular, and rough particles. At the same time, uniform gradings with proper amounts of each size result in aggregate blends with high packing and in concrete with low water demand. Optimized aggregate blends have high packing, requiring low amounts of paste. As a result, they are less expensive and will have less durability problems caused by the paste such as heat generation, porosity, and drying shrinkage. Current ASTM C 33 standard limits the amount of material passing the N 200 sieve (<b>microfines)</b> to 7 percent. However, manufactured fine aggregate (MFA) usually has between 10 and 20 percent <b>microfines.</b> These limits, intended for natural sands, force MFA producers to wash aggregate incrementing costs and generating environmental issues.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to explore the possible ways of using the intrinsic properties of cellulosic pulp fibres and inorganic pigments, by combining these elements using non-standard procedures, {{as a means to}} engineer a new composite material – a novel uncoated woodfree paper with improved physical properties. Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) was used as the inorganic pigment in this study. To accomplish this objective, we conducted a preliminary study on web addition followed by detailed studies on in-situ precipitation in fibrillated pulp suspensions and blending of novel furnish materials. We evaluated the different technological approaches by analysing the production process and product quality. In the first approach, chemical precipitation and spraying of filler dispersion onto a fibrous web, and mechanically pressing to assist penetration into the network, were compared against conventional filler dosage before web forming. The results showed that web addition approach results in higher tensile strength and lower light scattering of paper. Filler agglomeration and optical crowding, in chemical precipitation and web application respectively, resulted in significantly deteriorating the light scattering of the handsheets. The experimental conditions were not sufficient to obtain an even distribution of filler along the thickness direction of paper and the filler characteristics were not optimised in this study. In the second technique, precipitation onto fibrillated pulp suspensions was investigated by varying the pulp substrate, PCC crystal structure, and pre-refining a mixture of pulp and milk of lime. According to the research findings, PCCs formed by precipitation of calcium carbonate onto cellulosic fibrils and fibres do not necessarily have the same characteristics as reference PCCs formed by carbonizing milk of lime. Precipitation of calcium carbonate onto fibrillated fibres and <b>microfines</b> increases the retention of filler but impairs the dewatering of handsheets during pressing. Higher amount of fibrillated cellulosic substrates in combination with appropriate filler morphology, scalenohedral or rhombohedral, contribute to increased bond strength and light scattering of traditional fine paper. Pre-refining a mixture of pulp and calcium hydroxide results in grinding of lime, and hence, the composites have a greater surface area than the reference filler. Composite filled handsheets, from this study, exhibited high light scattering. In the third method, the microfines-filler composite was envisioned as the backbone structure for a new composite material – uncoated fine paper. In the new composite paper, strength properties arise from the microfibrillated cellulose, bulk and pores originate from the filler surrounded by fibrils, whereas tear strength is imparted by a minimal proportion of pulp fibres in the composite. Compared to conventional fibre based fine paper, even at high filler loading the new composite material showed higher bending stiffness, tensile and tear indices, internal bond strength, light scattering and brightness properties. The new concept of fines-pigment-based furnish enables us to load pigments in uncoated wood free paper up to 50 %- 60 %. However, dewatering time is considerably longer. This method needs to be optimised, with further research on dewatering, and printability, before scaling it to an industrial process. This study shows the potential of different approaches, novel furnish components and addition of pigment onto a formed web, in the creation of new composite fine paper. Novel composite structure for fine paper can be achieved by employing the smallest component of pulp fibres, cellulosic <b>microfines,</b> in combination with pigments. The characteristics of <b>microfines</b> and crystal structure of pigments are important control variables in the formation and properties of the new composite paper. On the other hand, cellulosic <b>microfines</b> are highly swollen and retard dewatering. Therefore, further optimisation of process methodology and product quality can be expected to lead to some useful advances in commercialisation of this technology...|$|R

30|$|The fibril {{term has}} been applied for {{defining}} structures with a dimension less than 1 μm, although not consequently. Structures with diameters of < 1.0 μm have also been observed in the fibre wall structure of pulp fibres. Such structures have been denominated macrofibrils, and diameters of approximately 0.66 μm have been reported [28]. However, according to Meier [13], macrofibrils do not have definite dimensions. A fibril may also be considered an engineered structure as it is produced during mechanical fibrillation. There {{seems to be no}} concrete border line between fibrils and fibrillar fines (Figure 5 A). Fibrillar fines may also be created through refining or beating, from mechanical and chemical pulp fibres, respectively [29]. Subramanian et al. [30] considered fibrillar fines, <b>microfines</b> and microfibrillar cellulose in the same category, i.e. particles that pass a 75 -μm diameter round hole or a 200 -mesh screen of a fibre length classifier. Such a definition indicates that MFC may also be considered as fines, as exemplified in Figure 5 A. Both materials are composed of relatively small and fibrillated components. However, according to Turbak et al. [1], no amount of conventional beating yields the microfibrillation obtained with an optimally homogenised product.|$|R
30|$|The OMC {{appears to}} {{increase}} as the replacement ratio of red mud is getting higher. The OMC is relatively higher in ASS pavement compared with that in OPC. The results with binder type are shown to be 9.1 – 10.2 % in AAS and 8.4 – 9.9 % in OPC, respectively. In other words, the OMC in ASS is 0.3 – 0.8 % higher than that in OPC. As shown in Fig.  2, the size distribution of AAS is relatively gradual, which implies {{that there are more}} <b>microfines</b> whose surfaces are wide enough to hold a large quantity of hygroscopic water. In addition, the OMC by mix proportion of red mud is observed to be 12 % higher in AAS 30 than in AAS 0, while it is 17 % higher in OPC 30 than in OPC 0. Similarly, the reason for increasing OMC with higher red mud replacement ratio is that the red-mud is silt and clay with an average particle size of 2.75  μm with high micro-fine content. Red mud has relatively higher density and a larger specific surface area compared with the binders such as OPC and ASS, so that its physical properties {{are similar to those of}} silt and clay (Bahmani et al. 2014). Therefore with increasing replacement ratio of red mud, it moves to the right in the compaction curve, from which it can be interpreted that the OMC increases while the highest dry density decreases.|$|R

Twelve bar shaped specimens of 5 commercially available composites – Supreme (3 M/ESPE), a universal nanofilled composite; Esthet-X (Dentsply), Z- 250 (3 M/ESPE), Charisma (Heraeus Kulzer), universal hybrid composites; and Helio Fill (Vigodent), a <b>microfine</b> composite – were confectioned according to the ISO 4049 / 2000 specifications. The test was performed after a 7 - days storage time using a universal test machine with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The filler weight content was determined by the ashing technique. The data obtained on the mechanical properties were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Pearson’s correlation test was used to determine the correlation between the filler content and the mechanical properties. A weak but significant correlation between the mechanical properties evaluated and the filler weight content was observed (p < 0. 000). The <b>microfine</b> composite presented the lowest filler weight and the lowest mechanical properties. Statistically different flexural strength and modulus of elasticity results were observed among the universal hybrid composites. The nanofilled composite presented intermediary results. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it could be concluded that the filler content significantly interfered in the flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of the composites tested...|$|E
40|$|Radioiodination {{reportedly}} damages peptides, but {{the nature}} of the damage has not been adequately examined. Utilizing isoelectric focusing, we examined the products of Chioramine T- and lactoperoxidase-directed radioiodi-nations of human calcitonin. Initially, the reaction products were purified by adsorption onto and elution from <b>microfine</b> silica (QUSO-G 32). Radioiodination of the calcitonin by Chioramine T and lactoperoxidase produced a heteroge-neous population of ‘ 251 -labeled peptides exhibiting ap-parent isoelectric points that were more acidic than that of unlabeled synthetic calcitonin. Variation in the products among radioiodinations and the inabUity of QUSO-G 32 to resolve the components of the reaction mixture prompted our examination of alternative purification procedures. Anion-exchange chromatography on QAE-Sephadex ef...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to retrofit the previously developed High Efficiency Advanced Coal Combustor (HEACC) to a standard gas/oil designed industrial boiler to assess the technical and economic viability of displacing premium fuels with <b>microfine</b> coal. This report documents {{the technical aspects of}} this project during the tenth quarter of the program. The four hundred hours ``Proof-of-Concept System Test`` under Task 3 was completed during this quarter. The primary objectives were to obtain steady state operation consistently on coal only and increase carbon conversion efficiency from {approximately} 95 % to the project goal of 98 %. This was to be obtained without increasing NO{sub x} emission above the project goal level of 0. 6 lbs/MBtu ({approximately} 425 ppM). The testing was also designed to show that consistent, reliable operation could be achieved as another prerequisite to the demonstration. The data were gathered and analyzed for both economic and technical analysis prior to committing to the long term demonstration. The Economic Evaluation was completed and work started on commercialization plan. During this reporting period, activities included sample analysis, data reduction and interpretation from all the testing during March and April. Following preliminary conclusions are drawn based on results evaluated: coal handling/preparation system can be designed to meet technical requirements for retrofitting <b>microfine</b> coal combustion; boiler thermal performance met requirement; NO{sub x} Emission can meet target of 0. 6 lb/MBtu; combustion efficiencies of 95 % could be met on a daily average basis, somewhat below target of 98 %; economic playback very sensitive to fuel differential cost, unit size, and annual operating hours; and continuous long term demonstration needed to quantify ash effect and how to best handle...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposal}} of <b>microfine</b> marble sawdust contained in marble slurry waste, currently represents an additional economic burden for dimension stones companies. This {{is because the}} sawdust is considered less important {{in comparison with the}} crushed calcareous aggregate produced in stone processing plants. In addition, the sludge is mistakenly viewed as waste that has to be disposed of in landfill. State of the art in recovery and utilisation of calcareous sawdust is mainly aimed in uses as substitute for more expensive ingredient in the building sector. Moreover limestone dust, recovered from marble sawing and processing slurry, has not yet found real economically feasible industrial usage. Due to the high market value of micronised CaCO 3, we study the use of limestone sawdust as functional filler in industrial products having higher added value, such as paper, rubber, paints, pharmaceuticals. Standard requirements of CaCO 3 for this kind of products are very tight, especially those relating to purity level, particle size distribution and brightness. The high Calcium limestone deposit and the factories in Orosei Marble producing area (Sardinia, Italy) allow the production of high quality <b>microfine</b> dust. To evaluate the properties of the sawdust, several analysis were carried out to compare the results with the standard requirements of CaCO 3 for paper, rubber and tyre production. The assessment concerns five different factories and it highlights the possible usage of the sawdust produced in Orosei by carrying out simple and inexpensive changes in both stone-working process and wastewater treatment. Finally, a commentary on environmental laws pertaining to the recycle of this kind of waste is also made in this paper...|$|E
