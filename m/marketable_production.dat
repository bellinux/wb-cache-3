40|$|H. armigera is, {{together}} with aphids, {{one of the}} industrial tomato key insects in central Italy. Its trophic action causes {{a decrease in the}} <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> with high social costs for the agricultural operators. The aim of the present work was to perform a bioassay on the cotton bollworm, feeding the larva with Kunitz proteinase inhibitor coded by the KTI 3 gene transgenic plant leaves. The molecules belonging to the Kunitz family have a molecular weight of 21 - 24 kDa and inhibit the serine proteinase, resulting active in the pH interval 9 - 11, that is the distinctive interval of Lepidoptera larva midgut. Riogrande cultivar tomato plants were transformed with the KTI 3 gene through Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The analysis of the data obtained and their elaboration show a direct effect (negative) on the Lepidoptera biology, particularly in the second generation; this result could have, in the future, a direct containment action of the phytophagous populations in nature, causing a relevant decrease of the <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> cull percentage.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of four different shading nets with different colour and shading intensity, on the microclimate and on the crop growth and development of tomato crop, was experimentally investigated. Experiments were carried out during summer of 2003 in Nea Agchialos, Central Greece. The seedlings of tomato were transplanted into the soil and the following parameters were recorded regularly: solar radiation, air temperature and humidity and crop temperature. In parallel, parameters relative to crop growth and development were also measured. The reduction of solar radiation above the crop was proportional to the shading intensity of the net. Similar values of air temperature and air vapour pressure deficit were observed under the shading nets and outside. However, the canopy temperature and accordingly, the canopy-to-air vapour pressure deficit were significantly lower under the shading nets than in the open field. Finally, concerning the effects of shading on crop growth and development, {{it was found that}} shading increased leaf area index and total <b>marketable</b> yield <b>production,</b> reduced the appearance of tomato cracking about 50 % and accordingly, the <b>marketable</b> tomato <b>production</b> was about 50 % higher under shading conditions than under non-shading conditions...|$|R

However, Chinese and Italian film co-productions are not an unprecedented phenomenon. The first co-production between these two film industries actually happened in 1982, when mini-series Marco Polo was produced by Italian television network RAI along with Chinese Company Cinematic Co-Production (CCCC). The aim {{of this article is}} to examine the production history of Marco Polo and its complex transnational dimension, through the analysis of issues previously highlighted by theoretical works about the crisis of national cinema and of issues of identity in European co-productions. Moreover, the article will analyze RAI's production policy of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, a watershed era that marks a move from the production of works of international film-makers of modern cinema, to more spectacular and <b>marketable</b> <b>productions</b> for the new global television market. Finally, I will discuss Marco Polo's relationship with the Italian political film, an important production trend in 1970 s Italian cinema, to which director Giuliano Montaldo contributed with at least three of his films.

Maize performance was compared with that in a natural fallow system, with fallow biomass burned versus retained as mulch in both fallow types. Fallow type had no effect on maize density. After biomass burning higher maize densities were attained at the low LUI site. Maize cob production was affected neither by fallow type nor by biomass management. Across seven years of cropping, <b>marketable</b> cob <b>production</b> in the low LUI site was 38. 5 % higher in mucuna fallow than in natural fallow (p < 0. 06). Differences at p < 0. 05 were found in one out of seven years. In the medium LUI sites, mucuna and pueraria fallow increased <b>marketable</b> cob <b>production</b> by 70 – 132 % (p < 0. 001). Maize grain yield was closely related to the <b>marketable</b> cob <b>production</b> in all sites. In the low LUI site the cumulative maize grain yield over seven years was 30 % higher in mucuna fallow than in natural fallow (p < 0. 07), the difference being significant at p < 0. 05 in only one year. In the medium LUI sites maize grain yield was 65 % higher in mucuna fallow (p < 0. 001) and 69 - 94 % higher in pueraria fallow (p < 0. 001). Burning biomass had a cumulative grain yield advantage of 33 % at the low LUI site (p < 0. 053), with significant (p < 0. 02) differences in two out of seven years.

Due to vagaries of monsoon and scarcity of surface water in Indian SAT, dependence on groundwater has increased tremendously and water resource has transformed from community resource to a private resource. Farmers have dug open wells to draw groundwater from shallow aquifers. With advent of bore well technology and subsidized power, there has been shift in groundwater extraction from shallow aquifers to deeper aquifers creating mining effect. Intensity of rainfall in Indian SAT is grossly adequate to adequately charge the aquifers.

Early exposure to TuMV produced cabbages that were 50 % lighter than non-infected plants, but later infection was less damaging suggesting that controlling virus infection at the seedling stage is more important. TuMV was far less damaging to kale {{than it was to}} cabbage; although high proportions of TuMV-inoculated kale plants showed symptoms (> 90 %), the marketability and quality of leaves were not significantly reduced, and no clear relationship existed between timing of infection and subsequent crop losses. Early inoculation of Swiss chard with Beet mosaic virus (BtMV) significantly impaired leaf quality (similar to 50 % reduction in <b>marketable</b> leaf <b>production),</b> but the impact of disease was greatest in plants that had been inoculated at maturity, where average leaf losses were {{two and a half times}} those recorded in virus-free plants. Disease-management of BtMV in Swiss chard is important, therefore, not only at the seedling stage, but particularly when plants are transplanted from nursery to field...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of irrigation doses on standard and high lycopene tomato varieties has been analyzed during {{two years in}} one of the main processing tomato growing areas of Spain. Deficit irrigation (75 % ETc) implied a mean reduction in water use of 28. 2 %, while it caused a significant reduction in the <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> of 16. 4 % and increase in soluble solids (8. 4 %) and Hunter a/b ratio (2. 4 %). The effect on lycopene content was not significant. Increasing irrigation dose over the recommended 100 % ETc had no significant effect on the agronomical performance, while it provoked a dilution effect reducing total soluble solids and lycopene content. The effects on 33 tomato volatiles were also analyzed, 11 of them related to main aroma notes and 22 to the background volatile profile. The effect of deficit irrigation on aroma was dependant on climatic conditions and it may either not {{have a significant effect on}} the aroma profile or may lead to higher logodor units in main aroma volatiles. High lycopene cultivars showed higher contents in most volatiles, including some volatiles originated in pathways that have not been related with carotenoid degradation processes. In both the fresh and processing tomato market the improvement of organoleptic and functional quality and the reduction of the impact of agriculture on environment represent main goals. The use of high lycopene cultivars and restricted irrigation would enhance the aroma of materials targeted to quality markets, contributing to increase the efficiency of water use in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a new plant biostimulant composition, containing low doses of sodium selenate, glycine betaine and a spray adjuvant. We performed an experiment to test the influence of treatments with this new biostimulant composition, on cabbage and cauliflower crops, cultivated under normal watered and water stress conditions. We aimed to prove that an efficient technology of protective biofortification with selenium of crops would solve two technical problems of cruciferous cultivation into a semi-arid area, with selenium soil deficit: (i) safety supplementation of food chain and, concomitant, (ii) enhanced water use efficiency. Normal watered plants were irrigated {{at a rate of}} 100 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Water stressed cabbage and cauliflower plants were irrigated under deficit conditions, at a 75 % ETc. Six different treatments, including the new biostimulant composition and its ingredients, separate and/or in combination, were applied on cabbage and cauliflower, in a field experiment, organised in split plot design, with three replications. The treatments were applied by foliar spraying, 3 weeks and 6 weeks after seedlings transplantation in the field. During vegetation, physiological parameters (chlorophyll a fluorescence and stomatal conductance) were assayed. After harvesting, yield parameters were determined, for each treatment applied to both normal watered and water stressed plants. We calculated the water use efficiency as ratio between the marketable yield and the water used. We tested in field conditions this new biostimulant composition, which allows to obtain, under conditions of moderate water stress, a <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> {{similar to that of the}} normal watered crop. Physiological parameters demonstrated also enhanced water-use efficiency on cabbage and cauliflower treated with the new biostimulant composition, containing sodium selenate, betaine and spraying adjuvant based on ethyl rapeseedate...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} growth of crops allows the {{planning}} of rational cultivation methods which contribute to achieve greater potential of plant species, besides supplying information {{for the construction of}} descriptive mathematical models of growth. The growth curve of sweet pepper (Eppo hybrid), cultivated in coconut fiber in a greenhouse with fertirrigation, was determined. The experiment consisted initially of 160 plants divided into four blocks. Two plants were analyzed per block every 21 days after transplanting, ending at 189 days after transplant. The cultivation was carried out in plastics pots of 13 L containing coconut fiber, which were arranged in double rows, spaced 0. 5 x 0. 8 m between simple rows and 1. 1 m between double rows. In each harvest the plant growth, production and quality of mature fruits were evaluated. The dry mass of the shoot increased with time, following the experimental model exponential of first order, reaching a maximum of 451. 5 g/plant, 189 days after transplanting (DAT). The production of dry mass of leaves, stem, root and fruit also increased over time reaching maximum values of 68. 7, 65. 8, 11. 5 and 302. 9 g/plant, respectively, at 189 DAT. The same occurred with the leaf area per plant, plant height and the absolute rate of growth, whose maximum values were 6. 183, 5 cm², 136. 9 cm and 4. 4 g/plant/day, respectively. The growth of the plant was continuous throughout the cycle, and the highest amount of dry mass was accumulated in fruits, reaching a <b>marketable</b> <b>production</b> of 97. 3 t ha- 1. All fruits were classified as Extra...|$|E
40|$|High {{temperatures}} in the growing tomato have caused a reduction in fruit set and consequently productivity. This work aimed to evaluate F 5 lines of tomato to fruit set and high temperature tolerance in two culture environments. Two experiments were carried out, one in cultivation in greenhouse {{and the other in}} the field conditions, from February to June 2012. We evaluated 20 lines F 5 of tomato, originating from the segregation of hybrid SE 1055 F 1, developed for the hot and humid conditions, with resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici race 2, the tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), the Verticilium dahliae and geminivirus (TYLCV) and the control cultivar Yoshimatsu and own hybrid SE 1055 F 1. The experiment was performed in a randomized blocks design with 22 treatments, four replications and plots with two plants. We evaluated the total number of fruits per plant (NTF/PL), mass of unmarketable fruits per plant (MFNC/PL), fruit set (PEG), mass of marketable fruits per plant (MFC/PL) and yield of marketable fruits (REND). In the greenhouse were recorded higher temperatures and lower luminosity than in field cultivation. Lines 08, 12 and 13 showed higher fruit set in a greenhouse, being more suitable for cultivation at high temperatures. In the field, the lines 06 and 08 showed that <b>marketable</b> fruit <b>production</b> did not differ from 'Yoshimatsu'. Comparing the field experiment average with the average of greenhouse, a higher fruit set and a higher mass of marketable fruits per plant was achieved in field...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{experimentally}} investigate the effect of three different shading and insect proof nets on pepper crop development and production. Three screenhouses were used; two of them were covered by a 50 mesh insect proof screen with shading intensity of about 15 % and 35 % and the third one was covered by a green shading net (not insect proof) with shading intensity of about 35 %. The experiments were carried out from May to October 2012 in the experimental farm of the University of Thessaly in Velestino, Central Greece. Seedlings of sweet pepper plants were transplanted during May in three screenhouses and outside and measurements of crop development, production and quality, along with climate measurements inside and outside the screenhouses were performed. The results showed that compared to outside, plants grown under the green shading net were about 17 % higher and produced about the same number of fruit with about 7 % higher total fruit yield. The highest fruit number and total fruit yield was observed under the 15 % shading insect proof screen (about 7 kg m- 2) which was about 80 % higher compared to outside and about 35 % higher than that observed under the insect proof screen with the higher shading intensity. Marketable fruit yield for all screenhouses was more than 90 % of the total yield, while for the open field crop the <b>marketable</b> fruit <b>production</b> was about 60 % of the total. Pepper fruit sunscald was nearly eliminated, while BER and defects from pests were significantly reduced mainly under the insect proof screens...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Long-term {{investigations}} of soil moisture at different precipitation {{patterns in the}} black soil in Hailun county, Northeast China were made. This area is an important base for <b>marketable</b> grains <b>production</b> due to a short cultivation history, high soil organic matter content, and high yield potential. In this region, precipitation is the principal water source during the cropping season, hence soil water storage {{is very important for}} agricultural production. Estimation of the soil water retention characteristics of the black soil is necessary to assess the risk of drought, soil water potential to meet crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. The soil water conditions are influenced by meteorology, soil physical properties, vegetation and other related factors. Ten years of field research were the basis for our definition of soil water characteristics of the black soils at Hailun Agri-ecology Experimental Station, Songnen plain, Northeast China. This paper identifies three different kinds of precipitation which affect soil water movement and soil water characteristics in different seasons. Investigations were performed during the normal rainfall year of 1995, the above normal rainfall year of 1997 and the drought year of 2001. The basic characteristics of soil water in farmland of the black soil region and also the vertical motion of soil water were discussed. Based on the results of soil water measurement and analysis, the movement of black soil water was divided into four periods- a thawing stage in spring, a dry stage in summer, a wet stage in autumn and a frozen stage in winter. Four soil water zones were identified within the depth range 0 - 270 cm- a highly varying zone (0 - 40 cm), a weakly * Corresponding author...|$|R
