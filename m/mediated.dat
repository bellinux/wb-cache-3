5000|$|The MAM, Ig {{and first}} {{fibronectin}} III domain of PCP-2 {{was shown to}} <b>mediate</b> bead aggregation in vitro. PCP-2 accomplishes this by binding to another PCP-2 molecule on a fluorescent bead, known as homophilic binding. PCP-2 was unable to <b>mediate</b> aggregation between non-adherent cells when expressed as a full-length protein, however, suggesting that PCP-2 does not <b>mediate</b> homophilic adhesion in cells. The MAM and Ig domains of PCP-2 are capable of <b>mediating</b> weak cell-cell adhesion when swapped into the wild-type PTPrho protein, demonstrating that the MAM and Ig domain can <b>mediate</b> weak cell adhesion, but that they require other functional domains within PTPrho to <b>mediate</b> cell-cell adhesion. [...] The Ig domain of the R2B RPTP, PTPmu, is sufficient to <b>mediate</b> bead aggregation in vitro, therefore, {{it is possible that}} the PCP-2 constructs used by Cheng and colleagues were able to <b>mediate</b> bead aggregation due to a functional Ig domain in PCP-2.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure for gaining experimental control over <b>mediating</b> behavior on a spaced-responding schedule of food reinforcement. Three rats, food-deprived, were trained on a DRL 16 sec schedule of food reinforcement. Then, a concurrent schedule of food reinforcement was introduced {{on a second}} (<b>mediating)</b> lever, such that the first response to occur on the <b>mediating</b> lever, after the DRL interval had timed out, was reinforced with food, as was the next response to occur on the DRL lever. Reinforcement via the <b>mediating</b> lever became a discriminative stimulus for a food-reinforcement opportunity on the DRL lever. Next, food reinforcement for the <b>mediating</b> behavior {{was replaced by a}} conditioned reinforcer consisting of onset of a buzzer signaling timing-out of the DRL interval. Under these conditions, chaining of behavior on the two levers was strong, and timing on the DRL lever was more accurate than under ordinary DRL conditions. As the DRL requirement was lengthened from 16 sec to 24 sec to 60 sec, <b>mediating</b> behavior weakened slightly. When the inter-response requirement for food reinforcement on the DRL lever was made shorter than the inter-response requirement for conditioned reinforcement on the <b>mediating</b> lever, the <b>mediating</b> behavior extinguished. Performance in the experiment was analyzed into a four-component chain, and the factors contributing to the maintenance, and later extinction, of <b>mediating</b> behavior are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} <b>mediating</b> {{behavior}} {{were compared with}} respect to their effectiveness in variable-delay matching-to-sample and oddity-matching tasks. Each of four 5 -year-old children was trained to emit either differential or common <b>mediating</b> responses. The differential <b>mediating</b> response consisted of pressing a specific computer key corresponding to either of two possible sample stimuli (a red or a green square). The common <b>mediating</b> response consisted of pressing one of the two response keys regardless of the sample. The differential-response subjects did not show the typical, delay-related decrease in matching-to-sample performance that characterized the behavior of common-response subjects. An oddity-matching task was then introduced, and subjects were instructed to use the <b>mediating</b> keys however they preferred, including not at all. Differential-response subjects continued to respond on the originally trained <b>mediating</b> keys in response to sample presentation and later reversed their choice responding, thus accommodating the oddity-matching requirements. Common-response subjects continued to emit the previously trained <b>mediating</b> response and experienced limited success in oddity matching.

5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be <b>mediated</b> by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc <b>mediated</b> effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|E
