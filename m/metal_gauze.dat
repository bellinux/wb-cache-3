40|$|The paper {{shows that}} for {{majority}} of technological plants used to process hydrocarbon raw materials when operating {{a problem of}} formation of deposits in still-head pipes after the rectifying and stabilization columns, furnaces and other technology devices in oil processing is still of great importance. The structure of still-head deposits of furnace coils and rectifying columns has been studied by the example of small technological plant (STP) of JSC Kondensat (Aksay, the Republic of Kazakhstan). It was determined that key components of these deposits are sulfides of iron and copper as well as elementary sulfur. It is shown that the surface of contact devices of STP – grids made of stainless steel of brand 12 X 18 H 10 T, is substantially subject to corrosion. These samples are the structures which are still keeping geometry of initial grids, but lost their functional properties and characteristics. When mechanical influence is applied such samples easily transform into gray high-disperse powder. During operation period of STP various corrosion inhibitors and deemulgators (for example, TAL- 25 - 13 -R) have been tested. At the same time practically all tested brands of corrosion inhibitors couldn't decrease corrosion of stainless steel and formation of firm deposits in still-head pipes of technological devices. The existing corrosion inhibitors create protection on the boundary of phases metallic surface – liquid, but they aren't efficient on the boundary of phases metallic surface – liquid – steam-gas phase (at the temperature of 150 – 250 оC). The authors propose the mechanism of formation of these compounds based on result of corrosion of <b>metal</b> <b>gauzes</b> made of stainless steels brand X 6 CrNiTi 18 - 10 {{in the presence of}} sulphurous compounds. An active method of corrosion prevention is recommended to apply. The method is based on creation of nanodimensional anticorrosion coatings from binary compounds (such as titanium nitride) or pure metals (Ni, Cr, Ti, Cd, Zn, etc.). These metals don’t reduce initial high parameters of grids by heat conductivity and heat capacity, that makes possible to increase significantly life cycle of contact devices and, as a result, to improve considerably operational and economic indicators of operating technological plants used to process oil raw material...|$|R

5000|$|Before 1800 a {{great deal}} of coal was left in places as {{extraction}} was still primitive. As a result, in the deep Tyneside pits (300 to 1,000 ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "upcast" [...] shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the Davy lamp and Geordie lamp, where any firedamp (or methane) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by restricting the ingress of air with either <b>metal</b> <b>gauze</b> or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near Liège.|$|E

The first two metal tubes are excited directly by the flame from a torch. In the third tube, a glass tube, a flame is used to heat <b>metal</b> <b>gauze</b> in the tube. When the flame is removed, as in Figure 1, the convection currents created in the tube by the air heated by the hot gauze create a noise spectrum {{that leads to a}} sound resonance in the tube, as can be readily heard.

40|$|Abstract. Self excited {{combustion}} oscillations {{are caused}} by a coupling between acoustic waves and unsteady heat release. A premixed laminar flame in a Rijke tube, anchored to a <b>metal</b> <b>gauze,</b> is considered in this work. The flame response to flow disturbances is investigated by developing a nonlinear kinematic model based on the classical G-equation, with the assumption of a time-invariant laminar flame speed. Unsteady heat release from the flame {{is assumed to be}} caused by its surface variations, which results from the fluctuations of the oncoming flow velocity. The flame is acoustically compact, and its presence causes the mean temperature undergoing a jump, whose effect on the dynamics of the thermo-acoustic system is discussed. Coupling the flame model with a Galerkin series expansion of the acoustic waves present enables the time evolution of the flow disturbances to be calculated. It was found that the model can predict the mode shape and the frequencies of the excited combustion oscillations very well. Moreover, the fundamental mode is found to be the easiest one to be triggered among all acoustic modes. To gain insight about the mode selection and triggering, further numerical investigation is conducted by linearizing the flame model and recasting into the popular τ−n formulation...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{explosion}} oxyacetylene cylinders are filled with a spongy mass, acetone is added to saturate the mass, and acetylene is pumped into the cylinder. The first cylinders manufactured before 1936 used a kapok filling topped off with about 16 oz of crocidolite asbestos, with a <b>metal</b> <b>gauze</b> thimble inserted to reduce risk of flash back. Cylinders must be examined annually. The use of crocidolite ceased in 1972 and other fillings have been adopted since 1970; kapok cylinders now constitute less than 5 % of the total stock. To assess possible hazards, a mortality study of workers first employed between 1935 and 1975 and followed up to December 1984 was undertaken. Simulation tests showed low concentrations of asbestos in the air even in the earliest period. The population studied consisted of 370 workers at the Bilston plant in the West Midlands, 611 at the 14 other plants in England and Wales, and 120 in Scotland. No deaths occurred from mesothelial tumours but there was an excess of deaths from cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancer of the stomach, and cancer of the pancreas, the latter accounting for eight deaths. Risks appeared to be concentrated at the Bilston plant. The importance of these findings is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} partial oxidation (CPO) {{of methane}} with oxygen was studied at atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow reactor containing a single Pt <b>metal</b> <b>gauze.</b> Experiments were performed at catalyst temperatures and residence {{times in the}} range of 950 – 1200 K and 0. 02 – 0. 2 ms, respectively. Heat-transport limitations are taken into account explicitly, by measuring the catalyst temperature directly by means of a surface thermocouple. The experimental results indicated that the conversions of methane and oxygen were determined by transport phenomena; however, the CO selectivity appeared to be influenced significantly by the kinetics of the catalytic reactions. Hydrogen was found only at temperatures above 1273 K. In {{order to be able to}} derive intrinsic kinetic information from the experimental data, a reactor model consisting of two rows of parallel flat plates in series was developed, taking into account the relevant transport phenomena. This flat-plate reactor model was validated by comparing the model results to 3 D simulations of simultaneous heat and mass transfer in case of a simple surface reaction on the gauze catalyst. A series-parallel CPO reaction mechanism allowed simulation of the observed conversions and selectivities at different space-times. More detailed elementary-step reaction mechanisms can be developed, using both the experimental data and the flat-plate reactor model...|$|E
40|$|Fog water {{collection}} represents a meaningful {{effort in the}} places where regular water sources, including surface water and ground water, are scarce. Inspired by the amazing fog {{water collection}} capability of Stenocara beetles in the Namib Desert {{and based on the}} recent work in biomimetic water collection, this work reported a facile, easy-to-operate, and low-cost method for the fabrication of hydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterned hybrid surface toward highly efficient fog water collection. The essence of the method is incorporating a (super) hydrophobically modified metal-based gauze onto the surface of a hydrophilic polystyrene (PS) flat sheet by a simple lab oven-based thermal pressing procedure. The produced hybrid patterned surfaces consisted of PS patches sitting within the holes of the metal gauzes. The method allows for an easy control over the pattern dimension (e. g., patch size) by varying gauze mesh size and thermal pressing temperature, which is then translated to an easy optimization of the ultimate fog water collection efficiency. Given the low-cost and wide availability of both PS and <b>metal</b> <b>gauze,</b> this method has a great potential for scaling-up. The results showed that the hydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterned hybrid surfaces with a similar pattern size to Stenocara beetles’s back pattern produced significantly higher fog collection efficiency than the uniformly (super) hydrophilic or (super) hydrophobic surfaces. This work contributes to general effort in fabricating wettability patterned surfaces and to atmospheric water collection for direct portal use...|$|E
40|$|Thermoacoustic devices {{related to}} the Rijke Tube are reviewed. Most modern thermoacoustic devices use as a heat source a heated wire or ribbon or a {{premixed}} gas flame anchored to a <b>metal</b> <b>gauze,</b> metal tube matrix or porous ceramic frit. Numerous experiments have confirmed that combustion driven oscillations in tube devices are ""Rijke Tube"" or ""Organ Pipe"" oscillations, i. e. frequencies {{are the same as}} those in a Rijke tube or organ pipe of the same length and with the same gas temperature distribution. Experiments have also established the validity of Rayleighs stability criterion for the development of heat-driven acoustic oscillations. Modern mathematical analyses of acoustic oscillations in Rijke-type devices begin with a common basis: equations for mass, momentum and energy conservation. Almost all analyses assume constant hot section temperature. THe main difference between analyses is {{the manner in which the}} oscillating response of the heat source is modeled. Frequency of oscillation is governed primarly by the acoustic speed of gases in a chamber. Thus, the flame of heater response model used does not significantly effect frequency predictions. However, the flame or heater response model can have a dramatic effect on predicted growth rates. Since flame models influence predicted response of Rijke burners, some work with vibrating flames is also reviewed. Flame response models vary widely, from simple phenomenological models to sophisticated models based on large activation energy asymptotic theory"...|$|E
40|$|LT Ranch Space, is a {{non-profit}} rural art space in Lithuania hosting seasonal student sessions, providing a facility for research, experimentation and cultural events related to art, architecture, film and landscape. The Ranch {{has been running}} Summer Sessions with UCA, UAL, UW students and practitioners from a diverse range of disciplines since 2009. The artwork made {{was a part of}} the 2016 summer session. I was teaching staff, along with three others, and three of us made pieces alongside the help we gave to the students. My piece was a performance, a made outcome in predominantly metal and stone, two digital film pieces and some still photography. The work explored the materiality and function of the traditional smoke sauna building on the ranch site. The sauna sits apart from the active centre of the ranch, separated by trees in its quiet nook in the landscape. The space is not currently used as a sauna and the original large granite stones which made up the original floor are gathered outside the small building. When sauna would be used, historically, smoke would be built up inside the sauna and then released through a hatch in the roof when the sauna building contained an atmosphere hot enough to use as a sauna. The first film piece explores the preparation of the sauna for use with a wide angle film washing one of the large boulders from the old floor outside the building. The film is deliberately wide angle, taking in the activity, performed by myself, the building and the wider open space. The second investigation attempts to explore the materiality of the sauna through a made piece, the function of which was to produce a smoke signal in the landscape of the ranch marking the way in which the smoke would periodically appear when the sauna building was in use, and the relationship between the preparation of this particularly intense interior environment and the wider landscape. Again using the floor stones outside the building, a tiny, fragile hearth was made using a base of stone and thick steel rebar embedded in the stone which held up a fine <b>metal</b> <b>gauze.</b> The stone-rebar detail mimicked a similar detail being executed on the other side of the site, in the construction of a built structure for storing wood. The smoke signal was produced by making very hot, pure, charcoal on the main outdoor fire pit on the site, transferring this to the <b>metal</b> <b>gauze</b> and covering this with birch bark chips harvested onsite. The birch is the predominant timber in the region and the bark contains lots of resins which produce a thick white smoke when burnt. The hearth itself was surrounded by fresh chips and dried birch leaves from the beating bunches used during the sauna process to stimulate the circulation. The performance of producing the smoke signal in the space was recorded through film, again in wide angle shot to engage the building and the wider landscape. In particular, the ambient sounds were included which emphasized the relationship of this slightly detached quiet space to the more more actively noisy ranch spaces elsewhere. Closer still photography and smaller films recorded the hearth at close range, to record the spectrum of materiality which followed that of the interior space of the sauna, in preparation and use. The catalogue featured a written piece, stills from the films and some photography...|$|E
40|$|Reduction of CO 2 to {{methanol}} {{was carried}} out in a two compartment photoelectrochemical cell using carbon modified titanium oxide (CM-n-TiO 2) as a photoanode and Cu <b>metal</b> <b>gauze</b> as a dark cathode in an aqueous electrolyte of 5. 0 M NaOH. Both compartments were connected by glass wool soaked in the same electrolyte. The CO 2 reduction at the cathode in aqueous medium was coupled with the energetically challenging H 2 O oxidation reaction to O 2 at CM-n-TiO 2 photoanode. The reduction of CO 2 to methanol was found to depend on the way CO 2 solution was made. This is because most of the dissolved CO 2 in aqueous medium should be intact in the molecular form trapped by water molecules via hydrogen bonding and adsorbed on energetically compatible Cu metal surface. No measurable amounts of reduction of CO 2 to methanol were observed when it was mostly converted to CO 32 - and HCO 3 - ions after dissolution. The highest amount of methanol, 2. 5 × 10 - 8 moles cm- 2 s- 1 which is equivalent to 28. 8 grams m- 2 hr- 1 was observed in first 5 min of reaction time. The amounts of methanol decreased after 5 min indicating back reaction at the photoanode. An average photoconversion efficiency of solar energy to methanol fuel energy was found to be ~ 11 % within 20 min. The reduction of CO 2 to methanol was found to increase the yield by two fold in presence of initially added 0. 5 mM methanol that acted as an autocatalyst...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a non-enveloped, {{positively}} charged single stranded RNA hepatotropic agent {{from the family}} Picornaviridae, and the sole member of the genus Hepatovirus. There is only one HAV serotype but there are seven genotypes. Hepatitis A (HA) infection is usually self-limiting and {{the severity of the}} illness is age dependant. In children, infection with HAV is usually asymptomatic, while most adults and immunocompromised patients develop moderate to severe clinical disease. HA is endemic in South Africa (SA) with 100 % of children from the lower socio-economic population acquiring immunity before the age of 10. With the current trends in urbanisation, a change in the epidemic vulnerability of the SA population can be expected. HAV is predominantly transmitted by the faecal-oral route and contaminated food and water are important sources of infection. However, the contribution of waterborne HAV to the burden of HA disease in SA is unknown. The aims of this investigation were to assess techniques for the recovery, isolation and detection of HAV from water sources. Thereafter these techniques were applied to estimate the potential risk of infection posed to communities using the water sources for recreational and domestic purposes. This would elucidate whether or not water plays a role in the spread of HAV infection in SA. An effective and sensitive concentration method is fundamental to the successful detection of HAV in water sources. Three primary recovery and two secondary concentration techniques were investigated in this study. An in-house modified glass wool technique, using 15 g of glass wool and with the addition of three <b>metal</b> <b>gauze</b> grids at 5 g intervals, proved to be the most sufficient and cost effective technique for the primary recovery of HAV from water sources. The packing density of the glass wool and positioning of the grids proved to be essential for efficient HAV recovery. A polyethylene glycol/sodium chloride secondary concentration technique proved to be more cost effective than commercial centrifugal devices. Combinations of cell cultures, propagation conditions, RNA extraction protocols and detection techniques were assessed for the isolation and detection of HAV. A combination of FRhK- 4 R cell culture propagation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-oligonucleotide probe assay was demonstrated to be the simple, most efficient technique for the detection of HAV. The nucleotide sequences of HAV strains from water sources and clinical specimens were compared to ascertain whether the strains from water were a potential source of infection. Although the majority of clinical strains clustered seperately from the water strains, one strain from an asymptomatic patient was identical to a number of strains from water. This suggests that HAV in the environment is a potential source of infection in SA. To assess the potential risk of infection constituted by HAV to persons using surface dam and river water for domestic and recreational purposes, a deterministic exponential risk assessment model which works with mean values and conservative assumptions was applied. Results indicated a minimal risk of infection to the higher socio-economic, non-immune population using the water for recreational purposes, if 100 ml of water was ingested per day. No risk was identified for the lower socio-economic, predominantly immune, population who uses the same water sources for domestic and drinking purposes. This study represents the first comprehensive data on risk of infection constituted by waterborne HAV in SA. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
