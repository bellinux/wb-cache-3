40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel method for generation of {{an array of}} three-dimensional (3 D) multicellular spheroids within a microchannel in patterned cultures containing one or multiple cell types. This method uses a unique property of a cross-linked albumin coated surface in which the surface can be switched from non-adhesive to cell adhesive upon electrostatic adsorption of a polycation. Introduction of a solution containing albumin and a cross-linking agent into a microchannel {{with an array of}} <b>microwells</b> caused the entire surface, {{with the exception of the}} interior of the <b>microwells,</b> to become coated with the cross-linked albumin layer. Cells that were seeded within the microchannel did not adhere to the surface of the microchannel and became entrapped in the <b>microwells.</b> HepG 2 cells seeded in the <b>microwells</b> formed 3 D spheroids with controlled sizes and shapes depending upon the dimensions of the <b>microwells.</b> When the albumin coated surface was subsequently exposed to an aqueous solution containing poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI), adhesion of secondary cells, fibroblasts, occurred in the regions surrounding the arrayed spheroids.

Direct binding and inhibition assays both revealed that the IgG responses of many serum specimens were directed largely to the tube precipitin (TP) antigen even when the <b>microwells</b> were coated {{with a combination of}} coccidioidal antigens (CCAs). From a panel of 28 serum specimens containing antibodies to CCAs, 4 serum specimens yielded high IgG signals (absorbance, greater than 1. 0) and were negative for IgM (absorbance, less than 0. 2), yet all four IgG responses were inhibited by at least 90 % with partially purified TP antigens (2. 4 micrograms/ml). The IgM and IgG fractions of several serum specimens were separated by ion-exchange chromatography and assayed by using different antigen preparations adsorbed to the <b>microwells.</b> The binding of both IgM and IgG peaks to the <b>microwells</b> coated with the CCA preparation was inhibited significantly by preincubation with TP antigens. One serum specimen (specimen 26) yielded a large IgG response (absorbance, greater than 2. 0) with the CCA preparation and also bound directly to <b>microwells</b> coated only with TP antigens. The IgG signal (absorbance) of serum specimen 26 was reduced by 98 % when it was preincubated with TP antigens prior to the assay. Significant IgG signals from several other serum specimens were observed when <b>microwells</b> were coated with TP antigen preparations, but they were absent when periodate-treated preparations were used. Two cerebrospinal fluid specimens yielded IgG signals with CCA-coated <b>microwells,</b> which were not inhibited by TP antigens, and yielded no signal with <b>microwells</b> coated only with TP antigens. The results are consistent with the concept that the typical serologic response to TP antigens occurs early in disease progression, but they suggest that TP antigens stimulate both IgM and IgG responses...|$|R

First, plasma polymerisation of 1 -bromopropane was used to generate a bromine-functionalised thin film (BrPP) on a substrate of silicon wafer. Second, an epoxy functionalised polymer UV photoresist, SU- 8, was deposited and developed to create 50 μm-deep patterned <b>microwells</b> that display the BrPP coating at their base. Third, amino acids or peptides were selectively attached {{to the bottom of}} the <b>microwells</b> through bromine displacement by an amine or thiol nucleophile. Each surface functionalisation step was monitored by XPS, AFM, and contact angle measurements. These functionalities were then used as linkers to immobilise enzymes (e. g.

Peptide promoters of cell attachment were also immobilised and their functionality was evaluated using an L 929 fibroblast adhesion assay.

The prepared NIT- 1 spheroids or dissociated NIT- 1 cells were transplanted into the subrenal capsule in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. NIT- 1 spheroids prepared using the PNIPAAm-coated PDMS-based <b>microwells</b> had a uniformly sized spherical structure with a diameter of 200 - 300 μm.

A colloid of micelles was formed from polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) diblock copolymer. The micelles solution was dried on a silicon substrate leading to self-assembly of micelles into 3 -dimensional micropatterns. The micropatterns were then used as templates to fabricate <b>microwells</b> and tissue culture scaffolds from biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, by performing a simple lab-scale micromolding.

This thesis focused on developing microscale responsive platforms for spatial and geometrical control of multicellular organizations. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes methods to fabricate spherical and stripe microtissues of single cell types and their temperature-controlled retrieval. These microtissues were scaffold-free and can potentially produce homotypic cell-cell interactions. <b>Microwells</b> fabricated from poly(Nisopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) responded to temperature by changing their shapes. Spherical microtissues of a single cell type were formed in responsive <b>microwells</b> and recovered by using shape changing properties of <b>microwells.</b> Elastomeric microgrooves were conformally coated with PNIPAAm to first generate stripe microtissues of a single cell type, and then harvest them by exploiting the temperature-dependent hydrophilicity and swelling change of PNIPAAm film. The second part of the thesis introduces techniques to control spatial and geometrical distribution of multiple cell types in scaffold-free and scaffold-based tissues. Shape changing properties of dynamic <b>microwells</b> facilitated the sequential patterning of multicompartment hydrogels. Different cell types were spatially arranged in different compartments of microgels which may lead to complex cell-matrix interactions replicating native tissues. Shape changing properties of dynamic <b>microwells</b> were also employed to seed different cell types at different temperatures within defined geometries to control spatial and geometrical organization of multiple cell types. Resulting scaffold-free tissues can potentially produce homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions. Dynamic microstructures with different geometries could be used to recapitulate complex native tissues with controlled cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.
