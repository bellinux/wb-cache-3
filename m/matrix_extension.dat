40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest generalizations of {{elliptic}} integrable tops to matrix-valued variables. Our consideration {{is based on}} R-matrix description which provides Lax pairs in terms of quantum and classical R-matrices. First, we prove that for relativistic (and non-relativistic) tops such Lax pairs with spectral parameter follow from the associative Yang-Baxter equation and its degenerations. Then we proceed to <b>matrix</b> <b>extensions</b> of the models and find out that some additional constraints are required for their construction. We describe a matrix version of Z_ 2 reduced elliptic top and verify that the latter constraints are fulfilled in this case. The construction of <b>matrix</b> <b>extensions</b> is naturally generalized to the monodromy preserving equation. In this way we get <b>matrix</b> <b>extensions</b> of the Painlevé VI equation and its multidimensional analogues written {{in the form of}} non-autonomous elliptic tops. Finally, it is mentioned that the matrix valued variables can be replaced by elements of noncommutative associative algebra. In the end of the paper we also describe special elliptic Gaudin models which can be considered as <b>matrix</b> <b>extensions</b> of the (Z_ 2 reduced) elliptic top.
