25|$|A {{prominent}} {{institution of}} the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes. The Pashtuns remain a predominantly tribal people, but the trend of urbanisation has begun to alter Pashtun society as cities such as Kandahar, Peshawar, Quetta and Kabul have grown rapidly due to the influx of rural Pashtuns.

25|$|In 2015, in {{the wake}} of renewed debate about the {{symbolism}} of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation.

25|$|In three cases, {{the second}} round split one family name into two. The first round of {{simplification}} had already changed the common surnames 蕭 (Xiāo; #30 in 1982) and 閻 (Yán; #50) into 萧 and 阎. The second round adjusted these further and combined them with other characters previously much less common as surnames, 肖 and 闫 (trad. 閆). 傅 (Fù; #36 in 1982) was similarly changed to 付. Following the retraction of {{the second round}}, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> kept the new forms as their surnames so that the three family names are now written six or seven different ways.|$|E

25|$|Dairy {{products}} play {{an important}} role in Lithuanian cuisine; curd cheese (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Lithuanian butters and cream are unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called sūreliai are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> prefer making their own soured milk.|$|E
25|$|At around 3am, as {{the power}} of the waves {{increased}} and the tide rose, the ship started to break apart.

As it got too close to the shore it keeled over and <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> inside the ship drowned, the rest being thrown over the side and forced to swim to the shore.

25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church {{have come to understand}} Zion as primarily a community way of life that is centered around Jesus Christ, but <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> believe that, when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E

25|$|From feminists' perspectives, sexology, {{which is}} the study of human {{sexuality}} and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.|$|E
500|$|Bardsey Island (...) , [...] off the mainland, was {{inhabited}} in Neolithic times, and {{traces of}} hut circles remain. During the 5th century the island became {{a refuge for}} persecuted Christians, and a small Celtic monastery existed. Saint Cadfan arrived from Brittany in 516 and, under his guidance St Mary's Abbey was built. For centuries the island was important as [...] "the holy place of burial for all the bravest and best in the land". Bards called it [...] "the land of indulgences, absolution and pardon, the road to Heaven, and the gate to Paradise"; and in medieval times three pilgrimages to Bardsey Island {{were considered to be}} of equivalent benefit to the soul as one to Rome. In 1188 the abbey was still a Celtic institution, but by 1212 it belonged to the Augustinians. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> walk to Aberdaron and Uwchmynydd each year in the footsteps of the saints, although today only ruins of the old abbey's 13th-century bell tower remain. A Celtic cross amidst the ruins commemorates the 20,000saints reputed to be buried on the island.|$|E
500|$|Boganda {{is one in}} a {{long line}} of African {{political}} leaders who, in an attempt to develop specifically national political cultures, were presented (or presented themselves) as the great national leader, glorified and sometimes nearly deified. They were hailed as the fathers of their nations and considered wise in the ways of understanding the best interests of their peoples. Others who became particular objects of hero-worship include Léopold Sédar Senghor, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Moktar Ould Daddah, Ahmed Sékou Touré, Modibo Keïta, Léon M'ba and Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly. Boganda did little to discourage wide circulation of tales about his supernatural powers, putative invulnerability and even immortality. Shortly before his death, a large crowd waited on the shore of the Ubangui River to see him cross by walking upon the waters. He did not show up, but apparently a good <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> believed that he could have made the miraculous crossing. More than just a charismatic political leader, he was seen as the [...] "black Christ", a great religious figure endowed with extraordinary powers. Along with Congo-Brazzaville's Fulbert Youlou, who remained a priest while president, Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he unabashedly used the enormous popular respect for the Church and the cloth to political advantage. He successfully manipulated religious symbols (clerical garb, crosses, baptism, disciples, acolytes, etc.) for political purposes.|$|E

500|$|Just {{over two}} weeks after the convention, it was {{revealed}} that Eagleton had been hospitalized and received electroshock therapy for [...] "nervous exhaustion" [...] and [...] "depression" [...] several times during the early to mid-1960s (years later, Eagleton's diagnosis was refined to bipolar II disorder). McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry's battles with mental illness, and on the following day, July 26, stated publicly, [...] "I am 1,000percent for Tom Eagleton and have no intention of dropping him from the ticket." [...] Though <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>still</b> supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and newspapers questioned his ability to handle the office of vice president and, potentially, president or questioned the McGovern campaign's ability to survive the distraction. The resulting negative attention – combined with McGovern's consultation with preeminent psychiatrists, including Karl Menninger, as well as doctors who had treated Eagleton – prompted McGovern to accept, and announce on August 1, Eagleton's offer to withdraw from the ticket. It remains the only time a major party vice-presidential nominee has been forced off the ticket. Five prominent Democrats then publicly turned down McGovern's offer of the vice presidential slot: in sequence, Kennedy again, Abraham Ribicoff, Humphrey, Reubin Askew, and Muskie (Larry O'Brien was also approached but no offer made). Finally, he named United States Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. McGovern's 1,000 percent statement and subsequent reneging made him look both indecisive and an opportunist, and has since been considered one of the worst gaffes in presidential campaign history. McGovern himself would long view the Eagleton affair as having been [...] "catastrophic" [...] for his campaign.|$|E
