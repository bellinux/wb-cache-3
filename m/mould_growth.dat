Samples of M. plumbeus {{have been collected}} in numerous countries: {{as far north as}} Germany, Austria, Switzerland; as far east as Philippines, Indonesia; as far west as California and far south as South Africa. It is found in dust, soil and hypersaline water. Mucor plumbeus tolerates many soil types: including grassland, desert soils and heathland and has been isolated from the roots of alfalfa, oats, barley, Holcus mollis and other Australian heathland plants. In addition, it has been isolated from bird feathers, hay, decomposing plant debris, dung from different animals, fresh water, wood pulp, beech bark, wood timbers used in a copper mine, seeds of wheat and oat, and pecans. In the indoor built environment, M. plumbeus has been isolated from HVAC filters and has been detected in hospital air. In addition, M. plumbeus {{has been found to be}} associated with <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on concrete and other floor related materials and house dust.

2500|$|Cork taint is a wine fault mostly {{attributed}} to the compound 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), although other compounds such as guaiacol, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-octen-3-one, 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are also thought to be involved. TCA most likely originates as a metabolite of <b>mould</b> <b>growth</b> on chlorine-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes earthy, mouldy, and musty aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as [...] "corked".

Chemical treatments have shown the highest fungal contamination levels, the highest malting loss, but better enzyme activities (α and β-amylases, limit-dextrinase, α-glucosidase and β-glucanase).

40|$|Saloio cheese – a {{regional}} Portuguese cheese – is currently sold unpackaged or {{in a vacuum}} package. Neither of these packaging systems is acceptable: the first system yields a cheese too hard, because of excessive water loss, while the second yields a white cheese with poor textural properties. The use of a packaging system with a tailor-made moisture barrier, i. e., allowing for water loss, but at a lower rate, {{is a way of}} extending the cheese’s shelf-life. The adequate water vapour permeability to preserve the cheese was previously determined as 6. 8 · 107 g m/m 2 day Pa at 8 C. The objective of this work was to develop a packaging system providing the required relative humidity inside the package. Two systems were tested: (i) the active system Humidipak and (ii) perforated plastic films.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to develop stategies for raising the shelf-life of red raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.). The quality of red raspberries over shelf-life after coated with alginate plus Brazilian Citrus essential oils was evaluated. Edible coatings did not significantly influence the firmness loss, soluble solids content (SCC), and brightness of fruits over time, when compared to control, nevertheless all edible coatings with essential oils induced higher weight loss than those samples in which the essential oils were not incorporated. Fruits coated with alginate plus lime essential oil (0. 2 %) or orange essential oil (0. 1 %) after 15 days of storage had less red skin, but were darker than the remaining samples. The less red colour verified in these samples was also coincident with the lower concentration of anthocyanins {{at the end of}} the experiment as well as the lower capacity for scavenging ABTS free radicals or quenching singlet oxygen. The edible coatings supplemented with the essential oil of orange either at 0. 1 % or 0. 2 % were very efficient to control the yeasts and <b>moulds</b> <b>growth</b> after 15 days of storage. To control the development of aerobic mesophilic bacteria the use of essential oil of lemon 0. 2 % and essential oil of orange 0. 1 % were the most efficient.
