40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to utilize theories to reduce the subjectivity in <b>method</b> <b>engineering</b> processes. Since the support for the development of novel method fragments is especially weak, we concentrate on this <b>method</b> <b>engineering</b> aspect only. We show how theories can be incorporated into an existing <b>method</b> <b>engineering</b> process to guide method fragment development. We argue that theoretical support allows predicting the success or failure of a method and reduces the subjectivity in the <b>method</b> <b>engineering</b> process. One result of the paper is a proposal for a process model, which utilizes theories. Furthermore, we show that our approach is feasible by analyzing the usability of existing theories for the <b>method</b> <b>engineering</b> discipline. ...|$|R

Since the original proposal of situational <b>method</b> <b>engineering,</b> numerous approaches have been introduced to tackle this problem. In order to efficiently design situation specific methods it is necessary to reuse existing knowledge.

50|$|A {{time and}} motion study (or time-motion study) is a {{business}} efficiency technique combining the Time Study work of Frederick Winslow Taylor with the Motion Study work of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth (the same couple as is best known through the biographical 1950 film and book Cheaper by the Dozen). It is a major part of scientific management (Taylorism). After its first introduction, time study developed in the direction of establishing standard times, while motion study evolved into a technique for improving work methods. The two techniques became integrated and refined into a widely accepted method applicable to the improvement and upgrading of work systems. This integrated approach to work system improvement is known as <b>methods</b> <b>engineering</b> and it is applied today to industrial as well as service organizations, including banks, schools and hospitals.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give an {{overview}} of Situational Method Engi-neering, which is a type of <b>method</b> <b>engineering.</b> Situational <b>Method</b> <b>Engineering</b> aims at harmonisation of methods by providing rules to configure project-specific methods out of fragments from existing standard methods.
