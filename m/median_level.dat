5|$|Venus has an {{extended}} ionosphere located at altitudes 120–300km. The ionosphere almost {{coincides with the}} thermosphere. The high levels of the ionization are maintained only over the dayside of the planet. Over the nightside the concentration of the electrons is almost zero. The ionosphere of Venus consists of three layers: v1 between 120 and 130km, v2 between 140 and 160km and v3 between 200 and 250km. There may be an additional layer near 180km. The maximum electron volume density (number of electrons in a unit of volume) 3m−3 is reached in the v2 layer near the subsolar point. The upper boundary of the ionosphere—ionopause is located at altitudes 220–375km and separates the plasma of the planetary origin {{from that of the}} induced magnetosphere. The main ionic species in the v1 and v2 layers is O2+ ion, whereas the v3 layer consists of O+ ions. The ionospheric plasma is observed to be in motion; solar photoionization on the dayside, and ion recombination on the nightside, are the processes mainly responsible for accelerating the plasma to the observed velocities. The plasma flow appears to be sufficient to maintain the nightside ionosphere at or near the observed <b>median</b> <b>level</b> of ion densities.|$|E

In this study we tested the hypothesis that endothelium-derived biomarkers {{are associated with the}} pathophysiology of severe malaria and may help identify children with CM. Methods and Findings: Plasma samples were tested from children recruited with uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 32), {{cerebral malaria}} with retinopathy (CM-R; n = 38), clinically defined CM without retinopathy (CM-N; n = 29), or non-malaria febrile illness with decreased consciousness (CNS; n = 24).

Antibodies to CSP and LSA- 1 were primarily members of the IgG 1 and IgG 3 subclasses, while antibodies to TRAP were primarily members of the IgG 3 and IgG 4 subclasses. In a treatment-reinfection study following dry season testing, antibodies to TRAP were associated with a trend toward protection from infection in children (P = 0. 051) but not in adults. Antibodies to LSA- 1 and CSP did not correlate with protection in children or adults.

2500|$|This over-extraction of {{groundwater}} {{from the old}} clay lake bed has been causing the land upon which the city rests to collapse and sink.

Materials and methodsWe used the nationally representative Korean Environmental Health Survey in Children and Adolescents data for 2012 – 2014 and identified 2388 children and adolescents aged 3 – 18 years. The median and 95 th percentile exposure biomarker levels with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Multivariate regression analyses were performed on log transformed exposure biomarker levels adjusted for age, sex, area, household income, and father’s education <b>level.</b> The <b>median</b> exposure biomarker <b>levels</b> were compared with data from Germany, the US, and Canada, {{as well as the}} levels of Korean children measured at different times. ResultsThe <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> of blood lead and mercury, as well as urinary cadmium were 1. 23 μg/dL, 1. 80 μg/L, and 0. 40 μg/L (95 % CIs, 1. 21 – 1. 25, 1. 77 – 1. 83, and 0. 39 – 0. 41, respectively). The blood lead levels were significantly higher in boys and younger children (p< 0. 0001) and children with less educated fathers (p= 0. 004) after adjusting for covariates. Urinary cadmium level increased with age (p< 0. 0001). The <b>median</b> <b>levels</b> of blood mercury and urinary cadmium were much higher in Korean children and adolescents than those in their peers in Germany, the US, and Canada. Blood lead levels tended to decrease with increasing age and divergence between the sexes, particularly in the early teen years. <b>Median</b> <b>levels</b> of blood lead and urinary cadmium decreased since 2010. ConclusionSociodemographic factors, including age, sex, and father’s education level were associated with environmental exposure to heavy metals in Korean children and adolescents.
