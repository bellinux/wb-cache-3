40|$|Technical trading {{rules have}} been used in {{financial}} markets in order to examine their ability to yield a superior return. In the early empirical literature, a body of studies showed that trading rules do not outperform a simple buy and hold strategy. However, more recent research finds evidence that supports technical trading rules. This study examines the profitability of trading rules in 14 Middle East and North African (MENA) <b>markets.</b> <b>The</b> trading rules that used are: moving average trading rules (MA), trading range breakout (TRB) trading rules, filter trading rules, channel trading rules, Bollinger band (BB) trading rules and moving average coverage divergence (MACD) trading rules. <b>The</b> <b>markets</b> used in this work include <b>the</b> Bahrain stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Jordan stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Kuwait stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Lebanon stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Maltese stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Morocco stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Oman stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Qatar stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Saudi Arabian stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Tunisia stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Turkey stock <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates stock <b>markets,</b> <b>the</b> Cyprus stock <b>market</b> and <b>the</b> Egypt stock <b>market.</b> Our results indicate that according to mean return criterion, the best simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), triangular moving average (TMA), trading range breakout (TRB), filter and moving average coverage divergence (MACD) trading rules are for Turkey market. Malta, Bahrain and Oman have the highest percentage of rules that generate positive mean return. In terms of the Sharpe ratio, the best trading rules according to TMA, SMA, filter and channel trading rules are for Turkey market. Furthermore, Turkey has the highest percentage of rules that have a positive Sharpe ratio followed by Cyprus and Egypt. Controlling for data snooping, the results show that the number of trading rules that generate positive return comparing with buy and hold strategy has been reduced but there are still a large number of profitable rules through some markets...|$|R

5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by <b>marketing</b> <b>the</b> Yogo as the world's only {{guaranteed}} untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E
