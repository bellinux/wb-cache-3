5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' <b>marketing</b> <b>measures</b> taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E

50|$|Because {{marketing-mix}} models {{suggest a}} marketing tactic {{has a positive}} impact on sales doesn't necessarily mean it has {{a positive impact on}} long-term brand equity. Different <b>marketing</b> <b>measures</b> impact short-term and long-term brand sales differently and adjusting the marketing portfolio to maximize either the short-term or the long-term alone will be sub-optimal. For example the short-term positive effect of promotions on consumers’ utility induces consumers to switch to the promoted brand, but the adverse impact of promotions on brand equity carries over from period to period. Therefore the net effect of promotions on a brand’s market share and profitability can be negative due to their adverse impact on brand. Determining marketing ROI on the basis of marketing-mix models alone can lead to misleading results. This is because marketing-mix attempts to optimize marketing-mix to increase incremental contribution, but marketing-mix also drives brand-equity, which {{is not part of the}} incremental part measured by marketing-mix model- it is part of the baseline. True 'Return on Marketing Investment' is a sum of short-term and long-term ROI. The fact that most firms use marketing-mix models only to measure the short-term ROI can be inferred from an article by Booz Allen Hamilton, which suggests that there is a significant shift away from traditional media to 'below-the-line' spending, driven by the fact that promotional spending is easier to measure. But academic studies have shown that promotional activities are in fact detrimental to long-term marketing ROI (Ataman et al., 2006). Short-term marketing-mix models can be combined with brand-equity models using brand-tracking data to measure 'brand ROI', in both the short- and long-term. Finally, the modeling process itself should not be more costly than the resulting gain in profitability; i.e. it should have a positive Return On Modeling Effort (ROME).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{financial}} reports on stock market behavior {{is a central}} issue of research in accounting and finance. A number of studies investigate how financial information becomes impounded in security prices and affects investment decisions. Prior studies on the determinants of the bid-ask spread investigate the effect of <b>market</b> risk <b>measures,</b> and provide evidence that the bid-ask spread is a positive function of risk. Other studies report on an association between <b>market</b> risk <b>measures</b> and accounting risk measures. The present study extends this line of research by examining the effect of risk, proxied by accounting risk measures, on the bid-ask spread. The results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions provide evidence of a statistically significant association between certain accounting ratios and the bid-ask spread, and indicate that accounting risk measures account for more variability in the bid-ask spread than <b>market</b> risk <b>measures.</b> Most notably, {{the results indicate that}} a model which includes both accounting risk <b>measures</b> and <b>market</b> risk <b>measures</b> is a better fitted model that one which includes either accounting risk <b>measures</b> or <b>market</b> risk <b>measures</b> alone...|$|R
