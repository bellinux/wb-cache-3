50|$|Molecular motors are {{biological}} molecular {{machines that}} are the essential agents of movement in living organisms. In general terms, a motor is a device that consumes energy in one form and converts it into motion or mechanical work; for example, many protein-based molecular <b>motors</b> <b>harness</b> the chemical free energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP in order to perform mechanical work. In terms of energetic efficiency, this type of motor can be superior to currently available man-made motors. One important difference between molecular motors and macroscopic motors is that molecular motors operate in the thermal bath, {{an environment in which}} the fluctuations due to thermal noise are significant.|$|R
50|$|Paramotor is {{a generic}} {{name for the}} propulsive portion of a powered {{paraglider}} ("PPG"). It consists of a frame that combines the <b>motor,</b> propeller, <b>harness</b> (with integrated seat) and cage. It provides two attachment points for the risers of a paraglider wing that allows for powered flight.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic biology re-imagines {{existing}} {{biological systems}} {{by designing and}} constructing new biological parts, devices, and systems. In the arena of cytoskeleton-based transport, synthetic approaches are currently used in two broad ways. First, molecular <b>motors</b> are <b>harnessed</b> for non-physiological functions in cells. Second, transport systems are engineered in vitro to determine the biophysical rules that govern motility. These rules are then applied to synthetic nanotechnological systems. We review recent advances {{in both of these}} areas and conclude by discussing future directions in engineering the cytoskeleton and its <b>motors</b> for transport. <b>Harnessing</b> the cytoskeleton The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of fibers that exert and respond to force and serve as highways fo...|$|R
40|$|The two-headed kinesin <b>motor</b> <b>harnesses</b> {{the energy}} of ATP {{hydrolysis}} to take 8 -nm steps, walking processively along a microtubule, alternately stepping with each of its catalytic heads in a hand-over-hand fashion. Two persistent challenges for models of kinesin motility are {{to explain how the}} two heads are coordinated (“gated”) and when the translocation step occurs relative to other events in the mechanochemical reaction cycle. To investigate these questions, we used a precision optical trap to measure the single-molecule kinetics of kinesin in the presence of substrate analogs beryllium fluoride or adenylyl-imidodiphosphate. We found that normal stepping patterns were interspersed with long pauses induced by analog binding, and that these pauses were interrupted by short-lived backsteps. After a pause, processive stepping could only resume once the kinesin molecule took an obligatory, terminal backstep, exchanging the positions of its front and rear heads, presumably to allow release of the bound analog from the new front head. Preferential release from the front head implies that the kinetics of the two heads are differentially affected when both are bound to the microtubule, presumably by internal strain that is responsible for the gating. Furthermore, we found that ATP binding was required to reinitiate processive stepping after the terminal backstep. Together, our results support stepping models in which ATP binding triggers the mechanical step and the front head is gated by strain...|$|R

After a brief run (typically 10 feet or 3 metres) the wing lifts the <b>motor</b> and its <b>harnessed</b> pilot off the ground. After takeoff, the pilot gets into the seat and sits suspended beneath the inflated paraglider wing. Control is available using brake toggles for roll and a hand-held throttle for pitch.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLiving cells {{maintain}} a huge transmembrane electric field across their membranes. This electric field exerts a {{force on the}} membrane because the membrane surfaces are highly charged. We have measured electromechanical force generation by cell membranes using optically trapped beads to detach the plasma membrane from the cytoskeleton and form long thin cylinders (tethers). Hyperpolarizing potentials increased and depolarizing potentials decreased the force required to pull a tether. The membrane tether force in response to sinusoidal voltage signals was a function of holding potential, tether diameter, and tether length. Membrane electromechanical force production can occur at speeds exceeding those of ATP-based protein <b>motors.</b> By <b>harnessing</b> the energy in the transmembrane electric field, cell membranes may contribute to processes as diverse as outer hair cell electromotility, ion channel gating, and transport...|$|R
40|$|Goal-directed movement, such as {{reaching}} to touch an object, {{relies heavily on}} vision. Vision guides our motor system not only during initial targeting but also during online movement correction and error-driven learning. But it is not all one-way traffic. This paper reports {{a situation in which}} this perceptual-motor interaction runs in reverse, when action affects concurrent perceptual experience. More to the point, the paper reveals that visual perception is subject to change through learned (even arbitrary) visuomotor associations. By considering {{a situation in which the}} perceptual decision is dichotomous, this paper reveals that the brain readily <b>harnesses</b> <b>motor</b> behavior to constrain the formation of a visual percept...|$|R

Interfacing molecular motors with the macroscopic world by surface assembly on gold nanoparticles and a macroscopic gold film, {{has shown that the}} motor functions while chemically bound to a surface, a key result for future nanomachines such as a molecular conveyor belt.

40|$|To extract {{useful work}} from {{biological}} motor proteins, {{it is necessary}} to orient microtubules traveling over kinesin-coated surfaces properly. Toward this goal, we have used microfabrication to construct 1. 5 -ím-deep channels in SU- 8 photoresist patterned on glass. Although motor proteins bind to all surfaces, these channels localize motility exclusively to the glass surface, and the photoresist creates steep walls that direct microtubule movement. This technique provides a general approach for lithographically patterning enzyme activity. Kinesins are molecular motors that move along microtubules, powering intracellular transport in neurons and other cells. Motor proteins and the microtubule cytoskeleton function as an intracellular railroad systemsa railroad with nano-meter-scale engines and tracks that transport vesicles and organelles from one location in the cell to another. 1, 2 Because of the importance of organizing and transporting material at nanoscale dimensions, there is considerable interest in <b>harnessing</b> <b>motor</b> proteins for nanotechnology applications.

40|$|The {{idea that}} the damaged brain can {{functionally}} reorganize itself ⎯ so when one part fails, there lies the possibility for another to substitute ⎯ is an exciting discovery of the twentieth century. We now know that motor circuits once presumed to be hardwired are not, and motor-skill learning, exercise, and even mental rehearsal of motor tasks can turn genes on or off to shape brain architecture, function and, consequently, behavior. This is a very significant alteration from our previously static view of the brain, and has profound implications for the rescue of function after a motor injury. Presentation of the right cues, applied in relevant spatiotemporal geometries, is required to awaken the dormant plastic forces essential for repair. The focus of this review is to highlight {{some of the recent}} progress in neural interfaces designed to <b>harness</b> <b>motor</b> plasticity, and the role of miniaturization in development of strategies that engage diverse elements of the neuronal machinery to synergistically facilitate recovery of function after motor damage...|$|R
40|$|Unidirectional {{molecular}} rotary <b>motors</b> that <b>harness</b> photoinduced cis-trans (E-Z) isomerization {{are promising}} tools for {{the conversion of}} light energy to mechanical motion in nanoscale molecular machines. Considerable {{progress has been made}} in optimizing the frequency of ground-state rotation, but less attention has been focused on excited state processes. Here the excited state dynamics of a molecular motor with electron donor and acceptor substituents located to modify the excited-state reaction coordinate, without altering its stereochemistry, are studied. The substituents are shown to modify the photochemical yield of the isomerization without altering the motor frequency. By combining 50 fs resolution time-resolved fluorescence with ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy the underlying excited-state dynamics are characterized. The Franck-Condon excited state relaxes in a few hundred femtoseconds to populate a lower energy dark state by a pathway that utilizes a volume conserving structural change. This is assigned to pyramidalization at a carbon atom of the isomerizing bridging double bond. The structure and energy of the dark state thus reached are a function of the substituent, with electron-withdrawing groups yielding a lower energy longer lived dark state. The dark state is coupled to the Franck Condon state and decays on a picosecond time scale via a coordinate that is sensitive to solvent friction, such as rotation about the bridging bond. Neither subpicosecond nor picosecond dynamics are sensitive to solvent polarity, suggesting that intramolecular charge transfer and solvation are not key driving forces for the rate of the reaction. Instead steric factors and medium friction determine the reaction pathway, with the sterically remote substitution primarily influencing the energetics. Thus, these data indicate a chemical method of optimizing the efficiency of operation of these molecular motors without modifying their overall rotational frequency...|$|R
40|$|Motion is an {{intrinsic}} property of all living organisms, and each cell displays {{a variety of}} shapes and modes of locomotion. How structural proteins support cellular movement and how cytoskeletal dynamics and <b>motor</b> proteins are <b>harnessed</b> to generate order and movement are among the fundamental and not fully resolved questions in biology today. Protozoan parasites belonging to the Apicomplexa are of enormous medical and veterinary significance, being responsible {{for a wide variety}} of diseases in human and animals, including malaria, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis and cryptosporidiosis. These obligate intracellular parasites exhibit a unique form of actin-based gliding motility, which is essential for host cell invasion and spreading of parasites throughout the infected hosts. A motor complex composed of a small myosin of class XIV associated with a myosin light chain and a plasma membrane-docking protein is present beneath the parasite's plasma membrane. According to the capping model, this complex is connected directly or indirectly to transmembrane adhesin complexes, which are delivered to the parasite surface upon microneme secretion. Together with F-actin and as yet unknown bridging molecules and proteases, these complexes are among the structural and functional components of the 'glideosome'...|$|R
40|$|Myosin VI is a {{molecular}} <b>motor</b> that <b>harnesses</b> the conformational changes caused by ATP hydrolysis to generate motion along the actin filament (F-actin). As with all myosins, the motor domain of myosin VI contains an actin binding site and nucleotide binding site. The lever arm of myosin VI {{is followed by}} a coiled coil motif that mediates dimerization, and a cargo binding tail domain. Myosin VI is the only myosin that moves to the minus-end of F-actin. It has been implicated in multiple functions in disparate model systems. The ability of myosin VI to move processively across the actin filament provides a role for myosin VI in cargo transport, including uncoated endocytic vesicle (UCV) transport. Alternatively, kinetic studies have shown that myosin VI can be made to spend more of its actomyosin cycle tightly bound to actin when under increased load conditions, allowing myosin VI to also serve as a tension sensor that tethers membrane and protein elements to the actin cytoskeleton. The regulation of myosin VI {{at the level of the}} motor for it to act as a motor or tether is an intriguing possibility. In addition, myosin VI is mainly found in a cytoplasmic pool suggesting that its docking to cargoes is regulated, separately from its interaction with actin. In Chapter One, I show that myosin VI functions to transport uncoated endocytic vesicles (UCV) through the actin meshwork in our model retinal pigmented epithelial cell system, and in doing so demonstrate that the cortical actin meshwork acts as a barrier to uncoated endocytic vesicle trafficking to the pericentriolar region. In Chapter Two, I provide evidence that in vivo, myosin VI is regulated to act either as a transporter or a tension sensing anchor to actin following alteration at threonine 406. Finally in Chapter Three, I delineate a mechanism for myosin VI recruitment to the UCV cargo through its adapter GIPC/synectin. I posit that recruitment occurs via activation of the GIPC/synectin PDZ domain by PDZ motif- containing receptors being trafficked through the UC...|$|R
40|$|A brain–computer {{interface}} (BCI) is {{a device}} that allows a user to communicate with external devices through thought processes alone. A novel signal acquisition tool for BCIs is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical technique to measure localized cortical brain activity. The benefits of using this non-invasive modality are safety, portability and accessibility. A number of commercial multi-channel NIRS system are available; however we have developed a straightforward custom-built system to investigate the functionality of a fNIRS-BCI system. This work describes {{the construction of the}} device, the principles of operation and the implementation of a fNIRS-BCI application, ‘Mindswitch’ that <b>harnesses</b> <b>motor</b> imagery for control. Analysis is performed online and feedback of performance is presented to the user. Mindswitch presents a basic ‘on/off’ switching option to the user, where selection of either state takes 1 min. Initial results show that fNIRS can support simple BCI functionality and shows much potential. Although performance may be currently inferior to many EEG systems, there is much scope for development particularly with more sophisticated signal processing and classification techniques. We hope that by presenting fNIRS as an accessible and affordable option, a new avenue of exploration will open within the BCI research community and stimulate further research in fNIRS-BCIs...|$|R
40|$|A {{concept for}} a Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) has been {{developed}} based on the knowledge gained from over 50 years of space travel. It is being designed for Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) and Multi]Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and {{is based upon the}} Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) commode. The UMWS was modified to enhance crew interface and reduce volume and cost. The UWMS will stow waste in fecal canisters, similar to the EDO, and urine will be stowed in bags for in orbit change out. This allows the pretreated urine to be subsequently processed and recovered as drinking water. The new design combines two fans and a rotary phase separator on a common shaft to allow operation by a single motor. This change enhances packaging by reducing the volume associated with an extra <b>motor,</b> associated controller, <b>harness,</b> and supporting structure. The separator pumps urine to either a dual bag design for COTS vehicles or directly into a water reclamation system. The commode is supported by a concentric frame, enhancing its structural integrity while further reducing the volume from the previous design. The UWMS flight concept development effort is underway and an early output of the development will be a ground based UMWS prototype for manned testing. Referred to as the Gen 3 unit, this prototype will emulate the crew interface included in the UWMS and will offer a great deal of knowledge regarding the usability of the new design, allowing the design team the opportunity to modify the UWMS flight concept based on the manned testing...|$|R
