5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.|$|E

25|$|A Roman villa on the site, {{built around}} the year 200, {{contains}} an elaborate <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> floor in what {{is believed to have}} been a triclinium. In Roman tradition, seating would have been arranged in a U-shape around the mosaic for guests to recline as they ate, drank and socialized. The mosaic features images of Dionysus, god of wine and of socializing, along with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels.|$|E

25|$|Between 2005–2007, MICA {{accomplished}} a two-phased, $6.3million {{renovation of the}} building by the architectural firm of Grieves, Worrall, Wright & O’Hatnick, Inc. The first phase, renovation of the interior, was completed in Fall, 2005: interior finishes, such as the <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> flooring, marble columns, tin ceilings, wood wainscot, and trim were cleaned and restored. Classroom space was also increased, {{as well as the}} quality and quantity of studio space. The second phase, restoration of the building's exterior and train shed, was completed in Spring, 2007: stonework and wood were cleaned, repaired, and repainted, the slate canopy restored, and the drainage system fixed; clerestory and structural timbers in the train shed were replaced and the steel roof framing was reinforced. In keeping with the pedestrian landscaping and streetscape that MICA has created along Mount Royal Avenue, a new plaza with benches, bike racks, shrubs, and ornamental grasses and ground cover was added.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} 191st Street station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system. The station was completely renovated in 2003–2004 by the New York City Transit Authority. All of the deteriorating tiles and mosaics were replaced with exact reproductions of the originals made by Serpentile, a company that does reproductions of original subway motifs. The tiles are all unglazed porcelain a half inch wide. Each of the 72 columns had to be plastered and prepared for four-sided mosaics that wrap around each one. There are 72 vertical panels, and over 3500 linear feet of mosaics. New York City Transit construction crews did all of the tile and installation work. The station {{is also home to}} a <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> piece of art titled Primavera by Raul Colon, accessible from the St. Nicholas Ave entrance to the station, or via the access tunnel on Broadway.|$|E
25|$|Directly west {{of these}} rooms is the Edwardian Mappin Wing, which {{contains}} the entrance hall. Its walls are partly panelled, partly clad in marble; the lower floor covered in <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> {{and the upper}} with wood. The two levels are connected by a wide, white marble, central stair; to each side, at the upper landing, are marble guards with ornate, Neoclassical balustrades. Across {{from the top of}} the stair is a door (to the reception room) flanked with wood panels documenting the names and escutcheons of each of the governors general for New France, British North America, and Canada. On the opposite wall, to the left of the entrance, is the Royal Window—a stained glass piece commemorating the 40th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne, displaying, between the Queen's Canadian royal standard above and the Great Seal of Canada below, the monarch's coat of arms for Canada surrounded by the shields of each of the provincial coats of arms. Additionally, in the top two corners are images of Elizabeth's royal cypher, balancing out representations of the Sovereign's badges for both the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit in the bottom two corners. Another stained glass window is found to the right of the entrance, marking the first appointment of a Canadian-born governor general; the viceregal position is symbolised by a crowned lion holding a maple leaf and surrounded by the shields of the arms of the first seven persons to hold the post. In 2012, bronze and glass handrails, funded by a private donation from Rouge Herald Extraordinary Roger Alexander Lindsay, were added to each side of the stair in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
500|$|The college's first unified {{library was}} in Thompson Hall, which was {{constructed}} in 1905. [...] Funds for its construction were provided by William R.

[...] The building is sandstone, with hand-laid <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> floors and skylights. [...] It was lit by electric lights and heated by steam. [...] In addition to the college's holdings and those of the various literary societies, the library held the Walker Room, a room with fine furnishings, Tiffany lamps, and John Walker's personal library of 5,000 volumes. [...] From its construction until the 1970s, its steps and green space held the commencement exercises. [...] The building is sandstone, with hand-laid <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> floors and skylights. In 1965, this room was transferred to the U. Grant Miller Library. [...] In 2004, the building was remodeled into administrative facilities.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} Donnell {{purchased in}} 1979 had declined badly. The Dearborn entrances {{had been closed}} in, the ground floor had been [...] "defaced by garish signs", and the brick had been painted and was peeling. Inside, the marble wainscoting had been painted over {{and many of the}} original oak doors had been replaced with cheaper mahogany. The decorative stair rails had been enclosed, and some stairways and corridors had been closed off completely. Much of the original <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> had been demolished—some floors were carpeted, others tiled in vinyl or terrazzo. Half of the sixteen elevators were still manually operated. [...] "It was {{as if it had been}} partly updated every ten years throughout its history", said Donnell, [...] "it was never done over in its entirety." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{best known}} [...] "vase technique" [...] carpets from Kirmān {{are those of}} the {{so-called}} [...] "Sanguszko group", named after the House of Sanguszko, whose collection has the most outstanding example. The medallion-and-corner design is similar to other 16th century Safavid carpets, but the colours and style of drawing are distinct. In the central medallion, pairs of human figures in smaller medallions surround a central animal combat scene. Other animal combats are depicted in the field, while horsemen are shown in the corner medallions. The main border also contains lobed medallions with Houris, animal combats, or confronting peacocks. In-between the border medallions, phoenixes and dragons are fighting. By similarity to <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile</b> spandrels in the Ganjali Khan Complex at the Kirmān bazaar with an inscription recording its date of completion as 1006 AH/AD 1596, they are dated {{to the end of the}} 16th or the beginning of the 17th century. Two other [...] "vase technique" [...] carpets have inscriptions with a date: One of them bears the date 1172 AH/AD 1758 and the name of the weaver: the Master Craftsman Muhammad Sharīf Kirmānī, the other has three inscriptions indicating that it was woven by the Master Craftsman Mu'min, son of Qutb al-Dīn Māhānī, between 1066-7 AH/AD 1655-6. Carpets in the Safavid tradition were still woven in Kirmān after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1732 (Ferrier, 1989, p.127).|$|E
2500|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} the main mast of the USS Maine set upright {{into the center of}} a circular, stylized mausoleum shaped to look like a battleship gun turret. The structure is [...] in diameter and [...] high. The mast pierces the roof the memorial, and is sunk into the floor inside. The mausoleum is constructed of reinforced concrete, sheathed in tan granite on the outside and white marble on the interior. The names and ranks of those who died aboard the Maine are carved into the exterior of the mausoleum, organized into 23 panels. There are eleven slit windows with bronze grills in the structure. [...] The interior roof is a shallow dome, and the interior floor is lined with <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile.</b> The single entry to the mausoleum has two doors. The inner door is made of wood, and half the ship's bell (retrieved from the ocean floor in 1911) is attached to the outer side of this door. The outer door is a bronze gate decorated with metal rope and anchors. Ceremonial stone funeral urns stand {{on either side of the}} entryway. Above the door is carved the following: [...] "Erected in memory of the officers and men who lost their lives in the destruction of the U.S.S. Maine, Habana, Cuba, February 15, 1898".|$|E
2500|$|The décor of {{the rooms}} was {{regarded}} itself as art, with many notable French designers and artists commissioned to create the most striking spaces at sea. Beyond this, many pieces of artwork were especially ordered to adorn {{the walls of the}} dining rooms, lounges and cabins. Within the Salon Riviera the tapestry by Jean Picart le Doux dominated the entire forward wall, at 17.4m (57ft) long. In the same room two paintings by Roger Chapelain-Midy occupied niches in opposite corners to the aft. The overall interior was designed by Airbus, who had previously worked with Chapelain-Midy to design sets for a performance of Les Indes galantes at the Palais Garnier in 1952. Slightly forward, the Salon Fontainebleau was decorated by Maxime Old, and within was contained three tapestries by Lucien Coutaud (Les femmes fleurs), two by Claude Idoux (Jardin magique, Fée Mirabelle) and Camille Hilaire (Sous-bois, Forêt de France). Near to that room was the Salon Debussy (Music Room) with three bronze lacquered panels by Bobot, and a bronze abstract sculpture of a young woman playing a flute, by Hubert Yencesse. The theatre's interior was done in red, grey and gold by Peynet, with the ceiling in grey <b>mosaic</b> <b>tile,</b> and the port and starboard walls in vertical gold lacquered aluminium panels, tilted outwards to allow for recessed lighting from behind. The [...] was created by Anne Carlu Subes (daughter of Jacques Carlu) in silver anodized aluminium panels arranged in a 45-degree grid pattern. Jacques Noël created trompe-l'œil panels for all four walls of the First Class Children's Playroom in a Renaissance theme, and Jean A. Mercier painted a full mural entitled Une nouvelle arche de Noé (A New Noah's Arc) for the Tourist Class Children's' Playroom, using an abstract rendition of France as the Arc. The Bar de l'Atlantique contained two ceramics by Pablo Picasso, as well three other ceramic sculptures (Faune cavalier, Portrait de Jacqueline and Joueur de flûte et danseuse) by the artist in the Salon Saint-Tropez.|$|E

50|$|Similar to his sculptures {{from the}} early eighties, {{specifically}} his Brushstrokes pieces, the entire sculpture looks like {{it could have been}} painted with a few quick strokes of paint. The difference between these earlier pieces and The Head of Barcelona is that his Brushstrokes pieces are created with painted aluminum while The Head is his only piece made out of concrete and covered in <b>mosaic</b> <b>tiles.</b> The reason for this difference in his sculptures is because The Head of Barcelona was built to resemble the style of Antoni Gaudi, a Catalan architect who is famous for employing organic lines and <b>mosaic</b> <b>tiles</b> throughout his architecture, and for which Barcelona is known.|$|R
