40|$|Article 3 (2) TFEU stipulates: ‘The Union shall offer its {{citizens}} {{an area of}} freedom, security and justice […]’. Such an Area sounds like a present {{anyone would want to}} receive. However, what precisely is the meaning of these promising terms? How much ‘freedom’, ‘security’, and ‘justice’ does the Union want to offer? What are the inherent limitations? What are the constitutional, political, and practical obstacles to establishing the Area in the way the Union envisage it? The establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice poses huge challenges for the Union and its <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> joint objectives is difficult and might disenchant those who were inspired by the promising terminology, but even greater constitutional, political and practical difficulties arise when European law is incorporated into national law, when specific and effective cooperation arrangements are set up (including those requiring exchange of information), when flexible and differentiated integration compartmentalises the Area to a patchwork, in the exercise of parliamentary control, in the treatment of third country nationals, and in the control of minimum standards at all levels of cooperation...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of diverging trends in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) application {{in the various}} <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the driving forces behind the different trends is an important mission of the Renewable Energy Unit (REU). This can reveal which policy approaches perform better in the various socio-economic environment and by their comparison and dissemination it can foster {{the selection of the}} most appropriate policy tool for decision makers. Renewable energy use and the projected shares of the renewable energy sources (RES) in the final energy mix show positive tendencies all over Europe. Beyond the positive impression one can draw from the increase, there are signs that there are some diverging tendencies among different groups of countries. In this context the roundtable had a twofold objective. First it aimed at classifying and ranking the most important factors in CEE countries impeding a more rapid deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity production (RES-E). We used the following problem classification: ¿	Financial o	Regulative ¿ support measures ¿	Institutional o	Network management -infrastructure ¿	Trans-Boundary Power Exchange (Cross-Border Issues) ¿	Power Systems Interconnection / Fair third party access rules o	Market structure/concentration The second objective was to identify efficient ways to overcome these barriers from demonstrations of successful examples from <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> with longer RES-E integration experience. Some of the best available techniques and country experience with the different policies were presented at the roundtable. The invited experts shared their experiences gained at various institutions: energy regulation offices, grid operating entities, energy production units and quite a few in energy related research organisations. Beside the positive examples, the barriers that exist in the various <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were also discussed. The roundtable proceeding may help the stakeholders in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> their strategic benefits from RES integration. The more rapid development of RES can offer advantages for all stakeholder groups: this win-win situation can be realised if all stakeholders of the market and regulation would be informed better how to benefit from the increased diversification offered by RES. The major benefits can be identified as the following for the stakeholders. ¿	Regulators can get a better understanding how the problems of larger scale integration the RES sources were overcome in different countries. More sophisticated regulatory mechanisms and better information systems can strengthen the position of regulatory bodies. Improving market conditions, bidding procedures, (ie. day and hour ahead market instead of the monthly schedule), embedding forecasting systems will lead to enhanced regulatory regimes. ¿	Grid operators are interested in the DER integration challenges, system loss reduction, access conditions, integrating output forecast from intermittent generators that can contribute to improved grid operation methods. ¿	Power production investors seek low volatility, secure cash flow (feed in tariff), diversification, immunity from oil price changes and carbon prices. ¿	Researchers quest for innovation and cost reduction by technological learning.
