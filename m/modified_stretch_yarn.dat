This combination results in relatively high mobility of filament segments along the yarn axis and in any direction away from the yarn axis [1]. The relatively high mobility of the filaments means that the <b>stretch</b> <b>yarn</b> structure is easily deformed and that yarn has poor dimensional stability in general. The flattening out of the yarn structure occurs rather easily under normal bend-ing or compressional deformations. The spreading of fila-ments changes the yarn cross-sectional shape to a rather flat, ribbon-like structure, or one that is quite elliptical. This collapse of the filament bundle permits a much greater area of contact with other surfaces, resulting in greater friction and discomfort in apparel applications. I...|$|R

Basically, the standard denim fabrics are made of unbleached cotton yarn, {{so there is no}} elasticity and many wrinkles. Recently, denim fabrics have been given elasticity according to consumers’ needs. The existing denim fabrics, which were compared with the Hanji denim fabric produced in this study, were denim fabrics with medium stretch (S 1) and high stretch (S 2). The approximate structure of the existing denim fabrics (S 1, S 2), using the analysis of fabric structure, showed cotton yarns (navy color) and <b>stretch</b> <b>yarns</b> used as warp and weft, respectively. Most Hanji denim fabrics produced, except for the DF 1 (C 10) and the DF 2 (C 10), showed a higher elastic recovery rate than that of existing medium stretch denim fabric (S 1).

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{experimental study}} was conducted to produce benchmark wave kinematics data for five different regular waves and the maxima of four different irregular wave trains. Two of the irregular waves generated are in the category of rogue waves. A series of experiments were conducted in a 2 -D wave tank at Texas A&M University to measure wave velocities and accelerations using LDV and PIV systems. The wave crests of regular and rogue waves are the focus of this study. With the measured wave velocity field, the wave accelerations were computed using a centered finite difference scheme. Both local and convective components of the total accelerations are obtained from experimental data. Also, the nonlinear wave forces on a truncated slender cylinder are computed by applying the obtained wave kinematics to the Morison equation. The force results based on measured wave kinematics are compared with those based on the kinematics of linear extrapolation, Wheeler <b>stretching,</b> and <b>modified</b> <b>stretching.</b> The Wheeler stretching method generally underestimates the actual wave kinematics. The linear extrapolation method is very sensitive to the cutoff frequency of the wave spectrum. The <b>modified</b> <b>stretching</b> method tends to predict the maximum value of wave kinematics above the still water level (SWL) well except for the convective acceleration.

Results A direct correlation between CFTR expression levels and PTHrP levels was found. An inverse correlation between CFTR and Wnt signaling activities was demonstrated. Conclusion These data are consistent with CFTR participating in the mechanicosensory process essential to regulate Wnt/β-Catenin signaling required for lung organogenesis. </p...|$|R

In particular the LPL, which is usually preferable with respect to the MSE and fits well the data of most sequences, might represent a valid alternative to the MOM in real-time forecasts of aftershock probabilities. We also show that the LPL generally fits the data better than a purely empirical formula equivalent to the aftershock rate equation predicted by the rate- and state- dependent friction model.

40|$|ObjectiveStenosis is {{the main}} cause of {{hemodialysis}} vascular graft failure and it is primarily caused by neointimal hyperplasia (NH) development at the vein-graft anastomosis. Even though NH development factors are well known, their activation pathway still remains disputed and the real role of the mismatch compliance between the vein and the graft wall has not yet been resolved. The purpose of this experimental study in swine was to verify the possibility of preventing the development of NH at the vein-graft anastomosis using a modified commercially available longitudinal stretch expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) Gore (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) graft (either standard or heparin-bonded) with an added handmade ePTFE radial stretch cuff at one end to reduce the compliance between the graft and the vein wall. MethodsTwelve ePTFE <b>stretch</b> grafts (6 <b>modified</b> and 6 unmodified) were surgically placed as arterovenous grafts (AVGs) between the carotid artery and the external jugular vein in 6 pigs. In each pig, one modified graft was placed on one side and one corresponding unmodified graft on the other side as a control. In 4 pigs, standard stretch ePTFE Gore grafts were used, and in 2 pigs, heparin-bonded stretch Gore grafts were used; 2 pigs were also treated with antiplatelet drugs. All the implanted grafts had a total length of 8 cm and a diameter of 6 mm. The modified graft was realized by cutting a short segment of the commercially available graft lengthwise which was then sewn crosswise (rotated 90 °) with the same diameter as the original graft and was then added to it. A Doppler ultrasound scan was used for monitoring the graft patency immediately, weekly, and before death. At death (21 - 28 days after implantation), artery, vein, and graft specimens were collected “en bloc” for histopathology. ResultsThe modified grafts in the antiplatelet-treated animals were able to completely prevent NH development on vein wall (100 % in 2 subjects) which was also reduced in antiplatelet untreated animals (66. 5 %, 96. 4 %, and 100 % in 3 subjects, respectively). The <b>modified</b> standard <b>stretch</b> grafts and similarly <b>modified</b> heparin-bonded <b>stretch</b> grafts obtained the same good results in NH prevention. ConclusionData provide evidence of the efficacy of <b>modified</b> <b>stretch</b> ePTFE grafts with an added radial stretch cuff for the prevention of NH in swine models and support the hypothesis of the pivotal role of mismatch compliance between the graft and the vein wall in NH development. Clinical RelevanceIf these results are confirmed in humans with a significantly improved graft patency, they would have a great effect on dialysis vascular access, especially in patients with unsuitable veins for fistula creation...|$|R
