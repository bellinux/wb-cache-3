For instance, Armenians from Armenia <b>might</b> <b>know</b> Russian, those from Lebanon and Syria may know Arabic and French, almost all Iranian Armenians speak Persian and Istanbul Armenians speak Turkish.|$|E
5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) <b>might</b> <b>know</b> about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches {{a glimpse of the}} crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{met with}} Mahatma Gandhi, {{becoming}} the first African Americans to have an audience with him. When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States, he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished. One {{important aspect of the}} meeting was a discussion of how non-violent resistance {{could be used as a}} means of creating social change. The meeting had a profound effect on the couple, changing the direction of their lives. Though they would remain Christians, the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice, transcending racial, social, economic and spiritual boundaries. After they returned to the United States, Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was looking for someone to establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides. Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman <b>might</b> <b>know</b> of a divinity student interested in the position. Instead, Howard decided to take up the challenge himself, securing a leave of absence in order to found the church. Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters, as she strongly believed in the cause.|$|E

25|$|A {{voyage to}} explore {{the east coast of}} New Holland, with a view to a British {{colonization}} of the country, had been recommended in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744–1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour: The first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted it, to come to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this means all the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; and we <b>might</b> <b>know</b> as well, and as certainly, as the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer our Expectations.|$|E

500|$|During casting of the film, Wong sought {{actors who}} were able to portray the main {{characters}} as heroic individuals with realistic qualities. This sentiment was also echoed by Perry, who stated that for the two lead characters, he and Wong sought actors who [...] "had the charisma of movie stars, but weren't so ridiculously rarified that you couldn't feel like you <b>might</b> <b>know</b> them". The casting of the supporting characters was given equal weight, being considered of equal importance with the casting of the main characters.|$|E

500|$|From the beginning, the battleships of Division Nine faced a hard task in {{adapting}} to the new methods and practices they encountered in the Grand Fleet. Any difficulties, however, that might have arisen from this transition based on national pride or rivalry were dissipated {{in large part by}} the professional example set by Admiral Rodman himself. As he would later note of his squadron's assimilation: [...] "I realized that the British fleet had had three years of actual warfare and knew the game from the ground floor up; that while we <b>might</b> <b>know</b> it theoretically, there would be a great deal to learn practically. There could not be two independent commands in one force if our work was to be harmonious, and the only logical course was to amalgamate our ships and serve under the command of the British commander-in-chief." [...] This cooperative attitude trickled down through the division, and elicited the admiration and appreciation of the British.|$|E

Lucas North (Richard Armitage) and Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) discover Tiresias is the Russian equivalent of Sugarhorse, but [...] "bigger and better;" [...] while Sugarhorse placed pro-western Russians to infiltrate its government, Tiresias does the opposite; recruit spies to infiltrate the British Government. Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) believes Connie James (Gemma Jones), a mole from the FSB, <b>might</b> <b>know</b> what Tiresias is planning. Ros and Lucas release Connie from custody by posing as masked Russian agents. Later, it is revealed that FSB officers have been assigned to assassinate her. FSB head Viktor Sarkisiian (Peter Sullivan) orders a kill squad to search every MI5 safehouse, provided by Connie, to kill her and the Section D team who are harbouring her.|$|E
500|$|After {{writing the}} line, Pierson {{worried that the}} phrase was too complex for the warden. To explain its origin, he created a backstory that was {{included}} in the stage directions. Pierson explained that in order to advance in the Florida prison system, officers had to take criminology and penology courses at the state university, showing how the warden <b>might</b> <b>know</b> such words. Strother Martin later clarified that he felt the line was the kind that his character would very likely have heard or read from some [...] "pointy-headed intellectuals" [...] who had begun to infiltrate his character's world under the general rubric of a new, enlightened approach to incarceration. Some authors believe that the quotation was a metaphor for the ongoing Vietnam War conflict which was taking place during the filming, and others have applied it towards corporations and even teenagers. The quotation was listed at number 11 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 most memorable movie lines. An audio sample of the line is included in the Guns N' Roses songs [...] "Civil War" [...] and [...] "Madagascar." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Grey and Shepherd's fight was {{described}} by Buchman as having [...] "no more taboos", {{compared to the other}} story lines developed in the episode: [...] "Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We <b>might</b> <b>know</b> Derek will come back, but she doesn't." [...] The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed [...] "a milestone of sorts for Meredith", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing we wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be [...] "frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected" [...] for the audience.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, now seems to be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who <b>might</b> <b>know</b> it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press. [...] A review in Financial Times by Jerome Burne was also critical, and he commented that Taylor does not convey [...] "a clear enough message" [...] in the work.|$|E
500|$|Charness {{singled out}} the film's famous title number and states, [...] "it's a very kinetic moment, for {{though there is}} no {{technically}} accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which <b>might</b> <b>know</b> nothing kinesthetically of actual dance... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes {{place at the same time}} Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera knowhow to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon." [...] He also complimented Donen's direction in the [...] "Moses Supposes" [...] number, including [...] "certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another." [...] Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as [...] "integrated", he also states that [...] "in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn't go that far. In 'Moses Supposes', he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song." [...] Donen's Royal Wedding and Give A Girl A Break continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences, and Kelly used even more sophisticated animation in his film Invitation to Dance.|$|E
