25|$|Vespers {{begins with}} the singing or {{chanting}} of the opening versicles Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Alleluia. (O God, come to <b>my</b> <b>assistance.</b> O Lord, make haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As {{it was in the}} beginning, both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia.) From Septuagesima until Easter, Laus tibi Domine, Rex aeternae gloriae (Praise be to Thee O Lord, King of eternal glory) replaces Alleluia.|$|E

They asked that I release a statement expressing my admiration for Mr. Henley, along with <b>my</b> <b>assistance</b> pulling it off the web as much as possible. Shit's weird. Ain't this guy rich as fuck? Why sue the new guy? I didn't make a dime off that song. I released it for free. If anything I'm paying homage." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Silva's departure, Jayavira Bandara Mudali {{approached}} Pedro Lopes de Sousa {{and requested}} permission {{to let the}} empress marry his brother-in-law. (According to Baldaeus, Jayavira himself asked for permission to marry the empress.) But the Captain-General refused the proposal, saying {{he was unable to}} give consent without obtaining the prior approval of the emperor. He also raised the matter of Jayavira's not being of noble birth. Disappointed, Jayavira expressed his dissatisfaction: [...] "...you who are but a stranger have with <b>my</b> <b>assistance</b> accomplished all your schemes of ambition and now endeavor to trample me underfoot..." [...] But they ended their conversation on good terms, Sousa agreeing to consider the proposal on his return to Colombo.|$|E
2500|$|In 1827 {{the first}} school {{building}} was erected. It {{is still standing}} {{just west of the}} Presbyterian church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of Mansfield, PA. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver’s Point—now Lawrenceville—for fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after the adoption of the public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839-40. in the article already quoted from, he says: [...] "I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study in my school. In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with <b>my</b> <b>assistance.</b> In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{emperor of}} Blefuscu, having taken {{three days to}} consult, {{returned}} an answer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said, “that as for sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace. That, however, both their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had given orders to fit up, with <b>my</b> own <b>assistance</b> and direction; and he hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable an encumbrance.” ...|$|R

All sounds had ceased, but, with a feeling of such terror as even these awful events had not inspired, I now saw the same mysterious movement of the wild oats prolonging itself from the trampled area about the prostrate man toward the edge of a wood. It was only when it had reached the wood that I was able to withdraw my eyes and look at my companion. He was dead." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{attempted}} {{to persuade him}} of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to meet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards dressing, and I had to call for <b>my</b> master's <b>assistance</b> in coaxing him out of bed. The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive assurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy would visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I invented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way. The pure heather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny, relieved his despondency after a while. He began to put questions concerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and liveliness.|$|R
