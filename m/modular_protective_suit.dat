40|$|A suitlock {{assembly}} that comprises a docking fixture and mechanism {{has been}} invented to facilitate and accelerate {{donning and doffing}} of a sealed <b>protective</b> <b>suit</b> and/or to enable ingress and egress between the <b>protective</b> <b>suit</b> and a sealed vessel. The sealed <b>protective</b> <b>suit</b> could be a space suit, {{in which case the}} sealed vessel could be a spacecraft. Alternatively, the sealed suit could be an environmental <b>protective</b> <b>suit</b> of a type worn on Earth during cleanup of a hazardous-material site, in which case the sealed vessel could be a vehicle equipped to maintain a safe interior environment for workers in transit to and from the site. Figure 1 depicts a typical situation in which several crewmembers are working inside such a vehicle, one is working outside in a <b>protective</b> <b>suit,</b> and one is donning or doffing a <b>protective</b> <b>suit</b> while holding onto an overhead bar for support...|$|R

40|$|An organic Phase Change Material (PCM) {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} absorb and release large quantity of latent heat during a phase change process over a certain temperature range. This paper presents results related to thermo-physiological efficiency of special underwear with organic PCM integrated in textile through microencapsulation process. The efficiency of PCM underwear was tested through physiological examinations in simulated high-temperature conditions, where test-subjects were voluntarily exposed to heat stress tests wearing NBC <b>protective</b> <b>suit</b> with PCM underwear (option "THERM") and without it (option "NoTHERM"). It can be concluded that wearing a PCM textile clothes under NBC <b>protective</b> <b>suit,</b> during physical activity in high-tempearture conditions, reduces sweating and alleviates heat stress manifested by increased core and skin temperature and heart rate values.
