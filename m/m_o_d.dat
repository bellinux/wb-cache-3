It demonstrates the influence of liquid velocity profiles on temperature and microwave energy dissipation in a microwave integrated milli reactor-heat exchanger. Horizontal cocurrent flow of a strong microwave absorbing reaction mixture (ethanol¿+¿acetic acid, molar ratio 5 : 1) and a microwave transparent coolant (toluene) was established in a Teflon supported quartz tube (i. d. : 3 × 10 - 3 <b>m</b> and <b>o.</b> <b>d.</b> : 4 × 10 - 3 m) and shell (i. d. : 7 × 10 - 3 <b>m</b> and <b>o.</b> <b>d.</b> : 9 × 10 - 3 m), respectively. Modeling showed that the temperature rise of the highly microwave absorbing reaction mixture was up to four times higher in the almost stagnant liquid at the reactor walls than in the bulk liquid. The coolant flow was ineffective in controlling the outlet reaction mixture temperature. However, at high flow rates it limits the overheating of the stagnant liquid film of the reaction mixture at the reactor walls. It was also found that the stagnant layer around a fiber optic temperature probe, when inserted {{from the direction of the}} flow, resulted in much higher temperatures than the bulk liquid. This was not the case when the probe was inserted from the opposite direction. The experimental validations of these modeling results proved that the temperature profiles depend more on the reaction mixture velocity profiles than on the microwave energy dissipation/electric field intensity. Thus, in flow synthesis, particularly where a focused microwave field is applied over a small tubular flow reactor, it is very important to understand the large (direct/indirect) influence of reactor internals on the microwave heating process...|$|R

40|$|Many {{processes}} such as machining, injection-moulding and metal-forming {{are usually}} operated by hydraulic servo-systems. The dynamic characteristics of these systems are complex and highly non-linear and are often subjected to the uncertain external dis-turbances associated with the processes.

40|$|In this paper, the {{vibration}} control philosophy and optimal design of passive tuned mass dampers (PTMDs) for a multi-degree-of-freedom (<b>m.</b> <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.) structure are presented. In order {{to prove the}} effectiveness of PTMD, the modal properties of a <b>m.</b> <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. building with an optimal PTMD are identified using a specified system identification procedure. The difference in the modal properties between a structure with and without PTMD determines the PTMD vibration control performance. An extended random decrement method, which considers the measurement correlation, was first employed to reduce the measured dynamic responses of the building. The Ibrahim time domain technique was then applied to calculate the modal frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes based on only a few floor response measurements. To obtain the complete mode shapes, an interpolation method was developed to estimate the mode shape values for the locations without measurements. The seismic responses at floors with and without measurements were also calculated. Numerical results throughout a five-storey building under ambient random excitations demonstrated that the proposed system identification techniques are {{able to identify the}} dominant modal parameters of the system accurately, even with high closed-space frequencies and noise contamination.

40|$|Key {{non-linear}} sti!ness characterization {{issues of}} rubber isolators are clari"ed, and a process is proposed that includes experiments in single- and multi-degree-of-freedom con"gurations while di!erent types of excitations are applied. Consequently, important characteristics, via experimental and analytical studies of three isolators, emerge {{that might not}} have been revealed in traditional non-resonant testing methods. First, static sti!ness experiments are conducted to measure time-invariant load}de#ection curves and in#uences from rubber durometer, isolator geometry and non-linear behavior on the dynamic-to-static sti!ness ratio are illustrated. Next, dynamic excitations under random, frequency-sweep and "xed-frequency are employed to investigate how the behavior of each isolator is in#uenced by type of excitation. Also, the non-linear dynamic sti!ness of each isolator is quanti"ed in both single- and multi-degree-of-freedom con"gurations. E!ects of isolator non-linearities on the e!ective vibration modes of the multi-degree-of-freedom (<b>m.</b> <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.) experimental con"guration are shown to be distributed di!erently for each isolator, yet some correlation is found with the single-degree-of-freedom (s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.) experiment. For analytical characterization, the continuous system theory is used to develop a quasi-linear representation of the <b>m.</b> <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. experimental con"guration. Isolator dynamic properties determined from the s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. experiment are used in this model.

Mapping of glacial landforms involved study of aerial photographs and subsequent field work. Evidence was found {{for the existence of}} two ice caps and five separate coire glaciers during the Loch Lomond Readvance, their various termini being represented today by clear lateral and end moraines at fourteen out of twenty-five locations. In nine cases, multiple lateral and/or end moraines suggest fluctuation of these ice margins during the Stadial maximum. An earlier stage of glaciation not related to the Late-Devensian ice-sheet maximum is represented by a single moraine and glacial striae. It is believed that this substage probably occurred between 18, 000 and 14, 000 years ago. Former sea-level changes were investigated by accurate mapping and instrumental levelling of raised coastal features. Three major periods of formation were identified :- 1. A pre-glacial or interglacial stage, evidenced by a highlevel rock platform at 32 to 37 m O. D.; 2.

Motivated by the recent result in [3], we propose a new achievable scheme in which cooperative jamming signals span the entire space of the eavesdropper, but are not exactly aligned with the information symbols. We show that this scheme achieves the same secure <b>M</b> <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of in [1], [2] but does not require any eavesdroppe...|$|R
40|$|Exper imenta l des ign {{techniques}} {{are used to}} opt imize the condi t ions of supercri t ical f luid extract ion (SFE) of 29 c <b>o</b> <b>m</b> p <b>o</b> u n <b>d</b> s, including polycycl ic aromat ic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlor ine pest icides f rom a l iquid-sol id extract ion cartr idge. These c <b>o</b> <b>m</b> p <b>o</b> u n <b>d</b> s are representat ive of larger c lasses of c <b>o</b> <b>m</b> p <b>o</b> u n <b>d</b> s of envi ronmenta l concern. A statistical 2 3 factorial exper imental design is initially per formed to study {{the relative importance of}} three SFE var iables: pressure, temperature, and extract ion t ime. The pressure has a statistically signif icant effect on the recovery of all c <b>o</b> <b>m</b> p <b>o</b> u n <b>d</b> s studied. The next most influential var iable is length of extract ion t ime, which has a statistically signif icant effect on the recovery of s <b>o</b> <b>m</b> e of the PAHs. The temperature is the least influential factor. Fol lowing the factorial des ign, a variable-size s implex opt imizat ion is used to demonst ra te that the SFE condi t ions can be opt imized to obta in the best overal l recoveries of the c <b>o</b> <b>m</b> p <b>o</b> u n <b>d</b> s studied. For those analytes demonstrat ing low recoveries in pure supercri t ical carbon dioxide (C O 2), a methanol modif ier is added to improve recoveries. By adding an appropr iate amount of methanol into the cartr idge, those analytes can be quanti tat ively recovered...|$|R
