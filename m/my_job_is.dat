500|$|In an {{interview}} with Metro Silicon Valley, Pete Postlethwaite quoted Bryan Singer as saying that all the characters are Söze. When asked point blank whether his character is Söze, Postlethwaite said, [...] "Who knows? Nobody knows. That's what's good about The Usual Suspects." [...] Spacey has also been evasive about his character's true identity. In {{an interview}} with Total Film, he said, [...] "That's for the audience to decide. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> {{to show up and}} do a part – I don't own the audience's imagination." [...] Singer said the film is ambiguous about most of the character's details, but the fax sent {{at the end of the}} film proves in his mind that Kint is Söze.|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|In mid-September, a video {{surfaced}} of Romney speaking {{before a}} group of supporters in which he stated that 47percent of the nation pays no income tax, are dependent on the federal government, see themselves as victims, and will support President Obama unconditionally. Romney went on to say: [...] "And so <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> {{not to worry about}} those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." [...] After facing criticism about the tone and accuracy of these comments, he at first characterized them as [...] "inelegantly stated", then {{a couple of weeks later}} commented: [...] "I said something that's just completely wrong." [...] Exit polls published following the election showed that voters never saw Romney as someone who cared about people like them.|$|E

500|$|A superhero who is {{commissioned}} by the U.S. government as a black-ops specialist. When reading the comic for the part, Morgan stopped when he saw his character was killed off three pages in. When telling his agent {{he did not want}} the part, he was told to continue reading it and find out how important his character was. Morgan found the role a challenge, explaining, [...] "For some reason, in reading the novel, you don't hate this guy even though he does things that are unmentionable. [...] <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to kind of make that translate, so as a viewer you end up not making excuses to like him, but you don't hate him like you should for doing the things that he does." [...] Of his casting, Snyder said, [...] "It's hard to find a man's man in Hollywood. It just is. And Jeffrey came in and was grumpy and cool and grizzled, and I was, like, 'OK, Jeffrey is perfect!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|Cinema Blend Amanda Krill said Stevens' wig {{looked like}} a [...] "Stepford Wives wig", adding: [...] "Everyone {{has a hard time}} not looking at it. She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Torres {{was called}} up for Spain's Euro 2008 squad, where {{he set up}} Villa to score Spain's first goal of the tournament {{in the first game}} in the group stage against Russia. Torres came under {{criticism}} for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager Luis Aragonés after being substituted off. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually [...] "irritated with himself". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2–1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1–0 victory. He said, [...] "It's just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were here and we won. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world." [...] He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner David Villa in the Team of the Tournament.|$|E

The panel decided to allow children a hand in the selection of the mascot for the first time at an Olympic Games. Torishima said, [...] "Kids' minds work differently from adults'. As a member of the panel, I like to think <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to help bridge that gap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, in a sense," [...] Festing dryly agreed. [...] "It {{looks as}} if <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to get tired and wet and dirty while others got the dollars; but it's a job with {{different}} sides.

2500|$|Shortly after Miller's {{article was}} published, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld {{appeared}} {{on television and}} pointed to Miller's story in support of their position. As summarized by the New York Review of Books, [...] "in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration’s case for war, and the Times played a critical part in legitimizing it." [...] Miller later said of the controversy y job isn't to assess the government's information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to tell readers of The New York Times what the government thought about Iraq's arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|A segment {{aired on}} the March 29, 2009, edition of 60 Minutes, [...] "The Internet Is Infected", {{featured}} {{an interview with}} Don Jackson, a data protection professional for SecureWorks. Jackson himself declares in the program that: [...] "A part of <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to know the enemy". However, during the interview, Jackson showed a photo of Finnish upper-level comprehensive school pupils and misidentified them as Russian hackers. In the photo, {{one of the children}} is wearing a jacket with the Coat of Arms of Finland on it. Another one is wearing a cap which clearly has the logo of Karjala, a Finnish brand of beer, on it. The principal of the school in Taivalkoski confirmed that the photo was taken at the school about five years before the program was broadcast.|$|E
2500|$|Blackman {{says that}} playing with Kravitz and playing jazz are {{different}}. [...] "My job with Lenny {{is a different}} thing. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to play a beat for hours, and make it feel good, and add some exciting fills and exciting colors, when it fits tastefully", Blackman says. [...] "My job in my band or in a creative situation is a totally different thing. We may start with a groove that feels great, I may play that for hours too, but I'm going to explore and expand and change that, play around with the rhythm and interject with the soloists." [...] "I like dance music and I like making the music feel good", says Blackman. [...] "To drive an audience of 100,000 into complete oblivion by playing a groove so strong ... I love doing that. I love the chance to show versatility." ...|$|E
5000|$|David Noonan {{explains}} {{the origins of}} the concept for the goliath race: [...] "It all started with a piece of concept art that looks very similar to the Races of Stone cover. <b>My</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> to write the chapter for [...] "the big guy."

2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long {{enough for me to}} tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Button's fourth-place finish, {{which was}} the fifth time in the season that he {{finished}} in the top four, he stated he did not compete to attempt to prove anything but was in the sport [...] "to do my job and <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to do the best job I can for myself and for the team and that's exactly what I did." [...] However, he was delighted at his battle with the Williams team, saying, [...] "It was a lot of fun. And then the battle with Kimi Raikkonen, going past him was mega – I really enjoyed that. We're not the best of friends but we battle hard but clean." [...] Alonso did not feel frustrated towards teammate Räikkönen over the pair's late-race battle for sixth place: [...] "The most important thing was not the battle with him, it was the battle with the other teams and we got some good points for Ferrari today. Even if I could have overtaken Kimi a little quicker I had to save a lot of fuel {{in the last couple of}} laps so a battle with Sebastian was never a possibility." [...] Räikkönen dismissed the battle as [...] "normal racing" [...] and felt the duel had not hindered his team because it made no difference for him or Ferrari, and no matter where he finished, the team would accumulate the same amount of points.|$|E
2500|$|The {{challenge}} of designing Belle and the Beast's costumes paled {{in comparison to}} the difficulty of creating the enchanted objects, a combination of intricate wiring, prosthetics and pyrotechnics. Scale was the most prominent [...] "obstacle" [...] for Hould-Ward's to overcome: [...] "The problem was the presentation of an actor as a life-sized teapot when the characters in the film were so little in comparison". Because the castle's enchanted staff is slowly transforming into objects, shown at various stages of transformation without ever completely becoming the objects themselves, Hould-Ward was required to create several different costumes for each character in order to depict the transformation as the show progresses. Meanwhile, the costume of Lumiere alone was built by a team of forty people, including a creator of the prosthetic candle, hair and Vacuform specialist; the pyrotechnician, man responsible for equipping the costume's pyro unit with butane and man operating the butane tank were each separate people. While transforming animation into real life, Hould-Ward also worked on incorporating the human body each costume, explaining, [...] "I wanted the reality of the real person rather than the fantasy of the object... The essence of <b>my</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to allow my real actors to take you to this fantastical place." [...] A system of wired frames was used to help the actors support their characters' heavy garments. Such elaborate costumes had never been designed for a Broadway production before. Cogsworth's costume features a fully functioning clock on his face. Meanwhile, Madame de la Grande Bouche was the production's most expensive costume.|$|E

And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding.
