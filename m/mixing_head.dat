When the rotate-speed of the <b>mixing</b> <b>head</b> is 3000 r/min, as feed speed of the <b>mixing</b> <b>head</b> is 15 µm / s and cutting output is 0. 1 mm,an influence area constituted with Fe-Al intermetallic compounds was produced between the coating of high-speed steel and Al substrate because of dynamic recovery and recrystallization. The Fe-Al intermetallic compounds can improve microhardness as hard strengthening phase. and the highest microhardness of the influence area achieved 600 HV...|$|E

40|$|Although {{treating}} {{molten alloy}} with high shear processing (HSP) can dramatically refine the microstructure of solidified aluminium alloys, {{it was also}} recently employed {{as part of an}} effective route to purification of contaminated aluminium alloy scrap. The key mechanisms of HSP include the dispersion of large aluminium oxide films and clusters into very fine oxide particles by the high shear rate, and the redistribution of bulk melt by the agitation. These fine oxides act as nucleation sites for iron-based intermetallic phases, the formation of which is a pre-cursor to purification of the alloy. Macroscopic flow features of HSP, such as flow rate and shear rate, influence its performance significantly. Simulation based on Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict key features of fluid flow during HSP in a static direct chill (DC) caster. It was found that the distribution of shear rate and mass flow rate is highly nonuniform in the caster, and only in the close vicinity of the <b>mixing</b> <b>head</b> is there a relatively high level of shear rate and effective melt agitation. Therefore, effective dispersion of oxide films and clusters, and resulting significant nucleation of the intermetallics and/or primary aluminium phase, can only occur near the <b>mixing</b> <b>head,</b> and not throughout the whole crucible. Confidence in the model validity was built, by comparison with post-solidification microstructures in a previous experiment with similar process parameters and geometry. ...|$|E

The research focues on the evolution mechanisms of α+β dual phase microstructure in stirred zone and the effects of processing parameters on structures hardness.

After <b>mixing</b> <b>head</b> leaves and the structure cools, the precipitated lamellar α phase is among and/or within-regions. Grain refining of α+β dual phase is obvious. The shortened α/β lamellar spacing distance may improve the strengthening effect of the α+β duplex phase and enhance the hardness of the stir zone. The increasing of the tool rotation speed could coarsen β-regions, while the increasing of the travel speed could help reduce the α phase ratio and generate needle-type Martensites...|$|E

40|$|Currently {{promising}} development {{direction of}} space propulsion engineering is to use, as spacecraft controls, low-thrust rocket engines (RDTM) on clean fuels, such as oxygen-methane. Modern RDTM {{are characterized by}} a lack regenerative cooling and pulse mode of operation, during which there is accumulation of heat energy {{to lead to the}} high thermal stress of RDTM structural elements. To get an idea about the thermal state of its elements, which further will reduce the number of fire tests is therefore necessary in the development phase of a new product. Accordingly, the aim of this work is the mathematical modeling and computational study of the thermal state of gaseous oxygen-methane propellant RDMT operating in pulse mode. In this paper we consider a model RDTM working on gaseous propellants oxygen-methane in pulse mode. To calculate the temperature field of the chamber wall of model RDMT under consideration is used the mathematical model of non-stationary heat conduction in a two-dimensional axisymmetric formulation that takes into account both the axial heat leakages and the nonstationary processes occurring inside the chamber during pulse operation of RDMT. As a result of numerical study of the thermal state of model RDMT, are obtained the temperature fields during engine operation based on convective, conductive, and radiative mechanisms of heat transfer from the combustion products to the wall. It is shown that the elements of flanges of combustion chamber of model RDMT act as heat sinks structural elements. Temperatures in the wall of the combustion chamber during the engine mode of operation are considered relatively low. Raised temperatures can also occur in the <b>mixing</b> <b>head</b> in the feeding area of the oxidant into the combustion chamber. During engine operation in the area forming the critical section, there is an intensive heating of a wall, which can result in its melting, which in turn will increase the minimum nozzle throat area and hence will change the operating conditions of engine. </p...|$|E
