40|$|Genomics Data Miner (GMine) is a {{user-friendly}} online {{software that}} allows non-experts to <b>mine,</b> <b>cluster</b> and compare multidimensional biomolecular datasets. Various powerful visualization techniques are provided, generating high quality figures {{that can be}} directly incorporated into scientific publications. Robust and comprehensive analyses are provided via {{a broad range of}} data-mining techniques, including univariate and multivariate statistical analysis, supervised learning, correlation networks, clustering and multivariable regression. The software has a focus on multivariate techniques, which can attribute variance in the measurements to multiple explanatory variables and confounders. Various normalization methods are provided. Extensive help pages and a tutorial are available via a wiki server. Using GMine we reanalyzed proteome microarray data of host antibody response against Plasmodium falciparum. Our results support the hypothesis that immunity to malaria is a higher-order phenomenon related to a pattern of responses and not attributable to any single antigen. We also analyzed gene expression across resting and activated T cells, identifying many immune-related genes with differential expression. This highlights both the plasticity of T cells and the operation of a hardwired activation program. These application examples demonstrate that GMine facilitates an accurate and in-depth analysis of complex molecular datasets, including genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics data...|$|E

40|$|This thesis proposes an {{intrusion}} detection system (IDS), which applies data <b>mining</b> <b>clustering</b> technique to wireless network data captured through hardware sensors for purposes of real time detection of anomalous behavior in wireless packets. The proposed wireless IDS system design approach involves real time pre-processing of sensor data using Local Sparsity Coefficient (LSC) outlier detection algorithm to assign anomaly scores to the connection records. Connection records with low anomaly scores are used as the initial starting points (centre positions) for building clusters. The algorithm continuously derives minimum deviation from the maximum distance of individual centre positions. New objects whose distances from the closest cluster are more than the minimum deviation are tagged as anomaly and moved to alert cluster. One major contribution of thesis is detection of MAC spoofing attacks by tracking sequence numbers, which ensures duplicate or spoofed (stolen) MAC addresses are not used in the network.

40|$|Abstract- Data {{clustering}} is {{an important}} task {{in the area of}} data <b>mining.</b> <b>Clustering</b> is the unsupervised classification of data items into homogeneous groups called clusters. Clustering methods partition a set of data items into clusters, such that items in the same cluster are more similar to each other than items in different clusters according to some defined criteria. Clustering algorithms are computationally intensive, particularly when they are used to analyze large amounts of data. With the development of information technology and computer science, high-capacity data appear in our lives. In order to help people analyzing and digging out useful information, the generation and application of data mining technology seem so significance.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{standardization}} of XML as an information exchange language over the net, {{a huge amount}} of information is formatted in XML documents. In order to analyze this information efficiently, decomposing the XML documents and storing them in relational tables is a popular practice. However, query processing becomes expensive since, in many cases, an excessive number of joins is required to recover information from the fragmented data. If a collection consists of documents with different structures (for example, they come from different DTDs), <b>mining</b> <b>clusters</b> in the documents could alleviate the fragmentation problem. We propose a hierarchical algorithm (S-GRACE) for clustering XML documents based on structural information in the data. The notion of structure graph (s-graph) is proposed, supporting a computationally efficient distance metric defined between documents and sets of documents. This simple metric yields our new clustering algorithm which is efficient and effective, compared to other approaches based on tree-edit distance. Experiments on real data show that our algorithm can discover clusters not easily identified by manual inspection.
