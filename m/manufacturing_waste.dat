40|$|The {{recovery}} and reuse of end-of-life GRP in an environmentally friendly, cost-effective manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the composites industry. In 2015 the global consumption of reinforcement grade E-glass fibre (GF) exceeded 5 million tons. Associated with this global GF consumption is the production of 0. 5 - 1 million tons of GF <b>manufacturing</b> <b>waste</b> most of which is landfilled. Furthermore, approximately 70 % of reinforcement GF is used to manufacture thermoset based composites (GRP) which also produces approximately 15 % <b>manufacturing</b> <b>waste.</b> Consequently it can be shown that there is actually sufficient GF available in current <b>manufacturing</b> <b>waste</b> and end-of-life GRP to meet approximately 50 % of the global demand for GF reinforcements. However, such GF and GRP materials (both end-of-life and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>waste)</b> are difficult to recycle in an efficient manner and have historically also been disposed of in landfills. Such landfilling is rapidly becoming untenable due to legislative and landfill pricing developments. A number of processes for recycling GRP are available or under development. However, nearly all options deliver recycled glass fibres (RGF) which are not cost-performance competitive due to the huge drop in performance of RGF compared to its original state. A breakthrough in the regeneration of RGF performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling GRP waste and end-of-life composites. This presentation will review the status of the ReCoVeR project which is focussed on enabling cost-effective regeneration of the performance and value of glass fibres obtained from thermal recycling of end-of-life GRP and GRP <b>manufacturing</b> <b>waste.</b> Highlights of our latest results will be presented with emphasis on our breakthrough treatments to regenerate the properties of thermally recycled glass fibres.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{effective}} methodology for implementing lean manufacturing strategies and a leanness evaluation metric using continuous performance measurement (CPM). Design/methodology/approach – Based on five lean principles, a systematic lean implementation methodology for manufacturing organizations has been proposed. A simplified leanness evaluation metric consisting of both efficiency and effectiveness attributes of manufacturing performance has been developed for continuous evaluation of lean implementation. A case study to validate the proposed methodology has been conducted and proposed CPM metric has been used to assess the manufacturing leanness. Findings – Proposed methodology is able to systematically identify <b>manufacturing</b> <b>wastes,</b> select appropriate lean tools, identify relevant performance indicators, achieve significant performance improvement and establish lean culture in the organization. Continuous performance measurement matrices in terms of efficiency and effectiveness are proved to be appropriate methods for continuous evaluation of lean performance. Research limitations/implications – Effectiveness of the method developed has been demonstrated by applying it in a real life assembly process. However, more tests/applications will be necessary to generalize the findings. Practical implications – Results show that applying the methods developed, managers can successfully identify and remove <b>manufacturing</b> <b>wastes</b> from their production processes. By improving process efficiency, they can optimize their resource allocations. Manufacturers now have a validated step by step methodology for successfully implementing lean strategies. Originality/value – According to the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first known study that proposed a systematic lean implementation methodology based on lean principles and continuous improvement techniques. Evaluation of performance improvement by lean strategies is a critical issue. This study develops a simplified leanness evaluation metric considering both efficiency and effectiveness attributes and integrates it with the lean implementation methodology...|$|R
