5|$|The {{central and}} {{southern}} section of the Peak District, where Carboniferous Limestone is found {{at or near the}} surface, is known as the White Peak in contrast to the northern Dark Peak and the South West Peak, which are characterised by <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> outcrops and broad swathes of moorland.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly <b>millstone</b> <b>grit.</b> Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|The early name, Bolton le Moors, {{described}} {{the position of}} the town amid the low hills {{on the edge of the}} West Pennine Moors southeast of Rivington Pike (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the River Croal flows in a southeasterly direction towards the River Irwell. The geological formation around Bolton consists of sandstones of the Carboniferous series and Coal Measures; in the northern part of Bolton the lower Coal Measures are mixed with underlying <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ballochmyle glyphs or motifs are {{carved on}} red sandstone, however {{they are found}} {{elsewhere}} on other sedimentary rocks such as <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grits,</b> {{as well as the}} harder igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granites and schists.|$|R
2500|$|Woodford forms a {{semi-rural area}} of mostly ribbon developments. The village has an open level aspect to it, {{most of the}} village is between [...] and [...] above mean sea level. This is due to being [...] west of the Red Rock Fault at Poynton where the <b>millstone</b> <b>grits</b> and coal {{measures}} of the Carboniferous period, made a [...] downfall, to be covered with glacial tills. The soils of Woodford consist of clay. It {{is close to the}} South Pennines and the Peak District. Forming the most southern point of Greater Manchester, the River Dean marks the border with Cheshire. To Woodford's north and northwest are the M60 and M56 motorways, providing road links to the rest of North West England.|$|R
6000|$|So {{much for}} the <b>millstone</b> <b>grits.</b> How long the {{deposition}} of sand went on, how long after it that second deposition of sands took place, which {{goes by the name}} of the [...] "gannister," [...] or lower coal- measures, we cannot tell. But it is clear, at least, that parts of that ancient sea were filling up and becoming dry land. For coal, or fossilised vegetable matter, becomes more and more common as we ascend in the series of beds; till at last, in the upper coal- measures, the enormous wealth of vegetation which grew, much of it, where it is now found, prove the existence of some such sheets of fertile and forest-clad lowland as I described in my last paper.|$|R
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including <b>millstone</b> <b>grit,</b> which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E
5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. <b>Millstone</b> <b>grit,</b> a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
50|$|Carboniferous {{deposits}} {{were laid}} down on and between large pre-existing land blocks and intervening troughs. The blocks {{are known as}} the Askrigg and Alston blocks. These upstanding areas and the troughs between were actively subsiding into shallow seas which {{were the result of}} a global rise in sea levels. These seas contained high levels of calcium carbonate and calcium forming fossils. There are areas of reef deposition around the blocks where the seas were temporarily shallower. The land mass was by now astride the equator. The bordering seas began to be periodically invaded by deltas formed by rivers flowing from the adjacent higher ground. The sand of the deltas became the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grits</b> of the Yorkshire Pennines. The climate then became humid and the delta areas started to support swamps and tropical rain forests. These deltas changed size and shape frequently and were regularly inundated by the sea. They would eventually form the numerous coal seams of the Coal Measures sandstones. The Variscan orogeny occurred {{towards the end of the}} Carboniferous period as the former supercontinents of Gondwanaland and Euramerica collided to form the single supercontinent of Pangea. The seas between the land masses were closed up and fold mountain ranges were formed along the closure line in many areas. The area of Britain was uplifted and fault lines developed.|$|R
5000|$|Open to {{the public}} most months of the year, the mill {{processes}} corn, wheat, rye, and barley, although only corn is ground on the primary <b>millstones.</b> Cornmeal and <b>grits</b> are the primary products, {{with much of the}} product wholesaled to numerous business in the region to help promote the growing movement towards minimally-processed local foods. On March 11, 2017, the Southeastern Massachusetts Agricultural Partnership held [...] "the first state-wide grain gathering in the 21st century" [...] at the Plimoth Grist Mill.|$|R
5|$|Earl Thomas {{granted the}} manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert {{obtained}} a licence to crenellate from Edward II {{in order to}} fortify the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry {{on the site of}} what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show £1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313–14, of which £548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock, <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit.</b> This is a coarsely grained sandstone which can be worked to produce good-quality ashlar. The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Historically quarried for <b>millstone</b> <b>grit,</b> Tegg's Nose now {{includes}} {{a range of}} environments including moorland, meadow, farmland, broadleaved woodland and is rich in wildlife. Recreational uses of the area include walking, orienteering, horse riding, fell running, cycling, mountain biking, rock climbing, sledging and fishing.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of Carboniferous Limestone {{was followed by}} the deposition of dark marine shales, siltstones and coarse sandstones of the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit,</b> notably in the area later uplifted to form the Pennine anticline. This sequence {{can be seen in the}} Yorkshire Dales with Ingleborough protruding up above the carboniferous limestone landscape below.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground beneath}} {{the city is}} formed from Carboniferous strata of the Middle Pennine Coal Measures Group—a suite of sandstones, mudstones and coal seams which {{generally}} dip moderately eastwards. To {{the west of the}} city are the Upper Pennine Coal Measures and further west again the sandstones and mudstones of the Stainmore Formation, the local equivalent of the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit.</b>|$|E
25|$|Underlying {{the upper}} reaches of the Trent, are {{formations}} of <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> and Carboniferous Coal Measures which include layers of sandstones, marls and coal seams. The river crosses a band of Triassic Sherwood sandstone at Sandon, and it meets the same sandstone again as it flows beside Cannock Chase, between Great Haywood and Armitage, there is also another outcrop between Weston-on-Trent and King's Mill.|$|E
25|$|The geology of {{the area}} {{consists}} of thick sandstones and marls formed in desert conditions in the Triassic period, some 250 million years ago, and thin-bedded sandstones and shales formed 300million {{years ago in the}} Carboniferous period. Most of Britain at this time was a huge delta carrying vast amounts of sediment. These belong to the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> formation which makes up much of the Peak District.|$|E
25|$|The dales are 'U' and 'V' shaped valleys, {{the former}} {{enlarged}} and shaped by glaciers, {{mainly in the}} most recent Devensian ice age. The underlying rock is mainly Carboniferous Limestone, which results in a large areas of karst topography, in places overlain with shale and sandstone and topped with <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit,</b> although to the north and west of the Dent Fault the hills are formed from older Silurian and Ordovician rocks.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the Blackburn area yields {{numerous}} resources which underpinned {{its development}} as a centre of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution. Mineable coal seams have been used since the mid-late 16thcentury. The Coal Measures in the area overlie the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> which has been quarried {{in the past for}} millstones and, along with local limestone deposits, used as a construction material for roads and buildings. In addition, there were deposits of iron ore in the Furness and Ulverston districts.|$|E
25|$|To {{construct}} the canal, {{the line of}} the tunnel was ranged over the hill and then fifteen vertical shafts were sunk into the ground. It was from these that heads were driven on the canal line. A major problem was the change in the rock type which ranged from soft earth to <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit.</b> The construction site was also subject to flooding regularly, a problem which was overcome by the construction of steam engines to operate the pumps. Stoves were installed at the bottom of upcast pipes to overcome the problem of ventilation.|$|E
25|$|Allestree Hall is a 19th-century former {{country house}} {{situated}} in Allestree Park. It is a Grade II* listed building made of <b>millstone</b> <b>grit</b> from Derwent bank. The house begun by Bache Thornhill {{was completed by}} John Giradot (High Sheriff of Derbyshire) with three storeys and five bays, the central three bowed with an ionic columned porch. Since the 1980s the hall has been unoccupied, and {{was included in the}} English Heritage at Risk Register 2010, which states that the internal condition of the building is poor but fair overall. The city and English Heritage are looking to find a suitable scheme to enable it's redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|Directly beneath Glossop lie {{areas of}} Carboniferous <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit,</b> shales and sandstone. Glossop {{is on the}} edge of the Peak District Dome, at the {{southern}} edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the peaty soils of the moors thus are acid (pH5.5–7.0); this means the instream wildlife is dependent on food sources from outside the channel.|$|E
500|$|The {{underlying}} geology is <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> overlaid with coal measures. Gritstone was quarried {{for building}} {{stone in the}} area. Around Rivington are chalybeate springs and in Dean Wood is a waterfall with a descent of [...]|$|E
500|$|Oldham's {{topography}} is characterised by its rugged, elevated Pennine terrain. It has {{an area of}} [...] The geology of Oldham {{is represented}} by the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> and Coal Measures series of rocks. The River Beal, flowing northwards, forms the boundary between Oldham on one side and Royton and Shaw and Crompton on the other.|$|E
500|$|Sheffield's situation—amongst fast-flowing {{rivers and}} streams {{surrounded}} by hills containing raw materials such as coal, iron ore, ganister, and <b>millstone</b> <b>grit</b> for grindstones—made it an ideal place for water-powered industries to develop. Water wheels were often built for the milling of corn, but many were converted to the manufacture of blades. As early as the 14th century Sheffield was noted {{for the production of}} knives: ...|$|E
500|$|The Great Stone, {{which gave}} {{its name to}} the Great Stone Road, where it was located until being moved in 1925, is one of Stretford's most easily {{overlooked}} landmarks. The stone is composed of <b>millstone</b> <b>grit</b> and was probably deposited as a glacial erratic. It is rectangular in shape, about [...] wide, [...] deep, and [...] tall, with two [...] deep rectangular slots cut into its upper surface.|$|E
500|$|The general {{geological}} {{structure of}} the Peak District {{is that of a}} broad dome, whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded. [...] Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the top off the dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins, Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> outcropping between them. The southern edge of the dome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age though they barely impinge on the National Park.|$|E
500|$|The River Irwell {{catchment}} area {{extends from the}} moors above Bacup to the Manchester Ship Canal. The climate of the {{catchment area}} is wetter than the UK average, with rainfall of [...] per annum compared to [...] per annum, and the rivers quickly respond to rainfall. The topography varies considerably, with the upper reaches dominated by the Pennine moors {{at an altitude of}} between [...] and [...] AOD and the bottom of the catchment consisting of relatively flat land, which lies between [...] and [...] AOD. The watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys, which contributes to high rates of run-off, as does the underlying solid geology. This comprises Lower Coal Measures overlying <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit,</b> both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water. The <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> is, in turn, underlain by limestone rocks from the lower Carboniferous period. [...] The surface deposits comprise thick peat in the upper reaches, with glacial boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel in the lower parts. The sand and gravel are also classified as a minor aquifer, whilst the boulder clay is a non-aquifer. The higher, steeper slopes of {{the upper part of the}} catchment provide a large source of erodible material and debris which is transported downstream to the lower, flatter parts of the catchment. Where the channel is constricted, this material is then deposited and can contribute to a reduction in channel capacity.|$|E
500|$|Rochdale Town Hall is [...] wide, [...] deep, and {{is faced}} with <b>millstone</b> <b>grit</b> quarried from Blackstone Edge and Todmorden. Although now {{blackened}} by industrial pollution, the building {{has been described as}} a [...] "rich example of domestic Gothic architecture". Naturalistic carved foliage on the exterior recalls the style of Southwell Minster, and the architecture is influenced by Perpendicular Period and medieval town halls of continental Europe. [...] The building has been likened to Manchester Town Hall, Manchester Assize Courts, the Royal Courts of Justice, and St Pancras railway station, all products of the Gothic Revival architectural movement. [...] The stained glass windows, some of which were designed by William Morris, have been described as [...] "the finest modern examples of their kind". At each end of the frontage is an octagonal staircase.|$|E
500|$|The river then {{passes through}} Avon Valley Country Park and past Stidham Farm, another SSSI that {{contains}} Pleistocene terrace-gravels of the river. A depth {{of at least}} [...] of sandy gravels are recorded, consisting mainly of limestone clasts, but also with <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit,</b> Pennant Sandstone, flint, and chert clasts. The river passes under the old railway line that now forms the Avon Valley Railway, a [...] heritage railway, before reaching Swineford Lock. Here, between 1709 and 1859, there was an active brass and copper industry served by the river, which also provided water power for the cloth industry. The remains of Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925, are next to Saltford Lock. The lock was opened in 1727 but destroyed by rival coal dealers in 1738, to prevent the river being used for transportation.|$|E
500|$|The Avon Gorge {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because it supports some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams. Other notable plants include Bristol Rock-cress, Bristol onion, Spiked Speedwell, Autumn Squill and Honewort. Other areas along the river which have this designation include Bickley Wood, Cleeve Wood, Hanham for its large population of Bath Asparagus (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum). Stidham Farm near Keynsham contains at least At least [...] of Pleistocene terrace-gravels, consisting of limestone clasts mainly, but also with <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit,</b> Pennant Sandstone, flint and chert clasts. The site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area, and of the terrace stratigraphy, particularly as {{it is one of}} only two accessible terrace deposits {{in this part of the}} Avon valley. Newton St Loe SSSI is also listed for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon. In conjunction with other sites within the wider area, they have aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England.|$|E
500|$|The body of {{the church}} is {{constructed}} in yellow sandstone ashlar, and the tower in <b>millstone</b> <b>grit,</b> an unusual material for churches in Cheshire. The architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor draws attention to the crispness of the details of the stonework in the tower 500years after it was carved, compared to the sandstone, which is prone to weathering. The roof is metal. The church incorporates elements of Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular architecture. The overall plan is that of a trapezium; the west end is [...] wider than the east. The {{body of the}} church consists of a seven-bay nave and chancel with no structural division, and north and south aisles. The aisles are rectangular, thus the narrowing takes place entirely within the nave and chancel. The west end of the nave, between the piers (columns) of the arcades, is [...] wide. This is exceptionally wide for a parish church, and slightly wider than the nave of Chester Cathedral. The aisles extend along the sides of the chancel, forming north and south chapels. The tower stands {{to the north of the}} west bay of the body of the church, and is joined to it by a short passage with a porch on its east side. There are also porches on the west and south sides of the church.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of the Oldham Metropolitan Borough, where the industrial architecture was generally constructed from Accrington redbrick, Saddleworth's textiles mills and supporting infrastructure was made from the local <b>millstone</b> <b>grit.</b> This is in keeping with other settlements amongst the [...] southwest Pennines, such as Milnrow near Rochdale.|$|E
2500|$|The River Don {{rises in}} the Peak District, on Great Grains Moss, a <b>millstone</b> <b>grit</b> moorland area between [...] above sea level. A series of small streams, {{including}} Great Grains and Black Grough join up, and within [...] enter Winscar Reservoir. Reaps Dyke rises within [...] of the source, and flows in a semicircle to the north, through Snailsden reservoir and Harden reservoir, to flow into another arm of Winscar reservoir. Just [...] from the source, Withens Brook rises, but flows westwards, to supply the reservoirs of Longdendale {{and the people of}} Manchester. To the south of Winscar reservoir, other streams supply Upper Windleden and Lower Windleden reservoirs.|$|E
2500|$|The River Don, {{together}} with its main tributaries, the River Rother and the River Dearne, form a river {{system with a}} catchment of , which held a population of around 1.4million in 1997. Much of the region has an underlying geology of carboniferous rocks, containing coal measures, which have resulted in pollution of the river system where the coal has been mined. The headwaters rise on the moorlands of the Pennines, where the rocks are largely <b>millstone</b> <b>grit,</b> while the lower reaches pass through areas of alluvial and glacial material, up to [...] thick, which lies on top of strata of Magensian limestone and Sherwood sandstone.|$|E
2500|$|The town {{straddles}} the Red Rock Fault. Its [...] downthrow {{to the west}} brings the Permo-Triassic sandstones and mudstones of the Cheshire Plain up against the <b>Millstone</b> <b>Grit</b> and shales of the Peak District. To the immediate east of the fault are the coal measures of the Carboniferous period which, unlike those in the Lancashire Coalfield, are missing the top layers. Here we find outcrops of the Middle Coal Measures. Coal from these strata, particularly the Four Foot Mine (or seam), the Five Foot Mine and the Accommodation Mine, was mined in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century. The lower ground, including most of Poynton, is covered by glacial till left by the retreating ice sheet {{at the close of the}} last ice age.|$|E
