5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank <b>microphone</b> called the Superstar Celebrity <b>Microphone</b> {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the <b>microphone,</b> but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} songs on Desolate North one was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home. He has said how this was {{the most difficult part of}} the recording. As it happened, Anderson misplaced his <b>microphone</b> stand and so recorded those two songs with the <b>microphone</b> tucked under his chin. Despite the hindrance, Anderson claimed that the <b>microphone</b> picked up everything, and he was happy with the result.|$|E

5|$|Elgar {{has been}} {{described}} as the first composer to take the gramophone seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings of his works.

50|$|As a {{practical}} matter, phantom powering allows the same two-conductor shielded cables {{to be used}} for both dynamic <b>microphones</b> and condenser <b>microphones,</b> while being harmless to balanced <b>microphones</b> that aren't designed to consume it, since the circuit balance prevents any substantial DC from flowing through the output circuit of those <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
40|$|Test {{recordings}} {{can facilitate}} {{evaluation of a}} <b>microphone's</b> characteristics but there is currently no standard or experimentally validated method for making recordings to compare the perceptual characteristics of <b>microphones.</b> This paper evaluates previously used recording methods, concluding that, of these, the most appropriate approach is to record multiple <b>microphones</b> simultaneously. However, perceived differences between recordings made with <b>microphones</b> in a multi-microphone array {{might be due to}} (i) the characteristics of the <b>microphones</b> and/or (ii) the different locations of the <b>microphones.</b> Listening tests determined the maximum acceptable size of a multi-microphone array to be 150 mm in diameter, but the diameter must be reduced to no more than 100 mm if the <b>microphones</b> to be compared are perceptually very similar...|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB <b>Microphone</b> and the Xbox Live <b>microphone</b> feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} {{using the}} time-frequency phase information of two <b>microphones</b> is proposed to estimate an ideal timefrequency mask using time-delay-of-arrival (TDOA) {{of the signal}} of interest. At a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB, the proposed technique using two <b>microphones</b> achieves a digit recognition rate (average over 5 speakers, each speaking 20 - 30 digits) of 71 %. In contrast, delayand-sum beamforming only achieves a 40 % recognition rate with two <b>microphones</b> and 60 % with four <b>microphones.</b> Superdirective beamforming achieves a 44 % recognition rate with two <b>microphones</b> and 65 % with four <b>microphones.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|The second {{show was}} widely {{acknowledged}} as {{superior to the}} afternoon performance, although Village Voice reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set {{with a lack of}} respect.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a <b>microphone</b> positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the <b>microphone</b> stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading to a shot of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E
