5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, {{a popular}} new trend was {{so-called}} Eurodance music and this style also had Finnish followers, {{many of which}} however are today quite forgotten. A couple of bands also wrote their lyrics in English, but didn't <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the international music market. To mention few artists, there were Hausmylly, Aikakone and Movetron.|$|E

Differences of opinion and other factors led to the break-up of the original Puddle of Mudd by early 1999, leaving Scantlin as the only original member.

25|$|A modest ratings success, KITS {{fought off}} {{competition}} from the legendary AM CHR station, KFRC (which changed format to big bands in 1986), as well as KMEL-FM, which had switched from album-oriented rock to CHR in 1984. 105 KITS was, for a while, {{the darling of the}} Jet Set; daily visits were common from movie celebrities such as Bette Midler, Tom Cruise, Pat Morita, George Takei, Anthony Perkins and others. The celebs didn't usually <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the air, but they toured the studios in San Francisco's Merchandise Mart just to see what the industry buzz was all about.|$|E

25|$|The couple {{agreed to}} share {{custody of their}} {{daughter}} and Priscilla was awarded an outright cash payment of $725,000 as well as spousal support, child support, 5% of Elvis' new publishing companies and half the income {{from the sale of}} their Beverly Hills home. Originally the couple had agreed upon a much smaller settlement; a $100,000 lump payment, $1,000 a month spousal support, and $500 a month child support. Priscilla was keen to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> her own and prove that her marriage to Elvis was not about money. However, soon afterwards, her new lawyers had persuaded her to up her demands, pointing out that a star of Elvis' stature could easily afford more for his former wife and child.|$|E

On the next drive by Texas Tech, Graham Harrell's pass was intercepted by Uche Anyanwu. The next Nevada drive stalled on a three-and-out. Nevada was forced to punt to Eric Morris who took it 86 yards for a touchdown, giving the Red Raiders the lead, 7–3.

25|$|Benoit and Dean Malenko won the ECW World Tag Team Championship from Sabu and The Tazmaniac in February 1995, Benoit's first American title. After winning, {{they were}} {{initiated}} into the Triple Threat stable, led by ECW World Heavyweight Champion, Shane Douglas, as Douglas's attempt {{to recreate the}} Four Horsemen, as the three-man contingency held {{all three of the}} ECW championships at the time (Malenko also held the ECW World Television Championship at the time). The team lost the championship to The Public Enemy that April at ECW Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with The Steiner Brothers and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> time, so Benoit left as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States. He toured Japan until WCW called.|$|E
