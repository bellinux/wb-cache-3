This 3rd-century Chinese text speaks of the Japanese drinking and dancing. Alcoholic beverages (酒) are mentioned several times in the Kojiki, Japan's first written history, which was compilled in 712. Bamforth (2005) places the probable origin of true sake (which is made from rice, water, and kōji mold ( [...] , Aspergillus oryzae) in the Nara period (710-794). In the Heian period, sake was used for religious ceremonies, court festivals, and drinking games. Sake production was a government monopoly for a long time, but in the 10th century, temples and shrines began to brew sake, and they became the main centers of production for the next 500 years. The Tamon-in Diary, written by abbots of Tamon-in (temple) from 1478 to 1618, records many details of brewing in the temple. The diary shows that pasteurization and the process of adding ingredients to the <b>main</b> <b>fermentation</b> mash in three stages were established practices by that time. In the 16th century, the technique of distillation was introduced into the Kyushu district from Ryukyu. The brewing of shōchū, called [...] "Imo—sake" [...] started, and was sold at the central market in Kyoto.|$|E
50|$|Inbicon {{utilizes}} a hydrothermal pretreatment process {{after the}} mechanical conditioning of the feedstock. The premise {{of this process}} is to produce a fibre fraction and a liquid fraction through an extraction using hot water. In the fibre fraction this process achieves greater than 80% of the lignin present in the initial feedstock. Whereas the liquid fraction contains: C5 sugars, alkali chlorides and fermentation inhibitors. The <b>main</b> <b>fermentation</b> inhibitor present is acetic acid. However, the fermentation inhibitors can later be removed through detoxification with NH3 at a feasible cost. Since this pretreatment process does not use acids or bases and only water it eliminates the need to extract pretreatment chemicals once completed.During the initial step of the hydrothermal pretreatment process the feedstock is soaked and simultaneously placed in temperatures of up to 100 °C and ambient pressure. This allows for the extraction of air present and saturates the feedstock with water. The next step entails a pressurized treatment at elevated temperatures in the range of 170 to 230 °C through the addition of hot water or steam for approximately 5-15 minutes. This pressurized treatment can be repeated at altered temperatures and pressures in different zones increasing each subsequent time, therefore, labeled as a counter-current process. The steam released during the hydrothermal pre-treatment process is collected and reused in downstream evaporation processes. Throughout the hydrothermal pretreatment, there are acids formed that causes the fibre fraction to be nearly neutral in pH. The main benefit of this is that the pH will have to barely be adjusted for enzymatic liquefaction.|$|E

Representative homolactic LAB genera include Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, and group I lactobacilli.|$|R
40|$|Published by Elsevier {{on behalf}} of the Federation of European Microbiological SocietiesEthanol and acetic acid, at {{concentrations}} which may occur during wine-making, inhibited the transport of ι-malic acid in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The inhibition was non-competitive, the decrease of the maximum initial velocity following exponential kinetics. Glucose transport was not significantly affected either by ethanol (up to 13 %, w/v) or by acetic acid (up to 1. 5 %, w/v). The uptake of labelled acetic acid followed simple diffusion kinetics, indicating that a carrier was not involved in its transport. Therefore, the undissociated acid appears to be the only form that enters the cells and is probably responsible for the toxic effects.
