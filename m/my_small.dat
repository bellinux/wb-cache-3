500|$|Stoddart himself outspoken about Modernism, and its {{contemporary}} {{failures and}} historical misunderstandings, without hesitation, {{makes clear that}} his work stems from a Modernism born in neo-classicism, [...] "And yet, after having said all this about Modernism, I consider myself a Modernist – but {{in the context of}} a vast application of the term extending miles beyond the pokey wee official area to which usually it is confined. For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in <b>my</b> <b>small</b> way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{explicitly}} denounced Taylor in {{an exclusive}} interview with Beverly Deepe published in the New York Herald Tribune on December23, saying [...] "if Taylor did not act more intelligently, Southeast Asia would be lost" [...] and that the US could not expect to succeed by modelling South Vietnam on American norms. Khánh said Taylor and the US would need to be [...] "more practical and not have a dream of having Vietnam be an image of the United States, because the way of life and people are entirely different." [...] He added that Taylor's [...] "attitude during the last 48 hours—as far as <b>my</b> <b>small</b> head is concerned—has been beyond imagination". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Khánh said they were [...] "exploited by counter-revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest." [...] Khánh also threatened to divulge the content of his discussion with Taylor, saying [...] "One day I hope to tell the Vietnamese people and the American people about this...It is a pity because Gen. Taylor is not serving his country well." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to <b>my</b> <b>small</b> stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blishen and Garfield {{began work}} on The God Beneath the Sea after {{discovering}} that Greek mythology had had similar impacts on them as primary school children. In Blishen's words, [...] "these stories seemed to illuminate, to make clear, {{what was going on}} around me in <b>my</b> <b>small</b> and unimportant life. They were about love ... They were about the desire for power, about jealousy, about triumph and great defeat." [...] Garfield suggested they should [...] "write the stories for today's children" [...] and remove the [...] "upholstered Victorian quality" [...] of the stories as told to themselves.|$|E

After losing some 30 men killed and wounded, without a possibility of escape or rescue- perfectly {{at the mercy of}} the enemy, he being able to cut the levee and drown me out- I thought it my duty to surrender.

In my workshop I had some 1/4” mahogany wall paneling, some banjo parts, some mandolin parts, and some pine wood from a packing crate.

Using a mandolin set of machine heads and a mandolin bridge I strung it with four sets of duals over a guitar sized fingerboard. While building the instrument, I realized that if I just left it untuned <b>my</b> <b>small</b> son would be beating on a dischordant set of strings.

In an interview in July 2005, he said: [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>small</b> act of rebellion. I never liked it [...] When I finally told my mother she said, 'Nor do I'.

Joseph E. Johnston. [...] After Slocum’s defeat of the Confederate forces at Bentonville, an officer of Sherman’s staff wrote: “Slocum was more than equal to the necessity of the hour, and his success justified General Sherman’s selection of him as commander of the Left Wing of the Army.” ...|$|E

Next thing I knew, {{there was this}} chap in the long grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for <b>my</b> <b>small</b> pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued.

2500|$|On 22 December, Khánh {{went back}} on his promise {{to leave the country}} and {{announced}} on Radio Vietnam that [...] "We make sacrifices for the country's independence and the Vietnamese people's liberty, but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country". He said it was [...] "better to live poor but proud as free citizens of an independent country rather than in ease and shame as slaves of the foreigners and Communists". Khánh explicitly denounced Taylor in an interview published in the New York Herald Tribune on 23 December saying [...] "if Taylor did not act more intelligently, Southeast Asia would be lost", and that the US could not expect to succeed by modelling South Vietnam on American norms. He added that Taylor's [...] "attitude during the last 48 hours-as far as <b>my</b> <b>small</b> head is concerned—has been beyond imagination". Justifying the removal of the HNC, Khánh said they were [...] "exploited by counter-revolutionary elements who placed partisan considerations above the homeland's sacred interest." [...] Taylor responded by stating that generals had participated in [...] "improper interference" [...] into the purview of civilian government, while embassy staff said that their head had done nothing improper, as did the State Department, effectively again threatening to cut aid.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Viglione was {{introduced}} to the drums by his father on Christmas Day at age five with his interest quickly deepening at age nine when rock music became a primary focus and passion. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument. [...] "I spent every possible hour jamming with my friends up in our attic from the time I was in the fourth grade through when I graduated high school. You could hardly tear us all away from playing!" [...] At sixteen years old, Viglione began playing gigs in clubs with bands around New England before moving from New Hampshire to Boston in 1999. There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from <b>my</b> <b>small</b> town to pursue my dream. Both of my parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times." [...] Viglione played bass for a year in a and was exposed to music that played a large and influential role in his playing. [...] "I was listening to a lot of Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Black Flag, Swans, Miles Davis, Diamanda Galas, The Gun Club, Einstürzende Neubauten, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane records. Very cathartic music that taught me a lot about the beauty of how to balance using space and aggression in music." ...|$|E
