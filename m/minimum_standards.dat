5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: <b>Minimum</b> <b>standards</b> and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only <b>minimum</b> <b>standards.</b> These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the EU <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> on cold appliances: the British case Monitoring the effectiveness of policy {{is an essential part of}} securing energy savings. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> on cold appliances using the British market as a case study. Data availability on developments in the cold appliance market in Britain is very good compared to most other EU markets, permitting an unbroken quarterly analysis from 1995 onwards. The timing and magnitude of market transformation as a result of the <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> is shown in the context of historical rates of change, the aspirations of Directive 96 / 57 /EC and the development in price. The analysis shows that the <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> is resulting in substantial energy savings to the consumer, but that retailers and manufacturers delayed efficiency improvements to the UK market for as long as possible. More than one year after the standard came into effect a significant proportion of sales were not meeting the standard. There is very little evidence that the <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> has resulted in price increases. On the contrary, real prices generally continued to fall as manufacturers geared up to meeting the standard...|$|R

40|$|In {{considering}} {{a country that}} imposes a <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> on an imported polluting good, which generates negative consumption externalities, we construct a common-agency model, in which a domestic environmental group and a foreign industrial lobby can influence {{the formation of the}} <b>minimum</b> <b>standard</b> by providing political contributions to the government. This paper investigates the effects of trade liberalization on the political equilibrium environmental standard, the pattern of trade, environmental disutility, and social welfare. We find that trade liberalization tightens the <b>minimum</b> <b>standard,</b> decreases imports of the polluting good, and reduces environmental disutilities. The importing country’s social welfare, however, does not necessarily increase with trade liberalization. The weaker the environmental group’s lobbying efficiency, or the stronger the foreign firm’s lobbying efficiency, {{the more likely it is}} that trade liberalization will enhance the importing country’s welfare.
