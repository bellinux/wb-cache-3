30|$|Omnidirectional {{wheels are}} used in mobile robots doing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> tasks and other {{industrial}} applications, though mobile robots with omnidirectional wheels are controllable with reduced number of actuators and are highly manoeuvrable in narrow or crowded spaces. Accuracy of motion is influenced by systematic errors caused by unavoidable imperfections in the control and mechanical subsystems and nonsystematic caused by unpredictable phenomena such as wheel slippage and surface irregularities. Calibration {{will be needed to}} compensate for those errors due to the use of omnidirectional wheels. Other odometry errors, while the robot movement, may also exist due to unequal wheels diameters, joints misalignment, backlash and slippage in encoder pulses [24]. Omnidirectional vehicles are widely used in mobile robots for <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> <b>vehicles</b> for logistics and wheelchairs. However, they are generally designed for the case of motion on flat, smooth terrain and are not feasible for outdoor usage [17]. Slippage is there when omnidirectional wheels are in motion and manufacturing of those wheels is an expensive and needs high accuracy. Furthermore, there is a poor efficiency because not all the wheels are rotating in the direction of movement, which causes loss from friction, and are more computationally complex because of the angle calculations of movement [25].|$|R

40|$|Automated guided {{vehicles}} (AGVs) {{have been}} operating effectively in factories for decades. These vehicles have successfully used strategies of deliberately structuring {{the environment and}} adapting the process to the automation. The potential of computer vision technology to increase the intelligence and adaptability of AGVs is largely unexploited in contemporary commercially available vehicles. We developed an infrastructure-free AGV that uses four distinct vision systems. Three of them exploit naturally occurring visual cues instead of relying on infrastructure. When coupled with a highly capable trajectory generation algorithm, the system produces four visual servo controllers that guide the vehicle continuously in several contexts. These contexts range from gross motion in the facility to precision operations for lifting and mating parts racks and removing them from semi-trailers. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} instance of an AGV that has operated successfully in a relevant environment {{for an extended period of}} time without relying on any infrastructure. Overview The market for AGVs is the oldest established market for mobile robots. This market is probably valued at over US$ 900 million today [4], [17]. The largest consumer of AGVs is the automotive industry although many other industries, including warehousing and distribution, paper, printing, textiles, and steel, also use these vehicles.

40|$|With {{a proven}} life of 20, 000 {{operation}} {{hours in a}} lifetime test with a realistic dynamic load profile, the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) system V 3. 3 - 2 represents a milestone for the commercialization of DMFC systems. The hybrid DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 comprises an in active serial connected 1. 0 kW DMFC system and a 45 Ah lithium-ion high-power battery pack. This hybrid system replaces the battery tray of a class 3 forklift truck and can supply a peak load of 7 kW. The advantages of this energy-supply module compared to conventional lead-acid batteries are its higher range (24 h use with a 20 L methanol canister instead of 8 h with battery recharging) and its higher availability (a few minutes are required to exchange methanol canisters instead of hours to recharge the battery). However, {{in order to ensure}} that use of the DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 is economic, the DMFC stack must have a durability of at least 10, 000 h. This publication describes the degradation behavior of the DMFC stack and of the energy storage system during a lifetime test of the DMFC system V 3. 3 - 2 with a dynamic load profile of a <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In the first-ever test worldwide lasting 25, 600 h, the hybrid system is successfully operated for 20, 000 h.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 22, 2016 - June 22, 2018 Small and medium-sized enterprises that are characterized by high-mix, low-volume, and highly variable production operations often have unstructured material movement processes that are prone to <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. These sub-optimal <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems are oftentimes a result of small and medium-sized enterprise's limited resources. Current tools to assist organizations in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are resource intensive, complex, or too vague. <b>Material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes are defined in this research as: a) inappropriate <b>material</b> <b>handling,</b> b) operator search time, and c) inefficient forklift routing. To help {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} reduce <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes it is hypothesized that tailored visual management systems 1) can be designed from the analysis of three <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes, and 2) can yield a low resource intensive solution to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in reducing <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> wastes. In order to test these hypotheses, a methodology to design an ad-hoc <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is developed, tested via a case study, and validated via two alternate scenarios. Results show that ad-hoc visual management systems can be designed from low resource intensive analysis and are capable of increasing the efficiency of in-house material movements in small and medium-sized enterprises.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{production}} logistics, <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> {{is concerned with the}} internal material flow, which consist of inventory management and transportation. The overall goal with <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> is to ensure the production system access to <b>material,</b> where the <b>handling</b> is to be performed without any damage to neither material nor personnel. In a manufacturing company, a sufficient part of the total production cost can be directly derived from internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling.</b> According to Lean Production both transportation and inventory should be considered as waste. Therefore, it is important to improve the efficiency of the internal <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, though it must not be on the expense of the delivery precision or compromising the safety. The study assumes that the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system is supposed to provide the productions system with the right materials, in the right quantity, at the right time, and doing so in cost effective manner. The purpose with this study is to identify and analyze <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> in order to develop and present recommendations for a safer and more cost efficient <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> with preserved delivery precision. The study is a case study, which has been conducted on site at Sandvik Mining in Sandviken. Sandvik Mining produces drill bits, drill rods and adapters, which are used for rock drilling. The data collection has been done through interviews and observations, where the authors have been interviewing employees from Sandvik Mining as well as conducting direct observations of the processes within the field of study. The study was complemented by a literature review, where the most influential fields of study where <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> and Lean Production. The report presents a map of current material transportation flows within Sandvik Mining as well as how the management of these flows is conducted. From the map, problem areas have been identified and the underlying cause of these can be derived from the variations within the working methods. The variations occur due to the fact the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system does not meet the six aspects of the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> equation, namely: why, what, where, when and how materials should be transported as well as by who the transportation should performed. In order to create an effective <b>materials</b> <b>handling,</b> the study presents recommendations that aims to define and standardize <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities, which could be done by material-dedicated buffer zones. The study claims that these material-dedicated buffer zones would serve as reference points for the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system, and based on which, it is possible to define the different <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> activities. The buffer zones can also provide necessary control to the <b>materials</b> <b>handling</b> system {{as well as to the}} production system.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for the verification of controls in <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems. While currently these controls are mostly validated using simulation, in the proposed approach, the correctness of the involved controls is automatically proven by means of model checking. Model checking is a formal method that automatically verifies whether a system meets its specification by exhaustively analyzing {{a model of the}} corresponding system. To achieve a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system, a modeling methodology has been developed and is introduced in this thesis. The methodology is based on the definition of <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system elements, which are models of technical components such as conveyors or pushers. By interconnecting these elements, a model of the <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> system is built, which thereafter can be fed into a model checker to prove certain properties on the model. In order to also verify large and complex <b>material</b> <b>handling</b> systems, a compositional approach is proposed.
