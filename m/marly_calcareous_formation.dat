30|$|The {{second group}} of well logging data {{consists}} of wireline logs, measured continuously while the tool is pulled upward {{from the bottom of}} the borehole. The measurements are transmitted continuously via the wireline to the surface. For this study, standard geophysical wireline logs were used to measure the gamma ray of natural radioactivity in the geological formations in the borehole and reported in gAPI. At Soultz, the spectral gamma ray measurement was a significant proof of hydrothermally altered and fractured zones in the granite (Hooijkaas et al. 2006). It is more difficult to use this method to identify fracture zones in Triassic sediments due to their lower content of radioisotopes. In the Lettenkohle and the Upper Muschelkalk, the local GR minima are associated with the <b>marly</b> <b>calcareous</b> <b>formations.</b> In the Buntsandstein, clay layers (less than 2  m thick) correspond to isolated and localized GR peaks. Peaks associated with fracture zones with hydrothermal alteration halos show a larger GR variation than those induced by sedimentary clay layers.|$|R
30|$|In GPK- 2, the Tertiary sediments {{extend from}} the {{topographic}} surface down to 623 -m depth. The uppermost part {{is composed of}} clays and marls in the Pechelbronn oil formations of Oligocene age (316 -m depth) (Ménillet 1976; Cautru 1988) (Figure  1). The Eocene formations are divided into two types of marl: the ferruginous marlstones of the Red Layer (353 -m depth) and the marlstones interbedded with dolomite layers of the Dolomitic Zone (601 -m depth). At its base, there is {{a thin layer of}} dark claystones dated to the late Eocene. This Tertiary section features an erosional contact with the Jurassic formations. The Dogger formations are dark-grey clays with calcareous shale (653 -m depth), and the Lias formations are grey silty calcareous claystones (763 -m depth). The lowest part of the sedimentary cover is a typical Germanic Triassic sequence with Upper Triassic dolomites, anhydrite and clays for layers: the Keuper formation extends down to 853 -m depth and the Lettenkohle formation down to 873 -m depth. The stratigraphy of the Muschelkalk and Buntsandstein can be specified thanks to core samples from EPS- 1. The stratigraphic series of the typical Germanic Triassic sequence indicates rather constant thicknesses through all the URG, and all formations can be easily correlated between boreholes, even if separated by several kilometers. The top of the Upper Muschelkalk is composed of massive limestones rich in Terebratula over <b>marly</b> <b>calcareous</b> <b>formations</b> that extend over 35  m before giving way to massive crinoidal limestone beds. These high carbonate content limestone beds are the most competent rocks of the sedimentary cover. They are approximately 14 -m thick and mark the transition to the Middle Muschelkalk. The central section of the Muschelkalk is composed of marly dolomites invaded by anhydrite (circa 50 -m thick). The Upper Muschelkalk begins at a depth of approximately 980  m and is divided into two parts: the upper part is <b>marly</b> <b>calcareous</b> dolomites and the lower part is fossil-rich sandstones to a depth of 1, 021  m. The sedimentary cover ends with the Buntsandstein sandstones that extend to a depth of 1, 405  m. At the top of the formation, the Voltzia sandstones are fine-grained sandstones with interbedded clays and are over 10 -m thick. The so-called Intermediate Layers are sandstones with a larger grain size and are approximately 40 -m thick. The Middle Buntsandstein is represented by the Vosgian sandstones, typical medium-grained to conglomeratic continental sandstones with clay formations. The last 50  m of the formation is composed of the Annweiler sandstones, an argillaceous red sandstone. The transitional layer of Permian sandstones is visible in core samples from the EPS- 1 well but hardly distinguishable in cuttings. The evaluated porosity of the Buntsandstein is quite low (10 % {{at the top of the}} formation and 20 % for the Vosgian sandstones) (Vernoux et al. 1995). Petrophysical studies of the core samples note the role of the matrix permeability, which controls the geothermal fluid circulation through these sandstones (Haffen et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} model of groundwater flow systems in turbiditic fractured aquifers is proposed, {{taking into account}} natural discharge pattern of the hydrogeologic system and the system perturbation induced by tunnel drainage. Silico-clastic and <b>marly</b> <b>calcareous</b> turbidites outcrop extensively in Northern Apeninnes (Italy) and paper deals with {{the assessment of the}} aquifer-like behaviour of these units, up to now considered as aquitards, as reflected by the huge amounts of groundwater locally drained by tunnels for the high speed railway (HSR) connection between Bologna and Florence. The study is based on the analysis of a huge amount of hydrological data (springs, streams and tunnels discharge) collected by a monitoring activity performed for a 10 years time-span, integrated by hydrochemical and isotopic analysis on surface and tunnel waters and a stream-tunnel tracer test. In a turbiditic aquifer recession analysis permits to discriminate groundwater flow systems, to calculate recharge relative to the up-stream reach portion and to locate springs more vulnerable to tunnel drainage impacts. Natural discharge is stream-focused and, as the tunnel drainage is for 85 % formed by active recharge groundwater, the impact on the stream base-flow is severe with abatement of natural discharge budget component up to 2 / 3 of natural value...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cemented <b>calcareous</b> <b>formations,</b> {{typically}} {{referred to}} as chalk or marl, are widespread in the southeastern U. S. and are ideally suited {{to the use of}} drilled shaft foundations. Chalk formations are relatively stable in an open borehole and are relatively easy to drill but difficult to penetrate with driven piling. These cohesive intermediate geomaterials are sometimes difficult to characterize for design purposes because of the difficulty in sampling and testing. This paper provides a review of recent instrumented load tests performed in these cemented calcareous materials. A total of 15 tests were selected from southeastern states based on the availability of good quality load test data and geotechnical information. Most of the test data include measurements of compressive strength from cores. Ultimate unit side shear and end bearing resistance is found to show a relationship with unconfined compressive strength using existing published correlations for weak rock materials...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{the field}} surveys in the Skallen region during 1969 - 1970 are {{summarized}} with descriptions of stratigraphy and considerations on geotectonic history of the region. Field and aerial photographs, route maps, and field descriptions are also given. Basement rocks of the Skallen region are metamorphic rocks consisting of paragneisses, brown gneisses, marble, quartzite, and metabasite, and plutonic rocks consisting of charnockitic rocks, garnet gneissose granite, and pink granites. The metamorphic rocks comprise four stratigraphic units, namely, Skallen brown gneiss <b>formation,</b> Skallen lower <b>calcareous</b> <b>formation,</b> Skallen siliceous formation, and Skallen upper <b>calcareous</b> <b>formation,</b> in ascending order. These formations belong to the Skallen group, the total thickness of which, including most of the intercalated plutonic rocks which are transformed in situ from the metamorphites, is over 1500 meters. All the formations are conformable to each other, except the lowermost Skallen brown gneiss formation which is tectonically separated from other formations. The fundamental geologic structure of the region is nappe and associated isoclinal folds with gently and easterly plunging axes and axial planes dipping north; hence {{a part of the}} stratigraphic column of the present region is doubled. Some other folds or fractures were found, being overprinted by or superposing on the main nappe structure. The geotectonic history of the Skallen region is as follows from older to younger : moderately plunging recumbent anticline (nappe) -easterly and gently plunging recumbent anticline (nappe) -east-northeasterly or west-southwesterly and gently plunging open folding-east-southeasterly plunging minor folding-easterly gentle folding and northeasterly open synform-conjugate set of west-northwesterly and northeasterly fractures. The change of stress field from older N-S compressional to younger E-W compressional is estimated. A granulite facies metamorphism resulting {{in the formation of the}} metamorphites is considered to be synchronous with both or either of the recumbent anticlines, a dynamic metamorphism to take place during the earlier nappe, formation of charnockite to be synchronous with or slightly later than the subhorizontal recumbent anticline and partly to prolong until the completion of the plunging open folding, intrusion of pink granites, which indicate amphibolite facies conditions and the radiometric age of which is already obtained as about 500 m. y., to be around the stage of the gentle folding. Neither metamorphic nor plutonic effect was found in relation to the fractures...|$|R
