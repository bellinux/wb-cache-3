That trio, in my view, abetted al Qaeda, and if the September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick Clarke, Bill Clinton and Sandy Berger and not the antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.|$|E

Thus, you see, in any case my adoption of him would be greatly to his benefit. I can, of course, thoroughly understand that it will be very hard for you and Mrs. Humphreys to give up your child.
