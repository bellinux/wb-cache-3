Magnetic properties arise from the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons contained in a compound. Compounds are diamagnetic when they contain no unpaired electrons. Molecular compounds that contain one or more unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. The magnitude of the paramagnetism is expressed as an effective magnetic moment, μeff. For first-row transition metals the magnitude of μeff is, to a first approximation, a simple function of the number of unpaired electrons, the spin-only formula. In general, spin-orbit coupling causes μeff to deviate from the spin-only formula. For the heavier transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, spin-orbit coupling cannot be ignored. Exchange interaction can occur in clusters and infinite lattices, resulting in ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the relative orientations of the individual spins.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the on-surface <b>magnetochemistry</b> of square-planar transition-metal {{complexes}} adsorbed on ferromagnetic substrates. Specifically, the <b>magnetochemistry</b> of the transition-metal ions (Mn / Fe / Co / Ni) coordinated in square-planar porphyrin / phthalocyanine ligands arranged on native and oxygen-reconstructed ferromagnetic Ni(001) / Co(001) thin-films is studied. The metal-centers in the surface-adsorbed complexes are five-fold coordinated: four coordination-bonds with the square-planar ligand and one bond with the “surface-ligand”. This arrangement leaves the sixth site on-top of the complex open for an additional ligand to bind with the transition-metal center and give the possibility to control the magnetic properties of the on-surface complex. Specifically, nitric oxide (NO) or ammonia (NH 3) gas is used {{to serve as the}} sixth ligand. The experiments were performed in ultra-high vacuum and the samples were studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). This work is based on the induced magnetic ordering in a monolayer of transition-metal porphyrins adsorbed on ferromagnetic substrates. The effect allows to study the <b>magnetochemistry</b> at ambient / near-ambient temperature in the remanent magnetization of the substrate. The experimental results are complemented by density functional theory with additional Hubbard interactions taken into account (DFT+U) conducted by Kartick Tarafder and Peter Oppeneer from Uppsala (Sweden). Within the scope of this thesis, mechanisms for switching off, tuning and switching on the magnetic moments in the adsorbed complexes are demonstrated and explained. Furthermore, we show that apart from controlling the magnetic moment, the axial-ligand {{can also be used to}} control the exchange-interaction with the ferromagnetic substrate. Specifically, we observe that the strength and sign of the exchange-interaction can be controlled. These results clearly illustrate that the coordination-chemistry and <b>magnetochemistry</b> on-surface extends the framework of classical coordination-chemistry, since the interaction with the “surface-ligand” has to be included into the considerations. Furthermore, we show that highly-ordered two-dimensional arrays of molecular spin-systems can be fabricated by chemically directed self-assembly. Specifically, we produce chessboard-like Fe - Mn - Fe spin-arrays by mere co-evaporation of the functionalized molecular building-blocks. In a second step, the magnetic properties of this spin-array can be controlled by ammonia exposure and one half of the chessboard-like spin-array can be selectively and reversibly switched. Also, the on-surface charge-transfer between the strong electron-acceptor TCNQ and alkali-halides (e. g. Na+Cl-) is discussed. The experiments show that the 2 D metal-organic layers can be produced by the on-surface reaction of alkali-halides (instead of alkali-metals) and sufficiently strong electron acceptors. ...|$|E

The conventional ferrimagnetic spinel and garnet compositions, however, are not generally optimized for temperatures {{in the vicinity of}} 77 K and may require chemical redesign in order to realize the full potential of these devices. For microwave transmission, absorption losses may be reduced by a natural lengthening of the spin-lattice relaxation time and the suppression of hopping electron activity at low temperatures. However, these properties could be degraded by fast-relaxing impurities that broaden ferrimagnetic resonance lines. At low temperatures, saturation magnetizations increase according to the Brillouin-Weiss function behavior that is characteristic of most magnetic materials. Increased magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies will produce greater coercive fields that will lead directly to higher hysteresis loop switching energies. Other parameters that are influenced adversely by reduced temperatures are the magnetostriction constants, which can cause significant deterioration in the stability of the remanence ratios of hysteresis loops. To modify room temperature ferrites for devices that use high-Tc superconductors, <b>magnetochemistry</b> must be applied to obtain the desired parameter values, which in turn must be chosen through design tradeoffs and are set by the performance requirements of particular device applications...|$|E

THE INFLUENCE OF SEVERAL SYNTHETIC PARAMETERS HAS BEEN CAREFULLY EXAMINED. THE MOLECULAR AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURES OF MOST COMPLEXES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY SINGLE - CRYSTAL X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRPHY. THE NEW COMPLEXES WERE ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY ELEMENTAL ANALYSES, THERMAL TECHNIQUES, <b>MAGNETOCHEMISTRY</b> AND SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS. THE PRODUCTS OF THE REACTION SYSTEMS STUDIED COMPRISE A REMARKABLY WIDE VARIETY OF STRUCTURALTYPES, SOME OF WHICH ARE NOVEL, EMPHASIZING THE CAPABILITY OF THE CARBOXYLATE GROUP TO ADOPT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LIPATION MODES, BOTH TERMINAL BRIDGING, AND BOTH MONODENTATE AND BIDENTATE. A MATTER OF INTEREST IS THAT THERE IS MUCH VERSATILITY IN THE TYPE OF BRIDGING FOUND IN COPPER (II) ACETATE AND THAT OTHER SMALL BRIDGING LIPANDS CAN BE INCORPORATED TOGETHER WITH CARBOXYLATE BRIDGES IN THE SAME COMPLEX. ...|$|E
