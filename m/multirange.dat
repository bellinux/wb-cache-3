In computer-aided diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms, segmenting the high-intensity major vessels along with the attached lowcontrast aneurysms {{is essential to the}} recognition of this lethal vascular disease. It is particularly helpful in performing early and noninvasive diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms using phase contrast magnetic resonance angiographic (PC-MRA) images. The major challenges of developing a PC-MRA-based segmentation method are the significantly varying voxel intensity inside vessels with different flow velocities and the signal loss in the aneurysmal regions where turbulent flows occur. This paper proposes a novel intensity-based algorithm to segment intracranial vessels and the attached aneurysms. The proposed method can handle intensity varying vasculatures and also the low-contrast aneurysmal regions affected by turbulent flows. It is grounded on the use of <b>multirange</b> filters and local variances to extract intensity-based image features for identifying contrast varying vasculatures. The extremely low-intensity region affected by turbulent flows is detected according to the topology of the structure detected by <b>multirange</b> filters and local variances. The proposed method is evaluated using a phantom image volume with an aneurysm and four clinical cases. It achieves 0. 80 dice score in the phantom case. In addition, different components of the proposed method—the <b>multirange</b> filters, local variances, and topology-based detection—are evaluated in the comparison between the proposed method and its lower complexity variants. Owing to the analogy between these variants and existing vascular segmentation methods, this comparison also exemplifies the advantage of the proposed method over the existing approaches. It analyzes the weaknesses of these existing approaches and justifies the use of every component involved in the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of segmenting blood vessels and the attached aneurysms on PC-MRA images...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} the {{step-by-step}} principles for making local model of electron density are described. They {{are based on}} modulation principle - electron density dependence on time {{is a product of}} a number of temporal variations caused by solar radiation, magnetic activity, Earth orientation and unknown additional periodical processes (not a sum, as they suppose sometimes when making such models). A <b>multiranges</b> modulation principle is also suggested, that allows automatically extend the set of parameters by using new ones, obtained by filtration (or averaging) of basic set of parameters over the time. In the paper we describe two approaches to the model creation - descriptional and predictional ones. To test the approach three different models were created for daily electron density logarithm using the described principles. We have used the data of Irkutsk digisonde over the period 2003 - 2007 years for testing. It becomes clear that a non-optimal choice of the number of model parameters could increase prediction error, inspite the error over the set, used for analysis, will decrease. It is shown that one year prediction has accuracy about 9 - 23 % depending on the height, and the highest error corresponds to the height about 200 km. From the modelling we could also see that with increasing of the height the number of parameters increases, and this could be caused by inaccuracy of the model or by not taking additional physical mechanisms into consideration.

40|$|Characterization of {{atmospheric}} particulates {{was conducted at}} a site {{near the center of}} Norfolk, Virginia. Air quality was measured in terms {{of atmospheric}} mass loading, particle size distribution, and particulate elemental composition for a period of 2 weeks. The objectives of this study were (1) to establish a mean level of air quality and deviations about this mean, (2) to ascertain diurnal changes or special events in air quality, and (3) to evaluate instrumentation and sampling schedules. Simultaneous measurements were made with the following instruments: a quartz crystal microbalance particulate monitor, a light-scattering <b>multirange</b> particle counter, a high-volume air sampler, and polycarbonate membrane filters. To assess the impact of meteorological conditions on air quality variations, continuous data on temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction were recorded. Particulate elemental composition was obtained from neutron activation and scanning electron microscopy analyses of polycarbonate membrane filter samples. The measured average mass loading agrees reasonably well with the mass loadings determined by the Virginia State Air Pollution Control Board. There are consistent diurnal increases in atmospheric mass loading in the early morning and a sample time resolution of 1 / 2 hour seems necessary to detect most of the significant events...|$|E

3000|$|The {{notion of}} {{invariant}} subspaces introduced in [3] provided {{a basis for}} extending the underlying notion to nonlinear operators in a natural way; however, a natural entry point to delve into the study of such notion in infinite dimensions is first to deal with ideals of compact nonlinear maps generated by {T_ 1 T_ 2... T_m:T_j∈L(E)} where m∈N is fixed. These maps are known as maps of finite type and they inherit certain intrinsic properties of linear maps such as approximability by finite dimensional maps and bounded point spectra that are useful {{in the study of}} their associated ISPs. Notice T∈L(^mE; F) is finite dimensional if its <b>multirange</b> T(E, [...]..., E) is contained in a finite dimensional subspace of F; see Section  3 in [4]. In general, structural properties of T_j∈L(E) such as compactness were key in the study of their ISP; see [5, 6]. On the one hand, the work of Bényi and Torres [7] embodies different kinds of notions of compactness of a class of bilinear operators of finite type. Indeed, separate compactness of each section map of a bilinear map of finite type does not guarantee its compactness thus lending a study of Problem 1.3 a more general and broader consideration rather than restricting it to only compact nonlinear operators.|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} method of antisymmetrized {{molecular}} dynamics (AMD) to investigate dineutron correlation. We regard the total system as the core plus two valence neutrons in the AMD framework and treat the valence neutron wave functions by <b>multirange</b> Gaussians with the d-constraint method, in which {{the distance between the}} core and the center of mass of the two neutrons is constrained, to describe the size changing effect and the motion of two neutrons. We apply this method to the ground state of [10]Be as an example and investigate the motion of two neutrons around a largely deformed [8]Be core by analyzing the two-neutron overlap function around the core. Comparing the results including the different [8]Be core structures, we show that the core structure {{plays an important role in}} dineutron formation and expansion from the core. The radial fluctuation in the core leads to the expansion of the core potential to the farther region and, as a result, two valence neutrons can be expanded far from the core to form a dineutron. Differently, when the core is less deformed, the dineutron is dissociated by the spin-orbit potential at the surface of the core. We can investigate the dineutron correlation clearly by using the present framework and conclude that the framework is effective for the studies of dineutron correlation...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of renin release {{to the administration}} of renin inhibitors cannot be studied with conventional enzymatic methods used to measure plasma renin. In the present experiments, a novel <b>multirange</b> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human and primate renin was used to investigate the changes in plasma immunoreactive renin after renin inhibition. A potent and long-acting statine-containing renin inhibitor, CGP 29 287, was injected in conscious marmosets after mild or severe sodium depletion. In mildly sodium-depleted marmosets, CGP 29 287 (0. 1 mg/kg i. v.) reduced mean arterial blood pressure and completely inhibited plasma renin activity for up to 30 minutes. This response {{was associated with a}} transient increase in plasma immunoreactive renin concentration. After a dose of 1. 0 mg/kg i. v., the reduction of mean arterial pressure and the complete inhibition of plasma renin activity persisted for up to 120 minutes. These effects were accompanied by a sustained increase in plasma immunoreactive renin concentration. In severely sodium-depleted marmosets, CGP 29 287 (1. 0 mg/kg i. v.) induced a marked fall in systolic blood pressure and complete inhibition of plasma renin activity within 30 minutes of injection. Plasma immunoreactive renin levels increased to 257 % of pretreatment values. The converting-enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (2 mg/kg i. v.) induced a fall in systolic blood pressure of similar magnitude, which was accompanied by an increase in plasma renin activity. Levels of plasma immunoreactive renin increased to 210 % of pretreatment values. Hydralazine (0. 2 mg/kg i. v.) did not increase plasma renin activity or plasma immunoreactive renin levels despite a comparable hypotensive effect. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative {{cerebral}} microembolism is a {{cause of}} cerebral dysfunction after cardiac surgery, and particulate microemboli are the most damaging. Using a new-generation transcranial Doppler ultrasound, we compared the number and nature of microemboli in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting during performance of proximal anastomoses with three techniques: an aortic side-biting clamp and two clampless devices (the Enclose II device [Novare Surgical Systems, Inc, Cupertino, Calif] and the Heartstring II device [Guidant Corporation, Santa Clara, Calif]) developed to obviate {{the need for an}} aortic side-biting clamp, thereby reducing the number of cerebral microemboli. METHODS: Bilateral continuous monitoring of the middle cerebral arteries was performed with a <b>multirange,</b> multifrequency transcranial Doppler device that both automatically rejects artifacts online and discriminates between solid and gaseous microemboli. Recordings were continuously undertaken during performance of 66 proximal aortic anastomoses in 42 patients. Thirty-five anastomoses were performed with an aortic side-biting clamp, 20 with the Enclose device, and 11 the Hearstring device. RESULTS: Most microemboli occurred during application/insertion and removal of each device from the ascending aorta. The median number (interquartile range) of total microemboli was 11 (6 - 32) during side clamping, 11 (6 - 15) with the Enclose device, 40 (31 - 48) with the Heartstring device (P <. 01). The proportion of solid microemboli was significantly higher in the side-clamp group (23 %) compared with 6 % and 1 % in the Enclose and Heartstring groups, respectively (P <. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance of aortic side clamping results in a significant reduction in the proportion of solid microemboli detected with transcranial Doppler. As solid microemboli are probably the most damaging, use of the Enclose and Heartstring devices may represent an important strategy for minimizing cerebral injury during proximal aortic anastomoses...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cerebral injury, in both overt {{and subtle}} forms, is common {{following}} cardiac surgery. Current methods of assessment, most commonly neuropsychological testing, have several limitations {{and do not}} accurately define the anatomical and functional injury that occurs. We have assessed the degree of cerebral injury following on-pump and off-pump cardiac surgery using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and correlated this with the severity of microembolism as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. METHODS: Sixteen patients undergoing cardiac surgery (8 off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 4 on-pump CABG and 4 open-heart surgery) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain pre-operatively and 4 weeks post-operatively. The functional magnetic resonance images demonstrated brain activation during performance of a verbal working memory paradigm. Each patient had continuous transcranial Doppler monitoring intraoperatively using a recently validated technique (<b>multirange,</b> multifrequency Doppler) that allows rejection of artefacts and separation of gas and solid microemboli. Covariate analysis of pre- and post-operative functional magnetic resonance images was performed to correlate local mean signal intensity change with the extent of gas and solid microembolism. RESULTS: The median number of microemboli was 34 (range 10 - 176) in the off-pump group, 229 (range 127 - 314) in the on-pump CABG group, and 1220 (range 874 - 1261) in the open-heart group (P< 0. 05). The proportion of solid microemboli was significantly lower in the off-pump group in comparison to the on-pump CABG and open-heart groups (9 vs. 25 vs. 20 %, respectively, P< 0. 01). Comparison of pre- and post-operative functional magnetic resonance images demonstrated an overall reduction in task-associated activation in the post-operative period. However, and paradoxically, in certain specific regions of interest there was an increase in the signal intensity which correlated with the total number of microemboli (r= 0. 9, P< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing on-pump surgery have a higher degree of gas and solid microembolism which correlates with post-operative cerebral functional MRI activation. As activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is known to be sensitive {{to a wide range of}} insults, it may prove to be a useful marker of perioperative cerebral injury that could help in the evaluation of potential cerebroprotective strategies...|$|E
40|$|Experiments for {{characterization}} of time-dependent material properties in free-standing metallic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) pose challenges: e. g. fabrication and handling (sub) -μm sized specimens, control and measurement of sub-μN loads and sub-μm displacements {{over long periods}} and various temperatures [1]. A variety of experimental setups have been reported each having their pros and cons. One example is a micro-tensile tester with an ingenious electro-static specimen gripping system [2] aiding simple specimen design giving good results at μN and sub-μm levels, but without in-situ full-field observations. Other progressive examples assimilate the specimen, MEMS actuators and load cells on a single chip [3, 4] yielding significant results at nN and nm levels with in-situ TEM/SEM observability, though not without complications: complex load actuator/sensor calibration per chip, measures to reduce fabrication failure and unfeasible cofabrication on wafers with commercial metallic MEMS. This work aims to overcome these drawbacks by developing experimental methods with high sensitivity, precision and in-situ full-field observation capabilities. Moreover, these should be applicable to simple free-standing metallic MEMS that can be co-fabricated with commercial devices. These methods will then serve in systematic studies into size-effects in time-dependent material properties. First a numeric-experimental method is developed. It characterizes bending deformation of onwafer μm-sized aluminum cantilevers. A specially designed micro-clamp is used to mechanically apply a constant precise deflection of the beam (zres < 50 nm) for a prolonged period, see fig. 1. After this period, the deflection by the micro-clamp is removed. Full-field height maps with the ensuing deformation are measured over time with confocal optical profilometry (COP). This yields the tip deflection as function of time with ~ 3 nm precision, see fig. 2. To extract material parameters describing the time-dependent behavior, the experiments are simulated with FEM using a standardsolid material model and the exact test-structure geometry. Although this method is simple, yet precise, it lacks direct determination of stress and strain. Therefore a second method is designed: measuring time-dependent tensile behavior of these cantilevers with a custom nano-tensile stage. The wafer with specimen is fixed to and manipulated with nano-precision by piezos stacked on micro-manipulators. The piezos also serve as load actuators. The stage has a custom <b>multirange</b> load cell providing a load range of 0 - 100 mN at a minimum resolution of 10 nN. An electro-static force is generated between the top flat of the specimen’s free end and a mating flat on the load cell. Full-field displacement measurements through SEM/AFM/COP are enabled by a compact design. A final addition is a heating element allowing testing up to 150 °. In short, the work will first discuss {{the performance of the}} numeric-experimental method for timedependent bending deformation characterization. Secondly, it will present the performance of the time-dependent tensile testing method along with preliminary measurements of time-dependent material behaviour...|$|E
