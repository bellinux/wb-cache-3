5|$|Davidson was {{selected}} for the 1954–55 tour of the West Indies, where he injured his right ankle in a tour match against Jamaica and <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Test against the West Indies. Upon his recovery, he could not break into the XI and did not play {{in any of the}} Tests, which Australia won 3–0. He scored 70 runs at 35.00 and took four wickets at 51.75 in three first-class outings.|$|E
5|$|During Hunt's injury, Bennett moved Broncos {{teammate}} Justin Hodges to fullback and Hodges {{was impressive}} in the position. When Hunt {{returned to the}} Broncos side in Round 25 against the Parramatta Eels, {{he was forced to}} play on the wing due to Hodges' good form. Hunt and Hodges continued to switch the fullback position {{for the remainder of the}} season. Hunt <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> week of the finals due to a hamstring problem but was able to return a week later.|$|E

5|$|However, {{he broke}} the same finger again and <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Test, ending a run of 48 {{consecutive}} Test matches. He returned for the remaining Tests and scored 68 in the Third Test to help to force a draw, after Australia had conceded a 221-run first innings lead, but apart from {{that he had a}} disappointing series, failing to pass 25 and finishing with 131 runs at 21.83.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Blanchard <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{two games}} of the season due to an injury to his knee. In June 1946 his class was divided into two classes (1947 and 1948) to {{transition}} back to a peacetime four-year curriculum from the wartime three-year curriculum instituted in October 1942. Both Blanchard and Davis were placed in the final three-year group, the Class of 1947 (Davis had entered West Point in July 1943 but was turned back a year in 1944 for a deficiency in mathematics).|$|E

5|$|After {{failing to}} sign coveted free agents Deron Williams and Steve Nash, the Mavericks {{retooled}} their roster by {{letting go of}} Jason Kidd, Jason Terry and Brendan Haywood, and acquiring younger players such as O. J. Mayo, Darren Collison, as well as veteran big men Chris Kaman and Elton Brand. Nowitzki plans to play out {{the remainder of his}} 4-year, 80 million dollar contract that expires in 2014. Nowitzki underwent knee surgery in October 2012 and <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 27 games of the season. He returned on December 23, 2012, in a game against San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Bieksa {{entered the}} Canucks' 2005–06 {{training}} camp as a projected competitor {{to be the}} team's sixth defenceman. However, three days into prospects camp, he suffered a high ankle sprain after colliding into the boards with another defenceman. He was reassigned to the Moose on October 3, 2005, and <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{month and a half}} of the 2005–06 season. While sidelined, Bieksa was named an alternate captain to Mike Keane by Moose Head Coach Alain Vigneault on October 29. He made his return to the line-up on November 11 against the Rochester Americans. In his second game back, he notched two goals and an assist on November 15 against the Grand Rapids Griffins in a 6–5 shootout loss.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{suffered}} another {{knee injury}} in the 2002–03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three games of the regular season. After returning to play, he had 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games, including two goals and an assist {{in his first game}} back, before a knee-on-knee collision in December forced him back out. After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee, which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points.|$|E

5|$|By {{his third}} season, 1998–99, Iginla led the Flames in goals with 28. His success {{complicated}} negotiations {{for a new}} contract, as he and the Flames struggled {{to agree on a}} new deal following the season. Hoping to help resolve the contract impasse, Iginla agreed to attend training camp without a contract and purchased his own insurance as the team would not have been responsible financially if he suffered an injury. He remained without a contract {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season and <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three games as a holdout before signing a three-year deal worth US$4.9 million, plus bonuses. He finished the year with career highs in goals (29) and points (63). He then topped both marks in 2000–01 by recording 31goals and 71points.|$|E
5|$|Fleury <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{two months}} of the season before being reinstated. While out with {{teammates}} in January 2003, {{he was involved in}} a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus, Ohio, that left him bloodied; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life. He was not suspended, but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks, and they placed him on waivers in March. No team claimed him, and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks, recording 12goals and 21assists in 54games. Following the season, in April 2003, he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program. The suspension ended his NHL career.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Julian joined Conference National side Newport County on a free transfer. In Newport's first {{pre-season}} game {{ahead of}} the 2012–13 season, away to Caldicot Town, Julian suffered a knee ligament injury. He subsequently <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{three months of the}} season, before eventually making his first-team debut for Newport on 17 November 2012, in a 3–1 home defeat to Hyde. Julian went on to make eleven appearances during a campaign in which Newport would return to the Football League after a 25-year absence following the club's 2–0 play-off final victory over Wrexham in May 2013.|$|E

5|$|In the interwar period, the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Injuries reduced Mullen to 49 {{games with}} the Blues in 1982–83, but he still scored 47 points. His 41 goals in 1983–84 set a record as the most scored by an American-born player in NHL history (broken by Bobby Carpenter the {{following}} season). He again reached the 40-goal plateau in 1984–85, and had 92 points total. He <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three days of the Blues' training camp prior to the 1985–86 season in a contract dispute before agreeing to a one-year deal. On February 1, 1986, the Blues dealt him to the Calgary Flames {{as part of a}} six player trade. Mullen went to Calgary, along with Terry Johnson and Rik Wilson, for Eddy Beers, Charlie Bourgeois and Gino Cavallini.|$|E
5|$|König {{took part}} in several fleet sorties in support of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group; however, due to her {{grounding}} outside Wilhelmshaven, the ship <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> operation of these battlecruisers {{on the night of}} 15–16 December 1914, when they were tasked with bombarding the English coast to lure out a portion of the British Grand Fleet to the waiting German fleet. On 22 January 1915, König and the rest of IIISquadron were detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic.

Neuner <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> World Cup of the 2009–10 season due to a cold in December 2009. She returned at the following races in Hochfilzen, but was still affected by her cold and finished outside the top 20. Her first podiums of the winter came in Pokljuka, finishing third in the sprint and second in the pursuit race. Thereby she secured her Olympic qualification within the German team.|$|E
5|$|Playing a {{physical}} style again {{took its toll}} on Roberts' upper body, and he required surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, he <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{four and a half}} months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury. Roberts reached a career milestone midway through the 2003–04 season, as he played his 1,000th NHL game on January 13, 2004, a 4–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 48 points in 72 games and played in his third All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2001 season, Aidoo broke his leg while filming Brian's Song. Although {{initially}} expected to heal in time for training camp, Aidoo's recovery was slower than expected, and he <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two games of the season with a broken right fibula. Aidoo returned to the Marauders in mid-September. In his first game back, Aidoo scored two touchdowns and broke the OUA conference record for career touchdowns with 35 total majors. He played a large role in a 27–15 upset of first-ranked Ottawa, scoring two of three touchdowns in the final five minutes of the game. Due to recurring issues with his healing leg, Aidoo missed multiple games in October but returned for the playoffs.|$|E
