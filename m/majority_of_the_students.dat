A typical family might have Dutch-speaking grandparents, bilingual parents, and French-speaking children.

From 1842, Dutch was removed from the first four years of boys' schools, although in later school grades it could be studied. In girls' schools and Catholic schools Dutch was taught even less, even though Dutch was still the native tongue of a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b>|$|E
25|$|Word of the bashi-bazouks' atrocities {{filtered}} to {{the outside}} world by way of American-run Robert College located in Constantinople. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were Bulgarian, and many received news of the events from their families back home. Soon the Western diplomatic community in Constantinople was abuzz with rumours, which eventually found their way into newspapers in the West. While in Constantinople in 1879, protestant missionary George Warren Wood reported Turkish authorities in Amasia brutally persecuting Christian Armenian refugees from Soukoum Kaleh. He was able to coordinate with British diplomat Edward Malet to bring the matter {{to the attention of the}} Sublime Porte, and then to the British foreign secretary Robert Gascoyne-Cecil (the Marquess of Salisbury). In Britain, where Disraeli's government was committed to supporting the Ottomans in the ongoing Balkan crisis, the Liberal opposition newspaper Daily News hired American journalist Januarius A. MacGahan to report on the massacre stories firsthand.|$|E
25|$|Undergraduate: The {{admission}} {{system of}} Islamic University of Technology (IUT) {{is different from}} other universities of Bangladesh for BSc and higher diploma programs.

IUT authority only selects Muslim students as per their results in secondary and higher-secondary level. A placement test determines {{the position of the}} students against their choice which they had given on the admission form. Prospective Muslim students need to fill a form and submit it to the ministry of manpower and employment of their respective countries. The form can be collected from IUT office or the respective ministry. It is also available in the university website. IUT was established to support only Muslim students of all the countries of OIC. It takes students from the respective governments, and a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> are Bangladeshi Muslims. Previously, only male Muslim students were eligible to apply but from the year 2016, IUT started a female section as well.|$|E

Jason (Kane Hodder) is resurrected again, this time by the telekinetic Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln), {{who is trying to}} resurrect her father who drowned in the lake when Tina was a child. Jason once again begins killing those who occupy Crystal Lake and is returned {{to the bottom of the}} lake after a battle with Tina. Jason is resurrected again in [...] (1989) by an underwater electrical cable. He follows a group of students on their senior class cruise to Manhattan, where he kills the ship's crew and the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> Upon reaching Manhattan, Jason chases Rennie (Jensen Daggett) and Sean (Scott Reeves), the two remaining students, into the sewers. Jason eventually melts away because the sewer is flooded with toxic waste. In [...] (1993), Jason, through an unexplained resurrection, is hunted by the FBI at Crystal Lake.

2500|$|In India the dormitories {{are called}} [...] "PG housing" [...] or [...] "Student Hostels". Even {{though most of}} the colleges/universities have hostels on-campus, however in most of the cases it is not enough for the total {{students}} enrolled. <b>Majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> prefer to stay off-campus in PGs and private hostels as they usually have better amenities and services. For example in 2015 estimated 1.8 lakh students enrolled with Delhi University , there are only about 9,000 seats available in its hostels for both undergraduate and postgraduate students. The university admits an average of 54,000 students every year. Which leaves a majority of students to find accommodation off-campus. This is led to a lot of student hostel or student PG chains to be established near Delhi University.|$|E
2500|$|Leo {{then goes}} on to note that, [...] "the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> {{receiving}} assistance under the act are Black and Brown." [...] There have been various other Acts enacted to try and aid impoverished youth with the chance to succeed. One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This Act was meant to increase the accountability of public schools and their teachers by creating standardized testing which would give an overview {{of the success of the}} school's ability to educate their students. Schools which repeatedly performed poorly would have increased attention and assistance from the federal government. One of the intended outcomes of the Act was to narrow the class and racial achievement gap in the United States by instituting common expectations for all students. Test scores have shown to be improving for minority populations, however, they are improving at the same rate for Caucasian children as well. This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.|$|E
