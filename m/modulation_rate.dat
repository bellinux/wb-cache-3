Signal processors, such as four-phase modems, cannot change the DSR, but the <b>modulation</b> <b>rate</b> depends on the line modulation scheme, in accordance with Note 4.

40|$|Natural and behaviorally {{relevant}} {{sounds are}} characterized by temporal modulations of their waveforms, which carry important cues for sound segmentation and communication. Still, there is little consensus as to how this temporal information is represented in auditory cortex. Here, by using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) optimized for studying the auditory system, we report the existence of a topographically ordered spatial representation of temporal sound <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> in human auditory cortex. We found a topographically organized sensitivity within auditory cortex to sounds with varying <b>modulation</b> <b>rates,</b> with enhanced responses to lower <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> (2 and 4  Hz) on lateral parts of Heschl's gyrus (HG) and faster <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> (16 and 32  Hz) on medial HG. The representation of temporal <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> was distinct from the representation of sound frequencies (tonotopy) that was orientated roughly orthogonal. Moreover, the combination of probabilistic anatomical maps with a previously proposed functional delineation of auditory fields revealed that the distinct maps of temporal and spectral sound features both prevail within two presumed primary auditory fields hA 1 and hR. Our results reveal a topographically ordered representation of temporal sound cues in human primary auditory cortex that is complementary to maps of spectral cues. They thereby enhance our understanding of the functional parcellation and organization of auditory cortical processing...|$|R

Sound envelope processing in {{the developing}} brains [...] Chapter 5. General discussion and conclusions. Our ability to understand speech and other sounds relies crucially on the capacity to detect and perceive temporal amplitude fluctuations {{in the range of}} about 1 - 100 Hz. However, most individual neurons in auditory cortex are capable of precisely aligning their activities only to <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> {{at the lower end of}} this range. This raises the question of how higher <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> might be encoded, and of how the auditory cortex might be organised to accommodate the full range of perceptually relevant amplitude envelope modulations. Here we show, with noninvasive magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography measurements, that population oscillatory responses of human auditory cortex transition between a mode of strong phase locking to <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> below about 40 - 50 Hz, to a non phase-locked mode of responding at rates higher than about 50 Hz. Such dual response modes are predictable from the behaviours of single neurons in auditory cortex of non-human primates, but only the low rate phase locking mode has been previously observed in the neuronal population responses indexed in human MEG/EEG recordings. Taken together, the single neuron and MEG and EEG results from current thesis work suggest that two distinct types of neuronal encoding are required to represent the full range of temporal <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> that are relevant to everyday perception.

40|$|Current {{hypotheses}} about language processing advocate an integral relationship between encoding of temporal information and linguistic processing in the brain. All such explanations must accommodate the evident {{ability of the}} perceptual system to process both slow and fast time scales in speech. However most cortical neurons are limited in their capability to precisely synchronise to temporal <b>modulations</b> at <b>rates</b> faster than about 50 Hz. Hence, a central question in auditory neurophysiology concerns how {{the full range of}} perceptually relevant <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> might be encoded in the cerebral cortex. Here we show with concurrent noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements that the human auditory cortex transitions between a phase-locked (PL) mode of responding to <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> below about 50 Hz, and a non-phase-locked (NPL) mode at higher rates. Precisely such dual response modes are predictable from the behaviours of single neurons in auditory cortices of non-human primates. Our data point to a common mechanistic explanation for the single neuron and MEG/EEG results and support the hypothesis that two distinct types of neuronal encoding mechanisms are employed by the auditory cortex to represent a wide range of temporal <b>modulation</b> <b>rates.</b> This dual encoding model allows slow and fast modulations in speech to be processed in parallel and is therefore consistent with theoretical frameworks in which slow temporal modulations (such as rhythm or syllabic structure) are akin to the contours or edges of visual objects, whereas faster modulations (such as periodicity pitch or phonemic structure) are more like visual texture. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of a signal in the N 0 Sπ binaural configuration gives rise to fluctuations in interaural phase and amplitude. Sensitivity to these individual cues was measured by applying sinusoidal amplitude modulation (AM) or quasi-frequency modulation (QFM) to a band of noise. Discrimination between interaurally in-phase and out-of-phase modulation was measured using an adaptive task for narrow bands of noise at center frequencies from 250 to 1500 Hz, for <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> of 2 – 40 Hz, and with or without flanking bands of diotic noise. Discrimination thresholds increased steeply for QFM with increasing center frequency, but increased only modestly for AM, and mainly for <b>modulation</b> <b>rates</b> below 10 Hz. Flanking bands of noise increased thresholds for AM, but had no consistent effect for QFM. The results suggest that two underlying mechanisms may support binaural unmasking: one most sensitive to interaural amplitude modulations that is susceptible to across-frequency interference, and a second, most sensitive to interaural phase modulations that is immune to such effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{envelope of}} speech {{is an important}} cue contributing to speech intelligibility. Theories about the neural foundations of speech perception postulate that {{the left and right}} auditory cortices are functionally specialized in analyzing speech envelope information at different time scales: the right hemisphere is thought to be specialized in processing syllable <b>rate</b> <b>modulations,</b> whereas a bilateral or left hemispheric specialization is assumed for phoneme <b>rate</b> <b>modulations.</b> Recently, it has been found that this functional hemispheric asymmetry is different in individuals with language-related disorders such as dyslexia. Most studies were, however, performed in adults and school-aged children, and only a little is known about how neural auditory processing at these specific rates manifests and develops in very young children before reading acquisition. Yet, studying hemispheric specialization for processing syllable and phoneme <b>rate</b> <b>modulations</b> in preliterate children may reveal early neural markers for dyslexia. In the present study, human cortical evoked potentials to syllable and phoneme <b>rate</b> <b>modulations</b> were measured in 5 -year-old children at high and low hereditary risk for dyslexia. The results demonstrate a right hemispheric preference for processing syllable <b>rate</b> <b>modulations</b> and a symmetric pattern for phoneme <b>rate</b> <b>modulations,</b> regardless of hereditary risk for dyslexia. These results suggest that, while hemispheric specialization for processing syllable <b>rate</b> <b>modulations</b> seems to be mature in prereading children, hemispheric specialization for phoneme <b>rate</b> <b>modulation</b> processing may still be developing. These findings could have important implications for the development of phonological and reading skills. status: publishe...|$|R
