5|$|Being in {{the genus}} Acinonyx, the <b>morphology</b> of the cheetah differs notably {{from the big}} cats (genus Panthera). The face and the jaw are unusually {{shortened}} and the sagittal crest is poorly developed, possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed. In fact, the skull resembles that of the smaller cats. Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine, {{in contrast to the}} stiff and short one of other large felids. A 2001 study of felid <b>morphology</b> stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar <b>morphology</b> of the cheetah. Interestingly, the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in <b>morphology</b> as well as behaviour. For example, the cheetah has a relatively long snout, long legs and deep chest, tough foot pads and blunt, semi-retractable claws; moreover, its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids. In the 2001 study, it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf.

Even though such extreme <b>morphologies</b> are relatively rare, the craniate trophic system provides many examples of this evolutionary trend despite its highly integrated nature and intrinsic complexity. In this article, as {{an introduction to the}} special issue on functional consequences of extreme adaptations of the trophic apparatus in craniates, we survey case studies highlighting the occurrence of extreme <b>morphologies</b> in the trophic system in craniates and briefly review a number of associated conceptual issues: (1) Are extreme <b>morphologies</b> associated with constrained functional versatility? (2) Do high-performance systems necessarily involve extreme morphological adaptations? and (3) Do extreme <b>morphologies</b> limit functional and ecological capacities? An overview of the case studies presented here shows that the craniate trophic system is a suitable model system to explore the evolution of extreme <b>morphologies</b> but currently provides no clear-cut answers to conceptual issues addressed...|$|R

40|$|Self-assembly of {{proteins}} into amyloid aggregates displays a broad diversity of <b>morphologies,</b> {{both at the}} protofibrillar and final fibrillar species. These polymorphic species can coexist at fixed experimental conditions, and their relative abundance can be controlled by changing the solvent composition, or stirring the solution.

Here we investigate the nucleation of distinct fibril <b>morphologies</b> using computer simulations of a simplified model of an amyloid polypeptide. Counterintuitively, the energetically less favorable fibril <b>morphologies</b> nucleate more frequently than the <b>morphologies</b> of higher stability for models with low aggregation propensity.

Among the new emerging nanofabrication methods, bottom-up self assembly of Block Copolymers (BCPs) is gaining significant popularity among the researchers and the semiconductor industries. BCP self assembly has many advantages among which, low processing cost, high resolution, and large scale processing are the more prominent ones. Controlling the polymer fraction in the BCP mix leads to variety of different <b>morphologies,</b> these <b>morphologies</b> {{can be used to}} create nanofabrication masks and templates.

Stratified epithelia serve as a great context to study the spatial aspects of the stem cell niche and cell lineages by organizing into layers of different cell types. Several types of stratified epithelia develop <b>morphologies</b> with advantageous, protruding structures where stem cells reside, such as rete pegs and palisades of Vogt. Here, multistage, spatial cell lineage models for epithelial stratification are used to study how the stem cell niche influences epithelial <b>morphologies.</b> When the stem cell niche forms along a rigid basal lamina, relatively regular <b>morphologies</b> are maintained. In contrast, stem cell niche formation along a free-moving basal lamina may prompt distorted epithelial <b>morphologies</b> with stem cells accumulating at the tips of fingerlike structures that form.

Overall, our work provides {{an understanding of how}} stratified epithelia may attain distorted <b>morphologies</b> and sheds light on the importance of the spatial aspects of the stem cell niche...|$|R
