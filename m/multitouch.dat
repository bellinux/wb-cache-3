5|$|Apple reentered the mobile-computing {{market in}} 2007 with the iPhone. Smaller than the (not yet announced) iPad and {{featuring}} {{a camera and}} mobile phone, it pioneered the <b>multitouch</b> finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple’s iOS mobile operating system.|$|E
25|$|Laptops today feature <b>multitouch</b> touchpads {{that can}} sense {{in some cases}} up to five fingers simultaneously, {{providing}} more options for input, {{such as the ability}} to bring up the context menu by tapping two fingers, dragging two fingers for scrolling, or gestures for zoom in/out or rotate.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Apple {{announced}} and released {{a completely new}} mouse called the Apple Magic Mouse, built with an aluminum base with a <b>multitouch</b> panel. Like the trackpads on the Macbooks, this new version also introduced gestures. This version uses two AA batteries and was priced at $69.|$|E
25|$|The HP TouchPad has a 9.7inch, 1024×768 pixel, Gorilla Glass <b>multitouch</b> {{capacitive}} touch screen. Interaction can be by finger or a capacitive stylus, {{available for}} separate purchase. The TouchPad's virtual keyboard can be configured {{to one of}} four preset sizes, and has a number row {{on top of the}} common QWERTY layout. The TouchPad also features an InvenSense 3-axis gyroscope.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft PixelSense (formerly called Microsoft Surface) is an {{interactive}} surface computing platform that allows {{one or more}} people to use and touch real-world objects, and share digital content at the same time. The PixelSense platform consists of software and hardware products that combine vision based <b>multitouch</b> PC hardware, 360-degree multiuser application design, and Windows software to create a natural user interface (NUI).|$|E
500|$|The Dream's {{exterior}} uses a soft, matte plastic shell, and {{was made}} available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive [...] "chin" [...] on the bottom, which houses 5 navigation buttons ("Call", [...] "Home", [...] "Menu", [...] "Back", and [...] "End Call") and a clickable trackball {{in the center}} {{which can be used}} for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a [...] capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320×480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard—as the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting <b>multitouch</b> at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove <b>multitouch</b> support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack, requiring an adapter for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) [...] "ExtUSB" [...] port located {{on the bottom of the}} device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus.|$|E
500|$|Campbell of TouchArcade {{wrote that}} the iOS port was [...] "always meant to be" [...] due to the {{tactility}} of the game's puzzles. Campbell added that iOS <b>multitouch</b> changed how players could interact with the puzzles, though it did not change any of the solutions. The reviewer {{wrote that the}} controls were intuitive and designed for experimenting, {{as there is no}} tutorial. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku similarly wrote that the game helped him remember [...] "how wonderfully tactile the iPad can be".|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the open}} source nature of the Android platform, the Dream became a popular target for modding. Shortly {{after the release of}} the Dream, {{developers}} discovered a software exploit which would allow a user to gain superuser access to the phone—a process which would be referred to as [...] "rooting". As a parallel to [...] "jailbreaking" [...] on iOS devices, root access would enable users to perform tweaks and other changes at the system level that cannot be performed under normal circumstances (such as adding auto-rotation, and installing a custom kernel that restored the aforementioned <b>multitouch</b> support).|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{features}} a [...] 960 by 640pixel <b>multitouch</b> Retina display. It has two volume buttons and a ring/silent {{switch on the}} left side. On the top left there is a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microphone that is used for both noise cancellation during calls and when in speakerphone/FaceTime (video calling) mode. The lock/power button is situated on the top right edge of the device. The {{right side of the}} device has a Micro-SIM card slot. The bottom of the device {{features a}} speaker output on the right and a microphone input on the left with Apple's proprietary 30-pin dock connector in the center. The [...] supports video out via AirPlay and various Apple A/V cables. Supported video formats include H.264 (1080p 30 frames per second maximum), MPEG-4 video, and motion JPEG (M-JPEG).|$|E
500|$|At a lull {{in-between}} projects, programmer Eric Johnson of Semi Secret Software {{found the}} open source code and ported {{the game to}} iPad in a weekend before notifying Wohlwend. At the time, Wohlwend {{did not have an}} iOS device to test the port, and had to purchase an iPad. Johnson's iPad version spurred Wohlwend to consider how Hundreds would work with <b>multitouch</b> and cooperative play, and Semi Secret's Adam Saltsman to consider a Hundreds collaborative iOS release. The project was intended to be a quick level expansion, but quickly surpassed its several month estimate. Wohlwend and Saltsman extended the game's mechanics with new circles and puzzles, and many of their implemented ideas were later removed. Wohlwend was happy with the final result and credited the game's [...] "emergent interaction" [...] qualities to Saltsman. They built on each other's level designs, though Wohlwend said that Saltsman made [...] "basically all the levels". The new team enjoyed working with each other.|$|E
500|$|Edge {{thought the}} game to be [...] "an astoundingly {{harmonious}} mix of art and design" [...] and said its [...] "simple premise" [...] is [...] "perfectly suited for a <b>multitouch</b> screen". The magazine noted that the game occasionally becomes one of patience and not skill due {{to the degree of}} entropy in each level. Dan Ryckert of Game Informer noted Hundreds as one of the better examples of games that successfully [...] "embraced the simplicity of touch control", such that translation to traditional controller would be [...] "virtually impossible". He appreciated the way the game slowly introduced the new circle types, though he did not like how his hand occasionally obscured the screen. (For this reason, reviewers preferred the iPad version for its larger screen.) Multiple reviewers liked how the game continually renewed itself with the slow introduction of new game elements, though Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer described the core gameplay as [...] "one-note" [...] and criticized its lack of addictive loops that keep players interested. Mike Rose of Gamasutra compared the game as the inverse of Jezzball.|$|E
500|$|The Dream was {{released}} to mixed reviews. The {{design of the}} Dream {{was considered to be}} solid and robust; Joshua Topolsky of Engadget considered its hardware design a contrast to that of the iPhone, due to its numerous navigation buttons (in comparison to just a home button) and its [...] "charming, retro-future look; like a gadget in a 1970's sci-fi movie set in the year 2038." [...] The Dream's keyboard, as the only method of text input prior to Android 1.5's introduction of a virtual keyboard, was considered to be sufficient, although some felt that its keys were too small. Its display was considered sufficient for a phone of its class, but John Brandon of TechRadar felt that it was not good enough for watching videos due to its poor contrast and small size in comparison to the iPhone. Android itself was considered to still be in its infancy (primarily due to its bare-bones functionality in certain areas, limited application catalog, lack of <b>multitouch</b> gestures, or syncing with certain enterprise platforms), but showed promise through its customizable interface, increased flexibility over iOS, its notification system, ability to display security permissions when downloading apps, and its heavy integration with Google services.|$|E
500|$|Programmer Eric Johnson of Semi Secret {{found the}} open source version and ported {{the game to}} iPad in a weekend before notifying Wohlwend. At the time, Wohlwend {{did not have an}} iOS device to test the port, and had to {{purchase}} an iPad. Johnson's iPad version spurred Wohlwend to consider how Hundreds would work with <b>multitouch</b> and cooperative play, and Semi Secret's Adam Saltsman to consider a Hundreds collaboration, especially as the company lacked the funds to work on a new game from scratch. They began to work towards an iOS release. Saltsman expected Wohlwend to work with Johnson to finish the game in a few months by adding new [...] "circle types" [...] and designing 100 discrete puzzles, but extended that estimate and joined the project himself in that time. Wohlwend and Saltsman extended the game's mechanics with new circles and puzzles, but their results were clunky. Saltsman recalled wanting to add atop the game's [...] "basic building blocks", which took them off-track after a few months and took a few additional months to recover. Wohlwend wanted to make the game easier than the Flash version and so proposed ten new circles that were not adopted. However, he was happy with the final result and credited the game's [...] "emergent interaction" [...] qualities to Saltsman. They built on each other's level designs, though Wohlwend said that Saltsman made [...] "basically all the levels". The new team enjoyed working with each other.|$|E
2500|$|Windows 7 was {{primarily}} {{intended to be}} an incremental upgrade to the operating system intending to address Windows Vista's poor critical reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility. Windows 7 continued improvements on Windows Aero (the user interface introduced in Windows Vista) {{with the addition of}} a redesigned taskbar that allows applications to be [...] "pinned" [...] to it, and new window management features. Other new features were added to the operating system, including libraries, the new file sharing system HomeGroup, and support for <b>multitouch</b> input. A new [...] "Action Center" [...] interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center.|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft Surface 1.0, {{the first}} version of PixelSense, was {{announced}} on May 29, 2007 at the D5 Conference. It shipped to customers in 2008 as an end-to-end solution with Microsoft producing and selling the combined hardware/software platform. [...] It is a 30-inch (76cm) 4:3 rear projection display (1024×768) with integrated PC and five near-infrared (IR) cameras that can see fingers and objects placed on the display. The display is placed in a horizontal orientation, giving it a table-like appearance. The product and its applications are designed so that several people can approach the display from all sides to simultaneously share and interact with digital content. The cameras’ vision capabilities enable the product to see a near-IR image of what’s placed on the screen, captured at approximately 60 times per second. The Surface platform processing identifies three types of objects touching the screen: fingers, tags, and blobs. Raw vision data is also available and can be used in applications. The device is optimized to recognize 52 simultaneous <b>multitouch</b> points of contact. Microsoft Corporation produced the hardware and software for the Microsoft Surface 1.0 product. Sales of Microsoft Surface 1.0 were discontinued in 2011 in anticipation of the release of the Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface and the Microsoft Surface 2.0 software platform.|$|E
2500|$|The Start menu may be {{launched}} either by pressing [...] (the Windows key) on a keyboard or its equivalent on a tablet device, pressing CTRL+ESC on a keyboard, or by {{clicking on the}} visual Start button. With the exception of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Start button {{can be found on}} the taskbar. On versions before Windows Vista, the Start Button consisted of the word [...] "Start" [...] and the Windows Logo (the word [...] "Start" [...] was localized for each different language version of the system, for instance, reading Avvio in Italian). On the Windows Vista and Windows 7 desktop, the word [...] "Start" [...] has been replaced by a blue Windows [...] "orb" [...] logo. However, the user can revert to displaying the word [...] "Start" [...] and the Windows Logo by setting the theme to Windows Classic. The Start button on Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 is initially moved from the traditional taskbar to [...] "charms", a hidden secondary taskbar located to the right of the screen (accessed by swiping in from the right on <b>multitouch</b> devices, or positioning the mouse in one of the right corners of the screen and sliding up or down). The Start screen is accessed either by that button or by clicking the lower left corner of the screen. Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restore the button back to its original place without removing the new button in the charms.|$|E
