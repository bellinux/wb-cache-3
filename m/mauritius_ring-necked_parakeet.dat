40|$|International audienceThe <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula krameri), {{native of}} Asia and Africa, {{is a very}} {{successful}} invasive species in Europe: it has been present there for over 50 years. A recent study showed that European invasive populations occupy a colder climatic niche than in their native range but the establishment of this tropical species in temperate regions remains unexplained. Two main hypotheses may explain the success of <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> in Europe: admixture between individuals from different origins and/or rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated with molecular data the origin of European populations of <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> to assess whether these populations result from admixture between individuals from different source populations. We also investigated the morphology of individuals from European populations and from the native range to assess whether the invasive populations have morphologically diverged from their source and could have become adapted to European conditions. We found evidence of admixture {{in some of the}} European populations but not all of them. Admixture between individuals from different origins within European populations thus cannot explain alone their invasive success. Conversely, we found that the morphology of the individuals from European populations has diverged from the morphology of native individuals, in a similar direction. Rapid adaptation to European environmental conditions via phenotypic plasticity or natural selection could thus be a factor explaining the invasive success of <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> in Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{world is}} now {{thought to have}} entered into a sixth mass {{extinction}} event, which unlike previous mass extinctions, is entirely driven by human impacts. The early colonisation of humans has led {{to as many as}} a thousand endemic bird species becoming extinct, while increasing human mediated transport of species around the world has led to invasive species becoming one of the largest global conservation challenges of today. Studies in molecular ecology can help us to unravel how evolutionary processes are important for informing conservation and invasion biology by understanding genetic mechanisms that enable populations to grow and adapt in a changing world. As genetic diversity is essential for the persistence of populations, this thesis aims to understand how species respond, at a genetic level, to human-driven events such as the reduction of a population to a small size, or the introduction of a species into a novel environment. The findings demonstrate the important use of genetic markers for phylogenetic reconstruction and understanding population structure. These phylogenetic reconstructions examine taxonomic distinctiveness and patterns of evolution, and allow the identification of ancestral origins for invasive <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets.</b> Evidence from genetic phylogroups, trade data and drivers of population growth, highlight how multiple introductions and patterns of climate matching between the native and invasive ranges of <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets,</b> are mechanisms for invasion success. In contrast to mild genetic bottleneck effects, high levels of diversity and the avoidance of problems associated with small population size within populations of invasive <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet,</b> the endemic Seychelles black parrot exhibited a reduction in population size and reduced levels of genetic diversity over time. Moreover, the inclusion of new genetic data for a number of extinct parrot species enabled an examination of the loss of broader scale phylogenetic diversity, important for ecosystem function, as a result of extinctions of endemic species and invasions of <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets.</b> The findings from this thesis have already been applied to conservation and invasion biology by contributing to the reclassification of the endemic Seychelles black parrot, and to improving the ability of ecological niche models to predict areas suitable for future invasions of <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets.</b> Furthermore they provide a novel approach to identifying potential candidates as ecological replacements to restore ecosystem function and lost phylogenetic diversity...|$|R

40|$|Alien {{species are}} {{considered}} a cause of biodiversity loss throughout the world. An important but often overlooked form of competition with native species is the parasite-mediated one. Introduced species may bring their own parasites from their native ranges (spillover) or get native parasites from native species, thus increasing the parasites’ spread and transmission risk (spillback). Thus, a complete knowledge of parasites hosted by introduced species is important to assess and to possibly prevent impacts. <b>Ring-necked</b> and monk <b>parakeets</b> have been introduced in many European countries, where they established a number of alien reproductive populations. We sampled 21 <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> and 7 monk parakeets from Italy and identified 35 arthropod ectoparasites belonging to five species. Amongst those, one species was native to India (Neopsittaconirmus lybartota), where alien populations of <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> may have been originated, and one species from South America (Paragoniocotes fulvofasciatus), which is typically found of the monk parakeet in its native range.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} the results of object-based classifications assessing the potential of bi-temporal Pléiades images for mapping broadleaf and coniferous tree species potentially used by the <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> Psittacula krameri for nesting in the urban area of Marseille, France. The first classification was performed based solely on a summer Pléiades image (acquired on 28 July 2015) and the second classification based on bi-temporal Pléiades images (a spring image acquired on 24 March 2016 and the summer image). An ensemble of spectral and textural features was extracted from both images and two machine-learning classifiers were used, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Regardless of the classifiers, model results suggest that classification based on bi-temporal Pléiades images produces more satisfying results, with an overall accuracy 11. 5 – 13. 9 % higher than classification using the single-date image. Textural and spectral features extracted from the blue and the NIR bands were consistently ranked among the most important features. Regardless of the classification scheme, RF slightly outperforms SVM. RF classification using bi-temporal Pléiades images allows identifying 98. 5 % of the tree species used by the <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> for nesting, highlighting the promising value of remote sensing techniques to assess the ecological requirements of fauna in urban areas...|$|R
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{species can}} take {{advantage}} of resources unexploited by natives (opportunism hypothesis) or they can exploit the same resources but more aggressively or efficiently (competition hypothesis), thus impacting native species. However, invasive species tend to exploit anthropogenic habitats that are inefficiently used by natives such as urban environments. Focusing on the <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula krameri), one of the most invasive birds worldwide, we combined observations of interspecific aggressions, species-specific cavity-nest preferences and the spatial distribution of the native cavity-nesting vertebrate community to determine the invasion process as well as its potential impacts on native species in a Mediterranean city. Our results support the competition hypothesis, suggesting that <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> are outcompeting native species sharing nest-site preferences. Parakeets initiated and won most interspecific aggressions, which were directed towards competitors but also towards predators. This behaviour could explain the spatial arrangement of natives, with most bird species breeding close to parakeets possibly to take advantage of their effective antipredatory behaviour. However, temporal and spatial patterns of segregation suggest that a threatened bat species is negatively affected by parakeets. This demonstrates that common species gain benefits and threatened ones (in this study, a bat and possibly a falcon) lose nest sites due to invaders. Therefore, the conservation status of the native species that pay the costs of competition with invaders should be considered. This scenario of winners and losers may, however, shift towards mor...|$|R

40|$|Invasive species {{present a}} major threat to global biodiversity. Understanding genetic {{patterns}} and evolutionary processes that reinforce successful establishment is para- mount for elucidating mechanisms underlying biological invasions. Among birds, the <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula krameri) {{is one of the most}} successful invasive spe- cies, established in over 35 countries. However, little is known about the evolutionary genetic origins of this species and what population genetic signatures tell us about patterns of invasion. We reveal the ancestral origins of populations across the invasive range and explore the potential influence of climate and propagule pressure from the pet trade on observed genetic patterns. <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> samples representing the ancestral native range (n = 96) were collected from museum specimens, and modern samples from the invasive range (n = 855) were gathered from across Europe, Mauritius and Seychelles, and sequenced for two mitochondrial DNA markers comprising 868 bp of cytochrome b and control region, and genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. Invasive populations comprise birds that originate predominantly from Pakistan and northern areas of India. Haplotypes associated with more northerly distribution limits in the ancestral native range were more prevalent in invasive populations in Europe, and the predominance of Asian haplotypes in Europe is consistent with the higher number of Asian birds transported by the pet trade outside the native range. Success- ful establishment of invasive species is likely to be underpinned by a combination of environmental and anthropogenic influences...|$|R
40|$|Almost 90 % {{of global}} bird extinctions have {{occurred}} on islands. The loss of endemic spe- cies from island systems can dramatically alter evolutionary trajectories of insular species biodiversity, {{resulting in a}} loss of evolutionary diversity important for species adaptation to changing environments. The Western Indian Ocean islands have been the scene of evolution for a large number of endemic parrots. Since their discovery in the 16 th cen- tury, many of these parrots have become extinct or have declined in numbers. Alongside the extinction of species, a number of the Indian Ocean islands have experienced coloni- zation by highly invasive parrots, such as the <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>Parakeet</b> Psittacula krameri. Such extinctions and invasions can, on an evolutionary timescale, drive changes in spe- cies composition, genetic diversity and turnover in phylogenetic diversity, all of which can have important impacts on species potential for adaptation to changing environmen- tal and climatic conditions. Using mtDNA cytochrome b data, we resolve the taxonomic placement of three extinct Indian Ocean parrots: the Rodrigues Psittacula exsul, Sey- chelles Psittacula wardi and Reunion Parakeets Psittacula eques. This case study quantifies how the extinction of these species has resulted in lost historical endemic phylogenetic diversity and reduced levels of species richness, and illustrates how it is being replaced by non-endemic invasive forms such as the <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>Parakeet.</b> Finally, we use our phylogenetic framework to identify and recommend a number of phylogenetically appro- priate ecological replacements for the extinct parrots. Such replacements may be intro- duced once invasive forms have been cleared, to rejuvenate ecosystem function and restore lost phylogenetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{mitigate}} the threat invasive species pose to ecosystem functioning, reli- able risk assessment is paramount. Spatially explicit predictions of invasion risk obtained through bioclimatic envelope models calibrated with native species distribution data can {{play a critical role}} in invasive species management. Fore- casts of invasion risk to novel environments, however, remain controversial. Here, we assess how species’ association with human-modified habitats in the native range and within-taxon niche structure shape the distribution of invasive populations at biogeographical scales and influence the reliability of predictions of invasion risk. Location Africa, Asia and Europe. Methods We use 1200 native and invasive <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula krameri) occurrences and associated data on establishment success in combi- nation with mtDNA-based phylogeographic structure to assess niche dynam- ics during biological invasion and to generate predictions of invasion risk. Niche dynamics were quantified in a gridded environmental space while bioclimatic models were created using the biomod 2 ensemble modelling framework. Results <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> show considerable niche expansion into climates colder than their native range. Only when incorporating a measure of human modification of habitats within the native range do bioclimatic envelope mod- els yield credible predictions of invasion risk for parakeets across Europe. Inva- sion risk derived from models that account for differing niche requirements of phylogeographic lineages and those that do not achieve similar statistical accu- racy, but there are pronounced differences in areas predicted to be susceptible for invasion. Main conclusions Information on within-taxon niche structure and especially association with humans in the native range can substantially improve predic- tive models of invasion risk. To provide policymakers with robust predictions of invasion risk, including these factors into bioclimatic envelope models is recommended...|$|R

Giardial trophozoites were observed mainly in the duodenum of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). Knemidocoptic mites burrowed into the epidermis producing proliferative dermatitis in 25 budgerigars and l African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus erithacus). This ectoparasite often infested the skin around the cloaca. Coccidiosis was seen only in the small intestines of the finch (Poephila gouldiae gouldiae), African Grey Parrot, Rainbow lory (Trichoglossus haematodus), Indian <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula krameri manillensis) and peach-faced lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis).

40|$|The <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (RNP), (Psittacula krameri), is an {{invasive}} species in Great Britain (GB) which is undergoing rapid population {{expansion in the}} wild. Although {{it has been suggested}} that RNPs could be a potential source of infectious disease, little research has been done on the pathogens infecting this species in GB. Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), caused by beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), is an important infectious disease of psittacines, including captive RNPs, in GB and elsewhere. A wild RNP with marked feather abnormalities observed in an urban garden in London was euthanased and examined post mortem. Plucked contour feathers and pooled liver and spleen were PCR positive for BFDV DNA. Histopathological examination of affected skin demonstrated BFDV-compatible lesions. A feather from another RNP from a different location also was PCR-positive for BFDV. This is the first report of PBFD in a wild free living bird in GB. BFDV only affects psittacines; therefore, there is no known risk to native British birds. The presence of BFDV in free-living RNPs, however, could pose a disease threat to captive psittacines. Further work is required to determine the distribution and impact of BFDV infection in free-living RNPs in GB.

A plethora of different IAS risk and/or impact assessment protocols have been proposed, but it remains unclearwhether, how and why the outcomes of such assessment protocols may differ. Location Europe. Methods Here, we present an in-depth evaluation and informed assessment ofthe consistency of four prominent protocols for assessing IAS impacts (EICAT,GISS, Harmonia+ and NNRA), using two non-native parrots in Europe: thewidespread <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula krameri) and the rapidly spreadingmonk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus). Results Our findings show that the procedures used to assess impacts mayinfluence assessment outcomes. We find that robust IAS prioritization can beobtained by assessing species based on their most severe documented impacts,as all protocols yield consistent outcomes across impact categories. Additiveimpact scoring offers complementary, more subtle information that may beespecially relevant for guiding management decisions regarding already establishedinvasive alien species. Such management decisions will also strongly benefitfrom consensus approaches that reduce disagreement between experts,fostering the uptake of scientific advice into policy-making decisions. Main conclusions Invasive alien species assessments should take advantage ofthe capacity of consensus assessments to consolidate discussion and agreementbetween experts. Our results suggest that decision-makers could use the assessmentprotocol most fit for their purpose, on the condition they apply a precautionaryapproach by considering the most severe impacts only.

40|$|Aim: Although {{propagule}} {{pressure and}} environmental constraints {{are among the}} most important factors determining invasion success, studies considering both factors simultaneously are scarce. Moreover, while recent evidence suggests that the environmental requirements of individuals from different geographical ranges may be different, the role of propagule origin in invasions has been largely overlooked. Our aim was to disentangle the relative role of niche requirements, propagule origin and propagule pressure on the distribution of an invasive bird species. Location: Europe, Asia and Africa. Methods: We used species distribution models, niche and deviance partitioning analyses to investigate the relative roles of propagule pressure (international trade), origin of individuals (Asian or African), and environmental constraints in determining the distribution of invasive <b>ring-necked</b> <b>parakeets</b> across 25 European countries. Results: Differences between niches of native Asian and African parakeets were found, with the Asian niche matching the European niche more closely. In the invasive European range, distribution of parakeets was mainly explained by the pure effect of year of first importation (as a proxy of time since first introduction), the pure effect of geographical origin of propagules and the joint effect of environmental suitability and year of first importation, but not by overall propagule pressure. Only when taking into account the fraction of individuals whose native niche fitted better the European conditions - Asian parakeets - was the role of propagule pressure highlighted by models. Main conclusions: While environmental-based predictions calibrated on native ranges can constitute a useful first-screening tool, incorporating information about propagule pressure and especially about the variability in its geographical origin may result in a much more thorough assessment of invasion risk. Trade data reveal as a valuable proxy of propagule origin and pressure that can be combined with niche modelling for predicting the fate of trade-mediated invasions in a variety of organisms.

40|$|Alien {{species are}} the second {{leading cause of}} the global {{biodiversity}} crisis, after habitat loss and fragmentation. Popular pet species, such as parrots and parakeets (Aves, Psittaciformes), are often introduced outside their native range {{as a result of}} the pet trade. On escape from captivity, some such species, such as the <b>ring–necked</b> <b>parakeet</b> and the monk parakeet, are highly invasive and successfully compete with native species. Populations of Amazon parrots (Amazona spp.) can be found throughout the world, but data on their status, distribution and impact are incomplete. We gathered and reviewed the available information concerning global trade, distribution, abundance and ecology of Amazon parrots outside their native range. Our review shows that at least nine species of Amazon parrots have established populations outside their original range of occurrence throughout the world (in Europe, South Africa, the Caribbean islands, Hawaii, and North and South America). Their elusive behaviour and small population size suggest that the number of alien nuclei could be underestimated or at undetected. Despite international trade bans, the large trade of wild–caught Amazon parrots in past decades appears to have contributed to the establishment of alien populations worldwide. Establishment success seems to differ geographically. While European populations are still small and growing slowly, USA populations are large and expanding geographically. This difference is not related to large propagule pressure (trade) but possibly to a better niche match between native and introduced ranges. Amazona aestiva is the most frequently encountered Amazona parrot, with at least eight alien populations reported to date. All these populations, with the exception of those in the USA where the climate is more suitable for their establishment, are composed of a low number of individuals even though they have been established for a long period of time. Further research is required as little information is available on the ecology and potential impact of these alien populations...|$|R
