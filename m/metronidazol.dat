Results: we considered 80 patients (43 - GES and 37 - MS); Mean age - 68, 6 ± 17, 7 years; 52, 5 % were male; Antibiotic treatment in the previous 3 months - 85 %; Mean time of antibiotic treatment - 10, 5 ± 6, 1 days. Most Commonly Involved Antibiotics: cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and quinolones. Associated risk factors: renal insufficiency (22, 5 %); cardiac insufficiency (22, 5 %); previously dependent patient (36, 3 %). Diagnostic procedures: toxin search- 58 patients (in 36), colonoscopy - 62 (in 53); culture - 23 (in 17). The mortality rate was 18, 8 % (n = 15); recurrence rate - 10 % (n = 8). Therapeutics: <b>metronidazol</b> - 37 patients (46, 3 %); vancomycin - 24 (30 %); <b>metronidazol</b> + vancomycin – 12 (15 %).

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effect of azithromycin on {{expression of}} TLR- 4, TNFalpha i TGFbeta in bowel mucosa in murine model of experimental colitis induced by enema 2, 4 –dinitrofluorobenzen. Immunohistochemistry was performed from paraffin embedded murine intestinal tissue for TLR- 4, TNFalpha i TGFbeta. Experimental groups of animals were treated with azithromycin, metronidazole or methylprednisolone for five days, respectively and the control group was the group of healthy mice and group of mice with experimental colitis. Results of this study showed the changes in expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TLR- 4, TNFalpha i TGFbeta) in manipulation of experimental colitis induced by DNFB. The expected differences in expression markers: significantly increased expression of TNFα i TLR 4, and significantlly decreased expression of TGFβ in bowel mucosa in a murine model of experimental colitis compared to bowel mucosa of healthy mice. The results of this study documented the differences in expression of observed markers; smaller expression of TNFα i TLR 4 in bowel mucosa treated with methilprednizolone and azithromycin and larger expression of TGFβ in bowel mucosa of mice with experimental colitis treted with methilprednizolone, azithromycin and <b>metronidazol.</b> In murine bowel mucosa treated with <b>metronidazol</b> no differences were noted compared with group with experimental colitis. <b>Metronidazol</b> showed weak antiinflammatory effect compared to methilprednizolone and azithromycin. The effect of treatment on expression of markers documented that the effect of metronidazole on the reduction of TNF and TLR 4 expression on mononuclear cells of submucosa was significantly weaker than the effect of methylprednisolone and azithromycin. There was no significant difference between methylprednisolone and the effect of azithromycin on the reduction of TNF and TLR 4 expression. There was no significant difference between the effect of methylprednisolone, azithromycin and metronidazole on expression of TGFβ. The antiinflammatory effect of azithromycin was not significantly different from the antiinflammatory effect of methylprednisolone.

40|$|Background: Giardia lamblia {{is one of}} {{the most}} common protozoal infections in human {{especially}} children. <b>Metronidazol</b> (MTZ) is the drug of choice for treatment of giardiasis; its chemical composition possesses major threats and is becoming less sensitive. This study aimed to search for natural extracts alternative to MTZ. Methods: In-vivo effects of dichloromethane extracts of ginger and cinnamon in doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg/day separately were studied on 30 experimentally in-fected albino rats divided into 6 groups (5 rats each). Plant extracts were started on the 6 th day post infection for 7 successive days. The study was evaluated by fecal cyst and intestinal trophozoite counts, histopathology, scanning and transmission electron microscopic examinations of the small intestinal mucosa. Results: Ginger and cinnamon caused reduction of fecal cyst and trophozoites counts. Histopathology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after exposure to each extract revealed evident im-provement of intestinal mucosal damage produced by G. lamblia infection and di...|$|E
40|$|In years 1999 – 2000, we {{examined}} 83 patients {{from the region}} of Eastern Slovakia and tried to set {{the cause of the}} failure in treatment of Helicobacter pylori [HP]. Apart from the serology, microscopy, cultivation, and rapid urea test [RUT], {{we examined}} also the sensitivity in vitro on antibiotics [ATB], which are used in eradication schemes of treatment Hp. It includes: C aritromycin [CLA], Azitromycin [AZI], Amoxycilin [AMO], and <b>Metronidazol</b> [MET]. Into the group, we also involved patients who were at least once [43. 3 %], twice [37. 2 %], or more times [6. 3 %] re-cured by the triple combination – two ATB with blockation of proton pump [PPI], at our or some other surgery within the district, and at whom the positivity of at least two tests on HP after the cure overlasted. We failed in stating the number of HP eradication in 13. 2 % of patients. Aim It was to state out, which drug of the triple combination was “responsible...|$|E
40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled trial {{was conducted in}} one unit of Gynecology and Obstetrics Dept. of a Govt. hospital by giving a single dose preoperative prophylactic antibiotic {{and the results were}} compared with a control group who received a conventional prophylactic regimen of antibiotic combination. A total of 60 samples were taken from the patients currently admitted and undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy in one unit of the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology of a Govt. hospital for this trial and they were divided into two groups- 30 Cases and 30 Control. Case group were given a single dose cephradine 1 gm IV just before induction of anesthesia. Control group were given Inj. Ciprof/oxacin 200 mg IV 12 hrsly plus inj. <b>Metronidazol</b> 500 mg 8 hrsly till oral feeding followed by oral tab. Ciprof/oxacin 500 mg 12 hrsly plus tab. <b>Metronidazol</b> 400 mg 8 hrsly in the remaining days which was then practicing in that gynecology unit of the Govt. hospital. Variables measured for the trial were total cost and duration of antimicrobial therapy, rate of postoperative infection and side effects of antimicrobial therapy. While comparing the outcome between the case and control group, it was observed that both the duration and cost (P< 0. 001) and also the side effects (P< 0. 05) of antimicrobial therapy were significantly higher in control group than the case group (duration of antimicrobial therapy was 2. 9 ± 0. 88 days in case group and 8. 9 ± 0. 58 days in control group and cost of antimicrobial therapy was 113. 06 ± 24. 53 taka in case group and 957. 376 ± 32. 05 taka in control group). But the rate of post operative infection which is the main objective of giving preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, was significantly higher in case group than the control group (P< 0. 05). But this infection rate could be reduced if the sterilization procedure of the operation theatre and general conditions of the patients were improved. If these risk factors could be minimized, single dose preoperative prophylactic antibiotic could be effectively practiced in our country...|$|E
40|$|Spondylodiscitis in {{childhood}} is rare and has non-specific clinical features, requiring a high index of suspicion. The authors describe a nine month-old female infant, who {{presented at the}} emergency room (ER) with a torticollis for four days, without fever or trauma. Cervical X-rays were normal, and she received symptomatic treatment. Six days after, {{she returned to the}} ER with the same torticollis and also irritability, anorexia, and cervical hyper-extension. The CT scan showed cervical spondylodiscitis (C 6 -C 7) with pre-vertebral abscess. The laboratory results only revealed a slightly elevated Sedimentation Rate. Treatment was systemic vancomycin, gentamicin and <b>metronidazol</b> for six weeks, followed by two weeks of oral flucloxacillin. The causative organism was not identified. The symptoms and the abscess resolved {{during the first week of}} treatment. Five days after finishing the antibiotics the magnetic resonance showed partial C 6 -C 7 fusion, without neurologic compression or functional disability. Cervical spondylodiscitis with abscess is rare, especially in this age group. This case also emphasizes the importance of investigating an acquired persistent torticollis.
