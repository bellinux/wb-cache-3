5|$|Although Jardine {{had retired}} from regular {{first-class}} competition, {{he continued to}} play club cricket. Jardine and his wife initially lived in Kensington but moved to Reading {{after the birth of}} their first child, daughter Fianach. A second daughter, Marion, followed but the family suffered from financial worries. Jardine, as well as working in journalism, earned money from playing bridge. The family also tried unsuccessfully to engage in market gardening. To <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money,</b> Jardine became a salesman with Cable & Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Their father, Richard, {{often took}} Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> for the family. They offered their discoveries {{for sale to}} {{tourists}} on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.|$|E
5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps single mothers overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined {{with the fact that}} most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money.</b> When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

50|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} the major thing holding people back is the {{relative}} smallness of their thoughts, and explains the importance of ''''Thinking positively toward oneself''''.

Schwartz points out that the man was not smarter, more educated or better connected than his colleagues. According to Schwartz, the man expected to sell more so he did.|$|R
25|$|Writers in a {{specialized}} field {{or with a}} narrower appeal have found smaller alternatives to the mass market {{in the form of}} small presses and self-publishing. More recently, these options include print on demand and ebook format. These publishing alternatives provide an avenue for authors who believe that mainstream publishing will not meet their needs or who {{are in a position to}} <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> from direct sales than they could from bookstore sales, such as popular speakers who sell books after speeches. Authors are more readily published by this means due to the much lower costs involved.|$|E
25|$|Hampton's {{story was}} very {{different}} from the one presented by federal prosecutors. He claimed Hutton had, in response to his cash flow problems, come up with the idea to sell not heroin but a fake, perfectly legal, he thought. Previous to the deals with the DEA the two had, he said, already sold it to one gullible buyer and that he solicited the agents in order to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money.</b> At no time had he ever believed the two were actually selling heroin, he claimed. He raised the entrapment defense but proposed an alternate to the standard entrapment instruction.|$|E
25|$|The first generations bought or founded {{their local}} paper for profits and also social and {{political}} influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that {{only one or two}} branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the Los Angeles Times under the Chandler family.|$|E
5000|$|Collectors also usually prefer final artist's proofs {{even when}} they are {{identical}} to the main edition; if nothing else the print may have been presented to a friend by the artist. Prints are generally sold as limited editions, with a print being cheaper than a drawing or painting because the artist/gallery <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> by selling multiples. An artist's proof has special value because of its extra rarity and its possible differences from the [...] "standard" [...] print, factors that are often reflected in its price.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{idea was to}} use existing telephone lines for high speed data communication. DSL and telephone service can coexist on the same phone line and do not interfere with each other. From the Telco's point of view, DSL gives them the ability to sell the same telephone line twice, to the same customer. It is an idea that benefits the telco (who <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>money)</b> and the customer (who gets a high speed data connection {{without the need for}} installation of expensive new cables.) ...|$|R

25|$|An {{article in}} BBC NEWS, states that Ethiopian {{ownership}} of popular coffee designations such as Harrar and Sidamo is acknowledged, {{even if they}} are not registered. Ethiopia fought hard for this acknowledgement mainly to help give its poverty-stricken farmers a chance to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money.</b> Unfortunately, this has not been the case. In 2006, Starbucks says it paid $1.42 per pound for its coffee. The coffee Starbucks bought for $1.42 per pound, had a selling price—after transportation, processing, marketing, store rentals, taxes, and staff salary and benefits—of $10.99 per pound. As of August 2010, the Starbucks website sells only one Ethiopian coffee, which it says is new.|$|E
25|$|KSS {{was in a}} {{situation}} that they concession would expire in 1905. The issued an application for a new two years in advance and offered to take over KKS in the process. This raised a new debate concerning public or private operations, with many Conservative politicians calling for the privatization of KKS. In the 1904 municipal election the issue was raised, with the Liberal Party and the socialist parties running for municipalization of tram operations. Meanwhile, the municipal administration worked with estimates for taking over KSS. A take-over would cost the municipality about NOK2 million, while a sale would bring in about NOK1.6 million. However, as KSS was a profitable company, it was estimated that the municipality would <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> by taking over KSS than selling KKS, estimated at about NOK3 million for the period in question.|$|E
25|$|This {{downward}} trend {{has been demonstrated}} by the conflicts between various agencies and levels of government. This has allowed wood traders to shop for export clearance among the authorities that regulate it. As {{a result of this}} bribery to open periodic trade windows, large-scale exports of illegal precious woods clear customs without much difficulty. Because of the incredibly lucrative nature of recent trades, reports have indicated that government officials have significantly increased the price of export certificates to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> for themselves. This however has not stopped exporters from re-using single-use export certificates for two or three containers of rosewood. Furthermore, some of the certificates and authorizations from various government agencies bear titles found nowhere in any legal text, such as permis de ramassage and permis de carbonisation (collection permit and carbonization permit respectively). Such authorizations are not supported by and clearly conflict with Malagasy law.|$|E

50|$|A {{variant of}} the price {{penetration}} strategy is the bait and hook model (also called the razor and blades business model). A starter product is sold at a very low price but requires more expensive replacements (such as refills) which are sold at a higher price. It is an almost universal tactic in the desktop printer business, with printers selling in the US {{for as little as}} $100 including two ink cartridges (often half-full), which themselves cost around $30 each to replace. Thus, the company <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> from the cartridges than it does for the printer itself.|$|R

25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio {{since the beginning of}} the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid.

25|$|Knievel {{sought to}} <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> from his image. He {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} with just receiving free motorcycles to jump with. Knievel wanted {{to be paid to}} use and promote a company's brand of motorcycles. After Triumph, the motorcycle company he had been jumping with, refused to meet his demands, Knievel started to propose the idea to other manufacturers. American Eagle Motorcycles was the first company to sign Knievel to an endorsement deal. At approximately the same time, Fanfare Films started production of Evel Knievel, a 1971 movie starring George Hamilton as Knievel. There have been two other movies made about Evel: a television pilot made in 1974 starring Sam Elliott, and a made-for-TV film in 2004 starring George Eads. Also in 1974, Evel and Amherst Records released at the Sound City Studios the self-titled album Evel Knievel, which included a press conference, an anti-drug talk for his young fans, and four other tracks.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the suspension, Pottsville was {{prohibited}} from playing a scheduled game against the Providence Steam Roller or from completing its season. Ironically, Frankford was hurriedly substituted for the game at Providence. Meanwhile, Chicago scheduled and won two hastily arranged games against teams that had already disbanded for the season. This was within the NFL's rules at the time; teams were required to play eight league games, after which point they could either wrap up for the season, or schedule additional games to <b>make</b> <b>more</b> <b>money.</b> Hoping for some more cash, the Cardinals arranged to play the Milwaukee Badgers and the Hammond Pros, both of whom had already dispersed. Indeed, the Badgers were unable to bring back their full roster and resorted to substitute four high school players, which was in violation of NFL rules. The NFL heavily sanctioned both Chicago and Milwaukee following their game, {{going so far as to}} force the Badgers owner to sell the team. Carr said they would consider the game for removal from the standings; however, this never happened.|$|E
