At about midnight on 29 November 1878 a black <b>moving</b> <b>mass,</b> several feet high, was moving forwards {{at a rate of}} four or five mph.

25|$|While the {{buildings}} were designed to support enormous static loads, they provided little resistance to the <b>moving</b> <b>mass</b> of the sections above the floors where the collapses initiated. Structural systems respond very differently to static and dynamic loads, and since {{the motion of the}} falling portion began as a free fall through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or 10feet), the structure beneath them was unable to stop the collapses once they began. Indeed, a fall of only half a meter (about 20inches) would have been enough to release the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.|$|E

The BTA-6 and Multi Mirror Telescope had {{demonstrated}} during the 1970s the significant weight (and therefore cost) savings which could be achieved by the alt-azimuth design compared to the traditional equatorial mount for large telescopes. However, the alt-azimuth design requires continuous computer control, compensation for field rotation at each focus, and results in a 0.2 degree radius [...] at zenith where the drive motors cannot keep up with sidereal motion (the drives have a maximum speed of one degree per second in each axis). The mount is so smooth and finely balanced that before the drive motors were installed {{it was possible to}} move the then [...] assembly by hand. During closed loop guiding, the mount is capable of an absolute pointing accuracy of 0.03 arcseconds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical {{study on the}} identification of <b>masses</b> <b>moving</b> on a multi-span continuous beam using the acceleration measurements. In the study, the acceleration measurements are simulated from {{the solution to the}} forward problem of a continuous beam under <b>moving</b> <b>masses,</b> together with the addition of artificially generated measurement noise. In particular, the forward problem for the simulation is solved using the modified beam vibration functions. A simple dynamic force identification procedure using pseudo-inverse and singular value decomposition is first employed to arrive at rough approximations of the <b>moving</b> <b>masses.</b> A genetic algorithm is then used to find the best estimated values of the <b>moving</b> <b>masses</b> by minimizing the errors between the measured accelerations and the reconstructed accelerations from the <b>moving</b> <b>masses</b> in each generation. Five numerical examples are given to demonstrate the robustness of this method. Various possible sources of error including the effects of measurement noise and surface roughness are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

500|$|The {{telescope}} {{is housed in}} an onion-shaped steel dome with an internal diameter of , manufactured by Brittain Steel. The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the centre of rotation is [...] above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing. A conventional up-down 6m-wide shutter with wind-blind, several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control, and a [...] capacity crane (used for moving the primary mirror e.g. for aluminising) are all incorporated. The {{size and shape of}} the shutter allow observations down to 12° above the horizon, which corresponds to an airmass of 4.8. The total <b>moving</b> <b>mass</b> of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven [...] down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.|$|E

2500|$|The actual wire {{employed}} in voice coil winding {{is almost always}} copper, with an electrical insulation coating, and in some cases, an adhesive overcoat. Copper wire provides an easily manufactured, general purpose voice coil, at a reasonable cost. Where maximum sensitivity or extended high frequency response is required from a loudspeaker, aluminium wire may be substituted, to reduce the <b>moving</b> <b>mass</b> of the coil. While rather delicate in a manufacturing environment, aluminium wire has about {{one third of the}} mass of the equivalent gauge of copper wire, and has about two-thirds of the electrical conductivity. Copper-clad aluminium wire is occasionally used, allowing easier winding, along with a useful reduction in coil mass compared to copper.|$|E

2500|$|The wire in a {{voice coil}} is usually made of copper, though aluminum—and, rarely, silver—may be used. [...] The {{advantage}} of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the <b>moving</b> <b>mass</b> compared to copper. [...] This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency. [...] A disadvantage of aluminum {{is that it is}} not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed. [...] These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration. [...] Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of laminated composite beams subjected to distributed <b>moving</b> <b>masses</b> is investigated using the {{finite element method}} (FEM) based on the both first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and the classical beam theory (CLT). Six and ten degrees of freedom beam elements are used to discretize the CLT and FSDT equations of motion, respectively. The resulting spatially discretized beam governing equations including the effect of inertial, Coriolis, and centrifugal forces due to <b>moving</b> distributed <b>mass</b> are evaluated in time domain by applying Newmark’s scheme. The presented approach is first validated by studying its convergence behavior and comparing the results with those of existing solutions in the literature. Then, the effect of incline angle, mass, and velocity of moving body, layer orientation, load length, and inertial, Coriolis, and centrifugal forces due to the <b>moving</b> distributed <b>mass</b> and friction force between the beam and the <b>moving</b> distributed <b>mass</b> on the dynamic behavior of inclined laminated composite beams are investigated...|$|R

In order to preserve the characteristic coupling including bend-stretch, and bend-twist coupling the lateral strains and curvatures are presented {{on the basis of}} axial and transverse strains and curvatures. The dynamic responses of symmetric isotropic laminated beams under the action of <b>moving</b> <b>masses</b> have been compared to the experimental results.

40|$|This paper investigates model {{predictive}} control (MPC) techniques based on hybrid models for a multi-mass magnetic actuator.
