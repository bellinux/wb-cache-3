50|$|After {{generators}} and cable, minor amounts of copper {{are used in}} the remaining equipment. In yaw and pitch auxiliary <b>motors,</b> the <b>yaw</b> drive uses a combination of induction motors and multi-stage planetary gearboxes with minor amounts of copper. Power electronics have minimal amounts of copper compared to other equipment. As turbine capacities increase, converter ratings also increase from low voltage (<1kV) to medium voltage (1kV-5kV). Most wind turbines have full power converters, which have the same power rating as the generator, except the DFAG that has a power converter that is 30% of the rating of the generator. Finally, minor amounts of copper are used in air/oil and water cooled circuits on gearboxes or generators.|$|R

Rotor needs to be positioned in the wind direction by means of a tail or a <b>yaw</b> <b>motor.</b> Optimum locations for HAWTs are open areas with smooth air flow and few obstacles.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{associative}} learning/memory tests {{have been applied}} to Drosophila melanogaster flies lacking mushroom bodies. Only in paradigms involving chemosensory cues as conditioned stimuli have flies {{been found to be}} compromised by a block in the mushroom body pathway. Among the learning tasks not requiring these structures are a case of <b>motor</b> learning (<b>yaw</b> torque/heat), a test of the fly’s spatial orientation in total darkness, conditioned courtship suppression by mated females, and nine different examples of visual learning. The latter used the reinforcers of heat, visual oscillations, mechanical shaking, or sucrose, and as conditioned stimuli, color, intensity contrast, as well as stationary and moving visual patterns. No forms of consolidated memory have been tested in mushroom body-less flies. With respect to short-term memory the mushroom bodies of Drosophila are specially required for chemosensory learning tasks, but not for associative learning and memory in general...|$|R

50|$|Unlike CMU Ballbot, BallIP and Rezero use omni-wheels {{to drive}} the ball. This drive {{mechanism}} {{does not require a}} separate yaw drive mechanism and allows direct control of the yaw rotation of the ball. Unlike CMU Ballbot that uses four motors for driving the ball and one <b>motor</b> for <b>yaw</b> rotation, BallIP and Rezero use only three motors for both the operations. Moreover, they only have three force transmission points compared to four points on CMU Ballbot. Since the contact between an omni-wheel and the ball should be reduced to a single point, most available omni-wheels are not properly suitable for this task because of the gaps between the individual smaller wheels that result in unsteady rolling motion. Therefore, the BallIP project introduced a more complex omni-wheel with a continuous circumferential contact line. The Rezero team equipped this omni-wheel design with roller bearings and a high-friction coating. They also additionally fitted a mechanical ball arrester that presses the ball against the actuators in order to further increase friction forces and a suspension to dampen vibrations. The Adelaide Ballbot uses wheels for its LEGO version and traditional omni-wheels for its full-scale version.|$|R
40|$|Ever since {{learning}} and memory {{have been studied}} experimentally, the relationship between operant and classical conditioning has been controversial. Operant conditioning is any form of conditioning that essentially depends on the animal’s behavior. It relies on operant behavior. A motor output is called operant if it controls a sensory variable. The Drosophila flight simulator, in which the relevant behavior is a single <b>motor</b> variable (<b>yaw</b> torque), fully separates the operant and classical components of a complex conditioning task. In this paradigm a tethered fly learns, operantly or classically, to prefer and avoid certain flight orientations {{in relation to the}} surrounding panorama. Yaw torque is recorded and, in the operant mode, controls the panorama. Using a yoked control, we show that classical pattern learning necessitates more extensive training than operant pattern learning. We compare in detail the microstructure of yaw torque after classical and operant training but find no evidence for acquired behavioral traits after operant conditioning that might explain this difference. We therefore conclude that the operant behavior has a facilitating effect on the classical training. In addition, we show that an operantly learned stimulus is successfully transferred from the behavior of the training to a different behavior. This result unequivocally demonstrates that during operant conditioning classical associations can be formed...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{have many}} parts that generate noise {{but they can}} be broadly classifi ed as either aerodynamic or mechani-cal. Mechanical sources of noise include the gearbox, cooling fans, the generator, the power converter, hydraulic pumps, the <b>yaw</b> <b>motor</b> and bearings. Modern turbines incorporate many mechanical noise-reducing features such as nacelle in-sulation, gearbox isolation, and silenced ventilation. Aerody-namic noise sources are a function of blade geometry (refer to Figure 1). Similar to a fan, the level of aerodynamic noise is highly correlated with the tip speed. Reducing aerodynam-ic noise is subject of current research [3]. Modern turbines often have the ability to control their noise emissions through a combination of reduced rotor (and tip) speed and blade pitch angle adjustment. This typically comes at the cost of a reduced electrical power output. Typical sound power values for commercial scale wind turbines are in the range of 96 - 108 dB(A), LWA between cut-in and rated power...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{preliminary}} results obtained in the VENTURAS (VENTo: Una Risorsa Altamente Sfruttabile or 'wind: a highly exploitable resource') project, funded by the Italian Environmental, Land and Sea Protection Ministry, within a call for the funding of research projects aimed at improving the energy efficiency measures {{and the use of}} renewable energy sources in urban areas. The scope of the project is to develop an innovative propeller concept to improve the efficiency and the working capabilities of micro wind turbines, widening the range of the wind speed for which the turbine can transform energy effectively and safely. This new propeller concept is based on a variable pitch blade, which has morphing capabilities that enables the control system to select the optimum twist law along the blade, to optimize the efficiency also in non-nominal conditions. The final layout identified for the proposed wind turbine will be presented; the pylon contains the power supply and an On Board Computer (OBC) for the active control loop, whereas, the nacelle hosts the <b>motors</b> for <b>yaw</b> control and pitch/twist control. The general idea of the morphing control system is to obtain a twist law theta(r) so as to allow the optimal rotor operation for different working conditions. The proposed control strategy aims at maximizing the rotor efficiency, calculated as the product of the mechanical and the electrical efficiencies by maintaining the rotor in the nominal working condition. At low wind speeds, the control system changes the blade twist law, {{in order to maintain the}} angular speed at a certain level so that the electrical efficiency is always maximize...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of conventional wind turbines {{on board a}} vessel creates {{a number of new}} challenges for turbine control systems. Thrust force is used in marine applications as an additional control variable for propulsion of the vessel. Variability of the wind speed and wind direction, together with the yaw rate and range constraints, impose strong requirements on the turbine control system. A new projection algorithm that projects the turbine thrust force on the heading direction of vessel is proposed in this paper for controlling propulsion. Variations in the wind direction and wind speed are counteracted via turbine yaw angle, making the turbine thrust force always aligned with the heading direction of the vessel. The conventional Kv 2 speed controller is modified for varying yaw offset and a combined algorithm for simultaneous control of the turbine speed and thrust force is proposed. Stability of the Kw^ 2 speed controller for varying yaw offset is proved via the Lyapunov method. The controller also takes into account the constraints on the yaw rate and minimizes the turbine gyroscopic effects via a proper choice of the virtual upper bound of the input voltage of the <b>yaw</b> <b>motor.</b> All of the results are illustrated by simulations using measurement data acquired from the Hönö turbine...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Optiwind (now defunct), {{there appears to be}} a growing body of {{evidence}} that they believe have solved for both the acceleration and economic challenges posed by CWAT/DAWT designs. Where previous attempts at new designs in this category have focused purely on acceleration magnitude, Optiwind appears to have taken a more holistic approach to their design, considering cost as much as acceleration benefit. In addition, the ongoing operational and maintenance cost of the entire unit appears to be successfully addressed in this design. It is absent the significant cost drivers of HAWT systems - large composite blades, gearbox, <b>yaw</b> <b>motor,</b> pitch control, lubrication, etc. In addition, the novel foundation geometry appears to have mitigated the structural challenges of the conventional monopole foundation design, which was originally conceived to offset the counter-rotational effects ("wobbling") of large, three blade turbines. As such, it is reasonable to assume that Optiwind's holistic approach to systemwide costs have led to a series of designs and discoveries that can realistically deliver the economic advantages of accelerated wind at a cost that is less than the net system cost. This is accurate if the Optiwind system is compared to a HAWT purely on rating. The problem therein is, if one compares the Optiwind design based on its stack height (the distance from its lowest turbine to the highest turbine) to a traditional HAWT of the same diameter, the overall power output of the machine is 20% less than that of the HAWT, with all the attendant material and structural expenses generally associated with a CWAT/DAWT. On average a CWAT/DAWT system would need to produce at least 2-3 times the energy a HAWT could produce from the maximum area used by the CWAT/DAWT in order to offset the substantially larger material costs. There is no evidence yet that there are any DAWT/CWAT designs capable of this level of increase when compared on an apples to apples basis with HAWT's.|$|R
