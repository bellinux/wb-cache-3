25|$|Masonry cements {{are used}} for {{preparing}} bricklaying mortars and stuccos, and {{must not be used}} in concrete. They are usually complex proprietary formulations containing Portland clinker {{and a number of other}} ingredients that may include limestone, hydrated lime, air entrainers, retarders, waterproofers and coloring agents. They are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent <b>masonry</b> <b>work.</b> Subtle variations of Masonry cement in the US are Plastic Cements and Stucco Cements.

25|$|The Hough House was {{originally}} constructed in late nineteenth century, but {{has since been}} restored as a Colonial Revival style building. The structure emanates exuberance through its quality craftsmanship that showcases exquisite <b>masonry</b> <b>work</b> and wood detailing. The wood shingle roof, stone accents, facades, and Palladian style windows makes the Hough House the most stylish structure within the fort. The two-and-a-half storey building sits elegantly amongst the earthworks, creating an environment that resembles that of a countryside manor. The Hough House {{is perhaps the most}} visited site of Fort Malden, largely due to its attractive design, and more importantly the fact that it plays host to a large number of records and archives pertaining to the history of the fort itself.|$|E
25|$|In mid 1929 Gertrude Caton-Thompson concluded, after a twelve-day {{visit of}} a three-person {{team and the}} digging of several trenches, that the site was indeed created by Bantu. She had first sunk three test pits into what had been refuse heaps on the upper {{terraces}} of the hill complex, producing a mix of unremarkable pottery and ironwork. She then moved to the Conical Tower, and tried to dig under the tower, arguing that the ground there would be undisturbed, but nothing was revealed. Some further test trenches were then put down outside the lower Great Enclosure and in the Valley Ruins, which unearthed domestic ironwork, glass beads, and a gold bracelet. Caton-Thompson immediately announced her Bantu origin theory to {{a meeting of the}} British Association in Johannesburg. Caton-Thompson's claim was not immediately favoured, although it had strong support among some scientific archaeologists due to her modern methods. Her most important contribution was in helping to confirm the theory of a medieval origin for the <b>masonry</b> <b>work</b> of circa the 14th-15th century. By 1931, she had modified her Bantu theory somewhat, allowing for a possible Arabian influence for the towers through the imitation of buildings or art seen at the coastal Arabian trading cities.|$|E
500|$|While Sharpe was {{designing}} churches, he was augmenting {{his income}} by {{working as a}} sub-contractor in building railways. [...] These were the lines between Lancaster and Preston, Lancaster and Skipton, and between Liverpool and Southport. [...] He first became involved with the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway in 1838, two years after Joseph Locke was appointed as engineer for the line. Sharpe submitted a tender to supply the <b>masonry</b> <b>work</b> for the [...] "Lancaster Contract", the northern section of the line; and Peter Perry from Durham submitted a tender for the earthwork. [...] Locke insisted that both earthwork and <b>masonry</b> <b>work</b> should be under one contract, which Perry accepted and subcontracted the <b>masonry</b> <b>work</b> to Sharpe. Subsequently, Perry reneged on {{his part of the}} contract, resulting in serious disputes between Sharpe, Locke, and the directors of the railway company concerning the costs involved {{and the quality of the}} work. [...] The masonry for this section of the line included 15under-and-over bridges and the six-arch viaduct over the River Conder at Galgate. [...] The eventual outcome of the conflict was that Sharpe was dismissed from the work in 1839 with agreed financial compensation, having built most but not all of these structures.|$|E

By June the expedition reached the source of the north fork of the river and Marcy named a small tributary McClellan's Creek. Upon their return to civilization on July 28, they were astonished to find that they had been given up for dead. A sensational story had reached the press that the expedition had been ambushed by 2,000 Comanches and killed to the last man.

2500|$|Local {{rock was}} usually used for {{building}} material, and was quarried {{in the immediate}} vicinity of the castle site.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of dealing with}} construction and demolition waste (CDW) on construction sites is not new {{and continues to be}} a significant environmental problem. Currently the CDW collection system in Spain is done in a decentralized manner by each sub-contracted company, being necessary to implement effective waste management measures ensuring a correct management and minimization. During the last years several measures have been launched in order to improve and encourage the reuse and recycling of CDW. A widespread solution for CDW recovery is using them as a landscaping aggregate or for road bases and sub-bases. However, measures encouraging onsite prevention still need to be enhanced. This paper studies the major work stage generating CDW and analyses the categories of CDW produced during its execution. For this, several real building sites have been analysed in order to quantify the estimation of CDW generated. Results of this study show that a significant contributor to the CDW generation on building construction sites in Spain are the <b>masonry</b> <b>works.</b> Finally, a Best Practices Manual (BPM) is proposed containing several strategies on <b>masonry</b> <b>works</b> aimed not only at CDW prevention, but also at improving their management and minimization. The use of this BPM together with the Study and Plan of CDW management [...] required by law [...] , promotes the environmental management of the company, favouring the cohesion of the construction process organization at all stages giving rise to establishing responsibilities in the field of waste and providing a greater control over the process.

2500|$|Corbett {{planned a}} three-story {{memorial}} temple {{topped by a}} three-story tower. [...] The first three floors (which constituted the temple and {{the base of the}} tower) would be built in the Neoclassical style, while the tower would be a variation on the setbacks popular in Modern architecture. The structure was to be built entirely of masonry, with almost no metal used in its construction (except for reinforcing rods in the concrete). The rationale for this decision was that a building constructed purely of stone would be the most permanent structure possible. The firm of Osgood & Osgood of Grand Rapids, Michigan, was the consulting engineer. Daniel E. Moran (of the firm Moran, Maurice & Proctor of New York) designed the building's foundation; Gunvald Aus was the structural engineer; the firm of Clarke, McMullen & Riley (of New York) was the mechanical engineer; and Carl Rust Parker of Olmsted Brothers was the landscape architect. The general contractor was the Percy Cranford Co., but the actual <b>masonry</b> <b>work</b> was done by the Samuel Miller Co. (both companies were located in Washington, D.C.).|$|E

This school was purpose built in 1875 at a cost of £3,807. Around that time, it had four hundred children on the roll and nine teachers, with one classroom being able to accommodate 126 children. The building has been C listed since 1995.

2500|$|Space for {{a chapel}} {{had been set}} aside when Woodland was first laid out in 1853.

Even the new public vault was proving far too small to accommodate the heavy number of remains which built up during the winter. The cemetery superintendent again pushed for a chapel in 1869, but no action was taken until early 1880 when the city hired local landscape architect E.O. Schwaegerl (who had designed Riverside Cemetery) and oft-used local architect Alexander Koehler to design the chapel. The city finally issued a call for bids in September 1880. Contracts to the following were awarded on October 4: [...] For cut stone and <b>masonry</b> <b>work,</b> J.
