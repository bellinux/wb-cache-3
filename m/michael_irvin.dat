25|$|On April 24, Hall of Famer Jim Brown {{announced}} that he had offered his support and help to Jones while in Dallas. Former Cowboys teammates and NFL standouts <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> and Deion Sanders also both expressed a willingness to help the troubled cornerback.|$|E
25|$|Dallas kick {{returner}} Kevin Williams {{returned the}} opening kickoff 50 {{yards to the}} Buffalo 48-yard line. The Cowboys began the drive with quarterback Troy Aikman's 20-yard pass to wide receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin.</b> But on third down and six from 24-yard line, Aikman threw an incomplete pass, and the Cowboys {{had to settle for}} kicker Eddie Murray's 41-yard field goal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Michael</b> Jerome <b>Irvin</b> (born March 5, 1966) is {{a retired}} American {{football}} player, actor, and sports commentator. Irvin played college football at the University of Miami, then for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) for his entire pro athletic career (1988-1999), which ended due to a spinal cord injury. Irvin was nicknamed [...] "The Playmaker" [...] due to his penchant for making big plays in big games during his college and pro careers. He {{is one of three}} key Cowboys offensive players who helped the team attain three Super Bowl wins: he is known as one of [...] "The Triplets" [...] along with Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. He is also a former broadcaster for ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown and currently an analyst for NFL Network. In 2007, he was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|R
50|$|From 1978, the {{exhibition}} had an established exhibition venue in the ICA and a Permanent Committee supported {{the exhibition}} management until 1983. The selection of contributors {{was made by}} panels of students, divided between the specialisms of painting, sculpture, and performance/film. However, the students soon began to realise that the current format for the exhibition was unsustainable, and many organisers were left with personal debt. In one interesting movement toward complete democratisation, the 1981 committee “in order to encourage a larger entry of works” asked for all submissions {{to be made in}} the form of slides and then created a slideshow that could be arranged at will “to give a more complete idea of what is going on in art colleges at the moment.” The final exhibition in this student-lead format, was staged in 1986 with a catalogue which contained a historical introduction (and post-script), to the exhibition by Andrew Lambirth, 'New Contemporaries Past and Present'. This essay also includes a number of published letters from previous contributors such as RB Kitaj, Bert <b>Irvin,</b> <b>Michael</b> Sandle, Richard Wentworth, and Derek Jarman. Artists who participated in the exhibition during this period include Helen Chadwick, Anish Kapoor (both 1977), Antony Gormley (1978), Mark Wallinger (1981), Peter Doig (1982), Dexter Dalwood (1983), and Catherine Yass (1984).|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to his post-retirement endorsements and charity work, Warner has invested in the Elite Football League of India, a South Asian professional football league. Other prominent American backers include former Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka, former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin,</b> sports analyst Ron Jaworski, and actor Mark Wahlberg. Warner's total investment amount remains undisclosed, although $50,000 of it will go towards a donation of footballs to schools and underprivileged children throughout India.|$|E
25|$|Warner's top {{target was}} Fitzgerald, who caught seven passes for 127 {{yards and two}} {{touchdown}}s. Fitzgerald set a single postseason record with seven touchdown receptions, passing Jerry Rice, who had six in the 1988 postseason. Fitzgerald as well as Holmes each had 100 yards receiving, marking {{the fourth time in}} Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, followed by Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad in Super Bowl XXXVIII and Branch again a year later along with Terrell Owens in Super Bowl XXXIX.|$|E
25|$|The game set {{a number}} of marks for {{offensive}} production. The two teams combined for 868 yards of total offense, the second-highest total in Super Bowl history. Both starting quarterbacks threw for at least 300 yards {{for only the second}} time in Super Bowl history, with Dan Marino and Joe Montana each passing for at least 300 yards in Super Bowl XIX. This was also only the second Super Bowl to feature one 100-yard receiving performance on each team, with Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad each reaching 100 yards. Andre Reed and <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> first accomplished the feat in Super Bowl XXVII.|$|E
25|$|The {{glory days}} of the Cowboys were again {{beginning}} to dim as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> was suspended by the league {{for the first five}} games of 1996 following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2–3. They finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, won the NFC East title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40–15 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional round of the playoffs 26–17 by the Carolina Panthers.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{increased}} their lead to 21-3 on their next drive, with Aikman completing a 53-yard pass to <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> and a 22-yarder to tight end Jay Novacek at the Packers 1 before Smith's replacement, Blair Thomas ran {{the ball into}} the end zone from there. Green Bay struck back with a 74-yard drive, featuring Brett Favre's 59-yard completion to Brooks, to score on Edgar Bennett's 1-yard rushing touchdown. But their two-point conversion attempt failed and this ended up being their final scoring play of the game. Meanwhile, a 39-yard kickoff return by Williams set off a 52-yard drive that ended with Aikman's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Scott Galbraith with five seconds left in the half, giving Dallas a 28-9 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Branch and Terrell Owens {{each had}} 100 yards {{receiving}}, marking {{the third time}} in Super Bowl history, one player from each team had over 100 yards in a Super Bowl. <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> and Andre Reed were the first in Super Bowl XXVII, and Branch and Muhsin Muhammad the second a year earlier in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Branch also became the fourth player to have at least 100 yards receiving in back-to-back Super Bowls, joining John Stallworth, Jerry Rice and Antonio Freeman. Also, Mike Vrabel and David Givens became just the 14th and 15th players to score a touchdown in consecutive Super Bowls. Vrabel is the most surprising person on this list because he is a linebacker and he scored his on offense. They also became just the 7th and 8th players to catch a touchdown in back-to-back Super Bowls.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Cowboys {{had only one}} more yard of total offense than the 49ers (416–415), Dallas forced four {{critical}} turnovers that helped them earn the win. On San Francisco's first drive of the game, a holding penalty on offensive lineman Guy McIntyre nullified a 63-yard touchdown completion from quarterback Steve Young to wide receiver Jerry Rice, and the 49ers had to punt. Despite a 19-yard reception from <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> on the Cowboys first play, they also had to punt, but returner Alan Grant fumbled the football after a hit from Dixon Edwards and Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston recovered it on the 49ers 22. The Cowboys restarted their drive with a completion to Irvin, this one a 21-yard gain to the 1-yard line. But the San Francisco defense managed to hold them up on three consecutive plays, forcing Dallas to settle for Lin Elliott's 20-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman {{completed}} four consecutive passes on a 65-yard drive, the last a 25-yard touchdown to wide receiver Alvin Harper. Green Bay returner Corey Harris fumbled the ensuing kickoff {{out of bounds}} at his own 4-yard line. Green Bay still managed {{to drive to the}} Cowboys 31-yard line, with Favre completing a 48-yard pass to Sterling Sharpe on the way, but the drive ended there and Jacke hit the uprights on a field goal attempt from 49 yards. Dallas took over and stormed back on a 10-play, 45-yard drive, with Aikman's 22-yard completion to Smith and two more to <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> for 24 total yards. With 23 seconds left in the first half, Cowboys kicker Eddie Murray made a 41-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Dallas' Joe Fishback recovered Harris' second fumble of the day, this one forced by Kenneth Gant, and Aikman threw a 6-yard touchdown toss to tight end Jay Novacek, making the score 17–3 at halftime.|$|E
25|$|After forcing Dallas to punt {{on their}} opening drive, Kramer {{completed}} passes to Herman Moore, Mike Farr and Willie Green for gains of 11, 13, and 13 yards before finished the 68-yard drive with a 31-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Green. Dallas responded {{with a pair of}} receptions by <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> for 35 yards and an 18-yard run from Emmitt Smith setting up a 28-yard field goal by Ken Willis. But the next time Dallas had the ball, Melvin Jenkins intercepted a pass from Beuerlein and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. After the Cowboys responded with another 28-yard Willis field goal, Eddie Murray's 36-yard field goal made the score 17–6 at halftime. Near the end of the half, Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson benched Beuerlein in favor of Aikman, but this did not improve the Cowboys fortunes. On the final two plays of the second quarter, Aikman was sacked and then threw an interception to linebacker Chris Spielman.|$|E
25|$|Dallas scored {{first when}} an {{interception}} by defensive back Darren Woodson {{on his own}} 47 and a 22-yard catch by <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> sparking a drive to the Panthers 1-yard line. However, Irvin suffered a separated shoulder on his reception and had to miss {{the rest of the}} game. Meanwhile, Dallas could not get into the end zone despite two chances from the 1. Aikman threw an incomplete pass on second down, and on third down, Emmitt Smith was dropped for a three-yard loss, forcing the team to settle for Chris Boniol's 22-yard field goal. On the Panthers ensuing drive, Dallas cornerback Kevin Smith kept it going with a pass interference penalty on third down, enabling Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins to complete the 68-yard possession with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Wesley Walls. On their next series, Winslow Oliver's 15-yard punt return set up a 42-yard drive that ended with Collins' 10-yard touchdown throw to Willie Green, giving the team a 14-3 lead in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman {{completed}} four passes to <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked the ball out of his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back Deion Sanders recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|Although the Cowboys {{eventually}} held a 451–294 {{advantage in}} total offensive yards, the 49ers converted three turnovers into three {{touchdowns in the}} first quarter en route to the 38–28 victory. On the third play of the game, San Francisco cornerback Eric Davis intercepted Aikman's pass, plowing right through the intended target (receiver Kevin Williams) as he snagged the ball out of the air, and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. On the next Dallas possession, Davis stripped the ball away from receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> and fellow defensive back Tim McDonald recovered it on the Dallas 39, setting up a 29-yard touchdown pass from Young to running back Ricky Watters, who eluded several Cowboys defenders high-stepping his way down the sideline en route to the goal line in spectacular showboating fashion. Williams then fumbled the ensuing kickoff when hit by 49ers running back Adam Walker. San Francisco kicker Doug Brien recovered the ball at the Cowboys 35-yard line, and then Young went back to work, converting a third and 1 with a 2-yard sneak and then throwing a 14-yard pass to receiver John Taylor. On the next play, Young ran the ball nine yards to the 1-yard line, and running back William Floyd took the ball into the end zone from there to give his team a 21–0 lead with 7:33 left {{in the first quarter}}.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco then {{defeated}} their nemesis, the Dallas Cowboys, 38–28, in the NFC Championship Game. Expected to {{be a close}} game, the 49ers converted 3 Dallas turnovers into 21 {{points in}} the first quarter. On the third play of the game, cornerback Eric Davis returned an interception from Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman for a touchdown. Wide receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> lost a fumble on Dallas' next drive, setting up Young's 29-yard touchdown pass to Watters. Then Cowboys returner Kevin Williams lost a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and it was recovered by kicker Doug Brien at Dallas' 35-yard line. Several plays later, Floyd scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to give San Francisco a 21–0 lead less than 8 minutes into the game. With the score 24–14 in the closing minutes of the first half, Aikman threw 3 straight incompletions, and a short punt by the Cowboys set up Young's 28-yard touchdown completion to Rice with 8 seconds remaining in the first half. The Cowboys eventually cut their deficit to 38–28 with a touchdown run by Emmitt Smith and Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin in the final period, but they were unable to score again. Although the Cowboys outgained the 49ers in total offensive yards (451–294), Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, Dallas was ultimately unable to overcome their first-quarter turnovers.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the more}} recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin,</b> known as [...] "The Triplets". The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before {{inducting}} Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Chey {{produced}} and directed [...] "Slamma Jamma" [...] that was released nationwide in theaters in 281 cities on March 24, 2017.

The film is {{about a man who}} finds God in prison and wins the national slam dunk competition against all odds.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Sanders intercepted a pass from Cunningham and {{returned}} it 12 yards to the Eagles 21-yard line, leading to their final score on Aikman's 9-yard pass to <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin.</b> [...] The Eagles responded as Cunningham completed 4/5 passes for 63 yards before taking {{the ball into the}} end zone himself on a 4-yard run. [...] He also completed a pass for a 2-point conversion, but by then only 2:36 remained in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson quickly {{returned}} the Cowboys to the NFL's elite. Skillful drafts added fullback Daryl Johnston and center Mark Stepnoski in 1989, running back Emmitt Smith in 1990, defensive tackle Russell Maryland and offensive tackle Erik Williams in 1991, and safety Darren Woodson in 1992. The young talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin,</b> guard Nate Newton, linebacker Ken Norton Jr., and offensive lineman Mark Tuinei, defensive lineman Jim Jeffcoat, and veteran pickups such as tight end Jay Novacek and defensive end Charles Haley.|$|E
2500|$|Two of the most-publicized {{injuries}} {{blamed on}} the playing surface occurred exactly six years apart. On October 10, 1993, Chicago Bears receiver Wendell Davis had both of his cleats get caught in a seam while he planted to jump for an underthrown bomb from QB Jim Harbaugh. He tore both of his patella tendons, ending his career. On October 10, 1999, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> suffered a neck injury {{that led to his}} premature retirement. (The previously winless Eagles rallied from a 10–0 deficit and won 13–10.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Miami {{entered the}} game with a {{seemingly}} unstoppable team. [...] The Hurricanes had outscored their opponents during the season 420–136 en route to a perfect regular season. [...] They had held the #1 ranking since handing the reigning champion (and eventual #3) Oklahoma Sooners their only loss during the fourth week of the season. [...] The 1986 Heisman Trophy winner, Vinny Testaverde starred at quarterback. The team also featured All-Americans Jerome Brown, Dan Sileo and Bennie Blades on defense, future NFL Hall-of-Famer <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> at wide receiver, and fullback Alonzo Highsmith, the eventual No. 3 pick in the 1987 NFL draft.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, {{hours before}} Game 3 of the Mavericks' first-round {{series with the}} New Orleans Hornets, Howard told <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> in an {{interview}} on ESPN Radio 103.3 FM that he smoked marijuana in the offseason, and that while he would not smoke during the season even if the NBA did not conduct random testing, he did not [...] "think that's stopping me from doing my job." [...] He called his marijuana use [...] "my personal choice". He had previously discussed his marijuana use and its possible link to him slipping to the 29th pick in 2003 NBA draft with TrueHoop blogger Henry Abbot.|$|E
2500|$|Jones {{immediately}} fired Tom Landry, {{the only}} {{head coach in}} franchise history, replacing him with University of Miami head coach Jimmy Johnson, who was also Jerry Jones' teammate in University of Arkansas as a fellow defensive lineman and <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> was under his tutelage in college. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman. Later that same year, they would trade veteran running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for five veteran players and eight draft choices. Although the Cowboys finished the 1989 season with a 1–15 record, their worst in almost 30 years, [...] "The Trade" [...] later allowed Dallas to draft a number of impact players to rebuild the team.|$|E
2500|$|As SEC Champions, Tennessee {{received}} an automatic {{berth in the}} 1986 Sugar Bowl, played on New Year's Day. [...] Their opponent, Miami, entered {{the game with a}} 10-game winning streak, which was capped by a 58-7 blowout of Notre Dame. [...] Ranked #2 in the nation, Miami needed a win over Tennessee and a loss by Penn State in the Orange Bowl to lay claim to the national title. [...] Under second-year coach Jimmy Johnson, the Hurricanes featured numerous future NFL players, including quarterback Vinny Testaverde, running backs Alonzo Highsmith, Warren Williams, and Mel Bratton, receivers <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> and Brian Blades, All-American tight end Willie Smith, and a defense led by linemen Jerome Brown and Kevin Fagan, linebacker Winston Moss, and defensive back Bennie Blades.|$|E
2500|$|On Dallas' {{first series}} of the third quarter, Aikman {{suffered}} a game-ending concussion, knocking him so senseless that when a team doctor asked him where the Super Bowl {{was going to be}} played, he answered [...] "Henryetta", Aikman's hometown in Oklahoma. Then with just over five minutes left in the third quarter, San Francisco running back Ricky Watters ran for a 4-yard touchdown to cut the lead to 28–14. However, 30-year-old Dallas backup quarterback Bernie Kosar responded by leading the Cowboys 82 yards to a momentum-shattering touchdown, including a critical 12-yard completion to <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> on third and 9 from the Dallas 19. On the last play, he connected with wide receiver Alvin Harper for a 42-yard touchdown. Cowboys kicker Eddie Murray later added a 50-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory.|$|E
2500|$|Miami {{still had}} over 8 {{minutes on the}} clock, but fumbled on their next possession. [...] With Penn State unable to move the ball, Miami began their last drive on their own 23 with 3:07 left in the game. [...] A 4th-down {{completion}} to Brian Blades went for 31 yards and moved Miami into Penn State territory. [...] With a minute left, Testaverde hit <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> at the Penn State 10. [...] The connection put the Hurricanes inside the 5 with 45 seconds left. [...] Even with a national championship at stake, though, Penn State linebacker Pete Giftopoulos said the Penn State defense stayed calm. [...] "We had some great leaders -- (seniors) Shane Conlan, Timmy Johnson, Bob White," [...] he said. [...] "They were key character people. To not see any fear in their eyes helped me as a junior and helped the other players to play the game. ... Nobody was losing it in the huddle, nobody was screaming. Everyone was like, 'Here's the play; let's do it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{revelation of}} Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said {{that much of}} Williams' speech was {{standard}} pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to [...] "attack the head" [...] of running back Frank Gore, {{he was saying that}} the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far. His former teammate, NFL Network analyst <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin,</b> said that he [...] "almost threw up" [...] when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to [...] "never take out a man's knees." [...] Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was [...] "woefully underpunished," [...] especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.|$|E
2500|$|Though not as dynamic as the {{previous}} year, Dallas' offense remained incredibly efficient, led by Aikman, who finished the regular season completing 271 out of 392 passes for 3,100 yards, 15 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Smith recorded 1,486 rushing yards and nine touchdowns, while catching 57 passes for 414 yards and another touchdown, earning him his third consecutive NFL rushing title and the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. [...] Fullback Daryl Johnston was also a reliable backfield threat, scoring four touchdowns and contributing a career-high 50 receptions for 371 yards. [...] Pro Bowler <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin</b> was once again the team's leading wide receiver, catching 88 passes for 1,330 yards and seven touchdowns. [...] Wide receiver Alvin Harper caught 36 passes for 777 yards and five touchdowns, while Pro Bowl tight end Jay Novacek had 44 receptions for 445 yards and one touchdown. Pro Bowlers Mark Stepnoski, Erik Williams, and Nate Newton anchored the offensive line. [...] On special teams, rookie receiver Kevin Williams ranked seventh in the NFL with 381 yards on 36 punt returns, while also gaining 689 kickoff return yards and catching 20 passes for 151 yards.|$|E
2500|$|The next week, the two danced a foxtrot and a Paso Doble with <b>Michael</b> <b>Irvin,</b> Mark Dacascos and Aaron Carter (Decascos and Irvin who got {{eliminated}} that week). For her Foxtrot, the two received 25 getting 9s from Tonioli and Inaba and a 7 from Goodman. Following that week, {{she danced}} a Quickstep which tied Osmond and Johnson's Argentine Tango score of 29. They then danced a 1970s-themed samba, {{for which she}} was awarded the first 30 of the season. The next week, {{she was asked to}} dance three dances (a waltz, a salsa and a cha-cha-cha) only receiving 9s and 10s, and receiving the second 30. For the finals week, she danced a Paso Doble and was dubbed by Carrie Ann Inaba as the [...] "Queen of the Paso Doble", and was granted the third 30. Then, she danced the Megamix dance along with Kelly Osbourne and Donny Osmond and was granted another 30. For her final dance before the public vote, Harrison and Chaplin danced a Hairspray-themed freestyle dance which was remarked by the judges that [...] "it was good but needed more" [...] and received a 27. The final dance was a repeat of her jive from week 2 and received 28, finishing in the second place.|$|E
