5|$|To this end, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) {{that the}} guns and {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>upkeep.</b> By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, this work began to slack off. As the money ran out, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E
5|$|The house, {{which is}} a Grade I listed building, {{was given to the}} National Trust in 1943 by Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet (1896–1966), an action {{strongly}} resented by his heir. Dashwood retained ownership of the surrounding estate and the contents of the house, most of which he sold; after his death, the house was restored at the expense of his son, the 11th Baronet. Today, while the structure is owned by the National Trust, the house is still the home of the Dashwood family.

5|$|Although {{the debate}} at large traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>upkeep</b> that the four completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

This was the first time any considerable work had been done on the front façade since the 1960s. A project began in 2012 to replace the building's climate control system—consisting of three large external chillers and multiple window-mounted air conditioners—with a geothermal heating and cooling system, expected to supply approximately half of the building's heating requirements during winter, until the geothermal system is expanded in future.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{industrialist}} Andrew Carnegie began funding dozens of public libraries in Pennsylvania. In 1901 the Carnegie Corporation received plans from the Easton Library Association asking for a donation for a new building to be constructed on Church Street. The committee sent plans for a two story 90 x 70 square foot building of Modern Renaissance architecture style on the best available piece of property in town, an old graveyard no longer in use. Included in the plans were a fireproof vault for the protection of books of rare and historic value, and an auditorium with a seating capacity of 400 to 500 people. The final building proposal would be large enough to house 34,500 volumes. After reviewing the plans Carnegie donated $50,000 under the condition that the citizens of Easton provide land for the construction of the library, and allocate a $5,000 annual <b>maintenance</b> <b>and</b> <b>upkeep</b> fee through the city government. The city ultimately agreed to fund the daily expenses and construction began.|$|E
