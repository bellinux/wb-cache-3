Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style.

50|$|The Scottish <b>macaroon</b> has a thick velvety centre and {{is covered}} in {{chocolate}} and roasted coconut. Traditionally they were made with cold leftovers of mashed potatoes and sugar loaf. When the <b>macaroon</b> bar became commercial the recipe no longer used mashed potato because of shelf life limitations. The modern <b>macaroon</b> is made from a combination (depending on producer) of sugar, glucose, water and egg white. These ingredients make a fondant centre. This recipe was reportedly discovered by accident in 1931, when confectioner John Justice Lees {{was said to have}} botched the formula for making a chocolate fondant bar and threw coconut over it in disgust, producing the first <b>macaroon</b> bar.|$|R

500|$|The White House Passover Seder had {{its origins}} in an {{informal}} Passover Seder conducted on April 19, 2008, by three junior staff members of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign. At the time, Obama and his campaign team were in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, {{in advance of the}} Pennsylvania primary, and the Jewish staffers realized they {{would not be able to}} go home to be with their families on Seder night. The three staffers [...] Eric Lesser, Herbie Ziskend, and Arun Chaudhary [...] obtained a [...] "Passover kit" [...] with wine, matzo, <b>macaroons,</b> and Haggadahs from the [...] at the University of Pennsylvania and were conducting a late-night Seder in a meeting room of the Sheraton Hotel in Harrisburg when Obama walked in. [...] "Hey, is this the Seder?" [...] Obama asked. He and a group of aides, all non-Jews, joined in to recite the Haggadah. Obama was familiar with the ritual, having attended Passover Seders for the previous nine years. At the end of the Seder, when the assembled said the traditional wish, [...] "Next year in Jerusalem", Obama added, [...] "Next year in the White House".|$|E

2500|$|There is {{detailed}} information about Italian Jewish cookery in the book Massechet Purim. It discusses pies, chestnuts, turtledoves, pancakes, small tarts, gingerbread, ragouts, venison, roast goose, chicken, stuffed pigeons, ducks, pheasants, partridges, quails, <b>macaroons,</b> and salad. These were considered luxuries. The oppressed medieval Jews enjoyed large meals only on Shabbat, festivals, circumcisions, and weddings. For example, the Jews of Rhodes, according to a letter of Ovadiah Bartinura, 1488, lived on herbs and vegetables only, never tasting meat or wine. [...] In Egypt, however, meat, fish, and cheese were obtainable, in Gaza, grapes, fruit, and wine. [...] Cold dishes are still relished in the East. Generally, only one dish was eaten, with fresh bread daily.|$|E

5000|$|The related <b>macaroon</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with the macaron. In English, most bakers have adopted the French spelling of macaron for the meringue-based item, to distinguish the two. This has caused confusion over the correct spelling. Some recipes exclude the use of <b>macaroon</b> to refer to this French confection while others treat the two as synonymous. The two food items are different, and the terms in English distinguish them. Etymologically, the word <b>macaroon</b> is simply an Anglicisation of the French word macaron (compare balloon, from French [...] ). Multiple pronunciations are technically correct depending on personal preference and context. In a Slate article on the topic, Stanford professor of linguistics and computer science Dan Jurafsky indicates that [...] "macaron" [...] (also, [...] "macaron parisien", or [...] "le macaron Gerbet") is the correct spelling for the confection.|$|R
