Premier Sports picked up the mantle for a number of seasons, but there has been no Main Stream Media coverage of the EIHL since 2015.|$|E

25|$|<b>Media</b> <b>support</b> for {{ice hockey}} has {{improved}} {{on a national}} level, {{although the majority of}} news is still found on the internet. Sky Sports has been covering the Elite league for a few seasons, and starting in the 2010/2011 season they will be showing 8 live games and a highlight show every week; the reason this deal happened was due to the elite league attracting very large viewing figures and Sky seeing the Elite Ice Hockey League as a potentially big and popular league.|$|E
25|$|Stateside, Blackwell {{was faced}} with adversity, but did manage to get some <b>media</b> <b>support</b> from {{entities}} such as the New-York Tribune. She had very few patients, a situation she attributed to the stigma of women doctors as abortionists. In 1852, she began delivering lectures and published The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls, her first work, a volume about the physical and mental development of girls. Although Elizabeth herself pursued a career and never married or carried a child, this treatise ironically concerned itself with the preparation of young women for motherhood.|$|E
25|$|Alongside renewed {{attacks on}} Romania's {{cultural}} traditionalism, Cocea and Arghezi initiated a lengthy campaign {{in favor of}} universal suffrage. Their articles and headlines were often sensationalist and provoking, again focusing on Carol I, Romania's aging King. They often referred to the monarch as Ploșnița ("The Tick"), Gheșeftarul ("The Shop-Keeper") or Neamțul ("The Kraut"). Facla, with <b>media</b> <b>support</b> from Adevărul and the Romanian anarchist milieus, was taunting the authorities by staging its own mock trial for lèse majesté. Faclas anticlericalism, specifically aimed at the Orthodox Church, formed {{part of a larger}} scandal, which had earlier seen Arghezi giving up his hierodeacon's frock. The ardent antimilitarism of Cocea's Facla articles, in particular his mockery of General Grigore C. Crăiniceanu and his sons, had similar results: the journalist was handed a preemptive and dishonorable military discharge.|$|E

He has represented Vanuatu and its culture in the international sphere, notably through UNESCO. His transition to politics came suddenly in 2008, at a comparatively young age; his successful campaign to be elected to Parliament generated popular and <b>media</b> <b>support.</b> As a Member of Parliament, he sought to publicise his activities and discuss political issues directly {{with members of the}} public; he also used his parliamentary allowance to help finance student scholarships and youth business projects. Three months after his election, he {{was arrested and charged with}} aiding prisoners who had escaped from gaol. The charges were later dropped.

Among his threats was moving the team to Itasca or Addison, Illinois in DuPage County. [...] Reinsdorf, through his real estate business, purchased [...] in Addison. Chicago Mayor Harold Washington lobbied the Illinois legislature, and subsequently then-Illinois Governor James R. Thompson promoted a package of incentives to retain the team in Chicago. The state floated bonds to build New Comiskey Park and let Reinsdorf keep all parking and concession revenues, {{as well as the}} $5 million per year from 89 skyboxes. [...] Reinsdorf and Chicago Blackhawks owner, William Wirtz contributed $175 million to fund the construction of the largest arena in the United States. [...] When the United Center opened in 1994 all of the skyboxes were leased for up to eight years. [...] As per the collective bargaining agreement, Reinsdorf was allowed to exclude 60% of luxury suite revenue from [...] "basketball-related income" [...] and thus it {{is not part of the}} revenue sharing income.|$|E

500|$|The Altar and the Door {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from critics upon its release. Particular praise {{was given to}} the lyrics and the album's overall concept, but some critics felt the album's sound was mediocre and uninventive. The album received the award for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 39th GMA Dove Awards. It sold 129,000 copies in its first week, a record for a Christian album with no secular <b>media</b> <b>support,</b> enabling a debut at number one on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and number two on the Billboard 200 and Digital Albums charts, only blocked on the latter charts by the soundtrack for High School Musical 2. It later topped the Catalog Albums chart in 2010. The 18th best-selling Christian album of the 2000s, The Altar and the Door has sold 1.2 million copies and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
