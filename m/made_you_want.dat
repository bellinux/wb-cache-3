500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that {{you had a chance to}} play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as Frank Deford, who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, [...] "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that he <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to please him, but he wanted you to do that by writing in your own distinct way." ...|$|E

6000|$|So? You {{have been}} looking at that {{beautiful}} drawing of the ruin of Arica in the Illustrated London News: and it has puzzled <b>you</b> and <b>made</b> <b>you</b> sad. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> to know why God killed all those people--mothers among them, too, and little children? ...|$|R
6000|$|He went on quietly. [...] "Sure! Me mind's <b>made</b> up. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> {{the garden}} and I like the porch; so 'phone the agent after dinner, and we'll go up and see to it this very afternoon." ...|$|R

6000|$|One {{thing she}} did ask him, and that was: [...] "What in the world <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to sleep in the}} barn, Pony?" [...] and Pony was ashamed to say he was getting ready to run off. He began: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It was {{too late}} to do any good by {{speaking}} when I heard they suspected him—and I was just a little fond of Tony once,” she said. “Of course, he wasn’t worth it—he never was—and that’s why I tried to warn <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>made</b> me feel <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to be kind to me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack! set to {{work and}} {{make a lot of}} cocoa. There are no spirits on board; but cocoa is better, after all. Put the other kettle on and chuck plenty of wood upon the fire, {{and as soon as the}} one that is boiling now is empty, fill that up again. I should say there are twenty or thirty of them, and a pint apiece will not be too much. Take a drink yourself, lad, as soon as <b>you</b> have <b>made</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> it as much as they do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you ce'tainly do equal anything," [...] {{said his}} wife. She lay still awhile, {{and then she}} roused herself with indignant energy. [...] "Well, then, I can tell you what, Albe't Landa: you can go right {{straight}} and take back everything you said. I don't want the child, and I won't have her. I've got care enough to worry me now, I should think; {{and we should have}} her whole family on our hands, with that shiftless father of hers, and the whole pack of her brothas and sistas. What <b>made</b> <b>you</b> think I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to do such a thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} sleep," [...] said Jimmy, {{with a gesture}} of resignation.

6000|$|... "You {{want the}} best lodgings in the place, and then, when at a {{tremendous}} cost of trouble, they have been obtained for you, you object {{to pay the price}} asked for them. You all try and palm yourselves off for dukes and duchesses, travelling in disguise. You have none of you ever heard of a second-class railway carriage--didn't know that such things were <b>made.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> a first-class Pullman car reserved for each two of you. Some of you have seen an omnibus in the distance, and have wondered what it was used for. To suggest that you should travel in such a plebeian conveyance, is to give you a shock that takes you two days to recover from. You expect a private carriage, with a footman in livery, to take you through the mountains. You, all of you, must have the most expensive places in the theatre. The eight-mark and six-mark places are every bit as good as the ten-mark seats, of which there are only a very limited number; but you are grossly insulted if it is hinted that you should sit in anything but the dearest chairs. If the villagers would only be sensible and charge you ten marks for the eight-mark places you would be happy; but they won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} these women as immense. No doubt {{they were of}} negotiable size, but I was only a very little chap and they have assumed nightmare proportions in my mind. They loomed, they bulged, they impended. Mrs. Mackridge was large and dark; there was a marvel about her head, inasmuch as she was bald. She wore a dignified cap, {{and in front of}} that upon her brow, hair was PAINTED. I have never seen the like since. She had been maid to the widow of Sir Roderick Blenderhasset Impey, some sort of governor or such-like portent in the East Indies, and from her remains--in Mrs. Mackridge--I judge Lady Impey was a very stupendous and crushing creature indeed. Lady Impey had been of the Juno type, haughty, unapproachable, given to irony and a caustic wit. Mrs. Mackridge had no wit, but she had acquired the caustic voice and gestures along with the old satins and trimmings of the great lady. When she told you it was a fine morning, she seemed also to be telling you you were a fool and a low fool to boot; when she was spoken to, she had a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous, scornful [...] "Haw!" [...] that <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to burn her alive. She also had a way of saying [...] "Indade!" [...] with a droop of the eyelids.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't help being yourself. You can't help {{being a very}} {{desirable}} creature so far as I am concerned. <b>You</b> have <b>made</b> me <b>want</b> <b>you.</b> You didn't intend to; you didn't try to. <b>You</b> were so <b>made,</b> that is all. And I was so {{made that}} I was ripe to <b>want</b> <b>you.</b> But I can't help being myself. I can't by an effort of will cease from <b>wanting</b> <b>you,</b> {{any more than you}} by an effort of will can make yourself undesirable to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} primary factors favor release or transfer :a. CSRT:#The detainee testified: [...] "I {{needed to}} survive, so I did {{work with the}} government, which {{was at the time}} the Taliban government and I work with them and that's the only mistake I <b>made</b> if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to call it that, or that's the only thing I did.":b. Exculpatory:#The detainee emphasized this was merely a civilian position and he had no real political responsibilities within the Taliban. Additionally, he had no interaction with the leaders in the Taliban.:#The detainee admitted his allegiance with the Taliban as he was fearful of standing against the current governing body in Afghanistan.:#The detainee does not know any of the al Qaeda members detained at Guantanamo. He cannot interact with the Arabs as he does not speak their language.|$|R
5000|$|Summing up his {{philosophy}} on how science is best managed, McMillan quoted {{from the collection}} of Lewis Thomas essays, Lives of a Cell: [...] "What research needs is for the air to be <b>made</b> right. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a bee to make honey, you do not issue protocols on solar navigation or carbohydrate chemistry, you put him together with other bees [...] [...] [...] and you do what you can to arrange the general environment around the hive. If the air is right, the science will come in its own season, like pure honey." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had several}} big-time mistakes. I {{felt at the}} time that it happened, 'Why am I here?' You're heartsick about a call that you <b>made.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> {{everything}} to be perfect. But it's not a perfect science. There's nothing perfect." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He was a womanizer {{certainly}} {{he made no}} secret of it, and yet there was far more to him than that. There was something oddly endearing about him, like a young boy gone wild, but with a look in his eyes that <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to hug him." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Burke {{graduated}} from La Salle, {{he earned a}} job as freshman coach at his alma mater, St. Joseph's Prep. He was soon promoted to head coach, and won the 1971 Catholic League Championship. Phil Martelli, current coach of St. Joseph's, {{was a member of}} that team, and said that Burke [...] "made coaching personal. It was about you as a person. He used a lot of humor. He <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to practice, and he <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to play." [...] The following year, Burke coached St. Thomas More High School to a Catholic League title, winning the Catholic League Coach of the Year honors for the second straight season. He is the only coach to accomplish this feat at two different high schools. St. Thomas More closed in 1975, and Burke came to Bishop McDevitt and West Catholic for one year each.|$|E
40|$|In many cases, {{how hard}} one works is less {{important}} than how one works. Robotics now has the critical mass of intellectual muscle it needs to progress rapidly, but it is lacking the philosophy and the tools to drive it forward as a unified field. Using Computer Science and its subfields as models for a successful academic disciplines, this paper provides suggestions for ways that we can improve our collective intellectual throughput. Rather than suggest directions for the entire field of Robotics, improvements in methodology and fields of study are suggested for individual researchers. The field of Robot Architecture is proposed, as well as an Internet-based living lexicon for robotic terminology. Several explicit suggestions for ways to improve individual research methods are <b>made.</b> Introduction If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to start a successful business, you start by looking to other successful businesses. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be a successful performer, you look to other successful performers. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1934 {{he became}} an {{instructor}} at Tufts. He worked there {{the rest of his}} life, rising to full professor in 1960. Holmes's students admired him. [...] "When he taught," [...] wrote Jerome Barron, [...] "something magical happened. He <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to write and understand poetry. He didn't lecture; he encouraged. Simplicity, and writing that went from the inside out, this is what he was after." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Every {{person in}} their {{formative}} years, needs a good solid role model. Someone {{they can look}} up to, someone who does {{all the right things}} -- Tommy was that person to me. He was a hard worker, the last to leave the practice field. Smart, friendly, sincere and truly liked and admired by everyone who met him. There was something about him that <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be around him and be his friend, a quality few of us have but wished we did." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reactions to the {{production}} have been very positive. Michael Billington of the British newspaper The Guardian claimed it was [...] "as good as theatre gets". Michael Coveney of the British Independent newspaper wrote that although the style was impressive, the acting {{was the most important}} quality: [...] "Many of the techniques were familiar in modern production. But the overall scope of this wonderful project was impressive because of the acting quality of Toneelgroep. It <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to go straight on to Amsterdam and catch the rest of their repertoire." ...|$|E
50|$|Comm South Companies {{was created}} and opened for {{business}} in the late 1990s. They offered prepaid home phone service to anyone regardless of credit, past due bills, or proof of identity. When the company started all dial tone lines were completely blocked meaning that only local telephone calls could be made and no collect, 900, or other toll calls could be <b>made.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to call long distance you {{would be required to}} buy a prepaid long distance card from a local store. Over time, Comm South Companies acquired a long distance plan which would allow you to make long distance calls from your home phone which was prepaid in advance. Each bill you received from Comm South was a bill for the next month of service and the due date was before that next month of service which is why the service was prepaid before you even used it to prevent people from running up high bills and not paying.|$|R

5000|$|With Roy, you didn't know if {{you were}} {{listening}} to mariachi or opera. He kept you on your toes. With him, {{it was all about}} fat and blood. He sounded like he was singing from an Olympian mountaintop. [...] "Ooby Dooby" [...] he was now singing his compositions in three or four octaves that <b>made</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to drive your car over a cliff. He sang like a professional criminal ... His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, 'Man, I don't believe it'.|$|E
5000|$|Benton's {{directing}} {{has been}} praised by Hoffman, who credits him for inspiring the emotional level supporting many scenes: [...] "Perfect directors make you emotional. On Kramer vs. Kramer, Robert Benton made me emotional. He was pulling {{so hard for}} me. When I didn't think I could do a scene again I'd say, [...] "I can't give it to you, I haven't got it." [...] Then he'd just get this {{look on his face}} and roll the camera and I'd say, [...] "Okay, this is yours."
