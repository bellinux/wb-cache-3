50|$|The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) {{determined}} that the accident {{was caused by the}} flight crew allowing the aircraft to descend significantly below the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> <b>height</b> for the approach without gaining sight of the approach lighting or runway threshold. The AAIB also found that the crew had failed to cross-check altimeter height indications during the approach, that the non-handling pilot failed to call out the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> <b>height</b> as the aircraft reached that altitude, and that the flight crew's performance had been impaired by the effects of fatigue.|$|E
50|$|On January 20, 1981, Cascade Airways Flight 201, Beech 99 N390CA, {{operating}} Seattle-Yakima-Spokane, crashed at 11:27 am PST in fog {{during its}} approach to Spokane International Airport. Seven were killed: five passengers and the cockpit crew, Captain David Weinberger and First Officer Paul Davis. Two passengers survived the crash and fire, Steven Tarnoff and James Eagle. It crashed into a wooded hillside 4.5 mi southwest of the airport, the NTSB investigation resulted in a determination of pilot error due to the crew using an incorrect frequency for a navigational aid and subsequently descending below the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> <b>Height</b> for that approach to the airport.|$|E
50|$|The crash site, on a 2,300 ft hill, was 1.6 mi {{northeast}} {{of where the}} aircraft should {{have been on the}} inbound course to the NDB. The published NDB approach brings the inbound aircraft down a valley, and has a <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> <b>height</b> of 2,150 ft at the missed approach point (where they should have climbed and turned to the right if the runway was not in view), which is below the elevation of the hills to the north. The runway is at 510 ft MSL. Five other aircraft had landed prior to the CT-43A and had not experienced any problems with the navigational aids. There was no emergency call from the pilots, and they did not initiate a missed approach, even though they were beyond the missed approach point when they hit the hill at 2:57 PM local time.|$|E

5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|R
5000|$|At 9:48 a.m., the Tweed New Haven Regional Airport tower {{controller}} {{gave the}} flight {{a choice of}} either Runway 2 or Runway 20 for landing. Flight 485 responded: [...] "O.K., {{the way it looks}} we will take two. It will be all right." [...] The flight was cleared for a downwind landing on Runway 2. As noted in the NTSB accident report, downwind landings at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport were prohibited by an Allegheny Airlines company directive. The first officer called out airspeed and descent rate as the flight descended past the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> <b>height</b> of 380 feet, which was verbally acknowledged by the captain, who then told the first officer to [...] "keep a sharp eye out here." [...] Approximately 18 seconds later, with the aircraft still descending, the first officer remarked: [...] "You can't see down through this stuff." [...] The captain responded that he could see the water. The first officer exclaimed that they were [...] "right over the water." [...] No apparent attempt to stop the descent was made. Approximately 3.5 seconds after the first officer's remark, an abrupt voice said [...] "Hold it." [...] The recording ended approximately 2 seconds later.|$|E
25|$|The NTSC {{concluded}} that the flight path became unstable below <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude with the rate of descent exceeding 1000 feet per minute. The flight crew lost situational awareness and visual references as the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude. The Captain’s go-around decision and execution was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient {{for it to be}} executed successfully. The pilots were not provided with timely and accurate weather information considering the weather around the airport and particularly on final approach was changing rapidly.|$|R

40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{and erosion}} patterns on simulated lunar surfaces (hard and soft) and interference effects between {{the surface and}} two representative lunar vehicles (cylindrical and spherical) were obtained with cold-air jets at various <b>descent</b> <b>heights</b> and nozzle total-pressure ratios up to 288, 000. Surface pressure distributions were dependent on both nozzle area ratio and, nozzle contour. Peak pressures obtained with a sonic nozzle agreed closely with those predicted theoretically for a near-sonic jet expanding into a vacuum. Short bell-shaped nozzles gave annular pressure distributions; the low center pressure resulted from the coalescence of shocks that originated within the nozzle. The high surface pressures were contained within a circle whose diameter was about 16 throat diameters, regardless of nozzle area ratio or contour. The peak pressure increased rapidly as the vehicle approached the surface; for example, at a <b>descent</b> <b>height</b> of 40 throat diameters the peak pressure was 0. 4 percent of the chamber pressure, but increased to 6 percent at 13 throat diameters. The exhaust jet eroded a circular concave hole in white sand at <b>descent</b> <b>heights</b> from about 200 to 600 throat diameters. The hole diameter was about 225 throat diameters, while the depth was approximately 60 throat diameters. The sand particles, which formed a conical sheet at a semivertex angle of 50 deg, appeared to follow a ballistic trajectory and at no time struck the vehicle. An increase in pressure was measured {{on the base of}} the cylindrical lunar vehicle when it approached to within 14 throat diameters of the hard, flat surface. No interference effects were noted between the spherical model and the surface to <b>descent</b> <b>heights</b> as low as 8 throat diameters...|$|R

50|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 46 is {{currently}} the deadliest to {{have occurred in the}} state of Maine. At the time of the crash, the crew had descended the Twin Otter below the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude in order to see the runway in heavy fog.|$|R
50|$|After the {{retrieval}} {{of both the}} flight recorders of Flight 222, investigators then examined its content. Initial examination of the Cockpit Voice Recorder revealed that the flight crew neither conducted an approach briefing nor a descent/approach checklist after the flight had been cleared by Magong Tower to land. This was contrary to the company's Standard Operating Procedure. Even though the flight crew did not formally brief or discuss the details in the approach chart, the first officer did remind the captain about several important things, including height of the aircraft and the distance requirements. As the examination continued, {{it was revealed that}} the crews had already known what they needed to know for the approach. They already knew that the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> Altitude was at 330 ft, however, while on the approach, the flight crews kept descending the aircraft well below from 330 ft and even as low as 200 ft. The CVR also showed that there was no discussion among the crew on whether the required visual references had been obtained as Captain Lee still puts the aircraft in descent well below the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> Altitude. First Officer Chiang did not intervene Captain Lee's mistake but rather coordinated with Lee's decision to descend below the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> Altitude, contrary to the Standard Operating Procedure.|$|R
5000|$|Non-precision approach. The MAP for a {{non-precision}} approach is typically crossed at the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude (MDA), {{and may be}} anywhere from well prior to the runway threshold to past {{the opposite end of}} the runway, depending on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and air traffic considerations.|$|R

5000|$|Flare : The final {{attitude}} is the flare {{which is basically}} {{a continuation of the}} roundout attitude to a slight climb attitude. The objective is to descend at the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> rate and lowest possible forward speed. When performed correctly the aircraft will gently contact the ground at a descent rate of 100 ft/min (30 m/min) or less.|$|R
2500|$|At first, icing was {{considered}} as a possible cause of the crash. This was later ruled out as a factor by the NTSB. The cause of the crash was the loss of altitude awareness; {{this led to a}} failure to maintain <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude for the approach resulting in an impact with trees and a ridge before the aircraft reached the [...] runway.|$|R
50|$|The {{structural}} failure {{that occurred in}} flight was a result from the crew's error in descending below the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> Altitude of 5400 ft. The right wing struck a ridge at 1300 ft, the aircraft then broke up and impacted the slope of a ridge 1.3 km further on. The tail section and right wing were found 150 m from the main wreckage.|$|R
50|$|At 18:55, Flight 222 {{was cleared}} to land. Flight 222 descended and {{maintained}} their altitude at 2,000 ft. Flight 222 then descended from 2000 ft to its assigned altitude of 400 ft. The crews then set their assigned altitude to 300 ft, below the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> Altitude of 330 ft. After descending through 344 ft, the crews then set the altitude to 200 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{preliminary}} investigation report {{stated that the}} crew breached air safety regulations on all three approaches by descending below the decision height of 200 ft before initiating a missed approach.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"December 2006. "Operators {{of mobile}} {{construction}} equipment (e. g., bulldozers, scrapers, etc.) often opt to descend {{out of the}} cabin in an irregular fashion without using proper egress methods, despite being trained on proper egress methods. The main objective {{of this research was}} to quantify and compare the effect of arm posture, landing style, and <b>descent</b> <b>height</b> on ground reaction forces, and acceleration at the ankle and knee by performing a laboratory study. Fifteen male subjects descended from three different <b>descent</b> <b>heights</b> (38. 1, 50. 8, and 63. 5 cm) using three different arm postures (arms to the side, arms front, and arms crossed) and landing on both legs at the same time, right leg first, and left leg first. The results demonstrated that with the increase in <b>descent</b> <b>heights,</b> the ground reaction forces, and accelerations at the ankle and knee increased. Landing with the arms out stretched horizontally in front of the body (arms front) resulted in higher ground reaction forces, peak resultant acceleration at the knee, and higher transmissibility between the ankle and the knee compared to the arms hanging {{to the side of the}} body. Although having the arms out front when landing may slightly reduce impact forces, this posture may help in maintaining balance upon landing. Landing with “both legs at same time” increased the GRF, whereas landing on one leg first followed by the other leg seemed to distribute the landing force over a longer period of time. Landing on one or two legs at the heights tested in this study resulted in ground reaction forces lower than injury threshold values for the ankle from previous research. However, descending from higher heights may result in impact forces approaching or exceeding injury threshold levels. Results from this study on the effect of arm posture and landing style may be helpful for training OE on egress at lower level heights, however, engineering controls may be needed at higher egress heights...|$|R
50|$|The First Officer {{had complained}} {{that he did not}} have an {{approach}} plate in front of him and hadn't seen the approach. From a pilot's perspective, this alone would be considered the cause of the crash because the approach plate (chart) provides the pilot with the courses and minimum altitudes necessary to execute the approach without impacting terrain. The chart would have indicated the <b>minimum</b> <b>descent</b> altitude of 2,400 feet, preventing the accident. Flying an approach without referring to the approach plate is gross negligence.|$|R
25|$|The Captain {{wanted to}} descend to 2,000ft, but the First Officer {{reminded}} him that the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Descent</b> Altitude (MDA) was 2,500ft, indicating the possible intentions of the Captain. However, later on, the plane descended through 2,300ft, thus violating the MDA of 2.500ft. After break-off from ILS approach, the Captain ignored the tower controller’s suggestion to fly a bad weather circuit by saying “let him say whatever he wants to say”. The CVR recording and flight simulation show that the Captain probably decided to fly a managed approach, unbeknownst to the ATS.|$|R
