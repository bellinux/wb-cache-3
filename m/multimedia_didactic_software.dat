40|$|Current {{educational}} systems have {{the need to}} resort to technological means to improve the teaching - learning process. One of these means are <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactic</b> materials. But are they really effective, {{in order to achieve}} the objective for which they have been designed? Are they only content transmitters? How effective are they? We can affirm that for the design of multimedia materials, not only should we think about meeting short-term goals, but also if the results that will be achieved in the long term will have some effect on the integral formation of the person. Bearing these objectives clear, it is necessary that all didactic material comply with standards that guarantee effectiveness. Therefore, the teacher must know these standards and know how to use them. In this way, all <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactic</b> material should not be based on rote learning but should promote the construction of knowledge and research, thus fulfilling the functions of providing information, awakening interests, maintaining a continuous activity and interaction with materials, guiding the learning, promote it from the mistakes, since it should offer them the possibility of improving gradually; and finally should facilitate the evaluation and control of learning both individually and as a team. Therefore, the module is divided into four (4) sessions whose credible products in each session will enable it to be published in web 2. 0 services and / or virtual learning platforms: In session 1, you will know the basic fundamentals on the subject and explore the various resources needed for the design, preparation and publication of <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactic</b> materials using <b>software</b> or web 2. 0 services. In session 2, you will design, produce and publish textual and hypertextual content using web 2. 0 software or services. In Session 3, you will explore various audio databases. You can also create your own audios or podcast using software and web 2. 0 tools. In turn, credible products will be published in web 2. 0 services. In session 4, you will explore and edit various video databases. Additionally, you will create your own webcast or videos using software and web 2. 0 tools.

40|$|Abstract Background Practice {{guidelines}} (PGs) are systematically developed statements {{intended to}} assist in patient, practitioner, and policy decisions. The AGREE II is the revised and updated standard tool for guideline development, reporting and evaluation. It is comprised of 23 items and a user's Manual. The AGREE II is ready for use. Objectives To develop, execute, and evaluate the impact of two internet-based educational interventions designed to accelerate the capacity of stakeholders to use the AGREE II: a <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactic</b> tutorial with a virtual coach, and a higher intensity training program including both the didactic tutorial and an interactive practice exercise component. Methods Participants (clinicians, developers, and policy makers) will be {{randomly assigned to one}} of three conditions. Condition one, didactic tutorial [...] participants will go through the on-line AGREE II tutorial supported by a virtual coach and review of the AGREE II prior to appraising the test PG. Condition two, tutorial + practice [...] following the <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactic</b> tutorial with a virtual coach, participants will review the on-line AGREE II independently and use it to appraise a practice PG. Upon entering their AGREE II score for the practice PG, participants will be given immediate feedback on how their score compares to expert norms. If their score falls outside a predefined range, the participant will receive a series of hints to guide the appraisal process. Participants will receive an overall summary of their performance appraising the PG compared to expert norms. Condition three, control arm [...] participants will receive a PDF copy of the AGREE II for review and to appraise the test PG on-line. All participants will then rate one of ten test PGs with the AGREE II. The outcomes of interest are learners' performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, mental effort, and time-on-task; comparisons will be made across each of the test groups. Discussion Our research will test innovative educational interventions of various intensities and instructional design to promote the adoption of AGREE II and to identify those strategies that are most effective for training. The results will facilitate international capacity to apply the AGREE II accurately and with confidence and to enhance the overall guideline enterprise. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is on self-regulated learning processes while using e-Learning applications considering as example apprentices. The thesis consists of five parts: introduction into {{the use of interactive}} media in vocational training, principles of self-regulated learning and of <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactics</b> and psychology, survey (expertise) and evaluation of a specific multimedia learn software for self-regulated learning for apprentices in the trade of electricians and concluding modification concepts for the evaluated learn software in regard to integration of effective functions to support self-regulated learning with this program. One of the main focuses in the theoretical part (part I) is the reflection on learn psychological conditions for effective self-regulated learning. On the one hand, the necessary competences and learn strategies for the learner were analyzed. On the other hand, didactical methods for encouragement and training of self-regulated learning were discussed. Furthermore, the fundamental instructional, psychological and multimedia presentation techniques and methods for e-learning applications were developed. A particular emphasis was put on pedagogical agents which are able to support learners during their self-regulated learning processes. In {{the second part of the}} thesis a survey of the learn software Elektrische Schutzmassnahmen(electrical precaution) was done on the basis of the instructional, psychological and multimedia presentation criteria worked out in part 1. The survey was carried out by the author of the dissertation. The learn software was designed for self-regulated learning for apprentices in the trade of electricians. The results of the survey are presented in a chart showing the positive and negative effects. In addition to that, an extensive examination and discussion of the media presentation techniques, their functions and didactic is given. The third step is an evaluation of the learn program Elektrische Schutzmassnahmen(electrical precaution). About 190 apprentices and 16 instructors in 20 training posts were interviewed. On the one hand was the insight, that the multimedia program has made the learn process about the very abstract rules and norms of the electrician preventive measure much more attractive and interesting. on the other hand has been detected that the learn software show lot of lacks for effective self regulated learning. In the fourth part have been worked out concrete concepts for the modification of the learn software Elektrische Schutzmassnahmen (electrical precaution). The concepts are based on the theoretical insights about the self regulated learning, about <b>multimedia</b> <b>didactics</b> as soon as on the outcomes and conclusions of the expertise and of the evaluation. The improvement is based on modified and additional functions for support the self regulated learning process with the program. An important part of the modification was the transformation of the existing guide character to the pedagogical agent with coach and team mate functionality. For the implementation have been prepared concrete technical solutions and screenplays. The main conclusions of the work: an effective self regulated learning had to be train and to be use consciously; in the vocational training for the apprentice there is scarcely introduction to the topic and the competences of self regulated learning; pedagogical agents could well support learner by more effective self regulated learning processes; e-learning applications should contain supporting functions for self regulated learning...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} {{hypermedia}} {{has led to}} a proliferation of <b>didactic</b> <b>software</b> available on the market, but it is getting more and more difﬁ cult to choose the right product. To meet the teacher’s need to acquire methodologies and tools supporting her/his new function of critical evaluator of didactic SW, we have created HyperValu@tor, a tool for the multidisciplinary assessment of didactic hypermedia. HyperValu@tor takes into account the main quality indicators guaranteeing overall teaching efﬁ cacy (content, multimediality, interactivity, navigability, style). Using the questionnaire supplied, the teacher/evaluator assigns a score (from 0 to 2) to a series of questions probing these quality indicators. All the indicators need to be considered in order to achieve an overall assessment, but if only some aspects of a hypermedia need to be judged, the single indicators can be assessed separately with HyperValu@tor. This dynamic navigation, offering the possibility to choose which indicators to evaluate, is one of the strong points of HyperValu@tor. But its most salient feature is that it allows teachers/evaluators to set up collaborative activities through the Web. Unlike other tools in the ﬁ eld, with HyperValu@tor it is possible to make a public evaluation, whereby several users can collaborate to achieve an assessment of the same product...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpeaking about sounds {{is not an}} easy task. Although {{there are}} many words {{available}} in our language to describe acoustic sensations, there is no strong consensus on the meaning of sound descriptors. Whereas visual stimuli can easily be described by everyone using simple words such as shapes, colors and textures, the characterization of sound stimuli is much more delicate, especially for people who don't have a proper sound expertise. Therefore several practical domains are suffering from barriers in the communication of sound related matters. Sound practitioners such as sound designers, acousticians, composers, sound engineers… are using a very technical lexicon to talk about sound and music. Speaking to non-experts in such terms can easily lead to misunderstanding. On the other side, people from the industry often need to formulate requirements for a desired sound (either product sounds, digital sounds, soundscapes) {{in the early stages of}} a design process and they do not have a standard way to express themselves. In this study we tried to develop a common sound lexicon adapted for communication purposes based both on theoretical literature and on sound experts practice.

40|$|Abstract:- This {{communication}} {{is based on}} a seven years experience of teaching day lighting to graduate architects coming from very different latitudes and climates. We first created <b>didactic</b> <b>software</b> to help them controlling sun paths. Later, we developed it gradually to support the common part of the problem: the geometrical one. With the same knowledge and tool, the students imagined very different projects, which reflected their different sensitivities and ideas about light, especially in its chromatic aspect. Their works confirmed us the evidence that the justified preoccupation about ecology and sustainability must not obviate the fact that good architecture is, first of all, an art. The software, “Heliodon”, developed by Benoit Beckers and Luc Masset, offers synthetic and original representations that allow the architect to develop its design freely, but controlling simultaneously space and time aspects. It complements commercial rendering software and is a fundamental component of a personal theory about light ambiances and color. The results are very original projects that blend aesthetic expression, geometrical control and environmental conscience. With this teaching, every architect is expected to discover his personal daylight. In the near future, the contributions of architects and urban designers will also be fundamental in order to extend the studies of solar radiation to large urban areas. The collaboration between geographers, climatologists and physicists will be crucial in order to define the appropriate numerical mockups at different scales.

40|$|New {{technological}} advances provide an increasingly faster communication {{and a general}} exchange of information and ideas. One of the great challenges of our time is {{to take advantage of}} those new technologies for education. The initial impulse for the creation of educational games was the need to reinforce learning using the potential of the digital world. The acquisition of content and the overall learning are indeed favoured by a custom <b>didactic</b> <b>software</b> with catchy graphics. Recent developments in media and technology force us to rethink traditional teaching methods and {{to take advantage of the}} latest technological evolution. To better understand the potential of these technologies, we need to highlight some of the most important moments of media history, gamification and mobile learning. The aim of this study lies in the application of the fundamentals, procedures and notions of mobile learning to a prototype of an educational game for the operating system of Apple's iPhone. Teachers may use this data entry interface as a platform to create custom classes, adapting them to the curriculum of their classes. In addition to being evaluated in class, students can stay connected to the application throughout the day with a game inspired by the popular model known as "Tamagotchi". As a practical example of the implementation of this “app”, we have created an artistic education class adapted to the level of "fundamental education" for six to eight-year-old children. We have also developed an appropriate graphic design concept for this age group. In the end, we will identify and discuss the advantages and the potential of this software for education in general and specifically for arts educatio...|$|R
