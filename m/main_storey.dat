50|$|A canal house (grachtenpand) is a (usually old) house {{overseeing}} a canal. These {{houses are}} often slim, high and deep. Because {{of the danger}} of flooding the front door is sometimes higher up and only reachable via stairs. The floor of the <b>main</b> <b>storey</b> lies about seven to nine steps above street level. Many stoops disappeared in the 19th century when entrances were moved to the basement.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was to be}} built [...] "immediately south" [...] of the Electrical & Engineering Building. Cost was {{estimated}} at $1 million upon announcement, tendered at $1,000,299.26, and $1,000,299 upon the beginning of construction. Interior dimensions were set at 445 ft long by 292 ft. The <b>main</b> <b>storey</b> was to offer 940980 ft2 m2 of exhibition area, and the mezzanine floor 34000 ft2 m2. This was twice {{the area of the}} Electrical Building. It was to feature [...] "modern lighting of the indirect type." [...] It was to include a [...] "public dining-room of sumptuous appointments." [...] Decorative iron work was to be used throughout.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{architectural}} {{style of the}} building is Italianate Classic Revival. The building consists two <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> together with an entranceway from the road, a basement, an attic and a clock tower.|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the three}} <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> has a higher ceiling than the one below, the ceiling height being {{indicative}} {{of the importance of}} the rooms' occupants: least noble at the bottom and grandest at the top.|$|R
50|$|The post 1896 {{building}} has two <b>main</b> <b>storeys,</b> plus a basement and the attic space. Built using Bath stone with Portland stone columns, the main south facade is symmetrical in a Neo-Classical style {{divided into three}} bays. The long east and west elevations are of similar materials and composition, but in a French classical style.|$|R
50|$|The new village {{comprised}} two identical rows of brick-built semi-detached cottages, each of {{a single}} <b>main</b> <b>storey</b> plus an attic floor with dormer windows. The two identical rows face {{each other across the}} Oxford-Reading and Henley-on-Thames (i.e. south-east) main road, which had been made a turnpike in 1736. (It has been classified the A4074 since the 20th century.) As the village population has subsequently grown, additional cottages have been added in similar styles early in the 19th century and again early in the 20th century. The old village had a village green. The new village has none, but was built to a spacious plan with gardens for every cottage and verges between them and the main road.|$|E
5000|$|The {{height of}} these roof pagodas is 2.84 meters each. The ninth pagoda {{occupies}} {{the center of}} the roof. It is almost twice as large as its peers (5.33 meters) and its single door faces south. Including these roof decorations, the total height of the pagoda is 13.36 meters. The eaves of the pagoda are made from 17 layers of brick as is characteristic for the period. The pagoda stands {{on the grounds of the}} Nine Pagoda (...) Temple. A change in the appearance of the walls of the pagoda near the middle of the main body (at 3.6 meters above ground) is seen as an indication that the lower half of the pagoda may have been formerly surrounded by another structure. The arched entrance door to the pagoda's <b>main</b> <b>storey</b> is located right above this transition. It leads to a chamber which houses a 1.2-meter tall Buddha statue made from stone and executed the style of the Tang Dynasty. There are also statues of two monks. On the wall of the chamber a few traces of Buddhist murals remain.|$|E

50|$|Located at {{the western}} end of Flinders Street near the corner of Knapp Street, the former Lion Brewery is in a semi-industrial area of Townsville, {{opposite}} the former railway yards and a two storey hotel on the corner with Knapp Street. Set back from the corner, but built to the Flinders Street alignment, it is an imposing multi-storeyed brick building consisting of two <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> and a tower on the south western end of the site. Originally red brick with contrasting white window surrounds, the building is now painted.|$|R
5000|$|By 1705 {{the house}} had been {{returned}} to the Powis family and in that year they sold it to John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who had alterations made by John Vanbrugh. Thereafter it was called Newcastle House. The building was a compact block with three <b>main</b> <b>storeys,</b> plus two storeys of basements below and two storeys of attics above. It was built of brick with bold stone quoins, band courses and cornice. There were two projecting wings to the rear, so a large amount of accommodation was fitted into the compact site.|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} been {{restored}} to look as it did during Handel's 36 year occupancy from 1723 to 1759. A typical early 18th century London terrace house, it comprises a basement, three <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> and an attic, and Handel was the first occupant. The attic was later converted into a fourth full floor. The ground floor is a shop not associated with the Museum, and the upper floors are leased to a charity called the Handel House Trust, and have been {{open to the public}} since 8 November 2001.|$|R

50|$|The {{houses in}} Eaton Square are large, {{predominantly}} three bay wide buildings, joined in regular terraces in a classical style, with {{four or five}} <b>main</b> <b>storeys,</b> plus attic and basement and a mews house behind. The square is one of London's largest and is divided into six compartments by {{the upper end of}} Kings Road (northeast of Sloane Square), a main road, now busy with traffic, that occupies its long axis, and two smaller cross streets. Most of the houses are faced with white stucco, but some are faced with brick.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tower is}} built of red ashlar, and {{measures}} 10 by 9 m, with the walls being 5 ft thick. [...] The entrance {{is to the}} south, at ground level, with a statue niche above and a turnpike stair to its left. There are four <b>main</b> <b>storeys,</b> and an attic with crowstep gables. The hall, on the first floor, is rib-vaulted in two bays, and has stone seats in the windows. It is over a vaulted basement comprising two poorly lit chambers. There is an unusual double garderobe chute at the north gable.|$|R

50|$|Brettingham's {{house was}} in a late Palladian style. It was seven bays wide with three <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> plus {{basement}} and attics and was built of brick with stone dressings. The Duke of Cumberland made various alterations. He built a projecting west wing {{on the site of}} a neighbouring house that he purchased and added a pair of lodges flanking the forecourt, probably all to designs by Robert Adam. Adam also made many designs for remodelling the interiors, which are now in the collection at the Sir John Soane's Museum, but only a few of them were carried out.|$|R
50|$|The street {{facade of}} Schomberg House is {{striking}} and rather {{unusual for a}} London mansion. It is of red brick, with four <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> above the basement. The facade's street-level entrance porticoes and decorative work is made of Lithodipyra (Coade stone) manufactured by Eleanor Coade. It is nine windows wide, with the central three bays projecting slightly and topped by a pediment, and the two end bays projecting boldly so that they form projections somewhat like small towers. The windows are narrow and six bold bands of quoins frame the three projections, giving the facade an energetic verticality.|$|R
2500|$|The hall {{is built}} in banded pink and buff {{sandstone}} with a grey-green slate roof. The building is nearly symmetrical, in ten bays, {{and in the}} Gothic Revival style, applying features of late 13th-century Gothic architecture to a modern use. Above the central two bays is a tower which terminates with gables and a short diagonal spire. The spire rises to a height of [...] The building has a semi-basement, two <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> and a dormer attic. The entrance is approached by two opposed flights of steps. Above the porch are four sculptures in Bath stone depicting episodes {{from the history of}} the city.|$|R
50|$|This first {{building}} has three <b>main</b> <b>storeys,</b> {{the ground or}} basement constructed of Port Chalmers breccia with the floors above built of Oamaru limestone. There was a central entrance at the first floor level - the piano nobile in architectural terms - reached by a double flight of steps from the street. Above it {{there is a high}} tower of five more levels incorporating a clock, bells and a mansard roof. The four corners of the building also have mansard roofs. The tower is 47 metres (165 feet) {{to the base of the}} flagpole and is very prominent in central Dunedin. The building’s principal elevation still dominates the Octagon.|$|R

5|$|The {{north and}} south sides of the {{quadrangle}} have large arched carriage openings beneath shaped gables; the keystones are carved with horse's heads. The walls within the carriageway opening are decorated with bands of blue brick. The east, {{north and south}} faces are all finished with an openwork brick parapet with a stone coping. The west building has twelve arched openings accessed from the courtyard. The <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> of the quadrangle mainly have three-light, stone-dressed mullion windows, with two-light windows at the attic level. All the roofs have tall octagonal chimneys and feature decorative ridge tiles. The interior of the stables block was rebuilt during the building's conversion to its present use of laboratories and offices.|$|R
5000|$|Architectural {{features}} {{give the}} building a regal appearance. The ground story is rusticated, while the principal stories {{are of the}} Corinthian order. The terrace block originally consisted of 19 houses, with Nos. 20 and 21 constructed later from the south pavilion. The original design contained three <b>main</b> <b>storeys,</b> an attic storey, pavilions, mansards, and basements, as well as shallow porches, square headed doorways, shallow architraves, first floor cornices, balustraded parapets, wings with Venetian-style windows, cast iron balconies, and spearhead area railings. There are fluted shafts, well proportioned capitals, and an entablature, No. 1 was adorned with a caryatid-bow. [...] At the westernmost end, No. 10 was provided with bow windows which continued up over two stories.|$|R
50|$|The house {{contains}} {{remnants of}} a late medieval building, but the exterior {{and some of the}} internal fittings date from the 18th century. The building is square in plan has two <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> as well as an attic and cellars. A wide staircase occupies the middle of the house while the front bedrooms are lined with 18th century wall panelling. The west wing is the oldest part of the building, with roof trussess suggesting it dates to the early 1500s. The exterior south (front) facade is a later remodelling of the early 1700s, with a symmetrical arrangement of windows and a hipped roof. The house has a large 18th century walled garden and summer house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first version}} of Powis House {{was built in the}} 1690s for William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis. No {{drawings}} of this version survive. At some point it was let for use as the French embassy, and on 26 January 1713 it burned to the ground. Jonathan Swift attributed this event to [...] "the carelessness of the rascally French servants". A replacement house was soon built. It had three <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> above an arched basement and was 104 feet (32 metres) wide. The subtle but lively façade featured Corinthian pilasters and a phoenix above the front door. The architect is unknown, but may have been French. The staircase walls were painted by the Venetian painter of the rococo, Giacomo Amiconi.|$|R
50|$|A Scheduled {{monument}} {{that includes}} the 13th-century hall-house and bailey with traces of other buildings, possibly of a later date, and a small stone-built boat landing east of the bailey. The structure appears to have comprised two <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> and a part attic. The castle was probably built {{by one of the}} MacDougall lords of Lorn in the 13th century. Documentary evidence from the late 14th century records it as Dounarwyse Castle in the possession of the Lords of the Isles. Lord Ochiltree entertained the Island Chiefs here before making them prisoners 1608. It was described as 'ruinous, old, useless and never of any strength' in 1688 but seems to have been garrisoned by Argyll's troops in 1690. No evidence exists of any occupation in the 18th century or later.|$|R
5000|$|The house, {{situated}} in the fashionable parish of St George's, Hanover Square, Westminster, was built in 1756-1761 by Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont (1710-1763), of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset and of Petworth House in Sussex, Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1761-63, and was thus first known as Egremont House. The house is in the late Palladian style, {{to the design of}} the architect Matthew Brettingham. It has three <b>main</b> <b>storeys</b> plus basement and attics and is seven bays wide. As is usual in a London mansion of the period, the first floor (piano nobile, [...] "second floor" [...] in American English) is the principal floor, containing a circuit of reception rooms. This floor has the highest ceilings and its status is emphasised externally by a Venetian window in the centre.|$|R
2500|$|The King and Queen {{has been}} widely praised for its distinctive, elaborately {{detailed}} architecture. Clayton & Black's [...] "theatrical rebuilding", completed in 1932, created an architectural [...] "pantomime" [...] of [...] "olde-worlde Tudor" [...] elements incorporating [...] "an impressive array of seemingly authentic details". The architects used a [...] "wonderful assembly" [...] of features commonly associated with 16th-century Vernacular architecture, selecting those which gave the most decorative appearance and allowed the widest variety of materials to be used. The main structure is of red brick laid in the English bond pattern; there is stonework to the ground floor, plaster and timber framing above, and a tiled roof with three weatherboarded dormer windows at the top (attic) storey, below which are the two <b>main</b> <b>storeys.</b> To the right (north) side is a two-storey section dating from 1935–36.|$|R
