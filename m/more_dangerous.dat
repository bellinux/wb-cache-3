5|$|Byng {{inspected}} the Canadian Corps positions {{and noted that}} the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and under constant danger of enemy fire. He assigned 3rd Canadian Division commander, Major-General Malcolm Mercer {{to draw up a}} plan to overrun the <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> German positions in a local attack.|$|E
5|$|However, Lukin {{claims that}} hot-water {{drilling}} is much <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> for the microbiotic fauna, {{as it would}} boil the living species, plus disturb the entire structure of water layers of the lake. Additionally, hot-water drilling would have required more power than the Russian expedition could have generated at their remote camp.|$|E
50|$|The second {{theme is}} a pointed, triumphant fanfare {{played by the}} brass which comes to {{represent}} the <b>more</b> rugged, <b>dangerous</b> aspects of the climb.|$|R

50|$|This town {{is smaller}} than Woormra, {{although}} its people are <b>more</b> aggressive, <b>dangerous,</b> and paranoid, as they even built a defensive wall out of sharp branches around their town.|$|R
5|$|Some octopuses, such as {{the mimic}} octopus, can combine their highly {{flexible}} bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> animals, such as lionfish, sea snakes, and eels.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{after the}} loss of Bismarck, Adolf Hitler ordered the Kriegsmarine to move the ships to Germany for {{overhauls}} in preparation for their deployment to Norway. There they were {{to serve as a}} fleet in being, and as the premier naval defence for German-occupied Norway. After lengthy discussions the Oberkommando der Marine opted for the shorter, but arguably <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> route, through the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> {{criminal}} elements {{took advantage}} of Galveston's lax law enforcement {{and the absence of}} the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.|$|E

50|$|Neo-Luddism {{denies the}} ability of any new {{technology}} to solve current problems, such as environmental degradation, nuclear warfare and biological weapons, without creating <b>more,</b> potentially <b>dangerous</b> problems. Neo-Luddites are generally opposed to anthropocentrism, globalization and or industrial capitalism.|$|R
60|$|Harvey {{had already}} {{examined}} Jet's wound, and pronounced it a trifling one, <b>more</b> painful than <b>dangerous.</b>|$|R
5|$|In mid-May, aerial {{reconnaissance}} near Mont Sorrel indicated that German forces were preparing an attack. Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers had noted {{the existence of}} works curiously resembling the Canadian positions, well behind the German lines. The Germans were also observed digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. The Canadian Corps had just begun developing plans to overrun the <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> German positions, when the Germans executed an assault of their own.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of human subjects, this {{involved}} injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or {{to have a life}} expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> than radium. Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, pre-dreadnoughts {{continued}} in active service and saw significant combat use even when obsolete. Dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were believed vital for the decisive naval battles {{which at the}} time all nations expected, hence they were jealously guarded against the risk of damage by mines or submarine attack, and kept close to home as much as possible. The obsolescence and consequent expendability of the pre-dreadnoughts meant that they could be deployed into <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> situations and more far-flung areas.|$|E
50|$|No {{new family}} {{dwellings}} {{have been built}} in more than 10 years, so houses are overcrowded {{with as many as}} 17 people living in small quarters. TB or tuberculosis is active in the town. This is made <b>more</b> acutely <b>dangerous</b> as the overcrowding continues.|$|R
50|$|Mollari's {{involvement}} with Morden becomes <b>more</b> complex and <b>dangerous,</b> as G'Kar's warning about an ancient enemy falls on deaf ears.|$|R
50|$|Reynolds {{continued}} {{to work as a}} songwriting collaborator with Faithfull and as guitarist in her band for two <b>more</b> albums <b>Dangerous</b> Acquaintances released in 1981 and A Child's Adventure released in 1983. After a 16-year break Reynolds and Faithfull resumed collaborating on Vagabond Ways in 1999.|$|R
5|$|Ten years later, in 123 BC, Gaius {{took the}} same office as his brother, as a tribune for the plebeians. Gaius was more {{practical}} minded than Tiberius, and so was considered <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> by the senatorial class. He gained support from the agrarian poor by reviving the land reform programme and from the urban poor with various popular measures. He also sought support from the second estate, those equestrians who had not ascended to become senators.|$|E
5|$|The Moving Picture Company {{created the}} climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look <b>more</b> <b>dangerous.</b> A full-scale replica of the building's exterior {{was used for the}} exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria proved <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> to Yamhad than Mari. The Assyrian {{king was}} an ambitious conqueror {{with the aim}} to rule Mesopotamia and the Levant, and called himself king of the World. Shamshi-Adad {{surrounded}} Yamhad by alliances with Charchemish, Hassum and Urshu {{to the north and}} by conquering Mari to the east forcing Zimri-Lim the heir of Mari to flee. Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Lim and aimed to use him against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]416 Remington Magum {{is one of}} the <b>more</b> popular <b>dangerous</b> game {{cartridges}} {{used for}} the hunting of dangerous game in Africa.

60|$|Dane {{could not}} help feeling that, unless the gentleman were prudent, he might have cause to regret {{his visit to the}} factory. He was {{inclined}} to admire high-spirited women, but Miss Castro looked <b>more</b> than <b>dangerous</b> just then; though Dane learned afterward that her hatred was justifiable.|$|R
60|$|Of {{this the}} fullest {{demonstration}} followed quickly. The Frenchmen having recovered their wits at last, both ships swung broadside on, and concentrating upon the Arabella as the nearer and heavier and therefore <b>more</b> immediately <b>dangerous</b> {{of their two}} opponents, volleyed upon her jointly at almost the same moment.|$|R
5|$|The {{side effects}} of Adderall are many and varied, but the amount of {{substance}} consumed is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Adderall is currently approved for long-term therapeutic use by the USFDA. Recreational use of Adderall generally involves far larger doses and is therefore significantly <b>more</b> <b>dangerous,</b> involving a much greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, Wipeout 2097 is set over four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> F5000 AG racing league. The game {{introduced a new}} damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3D Control Pad, whereas the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional Negcon twist controller.|$|E

50|$|No job is <b>more</b> stressful, <b>dangerous</b> or exhilarating {{than those}} of the Firefighters, Rescue Squad and Paramedics of Chicago Firehouse 51. These are the courageous men and women who forge headfirst into danger when {{everyone}} else is running the other way and whose actions make {{the difference between life and}} death. These are their stories.|$|R
5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because {{of the necessity of}} flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The task was made all the <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E
5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be <b>more</b> <b>dangerous</b> for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
60|$|But again, it is {{promised in}} the Bible, {{that in the}} new heavens and new earth there shall be no more sea. When the sea has done its work, God will have done with it--and {{then there will be}} no more {{division}} between nation and nation--no <b>more</b> long <b>dangerous</b> voyages from one country to another.|$|R
