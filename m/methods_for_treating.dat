25|$|The deep {{penetration}} {{and large}} hip thrusts of the missionary position {{can cause the}} man to reach orgasm quickly compared to other positions, which can be problematic if the couple seeks to reach simultaneous orgasm. The male reaching orgasm first can be disruptive to sex, as 50% of penile erection is lost immediately after ejaculation, making him more likely to inadvertently slip out of the vagina, especially during the strong pelvic contractions of female orgasm. In addition to the standard <b>methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>treating</b> premature ejaculation, Zachary Veilleux notes that this problem can be overcome by workarounds such as changing positions frequently (which studies have shown delays male orgasm {{by a factor of}} 2-3), using lubrication to reduce friction (friction stimulates the male but is not as important in female orgasm), or switching to cunnilingus for a while when close to ejaculation, and then switching back when ejaculation is no longer imminent.|$|E
25|$|Kenny {{filled her}} final years with {{journeys}} in America, Europe and Australia {{in an effort}} to gain further acceptance of her method. She had also developed many <b>methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>treating</b> some serious illness. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, she returned home to Toowoomba in 1951, where she died on 30 November 1952 at her home Straun in Toowoomba after four days in a coma following a cerebral thrombosis. In a desperate attempt to save her life, Dr Irving Innerfield of New York sent his new experimental drug Trypsin by air mail, with the plane delayed so the drug package could be boarded, to Brisbane, where over 500 people waited for its arrival, after which it was then rushed by car to Toowoomba. Although the drug was administered on 29 November 1952, her doctor believed Kenny was too close to death to benefit from it, and she died the following day.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{discussion}} of the novel, Harris describes this [...] "manliness" [...] as becoming, for Barker's characters, an [...] "unrealistic militaristic-masculine ideals"; practices such as the deliberate repression of emotion consume the novel's characters and create psychological instability, as well as being the cause of extensive discrimination during the war. Harris highlights how this thematic treatment fairly represents how the question of masculine identity effected Sassoon and other shell-shocked World War I soldiers. Harris also describes Barker, as author, and Rivers, as a period innovator, demonstrating how the use of therapy on soldiers offers an opportunity to shape and rethink this model of masculinity. The idea of reintegrating emotions, in relation to questions about the nature of masculinity, {{are an important part of}} the novel; Barker focuses on the same type of emotional reintegration that historians have identified in River's actual <b>methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>treating</b> victims of the war.|$|E
