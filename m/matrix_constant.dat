We propose a new nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) -based method, in which locally reliable clusters are explicitly considered by using instance-wise weights over clusters. Our method factorizes the input cluster assignment matrix into two matrices H and W, which are optimized by iteratively 1) updating H and W {{while keeping the}} weight <b>matrix</b> <b>constant</b> and 2) updating the weight matrix while keeping H and W constant, alternatively. The weights in the second step were updated by solving a convex problem, which makes our algorithm significantly faster than existing NMF-based ensemble clustering methods. We empirically proved that our method outperformed a lot of cutting-edge ensemble clustering methods by {{using a variety of}} datasets...|$|E

Chen applied the information geometry method to spectrum sensing, increased the measurement of manifolds, and obtained the decision threshold through simulation [16]. Lu et al. used the matching method to obtain the closed expression of the decision threshold, which has higher computational complexity [17]. However, in spectrum sensing, the derivation of the threshold is not only complicated, but there is always some deviation in using the fixed decision threshold to determine whether the PU exists.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of matrix information geometry to radar signal processing and target detection {{is a new}} and interesting subject. Wake vortices are Doppler-spread after Fourier transform. The traditional Moving Target Detection (MTD) method cannot adequately accumulate returns power of the whole spectrum. Based on matrix information geometry, a <b>matrix</b> <b>Constant</b> False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection method is proposed to improve the detection performance of a weak wake target. In this method, covariance matrices of the observed data can be constructed into a matrix manifold; compared with CFAR detection, the geodesic distance between the covariance matrix in the detection cell and the mean of covariance matrices in the secondary cell {{is regarded as the}} detection statistics. Using simulated wake vortices, the return data in background noise and the iterative estimation performance of Riemannian mean are analyzed; the geodesic distance of covariance matrices of target return and noise with varying signal-noise rate is analyzed; and the detection performance of the matrix CFAR and the conventional MTD method is compared...|$|E
40|$|In the {{nonlinear}} analysis of structural systems, the Newton-Raphson (NR) method {{is the most}} common method to solve the equations of equilibrium. The NR method is easy to implement and gives an asymptotically quadratic rate of convergence. However, there are some well known shortcomings of the NR method. The Modied Newton (MN) method alleviates some of the problems of NR, but with a asymptotically linear rate of convergence requiring an excessive number of iterations to reach equilibrium. Accelerated Newton (AN) methods strike a compromise between the NR and MN methods. Generally, the compromise is to hold the stiness <b>matrix</b> <b>constant</b> during iteration, but to use selected information from previous iterations to accelerate conver-gence of the MN method. Since the mid 1980 s, AN methods based on projections into Krylov subspaces have been developed by researchers in the mathematics community. Of particular interest is the method formulated by Carlson and Miller (1998) involv-ing low rank least squares projections. Its performance in the {{nonlinear analysis}} of structures is comparable to NR, requiring only a few more iterations to converge while taking less computational time than both NR and MN...|$|E

Development of a biomaterial that simulates {{this type of}} physiological binding and function is an exciting proposition for designing controlled advanced delivery sys-tems for simulating in vivo conditions in vitro. We have decorated silk protein with sulfonated moieties through diazonium coupling reactions to noncovalently immobilize pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 b) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in such a biomimetic manner. After adsorption of the cytokines to the diazonium-modified silk <b>matrix,</b> <b>constant</b> release of cytokines up to at least 3 days was demonstrated, as an initial step to simulate an osteoarthritic (OA) microenvironment in vitro. Matrix-embedded cytokines induced the for-mation of multiple elongated processes in chondrocytes in vitro, akin to what is seen in OA cartilage in vivo. Gene expression profiles with this in vitro tissue model of OA showed significant similarities to profiles from explanted OA cartilage tissues collected from patients who underwent total knee replacement surgery. The common markers of OA, including COL, MMP, TIMP, ADAMTS, and metallothioneins, were upregulated at least 35 -fold in the in vitro model {{when compared to the}} control—non-OA in vitro generated tissue-engineered cartilage. The mi-croarray data were validated by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Mechanistically, protein inter-action studies indicated that TNF-a and IL- 1 b synergistically controlled the equilibrium between MMPs and their inhibitors, TIMPs, resulting in ECM degradation through the MAPK pathway. This study offers a promising initial step toward establishing a relevant in vitro OA disease model, which can be further modified to assess signaling mechanisms, responses to cell or drug treatments and patient-specific features...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of vortex generators on {{the enhancement of}} heat transfer from a wall-mounted cube matrix was investigated by numerical simulation using finite-volume method. The momentum and convective heat transfer equations were discretized and solved using large-eddy simulation. The numerical simulation was performed on a fully developed turbulent flow over one cube mounted {{in the middle of}} a cube <b>matrix.</b> <b>Constant</b> heat flux was generated from the cubes. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in both the streamwise and the spanwise directions. In order to study the {{influence of}} vortex generator on the flow structures and heat transfer coefficient, the flow and the convective heat transfer equations were solved around two cube configurations: a smooth cube and a cube with vortex generator attached to its surface. The vortex generator used in this investigation is a simple rib attached to the top and the side walls of the cube close to the streamwise edge. The flow Reynolds number based on the bulk velocity and the height of the channel was 13000. Standard Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model was used to model the unresolved scales and heat fluxes. The LES results were compared with the experimental results and good agreement was obtained. Numerical flow visualization was used to provide a better insight into the flow structures and heat transfer coefficient around the cubes. The LES results showed that the flow in the boundary layer around the cube with vortex generator is more turbulent and unsteady than the flow around the smooth cube without the vortex generator. More turbulent structures are generated close to the surface of the cube resulting in a good mixing of heat and hence high heat transfer coefficien...|$|E

40|$|Biotechnological {{processes}} {{have been}} developed and applied successfully to obtain new products. Among these, one in development {{is the use of}} microorganisms that ferment xylose from the hemicellulosic fraction of agroindustrial waste to xylitol, a functional food with important industrial applications. Among the agroindustrial waste the sugarcane bagasse is the most abundant lignocellulosic residue in Brazil, and this has not been exploited to its full potential due to ignorance or lack of readily available technology to be applied, or have been used in a less valued. In this context the biotechnology emerges as an alternative route for generation of high-value added products aimed use this waste suitably. Basically the biotechnological processes can be divided in two stages: the stage of the process itself and the purification stage. As the separation, purification and recovery stages {{are an important part of}} the biotechnology process, which can reach up to 80 % of the final cost of the product, this study therefore aimed the recovery and purification through the use of an alternative technology, not yet applied for this aim, the supercritical technology. The bioprocess was carried out in a fluidized reactor with cells of Candida guilliermondii immobilized in calcium alginate effectively and the purification process was tested in a supercritical extractor with a capacity of 50 ml using CO 2 + ethanol as solvent.

40|$|Calibration {{is still}} a {{challenging}} task when dealing with the direct analysis of solids. This is particularly true for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIES), and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry/mass spectrometry, when the calibrations are matrix-dependent and/or appropriate certified reference materials are generally not available. Looking at the analysis of plant materials {{in the form of}} pressed pellets by LIBS, a new method to overcome and/or minimize this difficulty is proposed by keeping the <b>matrix</b> <b>constant</b> in order to produce matrix-matched calibration pellets. To achieve this goal and to test this novel approach, ground sugar cane leaves were chosen and submitted to acid extractions for obtaining the corresponding blank or a material containing very low concentrations of the analytes. the resulting dried solid material was used either as a blank or a low concentration standard, and also homogeneously mixed with the original plant material at appropriate ratios as well. the corresponding pellets were used as calibration standards and ablated at 30 different sites by applying 25 laser pulses per site with a Q-switched Nd:YAG at 1064 nm. the plasma emission collected by lenses was directed through an optical fiber towards a spectrometer equipped with Echelle optics and intensified charge-coupled device. Delay time and integration time gate were fixed at 2. 0 and 5. 0 mu s, respectively. This calibration strategy was tested for the determination of Ca, Mg, K, P, Cu, Mn, and Zn by LIBS in pellets of leaves from 17 varieties of sugar cane and good correlations were obtained with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry results in the corresponding acid digests. the proposed approach was also useful to estimate the limits of detection based on measurements of blanks, as recommended by IUPAC, or {{with the aid of a}} low concentration standard.

40|$|Matrix Gla protein (MGP), a vitamin K {{dependent}} protein, {{has recently}} been identified in many tissues. However, it is accumulated only in bone and cartilage suggesting that the expression of MGP {{may be related to}} the development and/or maintenance of the phenotypic properties of these tissues. We systematically evaluated MGP mRNA expression as a function of bone and cartilage development and also as regulated by vitamin D during growth and cellular differentiation. Three experimental models of cartilage and bone development were employed: an in vivo model for endochondral bone formation, as well as in primary cells of normal diploid rat chondrocyte and osteoblast cultures. MGP was expressed at the highest level during cartilage formation and calcification in vivo during endochondral bone formation. In chondrocyte cultures, MGP mRNA was present throughout the culture period but increased only after 3 weeks concomitantly with type I collagen mRNA. In osteoblast cultures, MGP mRNA was expressed during the proliferative period and exhibited increased expression during the period of matrix development. In contrast to osteocalcin (bone Gla protein), this increase was not dependent on mineralization but was related to the extent of differentiation associated with and potentially induced by extracellular matrix formation. During the proliferative period, type I collagen mRNA peaked and thereafter declined, while type I collagen protein steadily accumulated in the extracellular <b>matrix.</b> <b>Constant</b> MGP levels were maintained in the mineralization period of osteoblast differentiation in vitro which is consistent with the constant levels found during the osteogenic period of the in vivo system. MGP mRNA levels in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes in culture were significantly elevated by 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 (10 (- 8) M, 48 h) throughout the time course of cellular growth and differentiation. Interestingly, when MGP mRNA transcripts from vitamin D treated and untreated chondrocytes and osteoblasts were analyzed by high resolution Northern blot analysis, we observed two distinct species of MGP mRNA in the vitamin D treated chondrocyte cultures while all other cultures examined exhibited only a single MGP mRNA transcript. Primer extension analysis indicated a single transcription start site in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes with or without vitamin D treatment, suggesting that the lower molecular weight MGP message in vitamin D treated chondrocytes may be related to a modification in post-transcriptional processing. In conclusion, these results show that the selective accumulation of MGP in bone and cartilage tissues in vitro {{may be related to the}} development and/or maintenance of a collagenous matrix as reflected by increases in MGP mRNA during these periods.
