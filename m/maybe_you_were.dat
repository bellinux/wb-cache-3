I don't mean only in your work, for as for that I would back you against any scrivener in London, but I mean about yourself. It don't need half an eye to see that you have not been brought up to this sort of thing, though you have taken to it so kindly, but there is not one in a {{thousand}} boys of your age who would have settled down to work and made their way without a friend to help them as you have done; it shows that there is right good stuff in you. There, I am so long getting under weigh that I shall never get into port if I don't steer a straight course. Now, my ideas and my wife's come to this: if you have got no friends you will have to take a lodging somewhere among strangers, and then it would be one of two things--you would either stop at home and mope by yourself, or you would go out, and maybe get into bad company. If I had not come across you I should have had to employ a clerk, and he would either have lived here with us or I should have had to pay him enough to keep house for himself. Now in fact you are a clerk; for though you are only here for six hours a week--you do all the work there is to do, and no clerk could do more. Well, we have got an attic upstairs which is not used, and if you like to come here and live with us, my wife and I will make you heartily welcome." ...|$|E

Like the first Leyla, Mecnun {{falls in love}} with her when he sees her {{at the top of the}} stairs. Leyla is a businesswoman, and Mecnun's constant presence sabotages her company; once, he starts a fire. When Leyla criticizes him one day, Meclun says: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing? Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> always criticizing me? Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> always doing this? For once, turn around and look at yourself. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to blame, huh? <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> just not good enough. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not made for this job.

Perhaps {{you were in a}} magnificent cathedral, listening to a choral mass. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> at a music festival where the music made you forget the bad weather and appalling toilet facilities. Whatever the setting, music can lead us into a shared experience of ecstasy – a word which literally means “to stand outside oneself”. For my recent book Exaltation I examined two different musical “spaces” in which people experience ecstasy catalysed by music. The first was a Pentecostal congregation in suburban Perth; the second was the West Coast Blues ‘n’ Roots Festival...|$|E
