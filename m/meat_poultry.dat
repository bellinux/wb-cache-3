5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} {{can be prevented}} or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron is a requirement for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red <b>meat,</b> <b>poultry,</b> and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked <b>meat,</b> <b>poultry,</b> seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, <b>meat,</b> <b>poultry</b> and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E

50|$|For <b>meat</b> and <b>poultry</b> products, {{which are}} {{regulated}} by USDA, {{the rules are}} more complicated. Ready-to-eat <b>meat</b> and <b>poultry</b> products contaminated with pathogens, such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes, are adulterated. (Note that hotdogs are considered ready-to-eat products.) For raw <b>meat</b> or <b>poultry</b> products, the presence of pathogens will not always render a product adulterated (because raw <b>meat</b> and <b>poultry</b> products are intended to be cooked, and proper cooking should kill pathogens). Raw poultry contaminated with Salmonella is not adulterated. However, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has ruled that raw <b>meat</b> or <b>poultry</b> products contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 are adulterated. This is because normal cooking methods may not reduce E. coli O157:H7 below infectious levels. E. coli O157:H7 is the only pathogen that is considered an adulterant when present in raw <b>meat</b> or <b>poultry</b> products.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> and its products. A {{definition}} of meat, sources of <b>meat,</b> types of <b>poultry</b> production and own goal of the thesis are explained in the first chapter. Then there are described technological processes of poultry treatment in common with a veterinary and hygienic supervision which provides {{a check of the}} production and processing of <b>poultry</b> <b>meat.</b> In addition, there are mentioned some manufacturing companies which are engaged in poultry processing. The third and the fourth chapters are about a general characteristic and a quality of <b>poultry</b> <b>meat.</b> There are described issues related with <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> and its quality, structure, production and consumption in the following chapter. The last chapter is theoretical and there is taking apart the main problem of this thesis which means the production of <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> products, other <b>poultry</b> products and an overview of legislation related to <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> products. The practical part {{is focused on}} consumer attitude to <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> and <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> products and other kinds of meat by a questionnaire.

40|$|Present {{study was}} {{performed}} on three hundred and twenty samples of <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> and <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> products, 40 samples each from fresh <b>poultry</b> <b>meat,</b> fresh chicken boneless, frozen <b>poultry</b> <b>meat,</b> frozen chicken nuggets, frozen chicken burgers, chopping boards, mincing machines and cleaning cloths collected from different <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> sale centers, supermarkets and shops at Faisalabad. Listeria species could be isolated from all the examined samples at different percentages ranging from 10 to 37. 5 %. Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) was differentially identified from other Listeria species by colony characteristics, `beta haemolysis`, `cold enrichment procedure`, `Anton test`, `aesculin test`, characteristic `tumbling motility`, sugar fermentation tests and serotyping. L. monocytogenes could be isolated at variable percentages ranging from 2. 5 to 17. 5 % of the examined samples from <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> and <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> products. From the 31 isolates of L. monocytogenes isolated from examined samples, 23 strains belonged to type 1 and 8 strains belonged to type 4. Study revealed {{that the incidence of}} L. monocytogenes was much higher in frozen <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> products and other related inanimates as compared to fresh <b>poultry</b> <b>meat</b> samples. The public health hazards as well as suggestive measures to reduce human Listeriosis have been discussed...|$|R

25|$|In Bangladesh, poor {{socioeconomic}} {{position was}} associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, <b>meat,</b> <b>poultry,</b> and fruits. As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living {{in the developing world}} live in countries that produce food surpluses. The economist Amartya Sen observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and famine were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.|$|E
25|$|Besides merchants, a {{great number}} of {{physicians}} were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam: Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family; Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice (April 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science of practical use to them, for they were not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews taken into the trade-guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in 1632 (the cities being autonomous) excluded them. Exceptions, however, were made in the case of trades that related to their religion: printing, bookselling, and the selling of <b>meat,</b> <b>poultry,</b> groceries, and drugs. In 1655 a Jew was, exceptionally, permitted to establish a sugar-refinery.|$|E
