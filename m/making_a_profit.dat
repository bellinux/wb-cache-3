5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

5|$|Australian rules {{football}} is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League (AFL) games since 2001, when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games. Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, {{it was estimated that}} the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1million and $1.5million into the Tasmanian economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{congregation}} {{obtained a}} land patent from the London Virginia Company in June 1619. They had declined {{the opportunity to}} settle south of Cape Cod in New Netherland because of their desire to avoid the Dutch influence. This land patent allowed them to settle {{at the mouth of}} the Hudson River.

5|$|By 2004, Braathens {{had managed}} to cut costs {{sufficiently}} to make a profit. At the same time, SAS was having problems <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b> SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would be merged into a single company, SAS Braathens, in May. At the same time, the airline would create separate national airlines for Sweden and Denmark. SAS Braathens would operate 50 aircraft, all variations of the 737. The company took over the operating licence of Braathens, including the IATA and ICAO code, and callsign. Because all the operations streamlined and coordinated, {{there would be no}} further downstaffing due to the merger. From 1 June 2007, SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines, making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark, although it remain a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} release the film earned $33.6 million in North American theater rentals (the distributor's {{share of the}} box office), {{generating}} approximately $74.7 million in box office sales. Outside of North America, it earned $32.5 million in rentals (about $72.2 million at the box office) for a worldwide total of $66.1 million in rental earnings, roughly equivalent to $146.9 million in box office receipts. It was the fastest-grossing film {{as well as the}} highest-grossing film of 1959, in the process becoming the second-highest-grossing film of all-time (at that time) behind Gone with the Wind. Ben-Hur saved MGM from financial disaster, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> of $20,409,000 on its initial release, and another $10.1 million in profits when re-released in 1969. By 1989, Ben-Hur had earned $90 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.|$|E

5|$|The first {{potassium}} nitrate was transported on 8 December 1911, {{and two years}} later the plants were <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit.</b> Transported cargo increased from 110,000 tonnes per year to 250,000 tonnes in 1915, after the plant had been expanded, and up to 345,000 tonnes in 1917. The small hamlet of Rjukan had turned into a town, and in 1920 there were 11,651 people in Tinn. The 1920 were a tough time, and cargo decreased, but in 1929 the electric arc technology was replaced by the ammonia method, with the main product being {{potassium nitrate}}. During the 1930s other products came into production, including hydrogen and other gases, and from 1934 as the first plant in the world mass-produced heavy water.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested in plant ice themselves. New tools were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances in plant ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution networks to artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{services}} {{could be}} done with a round trip time of nine to ten days, including overnighting in Cairo, Karachi and Bangkok, and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong. At first there were semiweekly services, {{but by the end}} of 1947, these had increased to weekly. In June, Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC-3, LN-PAS Norse Carrier, and in August another DC-4, LN-PAW Norse Commander, both from KLM. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty-five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York and one to Johannesburg, South Africa, <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> of NOK750,000. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjavík, Gander and Bermuda to Caracas, where the plane landed on 26 August. In October, the airline flew to Panama, but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services. In 1948, the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong, eight to Johannesburg, two to the United States, three to Venezuela and two to Panama.|$|E

She gets back together with Des and they eventually marry. Daphne and Des become Mike Young's legal guardians when they learn that he comes from a violent home. Daphne helps Mike when he is banned from seeing Jane Harris (Annie Jones) by her grandmother, Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray). Daphne soon discovers that Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) has been sending poison pen letters about Mike to Mrs. Mangel and exposes her. Daphne contracts meningitis, but she recovers and then learns that she is pregnant. Daphne and Des's marriage becomes strained when she learns that he has been in contact with Lorraine. The couple eventually talk and Des explains that he had just given Lorraine some financial advice.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income {{to be able to}} afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope that the Free State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek {{proved to be}} prescient. In early 1947, mines in New South Wales were again crippled by strikes. The worst strike came in 1949, forcing Chifley to send {{in the armed forces}} to extract coal. While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced manufacturing output and more unemployment, South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock. Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding. From 1947 until the end of Playford's leadership in 1965, the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year. Transport infrastructure was improved, European immigrant workers were recruited, and twin power plants at Port Augusta were completed in 1960 and named after the premier. The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970, the whole state was self-sufficient for electricity. ETSA and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town—sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom's Baby—and mine of Leigh Creek and <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>profit</b> as well. From 1946 to 1965, the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96%.|$|E
