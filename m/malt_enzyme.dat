40|$|Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. The preference of carnivorous fish for protein amino acids instead of carbohydrates as a source of energy lead us to study the transcriptional regulation of the mitochondrial ALT (mALT) gene and to characterize the enzyme kinetics and modulation of mALT expression in the kidney of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) under different nutritional and hormonal conditions. 5 ′-Deletion analysis of mALT promoter in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells, site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays allowed us to identify HNF 4 α as a new factor involved in the transcriptional regulation of mALT expression. Quantitative RT-PCR assays showed that starvation and the administration of streptozotocin (STZ) decreased HNF 4 α levels in the kidney of S. aurata, leading to the downregulation of mALT transcription. Analysis of the tissue distribution showed that kidney, liver, and intestine were the tissues with higher mALT and HNF 4 α expression. Kinetic analysis indicates that <b>mALT</b> <b>enzyme</b> is more efficient in catalyzing the conversion of L-alanine to pyruvate than the reverse reaction. From these results, we conclude that HNF 4 α transactivates the mALT promoter and that the low levels of mALT expression found in the kidney of starved and STZ-treated fish result from a decreased expression of HNF 4 α. Our findings suggest that the mALT isoenzyme plays a major role in oxidazing dietary amino acids, and points to ALT as a target for a biotechnological action to spare protein and optimize the use of dietary nutrients for fish culture...|$|E
40|$|The use of enzymes for hydrolysing starch in cane juices {{has been}} applied in South Africa for some years. Bacterial amylases, notably those derived from Bacillus subtilis, have the {{advantage}} of stability at higher temperatures. Factory trials have shown that application of less than 10 ppm of bacterial amylase can destroy over 85 % of the starch in mixed juice in fifteen minutes. Applications of enzymes to syrup and clarified juice have also yielded promising results. Historical The process of decomposition of starch in cane juice {{has been applied}} many times during the history of sugar production. Haddon and de Sornay reported on the high starch content of Uba cane in 1927. 9, 10 A year later Haddon reported the removal of starch from sorghum and Uba juice by the use of a malt amylase. " ^ l 2 Feuilherade reported on the experimental use of an enzyme "Uba~e". ~ Though the source of this enzyme was not disclosed, it appears that the price was in the region of four rand per pound. The enzyme was apparently of low activity as it had to be used at a rate of 100 ppm on juice. Feuilherade assumed that the starch was completely transformed into glucose, and based a quantitative determination on this assumption. Boyes 2 used <b>malt</b> <b>enzyme</b> for the decomposition of cane starch in juices and massecuites, but found that the price remained prohibitive for general application. In 1958 Nicholson and Horsley published the presence of an amylase in cane juice, and described a method for the elimination of cane starch in juice. 14 These authors reported a degree of starch decomposition of 80 - 90 %, and occasionally even higher, at a temperature of 70 °C and a pH 5. 7 to 5. 9. The "natural enzyme " method was used experimentally at various sugar factories in Natal and adopted as a standard practice by The Tongaat Sugar C~mpany. ~ Carter 6 published results with this process in which 50 to 60 % of the starch originally present was decomposed at a pH of 6. 5 in eight minutes.

Five sorghum varieties, Dorado, Malisor 84 - 7, Tortillero, ATx 630 *R 3338, and ATx 623 *SC 1 03 were malted according to standard procedures and monitored for malting quality and starch modification during a 5 day malting period. Dry matter losses (DML) and (x-and B-amylase activities increased with longer germination time. After 5 days of malting, ot-and B-amylase activities were highest in Dorado and lowest in Malisor 84 - 7. (x-Amylase activity in Dorado was 70 % and B-amylase activity was 65 % of a commercial barley malt reference. Starch decreased and enzyme susceptible starch increased with longer germination time. Apparent starch loss was highly correlated with DML and a-and B-amylase activities. The amount of soluble amylopectin at 850 C decreased during malting for all varieties. The amount of soluble amylopectin at 1200 C decreased for all normal endosperm varieties during germination. Malting increased the proportion of starch soluble at 1200 and 850 C. Dextrins (MW 3. 0 X 1 03 to 6. 1 X 103) developed during malting in all varieties. After 5 days of malting, dextrin content ranged from 19. 5 % (Dorado) to 5. 1 % (Malisor 84 - 7) Dextrin development was delayed in Malisor 84 - 7 and Tortillero until germination day 1 or 2. ATx 630 *R 3338 produced significantly more dextrins during the germination period. Dextrin content of the commercial barley malt was 15. 6 %. Total sugars (DP 1 to DP 6) increased during malting. After 5 days of malting, ATx 623 *SC 1 03 had the highest amount of sugars (1 1. 6 %) and Malisor 847 had the lowest amount of sugars (6. 6 %).

40|$|One of {{the most}} popular and widely used {{alcoholic}} beverages is beer. There is a long-standing tradition of beer production in the Czech Republic and it is our significant export commodity. Hops, specifically the so called Saaz Late, is a typical ingredient in the production of bottom fermented a Pilsen kind of beer that has made us famous in the world. Beer is a complicated beverage and its production is not an easy process, although it may seem differently at first glance. Apart from the convenient ingredients, for the production of beer are also needed technological facilities and most importantly the knowledge. The procedure itself consists of grinding malt, mixing it with water and mashing process, which includes a shortage of polysaccharide chains by influence of <b>malt</b> <b>enzymes.</b> The extracted product is called hopped wort and it is further boiled together with hops. This process is in Czech language known as chmelovar (hereinafter referred to as wort). During the wort, there are some bitter substances coming to work (this is how mixture of ingredients and water is generally called during the whole process of production), the bitter substances are specifically alfa bitter acids and beta bitter acids. The extracted product is called hopped wort. After fermenting the hopped wort, there comes a stage of main and secondary fermentation. During this phase two crucial ingredients of beer are produced. Alcohol and carbon dioxide. Traditional for Czech regions is the bottom fermentation in which yeasts are descending to the base of a container. Biogenic amines are one of many components of the beer. However, they can be found not only in the beer, but also in almost all basic foods. We can find them in meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and even in different concentrations. Their production is often associated with the fermentation process. Regarding the content of biogenic amines in beer, due to the research it is obvious that a part of them gets into the beer from the original raw materials. Another part arises during the fermentation process. Tyramine and histamine (among others), discovered in the beer, can have a serious impact on human health. During the consumption of large quantities of such a beer, but even other foods that contain a lot of these biogenic amines, it may affect the circulatory system, breathing, cause a facial flushing and in extreme cases even cerebral haemorrhage.

40|$|Brewing with {{fractionated}} barley Beer is a globally consumed beverage, {{which is}} produced from malted barley, water, hops and yeast. In recent years, {{the use of}} unmalted barley and exogenous enzymes have become more popular because they enable simpler processing and reduced environmental impact. Raw barley, however, contains less endogenous enzymes and more undesired components {{for the use of}} beer brewing, compared to malted barley.   The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate how barley can be fractionated to optimize the use of resources for the beer brewing process, while maintaining the quality of the brewed beer. A resource use efficiency analysis was performed to verify the presumed benefits on the environmental sustainability of the proposed process change. The work was based on the hypothesis that fractionation of the unprocessed barley will reduce the amount of undesired components, which leads to improvements in the brewing process based on partial or no malting. Fractionation can be performed by milling and separation, which requires physical disentanglement of the components. This fractionation can be influenced by properties of the components of the material, such as the glass transition temperature (Stuart et al.). Fractionation by abrasive milling, also known as pearling, is another possibility: here one makes use of the spatial distribution of components in the kernels. In case of barley for brewing this technique is especially promising as most of the undesired components are in the outer layer of the kernel. In addition, the removal of bran from the barley reduces the amount of water needed in the process. It will also reduce the volume of spent grains, hence reducing wastes and energy required for drying the spent grains. A disadvantage of pearling is however that it lowers the ability of the barley kernel to produce enzymes. This leads to the need of the addition of exogenous enzymes, as is the case when the malting step is omitted.   Chapter 2 describes the glass-to-rubber transition of protein and starch isolated from the barley endosperm, for different moisture levels. The hypothesis for this chapter is that dry fractionation by milling is facilitated by milling conditions in which the protein is in a rubbery state and the starch in a glassy state. Two methods were used to measure the Tg; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo-mechanical compression tests (TMCT). The methods gave different results due to the differences in moisture content range, and heating rates, which may lead to conformational changes of the protein. The value of the Tg of partially crystalline materials, such as starch in barley, was not unambiguous when using TMCT because the mechanical effect of expansion of these materials was smaller. For both results, the Tg lines were modelled using the Gordon-Taylor equation. Based on sorption isotherms, it was concluded that moisture does not distribute evenly over the protein and starch in the kernel. Starch absorbs more moisture than protein at given water activities. This required a correction of the Tg lines. After this correction, the glass transition lines of starch and protein were closer together. The expectation is therefore that achieving good separation between the components based on having one glassy component and one rubbery component is challenging. For this reason, another dry fractionation technique, pearling, was considered. Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition of the barley and of fractions removed by pearling. Pearling was shown to selectively remove insoluble fibre, ash, protein and polyphenols, while the β-amylase activity and starch content of the remaining kernel was hardly affected. For example, removing the outer 5 % of the kernel reduced insoluble arabinoxylans (15 %), insoluble fibres (23 %), ash (19 %), polyphenols (11 %) and water holding capacity of the non-starch components (25 %), while only lowering starch content by 0. 20 %. The water holding capacity of the barley fractions was strongly related to the fibre content. This indicates that when the fibre content in the mash was reduced by pearling, the spent grains will take up less water, leading to less wort and sugar losses in this waste stream, and hence better use of the raw materials and less wastes. Chapter 4 compares a traditional brewing process to an enzyme-assisted brewing process with respect to their resource use efficiency, which is one aspect of the sustainability of the processes. The use of exogenous enzymes is found to be more efficient than producing <b>enzymes</b> through the <b>malting</b> process. The exergetic efficiency of the conventional malting process was 77 %. The main losses stem from the use of natural gas for removal of moisture from the barley in the kilning process, and from the loss of starch in the germination process. In case of the use of exogenous enzymes, it was concluded that the chemical exergy content of the enzymes was not a good measure for the exergy content of the enzymes. Instead, we proposed to use the cumulative exergetic consumption in the enzyme production rather than just the chemical exergy content of the enzymes. This cumulative exergetic consumption in the production of the enzymes was ± 30 times higher than their standard chemical exergy. This shows that the cumulative exergetic costs of minor components should be taken into account if a process uses them in significant quantities. This can be done by extending the system boundaries to include the production process of the purified components. The exergy efficiency of the enzyme formulation production process ranges between 20 % and 42 % depending on whether the by-product of the fermentation broth was considered as useful as the enzyme product. Even though the cumulative exergy consumption of the process was 30 times the standard chemical exergy of the dry enzyme, the total exergy input (i. e. both wasted and destroyed) for the production of 100 kg of beer was still larger for the conventional malting process (441 MJ) than for the enzyme-assisted process (354 MJ). In addition, beer produced using exogenous enzymes reduces the use of water by 7 %, of raw materials by 14 %, and of natural gas by 78 %. Thus, the exergy loss of the enzyme production process is more than compensated by the prevention of exergy loss in the total beer brewing process. Chapter 5 describes brewing tests using malted, unmalted and pearled, unmalted barley kernels. Brewing with unmalted barley saves material, energy and water in the malting stage but may result in complications during processing. Pearling mitigates these problems. Exogenous enzymes were used to compensate for the low enzyme activity in unmalted barley. Lautertun filtration and mash filtration were considered as filtration methods. Principle component analysis was performed on the chemical composition of the wort and the various spent grains, to investigate the effect of the malt-to-barley ratio, the degree of pearling and the filter method. A mash filter is optimal for this type of process, and we identified a window of operation in which optimal use is made of the raw materials while maintaining the end product quality, judged on basis of 4 quality parameters. The concluding chapter 6 presents a general discussion of all results described in this thesis. In addition, the benefits of pearling over that of milling and fractionation, and the effect of pearling on milling properties were discussed. Furthermore, it explores the advantages in environmental sustainability that can be achieved by pearling. Pearling as a pre-treatment for <b>malting</b> reduces the <b>enzyme</b> activity of germinating barley, and therefore the mash quality. This thesis provides insights in how pre-treatment of barley can make beer brewing more efficient in the use of resources. It stresses the need to optimally use all material streams in a process, to be able to design an environmentally sustainable process, and it shows that efficient resource use is key for achieving this. Additionally the value of enzymes as processing aids was discussed. A clear result is that one needs to include the resource use in the production of enzymes or other processing aids, when analyzing the environmental sustainability of a process, since this can be significant in the overall process.    ...|$|R
