5|$|After his {{education}} in Ottawa, McGee {{worked for the}} Canadian government Department of Indian Affairs, {{but he had a}} passion for sports and played lacrosse and rugby and excelled at ice hockey.

He played for the Ottawa Hockey Club from 1902 until 1906.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} noted as a joker on the pitch.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1956–57 season, the {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} a team for a short non-Test tour of New Zealand. The leading contender for the captaincy was 28-year-old Victorian Neil Harvey, who had been a regular <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> for eight years and was the senior batsman. However, both Harvey and Miller had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. The selectors thus thrust Craig into the leadership at the age of 21 and a half. He was a young player leading an inexperienced team—the youngest cricket team from any country to be sent overseas, with no players older than 30. It was seen as a bold move, as Craig had only played six Tests, was far from being a regular <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> and had only a year of captaincy at first-class level.|$|E

5|$|With {{ten minutes}} remaining, he was reintroduced by manager Mickey Harte, {{likely due to}} his {{experience}} as the only <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> who had played in an All-Ireland final before.

Another <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> John Y. Brown, Sr., would later become one of Cooper's political rivals. Coached by Charley Moran, the team was undefeated in four games in the 1918 season, which was shortened by an outbreak of the Spanish flu.|$|E

5|$|After {{releasing}} Clannad, Jun Maeda {{decided to}} make a game based on Tomoyo's scenario from Clannad. Maeda handled the game's planning and scenario, and Leo Kashida, a new <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> accompanied him. As opposed to Itaru Hinoue who was the character designer and art director for Clannad, Fumio was the art director for Tomoyo After, while Hinoue helped Fumio with the character design. As such, characters who appeared in Clannad such as Tomoya and Tomoyo look similar but visibly different from when in Clannad. Maeda also composed the music for the game along with Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi.|$|E
