40|$|Abstract This article {{introduces}} a <b>mobile</b> <b>infrared</b> silhouette imaging and sparse representation-based pose recognition for building an elderly-fall detection system. The proposed imaging paradigm exploits the novel {{use of the}} pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensor in pursuit of body silhouette imaging. A mobile robot carrying a vertical column of multi-PIR detectors is organized for the silhouette acquisition. Then we express the fall detection problem in silhouette image-based pose recognition. For the pose recognition, we use a robust sparse representation-based method for fall detection. The normal and fall poses are sparsely represented in the basis space spanned by the combinations of a pose training template and an error template. The 1 norm minimizations with linear programming (LP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) are used for finding the sparsest solution, and the entity with the largest amplitude encodes the class of the testing sample. The application of the proposed sensing paradigm to fall detection is addressed {{in the context of}} three scenarios, including: ideal non-obstruction, simulated random pixel obstruction and simulated random block obstruction.

40|$|Infrared (IR) {{handover}} is {{the procedure}} providing {{the change from}} one transmitter to another in an indoor environment. Since each transmitter covers a predefined small geographical area and handles the need of the infrared user for data transfer in that area. The active infrared user needs to change its transmitting point of connection to a wired backbone network while it is moving across the coverage boundaries of the multiple transmitters {{to which it is}} connected. For improving overall network performance, the active infrared user must be connected to the most suitable transmitter while accessing the data transfer provided by the fixed network. Therefore, a new smart active IR transceiver system has been described which accommodates handover for <b>mobile</b> <b>infrared</b> communications. A system has been designed and implemented using one receiver and three transmitters within an indoor environment. The system performance has been evaluated, and issues such as position, orientation, and radiation pattern of the signal sources and receiver have been tackled. The desired signal power for the proposed handover evaluation method is given by the average photocurrent that corresponds to the average optical power incident on the photodiode. However, the main limitation to the bandwidth of the IR front-end is the photodiode capacitance, so that the level of received header signal at the sampling point is modified by the front-end transfer function, which may lead to a wrong decision based on the IR channel quality estimation. Thus, {{in order to reduce the}} effect of noise and bandwidth aspects, a raised-cosine-output pulse shape to represent the digital baseband signal is the proposed method for optimizing the estimation of the average transmitter power. That is an active IR receiver can automatically make comparison and then selection of a transmitter which has the transmission quality of the greatest preference based on the recognized header pulse from the received and combined header signals, and finally it could only recover one 16 -PPM modulated data block in the form of a time-division-multiplexed stream having the greatest quality...|$|E

The lack of peripheral information leads to fewer horizontal eye movements and, thus, diminished scanning in RP {{patients in a}} natural environment walking task. This randomized controlled study aimed to improve mobility and the dynamic visual field by applying a compensatory Exploratory Saccadic Training (EST). Oculomotor responses during walking and avoiding obstacles in a controlled environment were studied before and after saccade or reading training in 25 RP patients. Eye movements were recorded using a <b>mobile</b> <b>infrared</b> eye tracker (Tobii glasses) that measured a range of spatial and temporal variables. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two training conditions: Saccade (experimental) and reading (control) training. All subjects who first performed reading training underwent experimental training later (waiting list control group). To assess the effect of training on subjects, we measured performance in the training task and the following outcome variables related to daily life: Response Time (RT) during exploratory saccade training, Percent Preferred Walking Speed (PPWS), the number of collisions with obstacles, eye position variability, fixation duration, and the total number of fixations including the ones in the subjects' blind area of the visual field. In the saccade training group, RTs on average decreased, while the PPWS significantly increased. The improvement persisted, as tested 6 weeks {{after the end of the}} training. On average, the eye movement range of RP patients before and after training was similar to that of healthy observers. In both, the experimental and reading training groups, we found many fixations outside the subjects' seeing visual field before and after training. The average fixation duration was significantly shorter after the training, but only in the experimental training condition. We conclude that the exploratory saccade training was beneficial for RP patients and resulted in shorter fixation durations after the training. We also found a significant improvement in relative walking speed during navigation in a real-world like controlled environment...|$|E

It covers {{a detailed description of}} the methodology and tools applied for the extremely complex industrial site that main technical challenge is the presence of the multi sources of CO 2 at the surface and in the soil. On the basis of previous research programs conducted on natural CO 2 storage sites, a specific geochemical monitoring program was developed that combine both a localized and continuous geochemical monitoring. The paper focuses on the surface gases monitoring techniques spread on specific site to quantify CO 2 flux and concentration at different levels from soil-atmosphere-interface : - 1 m to + 1 m. The geochemical monitoring was based on the combined use of conventional accumulation chambers and dynamic flow chambers systems equipped with high resolution IR sensors, Fourier Transform infrared sensors equipped with specific gas cell and a CO 2 <b>mobile</b> <b>infrared</b> sensor. This first step has lead to the location and discrimination of CO 2 sources and the analysis of the carbon cycle involving the influence of anthropogenic events and of the natural seasonal variations. Combined methodology matrix for a geochemical surface survey adapted to CO 2 storage in Paris basin depth saline aquifer is argued and the measurement results are discussed. C isotopic analyses to insure gas traceability have been also applied. Results are not shown in the paper. On the basis of such combined surface and subsurface gas measurements, seasonal variations of the natural CO 2 cycle were identified. As results, sensitivity and variability were considered to suggest the CO 2 warning levels adapted to detect CO 2 abnormal emissions on the surface. Finally, advanced complementary technologies for both soil and atmospheric gas investigations are also detailled as a part of the survey strategy.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of infrared detector arrays for passive gas detection systems. At present, extractive methods are commonly used {{for the detection of}} gases and vapours. In case of large distances or in the open atmosphere remote measurement systems have to be employed. Remote detection can be used to monitor industrial and traffic emissions and to detect defects and leaks. Usually, the basic measurement principle is active and double ended: e. g. the sampling distance is probed by rays of light and the spectral transmission is measured. For example, using tunable laser sources in the mid-infrared roadside monitoring of the emissions of single moving cars can be achieved. However, establishing and alignment of the necessary closed optical path for such measurements (light source, retroreflector) is always time consuming, and may be rather difficult since it needs access to both ends of the path. LIDARs are single ended systems, but those systems are in most cases im practical due to size, weight, and cost. In such cases a single ended and in particular a passive sensor approach is more suitable than an active technique. A passive sensor approach has to prove sufficient sensitivity and selectivity but it is the only viable approach under weight and cost restrictions in particular for <b>mobile</b> applications. <b>Infrared</b> spectroscopy is an established technique to detect most molecular gases. The 8 - 12 mu m atmospheric window is part of the infrared fingerprint region where many organic substances can be identified. Using the ubiquitous thermal radiation as background results in a high versatility of passive sensing systems. Usually mid infrared spectroscopy is the domain of Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) -spectrometers. They have been successfully used for remote sensing of smoke stack and flare emissions. However, in case of remote gas detection they suffer from typical shortcomings like errors caused by fluctuations of the signal during scanning and ne ed of a high dynamic range. The infrared detector array sensor (IDAS) is an advantageous alternative for the spectrometer. IDAS systems are more robust than FTIR-spectrometers and do not suffer from the sensitivity restrictions of conventional (single detector) grating spectrographs. In addition, IDAS spectroscopy benefits from the rapid technological progress of detector arrays which are usually employed in thermal imaging systems...|$|R

The RSC emissions were highly variable and the few earlier RSC measurements lay near the high end of combustion efficiency observed in this study. Fuel consumption by RSC was ∼ 5 % of total for a planned deforestation fire. Much regional RSC probably occurs in the residual woody debris burned during pasture maintenance fires.

FTIR emissions measurements of burning dung (in a pasture) showed high emission ratios for acetic acid and ammonia to CO (6. 6 ± 3. 4 % and 8. 9 ± 2. 1 %). Large emissions of nitrogen containing trace gases from burning dung and crop waste could mean that biomass burning in India produces more particle mass than previously assumed.

While much of the underlying technology is already available, there are still open challenges with respect to design, usability, portability, functionality and implementation aspects. Most existing “mobile tourism” solutions either represent of-the-shelf applications with rigidly defined content or involve portable devices with networking capabilities that access tourist content with the requirement of constant airtime, i. e., continuous wireless network coverage. This paper presents the design and implementation issues of a “mobile tourism” research prototype, which brings together the main assets of the two aforementioned approaches. Namely, it enables the creation of portable tourist applications with rich content that matches user preferences. The users may download these personalized applications (optimized for their specific device’s model) either directly to their mobile device or first to a PC and then to a <b>mobile</b> terminal (through <b>infrared</b> or bluetooth). Thereafter, network coverage is not further required as the applications execute in standalone mode and may be updated when the user returns online. The dynamically created tourist applications also incorporate a “push model”, wherein new tourist content is forwarded to the mobile terminal with minimal user intervention as soon as it is added or updated by the administrator. Our prototype has been developed on the top of Java 2 Micro Edition (J 2 ME) which offers an ideal platform for the development of full-fledged, interactive and portable applications tailored for resource-constrained mobile devices. The paper presents our development experiences with J 2 ME and highlights its main advantages and shortcomings in relation to the implementation of such kind of applications.

40|$|A self-navigating, path {{following}} and obstacle avoiding mobile robot {{is difficult to}} realize especially when its sensors are strongly effected by noise. This MSc thesis is aimed at investigating a realistic scenario of an autonomous mobile robot simulated in the MatLab environment. The robot system is able to follow a given reference path by utilizing its onboard sensors and decision making capabilities to avoid collisions with arbitrarily placed obstacles along its path. A novel navigational algorithm based on modifying the robot’s way-points using the run-time sensory data is developed and used to go around obstacles and then rejoin the original travel path as needed. The thesis work explores the impact of varying noise in the sensory data and ways of improving the navigational accuracy via signal processing. The study is done in two major sections, the first focusing on the navigational aspects of the mobile robot and the second exploring the sensory data analyses issues. The robot considered has a triangular shape with two differentially driven wheels at the rear left and rear right corners for skid steering control and one castor wheel in the front corner for balance purposes. The sensing system of the <b>mobile</b> robot includes <b>infrared</b> range finders with viewing angles of 180 degrees placed on {{the corners of the}} robot, which are able to detect obstacles all around the robot allowing effective path planning to be carried out via the special-purpose developed navigational algorithms.

For making the navigation mobility of the robot as realistic as possible, practical infrared sensors have been studied experimentally to determine their noise characteristics to include in the simulation studies and the noise levels easily varied to simulate low and high noise levels and assess their effects on the overall navigational precision.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), in {{addition}} to enabling monitoring solutions for numerous new applications areas, have gained huge popularity as a cost-effective, dynamically scalable, easy to deploy and maintainable alternatives to conventional infrastructure-based monitoring solutions. A WSN consists of spatially distributed autonomous wireless sensor nodes that measure desired physical phenomena and operate in a collaborative manner to relay the acquired information wirelessly to a central location. A wireless sensor node, integrating the required resources to enable infrastructure-less distributed monitoring, is constrained by its size, cost and energy. In order to address these constraints, a typical wireless sensor node is designed based on low-power and low-cost modules that in turn provide limited communication and processing performances. Data and computation intensive wireless monitoring applications, on the other hand, not only demand higher communication bandwidth and computational performance but also require practically feasible operational lifetimes so as to reduce the maintenance cost associated with the replacement of batteries. In relation to the communication and processing requirements of such applications and the constraints associated with a typical wireless sensor node, this thesis explores energy efficient wireless sensor node architecture that enables realization of data and computation intensive applications. Architectures enabling raw data transmission and in-sensor processing with various technological alternatives are explored. The potential architectural alternatives are evaluated both analytically and quantitatively with regards to different design parameters, in particular, the performance and the energy consumption. For quantitative evaluation purposes, the experiments are conducted on vibration and image-based industrial condition monitoring applications that are not only data and computation intensive but also are of practical importance. Regarding the choice of an appropriate wireless technology in an architecture enabling raw data transmission, standard based communication technologies including <b>infrared,</b> <b>mobile</b> broadband, WiMax, LAN, Bluetooth, and ZigBee are investigated. With regards to in-sensor processing, different architectures comprising of sequential processors and FPGAs are realized to evaluate different design parameters, especially the performance and energy efficiency. Afterwards, the architectures enabling raw data transmission only and those involving in-sensor processing are evaluated so as to find an energy efficient solution. The results of this investigation show that in-sensor processing architecture, comprising of an FPGA for computation purposes, is more energy efficient when compared with other alternatives {{in relation to the}} data and computation intensive applications. Based on the results obtained and the experiences learned in the architectural evaluation study, an FPGA-based high-performance wireless sensor platform, the SENTIOF, is designed and developed. In addition to performance, the SETNIOF is designed to enable dynamic optimization of energy consumption. This includes enabling integrated modules to be completely switched-off and providing a fast configuration support to the FPGA.  In order to validate the results of the evaluation studies, and to assess the performance and energy consumption of real implementations, both the vibration and image-based industrial monitoring applications are realized using the SENTIOF. In terms of computational performance for both of these applications, the real-time processing goals are achieved. For example, in the case of vibration-based monitoring, real-time processing performance for tri-axes (horizontal, vertical and axial) vibration data are achieved for sampling rates of more than 100 kHz. With regards to energy consumption, based on the measured power consumption that also includes the power consumed during the FPGA’s configuration process, the operational lifetimes are estimated using a single cell battery (similar to an AA battery in terms of shape and size) with a typical capacity of 2600 mA. In the case of vibration-based condition monitoring, an operational lifetime of more than two years can be achieved for duty-cycle interval of 10 minutes or more. The achievable operational lifetime of image-based monitoring is more than 3 years for a duty-cycle interval of 5 minutes or more. ...|$|R
