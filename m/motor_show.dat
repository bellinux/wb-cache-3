5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} <b>motor</b> <b>show</b> for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, {{who was in charge of}} Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the <b>motor</b> <b>show</b> and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E

5|$|The initial XJ220 {{concept car}} was {{unveiled}} {{to the public}} at the 1988 British International <b>Motor</b> <b>Show,</b> held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production; some 1500 deposits of £50,000 each were taken, and deliveries were planned for 1992.|$|E

5|$|A {{successor}} for the C3 Picasso {{was revealed}} in 2017 {{as the new}} C3 Aircross, and revealed at the Geneva <b>Motor</b> <b>Show</b> in March as the C-Aircross Concept, with an expected launch in late 2017. Auto Express reported the vehicle is taking design cues from the C-Aircross Concept, and will {{make the transition from}} MPV to an SUV design.|$|E
5|$|Press {{coverage}} of the concept XJ220 in 1988 was overwhelmingly positive {{and contributed to the}} decision in 1989 to put the XJ220 into limited production.

5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and {{he arranged}} for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International <b>Motor</b> <b>Show</b> in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No production models were sold until after the war, when the vehicle was renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International <b>Motor</b> <b>Show</b> in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E

5|$|Its design {{began in}} September 2005 with {{sketches}} by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed {{especially for the}} car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris <b>Motor</b> <b>Show</b> in late September.|$|E
5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was {{incorporated in the}} Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva <b>Motor</b> <b>Show.</b> The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which have been designed to have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The European {{version of}} the Volt, the Opel Ampera (known as the Vauxhall Ampera in the United Kingdom), was {{unveiled}} at the Geneva Auto Show in March 2009 and also was exhibited at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto Show. Opel developed the battery control modules for the Ampera at the Opel Alternative Propulsion Center Europe in Mainz-Kastel, Germany. The production {{version of the}} Ampera was unveiled at the 2011 Geneva <b>Motor</b> <b>Show.</b> The Ampera is assembled at the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant, Michigan.|$|E

5|$|The Opel Monza Concept is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} with {{gullwing}} door unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt <b>Motor</b> <b>Show.</b> The concept shares {{the same basic}} plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model {{for the next generation}} of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E
5|$|With the VT Commodore of 1997, Holden {{looked again}} to Opel in Germany for a donor platform. The {{proposal}} {{was to take}} the Opel Omega B and broaden the vehicle's width and mechanical setup for local conditions. In the early days, Holden considered adopting the Omega as is, save for the engines and transmissions, and even investigated reskinning the existing VR/VS architecture. Later on, the VT bodywork spawned a new generation of Statesman and Caprice (again based on the long-wheelbase wagons), and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney <b>Motor</b> <b>Show.</b>|$|E
5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt <b>Motor</b> <b>Show</b> and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to trickle charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can trickle charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
