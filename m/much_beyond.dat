5|$|Beyond the endemic {{internal}} power struggles, the TFG has faced {{far more serious}} problems in establishing its authority and rebuilding the structures of governance. Its writ has never extended <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> Baidoa. Its control of Mogadishu is ever more contested, and it is largely under siege {{in the rest of}} the country. There are no properly functioning government institutions.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.|$|E
5|$|After three days, {{unable to}} persuade {{his men to}} back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts {{in the army and}} conferred Macedonian {{military}} titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.|$|E

5|$|Malcolm's kingdom did {{not extend}} over the full {{territory}} of modern Scotland: {{the north and west}} of Scotland remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories under the rule of the Kings of Scots {{did not extend}} <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> the limits established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the Kingdom of England, which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of Northumbria. These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled Scotland for many years, although his role as founder of a dynasty {{has more to do with}} the propaganda of his youngest son David I and his descendants than with history.|$|E
5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> their respective tropes.|$|E
5|$|The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, {{is defined}} by {{regional}} kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared {{to make way for}} the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} plays {{of the fourth}} quarter {{failed to live up}} to the promise that had been shown in the third for the Hokies. Two {{incomplete}} passes and one that gained just twoyards forced Virginia Tech to punt the ball away with 13:49 remaining in the quarter. After taking over at its 33-yard line, Kansas had no more success on offense than did Virginia Tech. After three straight plays with no gain, Kansas was forced to punt the ball away as well. A 58-yard kick by Kyle Tucker pinned Virginia Tech inside its 10-yard line, and the Hokies were unable to advance the ball <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> the ten-yard line. An incomplete pass and a two-yard run by Branden Ore were all the offense managed before Sean Glennon threw a 20-yard interception to the Jayhawks' Justin Thornton. Thornton returned the ball 30yards to the Virginia Tech two-yard line, and on Kansas' first play after the interception, Todd Reesing ran twoyards for the touchdown. The score gave the Jayhawks a 2414 lead with just 10:57 remaining.|$|E

25|$|The few {{expeditions to}} {{penetrate}} <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> the Arctic Circle {{in this era}} added only small islands, such as Novaya Zemlya (11th century) and Spitzbergen (1596), though since these were often surrounded by pack-ice, their northern limits were not so clear.

25|$|Compressibility is an {{important}} factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, a host of new aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for World War II era aircraft to reach speeds <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> 800km/h (500mph).|$|E

25|$|Just as the Imām {{is seen by}} Ismailis as {{the manifestation}} of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the {{relationship}} between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> a normal missionary. The Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he learned to love the Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir.|$|E
25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then mix it with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net thrust. The limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the combustion chambers. Using materials available at the time, speeds <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} twentieth-century {{art is a}} {{narrative}} of endless possibilities {{and the search for}} new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence.|$|E

25|$|Wieslochia was {{possibly}} {{not a member}} of any extant suborder. That not only the Passeri expanded <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> their region of origin is proven by an undetermined broadbill (Eurylaimidae) from the Early Miocene (roughly 20mya) of Wintershof, Germany, and the indeterminant Late Oligocene suboscine from France listed above. Even very basal Passeriformes might have been common in Europe until the Middle Miocene, some 12mya. Extant Passeri superfamilies were quite distinct by that time and are known since about 12–13 mya when modern genera were present in the corvoidean and basal songbirds. The modern diversity of Passerida genera is known mostly from the Late Miocene onwards and into the Pliocene (about 10–2mya). Pleistocene and early Holocene lagerstätten (<1.8nbsp&mya) yield numerous extant species, and many yield almost nothing but extant species or their chronospecies and paleosubspecies.|$|E
25|$|Iran (then called Persia) {{traditionally}} was governed {{over the}} last few centuries in a fairly decentralised way with much regional and local autonomy. In particular, weaker members of the Qajar dynasty often did not rule <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> the capital Tehran, a fact exploited by the imperial powers Britain and Russia in the 19th century. For example, when British cartographers, diplomats, and telegraph workers traveled along Iran's southern coast in the early 19th century laden with guns and accompanied by powerful ships, some local chieftains quickly calculated that their sworn allegiance to the Shah in Tehran with its accompanying tax burden might be optional. When queried, they proclaimed their own local authority. However during Constitutional Revolution ethnic minorities including Azeris, Bakhtiaris and Armenians fought together for establishment of democracy in Iran while they had the power to become independent.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} people inhabiting the Allegheny Mountains {{emerged from the}} greater region's archaic and mound building cultures, particularly the Adena and Eastern Woodland peoples with a later Hopewellian influence. These Late Middle Woodland culture people have been called the Montaine (c. A.D. 500 to 1000) culture. Their neighbors, the woodland Buck Garden culture, lived in the western valleys of the central Allegheny range. The Montaine sites extend from the tributaries of the upper Potomac River region south to the New River tributaries. These also were influenced by the earlier Armstrong culture of the more southwestern portions northern sub-range of the Ouasioto (Cumberland) Mountains and by the more easterly Virginia Woodland people. The Late Woodland Montaine were less influenced by Hopewellian trade from Ohio, although similarly polished stone tools have been found among the Montaine sites in the Tygart Valley. Small groups of Montaine people appear to have lingered <b>much</b> <b>beyond</b> their classically defined period {{in parts of the}} most mountainous valleys.|$|E
