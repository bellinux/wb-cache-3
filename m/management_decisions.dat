The sampling intensity necessary to measure a nematode population with specified precision varies with population density. Since the density is unknown prior to sampling, optimum sampling intensity for a <b>management</b> <b>decision</b> is calculated for the economic threshold population level associated with the management cost. Population densities below the threshold are measured with greater precision than required; those above the threshold are less precisely measured, but invoke management.
