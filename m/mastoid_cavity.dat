40|$|Near {{infrared}} radiation {{can be used}} for warm stimulation in caloric irrigation of the equilibrium organ. Aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether near {{infrared radiation}} offers effective stimulation of the vestibular organ, whether it is well tolerated by the patients and especially whether it is a viable alternative to warm air stimulation in patients with defects of the tympanic membrane and radical <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities.</b> Patients with perforations of the tympanic membrane (n = 15) and with radical <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> (n = 13) were tested both with near infrared radiation and warm dry air. A caloric-induced nystagmus could be seen equally effectively and rapidly in all patients. Contrary to stimulation with warm dry air, no paradoxical nystagmus was observed following caloric irrigation with a warm stimulus (near infrared radiation). Results of a questionnaire showed excellent patient acceptance of near infrared stimulation with no arousal effects or unpleasant feeling. In conclusion, near infrared radiation proved to be an alternative method of caloric irrigation to warm dry air in patients with tympanic membrane defects and radical <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities.</b> Near infrared radiation is pleasant, quick, contact free, sterile and quiet. With this method an effective caloric warm stimulus is available. If near infrared radiation is used for caloric stimulus no evaporative heat loss occurs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} pre- and post-total {{middle ear}} reconstruction bacteriological changes {{in order to}} facilitate prevention and treatment of surgical infections. MethodsSpecimens from 128 ears in 124 patients with problematic <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> who underwent revision total middle ear reconstruction were studied. ResultsBacteriological tests were positive in 87 (68. 0 %) pre-operative specimens, despite local treatment, and in 74 (57. 8 %) specimens collected 10 days after operation. Common organism strains in pre- and post-operative specimens were slightly different and included: coagulase- staphylococcus, GRAM+ rods, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi. At the time of patient discharge(15 - 20 days post-operative), only 3 ears (2. 3 %) were tested positive which responded well to and became dry after local treatment. At one year, 4 ears (3. 1 %) showed recurrent otorrhea which again responded to local treatment. ConclusionFor infection of problematic <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> after an open cavity procedure, revision total middle ear reconstruction is effective in controlling infection and promoting a dry ear. Infection prevention and treatment is important considering the relatively high rates of peri-operative local infections...|$|R

50|$|Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} (CSOM) is a chronic {{inflammation of the}} middle ear and <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> that is characterised by discharge from the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane for at least 6 weeks. CSOM occurs following an upper respiratory tract infection that has led to acute otitis media. This progresses to a prolonged inflammatory response causing mucosal (middle ear) oedema, ulceration and perforation. The middle ear attempts to resolve this ulceration by production of granulation tissue and polyp formation. This can lead to increased discharge and failure to arrest the inflammation, and to development of CSOM, which is also often associated with cholesteatoma. There may be enough pus that it drains to the outside of the ear (otorrhea), or the pus may be minimal enough to be seen only on examination with an otoscope or binocular microscope. Hearing impairment often accompanies this disease.|$|E

To show that <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> with continuous infections and cleaning {{problems can be}} obliterated with bioactive glass (BG) and to present results of a pilot study for 16 operations on adults. Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. Päijät-Häme Central Hospital, Finland—a single ear, nose, and throat (ENT) hospital department serving a popu-lation of 216, 000. Subjects and Methods. Fourteen patients had a large open radical cavity with recurrent infections. Two ears had discharge and pain after simple mastoidectomy. A re-mastoidectomy included support of the cavity skin and obliteration with BG. The mean follow-up time was 2. 2 years. Results. All ears became dry. One reoperation was needed as the fascia support to the ear canal (EC) skin was too weak, {{and part of the}} BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry, and the missing BG was replaced in a reoperation. A slightly short musculoperiosteal flap supported the EC skin in 1 ear. A minor amount of BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry. The aim was an ample ear canal. One ear was overfilled and required meatoplasty. Simple <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> were iso-lated from the middle ear and become asymptomatic.

40|$|Introduction: To reduce {{incidence}} of residual cholesteatoma following ear surgery; {{and to reduce}} the need for second look “open” mastoidectomy using endoscopic mastoidotomy. Ten-year retrospective chart review of 249 primary cholesteatoma cases (1994 - 2004) with a minimum follow-up of two years.   The first objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} otoendoscopy in reducing the {{incidence of}} “cholesteatoma remnant” at the time of primary surgery. The second investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of otoendoscopy in reducing the need to open the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> during “second look operations”.          Materials and Methods: endoscopes were used on all cases as an adjunct to standard microscopic methods. Once all visible cholesteatoma was removed with standard microscopic techniques, endoscopes were utilized in order to identify any “remnants” of cholesteatoma. Endoscopes were also employed during revision second look cases in order to allow the evaluation of intact canal wall <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> without an open Mastoidectomy approach.   Results: Endoscopy at time of primary operations revealed a 22 % incidence of hidden cholesteatoma “remnants” despite apparent total microscopic eradication in closed cavity  cases, and 10 % in open cavity patients.   Endoscopic removal of cholesteatoma remnants reduced the long term cholesteatoma “residual” to 9. 7 % in closed cavity patients. Furthermore, endoscopic surgery significantly reduced the need to open the mastoids during second look operations.      Conclusion:  Otoendoscopy is a very effective adjunctive method in ear surgery. It allows significant reduction in cholesteatoma residual rate in both closed cavity and open cavity cases.   Furthermore, the great majority of second look mastoids can be evaluated endoscopically and thus avoid an open revision Mastoidectomy...|$|R

Discussion/ConclusionUnilateral clear retrotympanic effusion in an adult subject should, apart from serous otitis media, suggest possible cerebrospinal fistula. In the absence of otologic or traumatic history, arachnoid granulation is one possible etiology, inducing spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leakage when facing the temporal bone. Diagnosis is suggested by bone defects in the tegmen tympani or posterior wall of the temporal bone on CT, with the adjacent <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> filled with fluid.

40|$|Objectives: We {{evaluated}} {{a method}} for gas monitoring in the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> using tunable diode laser spectroscopy by comparing it to simultaneously obtained computed tomographic (CT) scans. Methods: The presented optical technique measures free gases, oxygen (O 2), and water vapor (H 2 O) within human tissue by use of low-power diode lasers. Laser light was sent into {{the tip of the}} mastoid process, and the emerging light {{at the level of the}} antrum was captured with a detector placed on the skin. The absorption of H 2 O was used to monitor the probed gas volume of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity,</b> and it was compared to the CT scan measured volume. The ratio between O 2 absorption and H 2 O absorption estimated the O 2 content in the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> and thus the ventilation. The parameters were compared to the grading of mastoid cavities based on the CT scans (n = 31). The reproducibility of the technique was investigated by measuring each <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> 4 times. Results: Both O 2 and H 2 O were detected with good reproducibility. The H 2 O absorption and the CT volume correlated (r = 0. 69). The average ratio between the normalized O 2 absorption and the H 2 O absorption signals was 0. 7, indicating a lower O 2 content than in surrounding air (expected ratio, 1. 0), which is consistent with previous findings made by invasive techniques. All mastoid cavities with radiologic signs of disease were detected. Conclusions: Laser spectroscopy monitoring appears to be a usable tool for noninvasive investigations of gas composition in the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity,</b> providing important clinical information regarding size and ventilation...|$|E

Patients: Four patients with bilateral canal wall down <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> who underwent the middle fossa approach for cochlear implantation. Interventions: Cochlear implantation and subsequent rehabilitation. A middle fossa approach with cochleostomy was successfully performed on the most superficial part of the apical turn in 4 patients. A Nucleus 24 cochlear implant system was used in 3 patients and a MED-EL Sonata Medium device in 1 patient. The single electrode array was inserted through a cochleostomy from the cochlear apex and occupied the apical, middle, and basal turns.

A secondary objective was the evaluation of hearing results in a subgroup of subjects who received the VSB device. Between 2009 and early 2011, 22 adult subjects with chronic otitis media (COM) underwent a SP, blind sac closure of the external auditory canal and abdominal fat obliteration to facilitate the application of an active middle ear implant (AMEI) in a staged procedure. Indications consisted of mixed hearing loss after previous tympanomastoplasty and failure of hearing rehabilitation with a hearing aid or bone conduction device in COM. Pre- and postoperative pure-tone audiograms were analyzed in respect to deterioration of inner ear function, unaided and aided (hearing aid, bone-anchored hearing aid and VSB) speech audiograms were compared to verify improvements in communications skills and functional gains. Incidence and type of complications were reviewed. No significant change was observed regarding mean bone conduction thresholds after the first stage procedure. Some minor wound healing problems were noted.

Background: Treatment with open cavity mastoidectomy can present poor functional results in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, especially if the cavity is large. Partial or total obliteration of the cavity can overcome these problems. Alpha-tricalcium phosphate bone cement has physicochemical characteristics that suggest its potential in <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> obliteration. Materials and Methods: Twenty guinea pigs were studied. All animals underwent surgery involving the dorsal tympanic bulla. In the study group animals (n = 10), <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> obliteration was performed with alpha-tricalcium phosphate bone cement. In the control group animals (n = 10), the cavity was left unfilled. On postoperative day 60, the animals were sacrificed and studied for signs of rejection of the material and other complications. Temporal bones were removed for histopathological study, in which the type and degree of inflammatory response, {{as well as the}} degree of ossification, were analyzed. Results: The mortality rate was the same in both groups. Deaths were attributed to anesthetic complications in the initial postoperative period.

40|$|This work {{is meant}} to study the {{importance}} of the posterior tympanotomy in the functional surgery of the chronic suppurative processes of the middle ear, in order to accomplish the osiculoplasties and tympanoplasties. This procedure represents an antroaditoaticotomy with keeping the meatal posterior wall, associated with the tympanoplasty with homograft (fascia of the temporal muscle) called by some authors mastoidectomy tympanoplasty. The particularity of this technique is that it realizes a communication (excavation) limited in the uppers side by the incudis pit, in the middle by the pyramid segment of the facial muscle and laterally by the bone ring crossed by the corda tympani nerve between the mastoid and the middle ear. The advantages of this technique are the existence of a good surgical field and the access to the posterior part of the cavotympan, as well as realizing an optimal functional relation between the volume of the middle ear and the <b>mastoid’s</b> <b>cavity.</b> The association of the anterior tympanotomy and tympanoplasty at the same surgical time allows: Rebuilding the integrity of the ossicular chain and the tympanic membrane; The control of the retraction pockets and tympanic perforations; The ablation of the evolving inflammatory or cholesteatoma lesions in the middle ear assuring also an efficient draining and avoiding the post operation complications; Last but not least, the functional gain of the audition, which {{would not have been possible}} by realizing a void cavity through an open technique.

40|$|Objectives: To {{overcome}} {{the lack of}} the autografts in revision ear surgery, the usefulness of human amniotic membrane (AM) patches as a dressing substitute for fascia grafts of the temporal muscle (temporalis fascia graft) was investigated in canal wall down tympanoplasty. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: In 11 ears of 11 patients, the AM was attached over the bony surface of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> (AM group). In 11 ears of nine patients, the temporalis fascia graft was attached over the bony surface of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> (fascia group). The times for graft epithelization were compared in both groups. Results: In both groups, complete epithelization of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> took place in all patients. The time of epitheliza-tion in the AM group was 32 days, whereas in the fascia group it was 45 days. Complete epithelization of the AM graft was significantly faster than the fascia graft (P <. 05). Conclusions: Hyperdry AM might be a new useful dressing substitute for temporalis fascia graft due to {{the reduction in the}} epithlializing time offered by the AM in revision ear surgery...|$|E
3000|$|This {{model is}} the first one {{characterized}} by accurate structural dimensional and geometric shapes of middle ear structures, external ear canal, and <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> in the human. To confirm the validity of this model, the vibration amplitude of the umbo obtained with this model was compared with that derived from experimental measurement data. The predicted vibration amplitude of stapes was also shown. It was difficult to measure stapes vibration amplitude without opening the middle ear cavity. If a complete FE model of the middle ear were constructed, spatial variations in displacement on the TM, three ossicular vibrations, and spatial pressure distributions in the middle ear cavity and external ear canal could clarified without direct measurement, which are difficult to perform. It appeared that the results from the temporal bone experiments and the FE-predicted results match, namely that blocking the aditus improves middle ear sound transmission in the 1500 to 2500 [*]Hz range and decreases displacement in the low frequencies below 1000 [*]Hz when compared with the normal ear. Blocking the aditus eliminates the compliance of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> thus stiffening the TM and decreasing low frequency transmission, while opening the aditus increases middle ear cavity compliance, decrease TM stiffness and improves the low-frequency response. It has been reported that the effect of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> on the vibration of the TM is remarkable at low frequency and that it behaves like a spring [17, 30, 36]. The <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> would enhance sound transmission at low frequency ([...] [...]...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Persistent otorrhoea and {{granulation}} {{tissue in the}} <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> are common post-operative complications of Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy. In {{order to avoid the}} same and to achieve a dry cavity instillation of acetic acid into the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> during the post operative period is common practice. Materials and Methods In this study we assessed the results of 4 % acetic acid instillation in varying quantity and frequency, in the ears after modified radical mastoidectomy. 40 Patients of chronic suppurative otitis media (atticoantral) / cholesteatoma, who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy during one and a half year period, were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups; Group A with 30 patients and Group B with 10 patients, by simple randomization method. Group A patients were asked to instill 4 % acetic acid approximately 10 to 12 drops (generously) into the <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> thrice a day for   8 weeks and were followed up every week.   10 patients  of Group B were asked to instill the same preparation only once weekly and followed up for the next 12 weeks.   Results: In Group A, dry <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavity</b> was achieved remarkably faster within six to eight weeks and in all the 30 patients. In Group B the results were delayed by up to 4 to 6 weeks in comparison to the Group A patients. Conclusion:             Though acetic acid instillation is known to help in achieving a dry cavity but a slightly higher concentration (4 % acetic acid) used more frequently is highly effective in rendering dry cavity much earlier without proliferation of {{granulation tissue}}...|$|E
40|$|Background / Objective : To {{determine}} {{the outcome of}} surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media at our department over 3 years, between 2001 and 2003. The outcome measures were; achievement of dry ear, closure of tympanic membrane perforation and improvement in hearing for patients who had myringoplasty. Methods : A retrospective review of case notes of patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (cholesteatoma and non-cholesteatomatous disease) operated upon by 2 consultant ENT surgeons in our department over a 3 year period. The operations performed were mastoidectomy and type I tympanoplasty or myringoplasty. The results were analysed and presented. Results : Seventy three patients were operated upon for cholesteatoma and non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media during this period, there were 41 males and 32 females with a sex ratio of 1 : 1. 3. Age range was 9 to 84 years with {{the mean age of}} 37 years. 17 of them were children aged 9 to 15 years (24 &#x 0025;). 25 patients (34. 2 &#x 0025;) had cholesteatoma and 48 (65. 8 &#x 0025;) had non-cholesteatomatous disease 41 (56. 2 &#x 0025;) had myringoplasty and 29 (39. 7 &#x 0025;) had mastoidectomy, and 3 (4. 1 &#x 0025;) patients had tympanomastoidectomy. 62. 5 &#x 0025; (n= 20) <b>mastoid</b> <b>cavities</b> were dry at 12 months follow up. Perforation closure was achieved in 89 &#x 0025; (n= 34). Binaural hearing was achieved in 6 patients and in 4 patients the operated ear became the better hearing ear; air-bone gap was closed completely in 8 patients (19. 5 &#x 0025;), and in 36. 6 &#x 0025; (n= 15) the gap was closed to within 10 dB. There was no deterioration in hearing in the operated ears. One patient presented with House Brachman grade 2 facial palsy pre-operatively which worsened to grade 4 post operatively but improved to pre-operative grade at 12 month follow up. Conclusion : Chronic suppurative otitis media is a disease that is still with us, and at our department, the surgery has a high success rate, which is also comparable in adults and children...|$|R
50|$|After Clarke’s {{analysis}} of the Ndutu skull, it was generally classified as Homo erectus. G. Philip Rightmire disagreed with this classification, and believed that its features suggested {{that it was more}} similar to the African fossils referred to as archaic Homo sapiens. According to Rightmire, the length and breadth dimensions of the Ndutu cranium are similar to earlier Homo erectus fossils from Koobi Fora and Illeret, while its size is more similar to OH 12 than OH 9. Based on the occipital morphology, <b>mastoid</b> shape, glenoid <b>cavity,</b> and tympanic plate of the Ndutu hominid, Rightmire claims that the fossil hominids it most resembles are Broken Hill, Elandsfontein, and other archaic Homo sapiens found in Africa.|$|R
