Tang and Teunter (2006) firstly studied this type of Economic Lot Scheduling Problem with Returns (ELSPR) and presented a complex algorithm for the optimal solution. More recently Teunter, Tang, and Kaparis (2009) proposed several heuristics {{to deal with the}} same problem using more computational efficient approaches.

Random scrap rate is considered in this study, and breakdown is assumed to occur in inventory stacking period.

40|$|For a {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturer, {{the establishment of}} dissolution specification limits {{for a new product}} affects the determination of the product’s acceptable shelf life, the sentencing of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lots,</b> and the cost of manufacturing changes. Common approaches to setting these limits either fail to model explicitly sources of variation in the observed dissolution profiles or result in specification limits on model parameters rather than on the observed responses that are of primary interest. We propose a nonlinear mixed effects model to account for sources of variation in the dissolution measurements and use it to construct a parametric bootstrap tolerance interval on the population of dissolution values at a specified time. This provides an evaluation of manufacturing process capability. We subsequently examine the bootstrap tolerance limit method with simulations using simple random samples, mixed models, and nonlinear mixed models. In all cases, the parametric bootstrap tolerance limits exhibit substantially lower coverage than the stated confidence level. Our results demonstrate the need for researchers to use caution when calculating bootstrap tolerance limits. While the bootstrap is a valuable tool in many situations, bootstrap intervals can and sometimes do perform quite poorly, particularly with small to moderate sample sizes...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a deterministic {{model of the}} manufacturing system with product recovery. Two types of policies for the problem had been proposed in literature, namely the (1,R) policy, in which one manufacturing setup is followed by R remanufacturing setups and the (P, 1) policy, which has P manufacturing setups, following every remanufacturing setup. Teunter (2004) developed heuristics to evaluate the cost for both policies and recommended choosing the better one among them. In this paper, we develop {{a new class of}} general (P,R) policies, where the long-run ratio of the number of manufacturing setups to the number of remanufacturing setups is P/R.

The objective is to minimize the expected lead time, and therefore we model the production environment as a queueing network. Given these lead times, release dates are set dynamically. This in turn creates a time window for every manufacturing order in which the various operations have to be sequenced. The sequencing logic is based on an Extended Shifting Bottleneck Procedure. These three major decisions are next incorporated into a four-phase, hierarchical, operational implementation scheme. A small numerical example is used to illustrate the methodology.

Some of the targeted compounds included diphenylamines, centralites, nitrotoluenes, nitroglycerin, and various phthalates. The compounds were ionized in the MS source using simultaneous positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) with negative atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in order to detect all compounds in a single analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{impact of}} {{different}} levels of uncertainty in geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) shear strength on landfill stability is evaluated in this study. The uncertainty in shear strength of the interface governing landfill stability is defined using statistical parameters obtained from a significant database of GCL internal and GCL–geomembrane interface large-scale direct shear tests. Uncertainty in GCL shear strength arises from material variability within a single product type and between different product types. For a given product type, uncertainty arises from material differences among specimens from the same <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lot</b> as well as among specimens from different manufacturing lots. In addition, uncertainty was observed to arise from differences in test procedures such as hydration, consolidation and shear displacement rate.

Inventory management is a key issue in the whole manufacturing process and in particular in the setting of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>lot</b> sizes. Great emphasis should be placed on the optimization of the costs and on the search of the appropiate production orders. In production planning and control, models are needed to set the basis of a given service; at what times and in what lot size should be produced different products on one machine. The aim is not only to formulate a feasible production plan, but also to identify based on a cost evaluation, the best possible production plan. For this purpose, the cost manufacturing, warehousing and setup costs are taken into account. The optimal lot sizing model will be chosen according to the conditions of the concerned enterprise production system.

The contributions to the material variability of the GCL fiber reinforcements, the GM textured asperities, and the bentonite are addressed separately. GCL peel strength results do not to correlate well with GCL internal and GCL-GM shear strength results, indicating that this test is not appropriate for characterizing the material variability in the GCL internal reinforcements or the GCL-GM interlocking capabilities.
