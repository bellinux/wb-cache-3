25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate.</b> The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate,</b> it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{since the}} {{limiting}} resolution is usually {{defined as the}} point at which the MTF is three percent or less, this would also be the maximum resolution of the tube. The MTF is affected by every part of an image intensifier tube's operation and on a complete system is also affected by the quality of the optics involved. Factors that affect the MTF include transition through any fiber plate or glass, at the screen and the photocathode and also through the tube and the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> itself. The higher the MTF at a given resolution, the better.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{some type}} of {{electron}} multiplier is used, though other detectors including Faraday cups and ion-to-photon detectors are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. <b>Microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> detectors are commonly used in modern commercial instruments. In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists {{of a pair of}} metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate. No direct current is produced, only a weak AC image current is produced in a circuit between the electrodes. Other inductive detectors have also been used.|$|E
40|$|An {{ultraviolet}} spectrograph {{was constructed}} using double <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> as detectors at the focal plane. The photoelectron pulses were located {{one at a}} time by measuring the charge division to the ends of a resistor strip behind the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates.</b> The system worked to 20, 000 counts/sec and gave resolution exceeding 100 elements...|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} achieve high spatial {{resolution}} readout of individual photoelectron events using <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> and a resistive anode is presented. A clamped pair of <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> is used, {{followed by a}} gap and a clamped triplet of <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> in cascade to achieve a high stable electron gain of 3 x 10 to the 7 th. The gain allows the position determination of each photoelectron event with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. A model consisting of a windowless vacuum-ultraviolet image sensor is presented to demonstrate 500 x 500 pixel images of 50 micron FWHM over a 25 -mm circular field of view. The detector offers sufficient speed, sensitivity and resolution {{for a variety of}} applications, and the mount design is compatible with planar, remotely-processed, proximity-focused photocathodes...|$|R
5000|$|The mass-market {{application}} of <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> is in image intensifier tubes of night vision goggles, which amplify visible and invisible light {{in order to}} make dark surroundings visible to the human eye.|$|R
25|$|An image {{intensifier}} or {{image intensifier}} tube is a vacuum tube device for increasing the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray image intensifier), or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate),</b> and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E
25|$|Image intensifiers convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an objective lens which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} recognized under the U.S. generation categories, Super Second Generation or SuperGen {{was developed in}} 1989 by Jacques Dupuy and Gerald Wolzak. This technology improved the tri-alkali photocathodes to more than double their sensitivity while also improving the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> by increasing the open-area ratio to 70% while reducing the noise level. This allowed second generation tubes, which are more economical to manufacture, to achieve comparable results to third generation image intensifier tubes. With sensitivities of the photocathodes approaching 700 uA/lm and extended frequency response to 950nm, this technology continued to be developed outside of the U.S., notably by Photonis and now forms the basis for most non-US manufactured high-end night vision equipment.|$|E

40|$|A new multi-particle {{time and}} {{position}} sensitive detector using only {{a set of}} <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates,</b> a waveform digitizer, a phosphor screen, and a CMOS camera is described. The assignment of the timing information, as taken from the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> by fast digitizing, to the positions, as recorded by the camera, {{is based on the}} COrrelation between the BRightness of the phosphor screen spots, defined as their integrated intensity and the Amplitude of the electrical signals (COBRA). Tests performed by observing the dissociation of HeH, the fragmentation of H 3 into two or three fragments,and the photo-double-ionization of Xenon atoms are presented, which illustrate the performances of the COBRA detection scheme.

40|$|Radiation hard {{monolithic}} particle {{sensors can be}} fabricated by {{a vertical}} integration of amorphous silicon particle sensors on top of CMOS readout chip. Two types of such particle sensors are presented here using either thick diodes or <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates.</b> The first type based on amorphous silicon diodes exhibits high spatial resolution due to the short lateral carrier collection. Combination of an amorphous silicon thick diode with microstrip detector geometries permits to achieve micrometer spatial resolution beneficial for high accuracy beam positioning. <b>Microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> based on amorphous silicon were successfully fabricated and multiplication of electrons was observed. This material may solve {{some of the problems}} related to conventional microchannel devices. Issues, potential and limits of these detectors are presented and discussed...|$|R
25|$|All the {{electrons}} {{move in a}} straight line due to the high-voltage difference across the plates, which preserves collimation, and where one or two electrons entered, thousands may emerge. A separate (lower) charge differential accelerates the secondary electrons from the MCP until they hit a phosphor screen {{at the other end of}} the intensifier, which releases a photon for every electron. The image on the phosphor screen is focused by an eyepiece lens. The amplification occurs at the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> stage via its secondary cascaded emission. The phosphor is usually green because the human eye is more sensitive to green than other colors and because historically the original material used to produce phosphor screens produced green light (hence the soldiers' nickname 'green TV' for image intensification devices).|$|E
25|$|While {{the third}} {{generation}} of tubes were fundamentally {{the same as the}} second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs photocathode, which is more sensitive in the 800nm-900nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the photocathode exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a free ride to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer {{at the edge of the}} photocathode causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the photocathode very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by positive ion poisoning. Due to the high electrostatic field stresses in the tube, and the operation of the <b>MicroChannel</b> <b>Plate,</b> this led to the failure of the photocathode within a short period - as little as 100 hours before photocathode sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the photocathode from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this photocathode, greater than 900 µA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, after {{eighteen}} {{years as an}} independent enterprise, Burle Industries and a key subsidiary were acquired by Photonis, a European holding company Photonis Group.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the X-ray detector which will provide second-of-arc images for the HEAO-B X-ray observatory.

Position determination is accomplished by electronic interpolation between the coarse grid wires. The detector provides the arrival time and position of each event which occurs within its field of view. Measurements of the spatial resolution (15 microns), temporal resolution (7. 8 microsec), image distortion (less than 10 microns), uniformity of efficiency (less than plus or minus 10 %), dark counting rate (0. 2 cts/sq cm/s), and quantum efficiency (10 % at 1. 54 keV) of this detector are described.

2500|$|One variant {{called a}} [...] "channel {{electron}} multiplier" [...] {{does not use}} individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission. One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous dynode was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an image intensifier in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles by the Electron Reflectometer instrument aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft from May of 1999 to the mission conclusion in November 2006. Originally designed to detect low-energy electrons, the Electron Reflectometer also measured particles with energies > 30 MeV that penetrated the aluminum housing of the instrument and were detected directly by <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> in the instrument interior. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental results, we show how the Electron Reflectometer <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> recorded high energy galactic cosmic rays with ∼ 45 % efficiency. Comparisons of this data to galactic cosmic ray proton fluxes obtained from the Advanced Composition Explorer yield agreement to within 10 % and reveal the expected solar cycle modulation as well as shorter timescale variations. Solar energetic particles were detected by the same mechanism as galactic cosmic rays; however, their flux levels are far more uncertain due to shielding effects and the energy-dependent response of the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates.</b> Using the solar energetic particle data, we have developed a catalog of energetic particle events at Mars associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which includes the identification of interplanetary shocks.
