To improve applicability of fully automated sleep staging, we have designed a formal classification framework to rigorously (1) select robust candidate features, (2) emulate {{artificial neural network}} classifiers, and (3) assign sleep-wake stages using flexible decision rules. An extensive database of 48 PSG records scored in 20 s epochs by two independent clinicians was used. A small subset of 2 s elementary epochs representative of each stages with unequivocal expert scores was selected to form a limited set of learning exemplars.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} artificial intelligence for diagnosing the condition of high voltage bushings. The techniques include neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy set theory, particle swarm optimisation, multi-classifier systems, factor analysis, principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, data-fusion techniques, automatic relevance determination and autoencoders. The classification is done using Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data based on field experience together with criteria from IEEEc 57. 104 and IEC 60599. A review of current literature showed that common methods for the diagnosis of bushings are: partial discharge, DGA, tan- (dielectric dissipation factor), water content in oil, dielectric strength of oil, acidity level (neutralisation value), visual analysis of sludge in suspension, colour of the oil, furanic content, degree of polymerisation (DP), strength of the insulating paper, interfacial tension or oxygen content tests. All the methods have limitations {{in terms of time}} and accuracy in decision making. The fact that making decisions using each of these methods individually is highly subjective, also the huge size of the data base of historical data, as well as the loss of skills due to retirement of experienced technical staff, highlights the need for an automated diagnosis tool that integrates information from the many sensors and recalls the historical decisions and learns from new information. Three classifiers that are compared in this analysis are radial basis functions (RBF), <b>multiple</b> <b>layer</b> <b>perceptrons</b> (MLP) and support vector machines (SVM). In this work 60699 bushings were classified based on ten criteria. Classification was done based on a majority vote.

The work also proposes the application of fuzzy set theory (FST) to diagnose the condition of high voltage bushings. The relevance and redundancy detection methods were able to prune the redundant measured variables and accurately diagnose the condition of the bushing with fewer variables. Experimental results from bushings that were evaluated in the field verified the simulations.

Since ana-log implementations of <b>layered</b> <b>perceptrons</b> perform quite fast in comparison with their digital counterparts, this is indeed unfortunate.

ASAMC is compared with simulated annealing, SAMC, and the BFGS algorithm for training MLPs on a number of examples. The numerical results indicate that ASAMC outperforms the other algorithms in both training and test errors.

40|$|Abstract—A common {{approach}} to pattern classification prob-lems is to train {{a bank of}} <b>layered</b> <b>perceptrons</b> or other classifiers by clustering the input training data and training each classifier with just the data from a specific cluster. There is no provision in such an approach, however, to assure the component <b>layered</b> <b>perceptron</b> is well suited to learn the training data cluster it is assigned. An alternate method of training, herein proposed, lets a <b>layered</b> <b>perceptron</b> in a classifier bank choose the cluster of inputs it processes {{on the basis of}} the perceptron’s ability to successfully classify those inputs. During training, data is therefore processed only by the classifier in the bank that best classifies the data or, equivalently, to which the data is most receptive. This allows each classifier to learn a localized subset of data dictated by the classifier’s own classification ability. Once each classifier in the bank is trained, a separate independent cluster pointer is trained to recognize to which cluster an input test pattern belongs. The cluster pointer is used in the test mode to identify which classifier in the bank will best classify the problem. The approach, also applicable to regression type problems, is illustrated through application on a simulated Gaussian data set and an active sonar test estimation problem. In both cases, the maximally receptive classifer/regression bank significantly outperforms a single <b>layered</b> <b>perceptron</b> trained on the same data...|$|R
