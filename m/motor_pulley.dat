40|$|Abstract−The {{effects of}} flow rates {{of hot air}} and cooling water on drying {{percentage}} and energy efficiency of cotton lint in a cylindrical type drum tumbler dryer (0. 54 m-ID× 0. 34 m-high) have been determined. Drying of the lint is mainly affected by flow rate of hot air, which {{is a function of}} the diameter ratio (D M /D F) of <b>motor</b> and fan <b>pulley</b> and <b>motor</b> capacity. During the drying process in the tumbler dryer, temperatures and humidity before and after were measured to determine the drying characteristics.

To cool, the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit's sides and through the damp pads.

40|$|Abstract — Means of {{vertical}} transportation, for both people and other loads, have been employed by mankind since ancient times. In early agricultural societies, these devices relied on men, animal or water power {{to lift the}} load. Rudimentary rope and pulley arrangements were used to support and move the required weight. The Industrial Revolution brought with it a number of technological advancements. Machine power allowed for fast developments and safety systems were introduced. In 1880, the first electric motor was used to power a lift. Led by ever growing needs in the industry, with the necessity of moving great amounts of raw materials {{and the introduction of}} steel beam construction and increasingly taller buildings, lift technology evolved rapidly.

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International Apart from {{enabling}} continuous ratio change under load, the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) offers, between limits, {{the ability}} to choose engine rotational speed independently of vehicle speed. Here lies a potential efficiency benefit, because the engine can operate more fuel efficiently. There are unfortunately considerable power losses within the CVT itself, causing many CVT equipped cars to be less fuel-efficient than cars with a manual transmission. The internal losses are caused for a substantial part by the CVT’s hydraulic actuation. An electromechanical CVT pulley actuation system was designed to overcome the hydraulic power loss and hence improve CVT efficiency. Spindles are driven from the fixed world through epicyclic gearings by electric motors that are placed outside the transmission housing in a cool environment. A mechanical link between the adjustment mechanisms on the two shafts provides energy exchange, thus lowering shifting power demand and actuator size. Because of this, only one electric <b>motor</b> actuates <b>pulley</b> movement on both shafts for ratio change. A second actuator keeps the belt tensioned and controls belt clamping force. A high degree of independency between ratio- and clamping force actuation can be established. A prototype {{was designed as a}} modification on a commercially available belt type CVT, which is currently in the realization phase. After trials on a test rig, the transmission will be built in to a vehicle to further evaluate the new concept...|$|R

Efficiency of systems is affected by problems like friction, {{which is also a}} major problem for energy consumption in the world. In a pulley system consisting of an electric <b>motor,</b> fixed <b>pulleys</b> and a load; “Does changing the number of pulleys in a pulley system affect friction and hence efficiency of the system to alter?” question is tested. The experiment was made in two parts. First, revolutions per minute (rev/min – rpm) pattern of the electric motor was plotted on a graph. After deciding the voltage for second part, the effect of friction on the efficiency of the pulley systems was investigated. For that, the number of pulleys attached to the system was increased step by step and how high (meters) the 0. 1 kg mass is pulled in 1 minute time by the electric motor is measured. Comparing theoretical height and measured height values gave the energy loss at the system. According to the law of conservation of energy that loss should be due to the effect of friction. So, the efficiency of the system was calculated using the data gathered.
