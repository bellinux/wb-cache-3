50|$|The engine's {{downfall}} was premature camshaft wear in {{some early}} models {{in both the}} V45 and V65. In retrospect, the wear was caused by inadequate oil flow to the heads/cams, driving {{for a long time}} on low engine speeds (under 3,000 rpm) and at cold start /engine warm-up procedure, non-accurate valve adjustment, and insufficient maintenance. But this came too late to save the engine's reputation. Honda itself at first denied there was a problem, then blamed inadequate or incorrect maintenance for the problem. They changed the <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval,</b> and developed and sold a special tool for 'proper' valve-lash adjustment.

40|$|Currently, lack of {{preventive}} measure {{is the problem}} that implicates poor maintenance outcome. Scheduled maintenance is claimed as a maintenance strategy to tackle the problem. However, the effectiveness of scheduled maintenance can be greatly influenced by the length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval.</b> Thus, this paper aims to study the relationship between length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> and maintenance performance. The literature review identifies the length of predetermined <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> as an importance characteristic of scheduled maintenance strategy.

40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} {{inspection and}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> optimization for a processing facility is proposed. Often {{inspection and maintenance}} activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> estimation modeling {{is available in the}} concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown inspection and maintenance modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing inspection and maintenance. This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an inspection and <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned inspection and maintenance strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally failure caused by wear or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective inspection and maintenance strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown inspection and maintenance optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown inspection and maintenance strategy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze {{periodic}} maintenance strategies for managing replicated objects in mobile wireless environments. Under periodical maintenance strategies, the system periodically checks local cells {{to determine if}} a replicated object should be allocated or deallocated in a cell to reduce the access cost. We develop a performance model based on Petri nets that considers the missing-read cost, write-propagation cost and the periodic maintenance cost with the objective to identify optimal periodic maintenance intervals to minimize the overall cost. The analysis results show that the overall cost is high when the user arrival-departure ratio and the read-write ratio work against each other and is low otherwise. In all cases, there exists an optimal periodic <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> that would yield the minimum cost. Further, the optimal periodic <b>maintenance</b> <b>interval</b> increases as the arrival-departure ratio and the read-write ratio work in harmony...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recent studies {{indicate}} that in both normal and pathological aging working memory (WM) performance deteriorates, especially when associations have to be maintained. However, most studies typically do not assess the relationship between WM and episodic memory formation. In the present study, we examined WM and episodic memory formation in normal aging and in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (mild cognitive impairment, MCI; and Alzheimer’s dementia, AD). Method: In the first study, 26 young adults (mean age 29. 6 years) were compared to 18 middle-aged adults (mean age 52. 2 years) and 25 older adults (mean age 72. 8 years). We used an associative delayed-match-to-sample WM task, which requires participants to maintain two pairs of faces and houses presented {{on a computer screen}} for short (3 s) or long (6 s) <b>maintenance</b> <b>intervals.</b> After the WM task, an unexpected subsequent associative memory task was administered (two-alternative forced choice). In the second study, 27 patients with AD and 19 patients with MCI were compared to 25 older controls, using the same paradigm as that in Experiment 1. Results: Older adults performed worse than both middle-aged and young adults. No effect of delay was observed in the healthy adults, and pairs that were processed during long <b>maintenance</b> <b>intervals</b> were not better remembered in the subsequent memory task. In the MCI and AD patients, longer <b>maintenance</b> <b>intervals</b> hampered the task performance. Also, both patient groups performed significantly worse than controls on the episodic memory task as well as the associative WM task. Conclusions: Aging and AD present with a decline in WM binding, a finding that extends similar results in episodic memory. Longer delays in the WM task did not affect episodic memory formation. We conclude that WM deficits are found when WM capacity is exceeded, which may occur during associative processing...|$|R
