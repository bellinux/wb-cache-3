5|$|Bike <b>maneuverability</b> and {{handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between <b>maneuverability</b> and stability.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently desirable, {{but no one}} could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat <b>maneuverability.</b> Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic <b>maneuverability</b> at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago {{illustrates}} the poor <b>maneuverability</b> of wheels {{by comparing the}} turning radii of walking and wheelchair-using humans. As Jared Diamond points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, {{including the use of}} rolling by dung beetles and tumbleweeds.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} <b>maneuverability,</b> the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 the Mirage IIIS fleet, nearing 20 {{years of}} {{operational}} service, began a major upgrade program {{to improve the}} capabilities of the aircraft. The interceptors were retro-fitted with canards manufactured by Israeli Aircraft Industries on the air intakes to improve <b>maneuverability</b> and stability at landing speeds, new avionics and countermeasures, and redesignated the Mirage IIIS C.70.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April NVA rockets hit Saigon and Cholon for {{the first}} time since the 1973 ceasefire. It was decided that from this time only C-130s would be used for the {{evacuation}} due to their greater <b>maneuverability.</b> There was relatively little difference between the cargo loads of the two aircraft, C-141s had been loaded with up to 316 evacuees while C-130s had been taking off with in excess of 240.|$|E
5|$|The {{long black}} and white tail fin can be up {{to a third of}} body length. Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher <b>maneuverability</b> afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its <b>maneuverability.</b> Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} head, {{with a pair}} of large {{compound}} eyes, and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking (mosquitoes, black flies and robber flies), or for lapping and sucking in the other groups. Their wing arrangement gives them great <b>maneuverability</b> in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their source of their food. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} <b>maneuverability,</b> the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the weather deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average speed with oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack <b>maneuverability</b> at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the factory stock tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve <b>maneuverability.</b> For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, which gave the ships excellent <b>maneuverability.</b> The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The La-7 {{ended the}} superiority in {{vertical}} <b>maneuverability</b> that the Messerschmitt Bf 109G had previously enjoyed over other Soviet fighters. Furthermore, it was fast enough at low altitudes to catch, albeit with some difficulties, Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers that attacked Soviet units on the frontlines and immediately returned to German-controlled airspace at full speed. The Yakovlev Yak-3 and the Yakovlev Yak-9U with the Klimov VK-107 engine lacked {{a large enough}} margin of speed to overtake the German raiders. 115 La-7s were lost in air combat, only half the number of Yak-3s.|$|E
5|$|The U-1-class design {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two variable pitch propellers. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that, in theory, could allow travel over the seabed. The design also placed the diving tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. The propulsion system for the U-1 class consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged. For underwater steering and <b>maneuverability,</b> the design featured four pairs of diving planes.|$|E
5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} <b>maneuverability</b> as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target as rapidly as possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the data processing problem.|$|E
5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior <b>maneuverability,</b> the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} <b>maneuverability</b> was his advance into Roman Syria. Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into Syria, towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the waterless Syrian desert, to the surprise of the Byzantines, he appeared in northern Syria. Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and <b>maneuverability.</b> Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and countermeasures. Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the action began, with Pitot's stern chasers opening fire upon Constellation. In an effort to cut the American frigate's {{advantage}} in speed, La Vengeance changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a broadside aimed at Constellations rigging. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the weather gage. Now having {{the advantage of the}} wind, Truxton's opening double-shotted broadside slammed into the port side of La Vengeances hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other {{for two and a half}} hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a raking fire position. As the French tended to aim for the rigging, at one point Constellations foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her <b>maneuverability</b> until they could be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and <b>maneuverability,</b> running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Vildanden {{announced}} {{it plans to}} operate routes to Trondheim Airport, Værnes, but lacks financial <b>maneuverability</b> to commence operations. By October 2009, Vildanden owed Kontorbygg, the operator of Geiteryggen, NOK1.5 million in airport fees. Kontorbygg stated that if Vildanden did not pay, the airport would have to file for bankruptcy. Innovation Norway rejected to give Vildanden a loan for NOK3.5 million in December 2009. Kontorbygg stated that the operation of Geiteryggen had cost the municipality NOK50 million {{in the course of}} the five years Vildanden had been operating from it. In February 2010, the Municipality of Skien announced that it required Vildanden to pay back the NOK3.1 million, plus NOK200,000 in interest, that they borrowed in 2007. The loan was renewed in March, after Vildanden paid NOK385,000. From 16 August, Helitrans took over as the operator, using an ATR 42. From 6 September, the company started with flights to Trondheim. The company ceased operations after its last flight on 14 January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her <b>maneuverability,</b> allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their <b>maneuverability,</b> from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
5|$|The 10-month 767 {{flight test}} program {{utilized}} {{the first six}} aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its <b>maneuverability</b> unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, {{land and water}} vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and <b>maneuverability.</b> The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. The player can control five craft: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, snowspeeder and V-wing. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, {{as well as}} varying degrees of speed and <b>maneuverability.</b> The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Levels set on non-atmospheric moons expose the player's craft to space; thus disallowing the Speeder and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being used; but as on other levels, the craft is vertically confined. Nine bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} most {{damaging}} attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded {{on the port}} side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost <b>maneuverability</b> and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor <b>maneuverability.</b> In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 1966, General McConnell {{ordered that}} a {{specialized}} CAS aircraft be designed, developed, and obtained; on 22 December, a Requirements Action Directive (RAD) was issued for the A-X CAS airplane, and the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office was formed. On 6 March 1967, the Air Force released {{a request for}} information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X. The objective {{was to create a}} design study for a low-cost attack aircraft. In 1969, the Secretary of the Air Force asked Pierre Sprey to write the detailed specifications for the proposed A-X project; Sprey's initial involvement was kept secret due to his earlier controversial involvement in the F-X project. Sprey's discussions with Skyraider pilots operating in Vietnam and analysis of aircraft used in the role indicated the ideal aircraft should have long loiter time, low-speed <b>maneuverability,</b> massive cannon firepower, and extreme survivability; possessing the best elements of the Ilyushin Il-2, Henschel Hs 129, and Skyraider. The specifications also demanded that each aircraft cost less than $3million. Sprey required that the biography of World War II Luftwaffe attack pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel be read by people on the A-X program.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{immediately}} planned another {{foray into}} the North Sea, but the damage to Seydlitz delayed the operation {{until the end of}} May. The II Battle Squadron—possessing the weakest battleships involved in the battle, and under-strength owing to the absence of , guarding the mouth of the Elbe, and , worn out and removed from active service—was positioned {{at the rear of the}} German line. Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that resulted the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. Upon realizing that the German fleet was coming into range, Beatty turned his ships back toward the Grand Fleet. Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the retreating battleships of the British 5th Battle Squadron at top speed. Deutschland and the other pre-dreadnoughts were significantly slower than the dreadnoughts, and quickly fell behind. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet's <b>maneuverability</b> was severely hampered by the presence of the pre-dreadnoughts; if Scheer ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have to sacrifice the slower ships to make good his escape.|$|E
5|$|Sharon ordered Matt to push northward to Serabaeum again, where paratroopers of the 81st Battalion were occupying defenses. The attack failed once more, and Sharon now sent Reshef on Matt's left flank. Using a {{battalion}} of some thirty tanks with mechanized infantry, Reshef used his superior <b>maneuverability</b> to flank the Egyptian position. There was heavy, close-quarter fighting in the trenches, and extra units were brought up against the Orcha position. The paratroopers reported their defenses to have been penetrated during the afternoon, and they later withdrew after detonating the bridges over the Sweetwater Canal at Serabaeum. The Israelis captured Egyptian positions in the area, and discovered that Orcha Hill contained a major Egyptian radio intercept station. The capture of Orcha caused the collapse of Egyptian defenses in the area; the paratroopers pulled back {{to the village of}} Ain Ghasin five kilometres north, and Azmy ordered the 89th Battalion to withdraw to the adjacent Touscan strong point, abandoning the ramparts at Serabaeum. These were occupied by the Israelis, which they used to fire on Egyptian positions across the canal. The Egyptians hastily organised defenses at Touscan. This new line of defenses was just over 12 kilometres south of Ismailia.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} led by Hernando Pizarro, the senior Spanish {{commander}} in Cusco, with a force of 100Spaniards (30infantry, 70cavalry) and an estimated 30,000 native allies. One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power, <b>maneuverability,</b> speed, and stamina over Inca warriors. All Spaniards wore some kind of armor, {{the most commonly used}} types were chain mail shirts and padded cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields. The main Spanish offensive weapon was the steel sword, which horsemen supplemented with the lance; both weapons could easily penetrate the padded armor worn by Inca troops. Firearms, such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce, hard to use, and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon. Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies. These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts. During the Ollantaytambo campaign, the Pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries, mainly Cañaris, Chachapoyas, and Wankas as well as several members of the Inca nobility opposed to Manco Inca.|$|E
5|$|Though Sachsen entered {{service in}} 1878, she only participated in one annual fleet exercise, in 1880, before all four ships were {{assigned}} to the 1884 maneuvers. This was due to the poor performance of Sachsen in the 1880 maneuvers and the negative reputation of the class. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor <b>maneuverability.</b> The four ships served rotations with the fleet for the next two years, though in 1886, all four were demobilized as the Reserve Division in the Baltic. Aside from the Sachsens half-sister , the German Navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until the late 1880s when the first of the s were laid down. The poor performance of the sortie corvettes, coupled with the rise of the Jeune École, led Leo von Caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|The elite hypaspistai infantry, {{composed}} of handpicked {{men from the}} ranks of the pezhetairoi and perhaps synonymous with earlier doryphoroi, were formed during the reign of Philip II and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great. Philip II was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes) and royal pages (basilikoi paides). Philip II was also able to field archers, including mercenary Cretan archers and perhaps some native Macedonians. It is unclear if the Thracians, Paionians, and Illyrians fighting as javelin throwers, slingers, and archers serving in Macedonian armies from the reign of Philip II onward were conscripted as allies via a treaty or were simply hired mercenaries. Philip II hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army. The increase in state revenues allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes. Although it did not succeed in every battle, the army of Philip II was able to successfully adopt the military tactics of its enemies, such as the embolon (i.e. 'flying wedge') formation of the Scythians. This offered cavalry far greater <b>maneuverability</b> and an edge in battle that previously did not exist in the Classical Greek world.|$|E
