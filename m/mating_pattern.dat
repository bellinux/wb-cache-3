It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous <b>mating</b> <b>pattern.</b> A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus.

500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of scleractinian taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies. [...] In temperate regions, the usual pattern is synchronized release of eggs and sperm into the water during brief spawning events, often related to the phases of the moon. In tropical regions, reproduction may occur throughout the year. In many cases, as in the genus Acropora, the eggs and sperm are released in buoyant bundles which rise to the surface. This increases the concentration of sperm and eggs and thus the likelihood of fertilization, and {{reduces the risk of}} self-fertilization. [...] Immediately after spawning, the eggs are delayed in their capability for fertilization until after the release of polar bodies. [...] This delay, and possibly some degree of self-incompatibility, likely increases the chance of cross-fertilization. [...] A study of four species of Scleractinia found that cross-fertilization was actually the dominant <b>mating</b> <b>pattern,</b> although three of the species were also capable of self-fertilization to varying extents.|$|E
40|$|While habitat {{fragmentation}} is {{a central}} issue in forest conservation studies {{in the face of}} broad-scale anthropogenic changes to the environment, its effects on contemporary <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> remain controversial. This is partly because of the inherent variation in <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> which may exist within species and the fact that few studies have replication at the landscape level. To study the effect of forest fragmentation on contemporary <b>mating</b> <b>patterns,</b> including effective pollen dispersal, we compared four native populations of the Australian forest tree, Eucalyptus globulus. We used six microsatellite markers to genotype 1289 open-pollinated offspring from paired fragmented and continuous populations on the island of Tasmania and in Victoria on mainland Australia. The <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> in the two continuous populations were similar, despite large differences in population density.

However, for dry provenances, fitness was negatively related to correlated paternity, while for mesic provenances, fitness was correlated positively with outcrossing rate and negatively with correlated paternity.

40|$|Bryophytes, {{by their}} haploid {{dominant}} life cycle, possess several unique qualities ideal for study of <b>mating</b> <b>patterns.</b> In particular, {{the possibility of}} intragametophytic selfing in some species, and the vegetative propagation of gametes allow for a unique window into the haploid stage that is intractable in other groups. Despite these advantages, there have been relatively few studies on <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> bryophytes in natural populations. Sphagnum (peatmoss) is an excellent case study in the interactions between sexual condition, ecology, and <b>mating</b> <b>patterns.</b> In the first Chapter, we use microsatellites to characterize the genetic diversity and <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> in fourteen species of Sphagnum, diverse in sexual condition (separate vs combined sexes in the haploid stage) and ecology (microhabitat variance along the water table). We find that genetic diversity and <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> are related only in species with separate sexes, that sexual condition and ecology have interacting effects on inbreeding coefficients, and that inbreeding depression is not a common phenomenon in Sphagnum. In the second Chapter, we conduct an intensive survey of one population of Sphagnum macrophyllum, to detect whether variance in haploid fecundity and mating success is related to diploid fitness. We find a relationship between mating success and fecundity (a signal of sexual selection), and fitness of the diploid generation {{is connected to the}} parentage of the haploid generation. Finally, in Chapter 3 we use phylogenetic comparative methods to track the phylogenetic signal in microhabitat preference in Sphagnum. We find extremely fast rates of evolution along the micronutrient gradient, but high phylogenetic signal along a hydrological gradient. Given that Sphagnum species living high above the water table have reduced water availability, phylogenetic signal in the hydrological gradient has macroevolutionary implications for mating systems in Sphagnum.

50|$|Assortative mating is a <b>mating</b> <b>pattern</b> and a form {{of sexual}} {{selection}} in which individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under a random <b>mating</b> <b>pattern.</b> Examples of similar phenotypes include, {{but are not limited}} to, body size, skin coloration/pigmentation, and age. Assortative mating, also referred to as positive assortative mating or homogamy, may increase genetic relatedness within the family. Assortative mating can be contrasted with disassortative mating (also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy) in which individuals with dissimilar genotypes and/or phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the genetic similarities within the family. Positive assortative mating occurs more frequently than negative assortative mating. In both cases, due to the nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>pattern,</b> there is a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences).|$|E

40|$|ReviewThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this record. Wildlife {{diseases}} are emerging at a higher rate than ever before meaning that understanding their potential impacts is essential, especially for those species and populations that may already be of conservation concern. The link between population genetic structure and the resistance of populations to disease is well understood: high genetic diversity allows populations to better cope with environmental changes, including the outbreak of novel diseases. Perhaps following this common wisdom, numerous empirical and theoretical studies have investigated the link between disease and disassortative <b>mating</b> <b>patterns,</b> which can increase genetic diversity. Few however have looked at the possible link between disease and the establishment of assortative <b>mating</b> <b>patterns.</b> Given that assortative mating can reduce genetic variation within a population thus reducing the adaptive potential and long-term viability of populations, we suggest that this link deserves greater attention, particularly in those species already threatened by a lack of genetic diversity. Here, we summarise the potential broad scale genetic implications of assortative <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> and outline how infection by pathogens or parasites might bring them about. We include a review of the empirical literature pertaining to disease-induced assortative mating. We also suggest future directions and methodological improvements that could advance our understanding of how the link between disease and <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> influences genetic variation and long-term population viability.

We found that males experienced strong sexual selection on tail height and body size, while sexual selection was undetectable in females.

Specifically, males (in comparison with females) exhibited greater standardized variances in reproductive and mating success, as well as a stronger relationship between mating success and reproductive success. Overall, our results illustrate that Bateman's principles provide the only quantitative measures of the mating system with explicit connections to formal selection theory and should be the central focus of studies of <b>mating</b> <b>patterns</b> in natural populations...|$|R

We found that parental and introgressed X. birchmanni females mated multiply with both parental and introgressed males.
