50|$|Calculating <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> {{is often}} {{regulated}} by legislatures, {{but may be}} litigated {{in a court of}} equity. <b>Mesne</b> <b>profits</b> may be calculated, even though there may be no point in doing so (as in the case where land was flooded by a dam, and the dam {{is not going to be}} removed). In the United States, laws regulating <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> have been the subject of Supreme Court decisions, such as Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. 1 (1823).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mesne</b> <b>profits</b> are profits {{derived from}} land while in {{wrongful}} possession, {{and may be}} claimed in damages for trespass, either in a separate action or joined with an action for {{the recovery of the}} land. The plaintiff must prove that he has re-entered into possession, his title during the period for which he claims, the fact that the defendant has been in possession during that period, and the amount of the <b>mesne</b> <b>profits.</b> The amount recovered as <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> need not be limited to the rental value of the land, but may include a sum to cover such items as deterioration or reasonable costs of getting possession.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesne</b> <b>profits</b> {{commonly}} occur where {{a landlord}} has obtained {{an order from}} a court to evict a tenant, or where an individual sues to eject a bona fide landowner to whom title to land was improperly conveyed. The mesne profit represents the value (living rent-free, profits earned from the land, etc.) the ejected tenant received from the property between the time the court ordered the eviction and {{the time when the}} tenant actually left the property. <b>Mesne</b> <b>profits</b> must be drawn from the land itself, rather than improvements on it. For example, <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> may accrue from growing crops on land but would not generally accrue from a factory built on the land (unless there were damage to the land or improvements to the land itself such as the removal of stone from a field).|$|E
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{had obtained}} judgment for recovery of possession of land, <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> and costs, and the defendant had made application {{to have the}} judgment set aside.|$|E
50|$|By law, {{trespass}} for <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> is a {{suit against}} {{someone who has been}} ejected from property that did not belong to them. The suit is for recovery of damages the trespasser caused to the property and for any profits he or she may have made while in possession of that property.|$|E

5000|$|The income {{derived from}} land unlawfully {{held by the}} possessor, {{for which he is}} {{answerable}} to the true owner when the latter recovers the land from him by the judgment of a court. The Talmud speaks of the possessor of land without right as the [...] "robber of the land" [...] (in English law, [...] "disseizor"); and he, or even a third person who takes fruits or branches from land thus withheld from the true owner, is considered as morally guilty of robbery (see the prohibition of an Israelite using, in the ritual thyrsus on the Feast of Booths, a palm-branch or citron taken from land held by a disseizor iv. 1, 2). The liability to pay <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> is implied and rather distantly indicated in the Mishnah (Giṭ. v. 2). Assuming that he who sells land with warranty is liable not only for the price of the land which he receives, but also for the <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> which the purchaser will have to pay after eviction to the true owner, it is here taught that from motives of public policy the warranty inserted in the deed of sale, though in the nature of a bond, is to be levied, as far as it secures the purchaser against this liability, only upon [...] "free property," [...] not on [...] "subjected property," [...] i.e., on lands which in the meanwhile have been given away, sold, or encumbered (for the distinction see Deed). The Gemara (B. M. 14a, b) discusses this matter fully {{in the light of the}} warranty, the liability of the unlawful possessor being taken for granted (see Maimonides, [...] "Yad," [...] Gezelah, ch. xiv.).|$|E
40|$|It {{has always}} been the law of {{trespass}} <b>mesne</b> <b>profits</b> to an oil and gas estate that a trespasser is liable for the value of the oil and gas that it has produced from the estate to which it trespasses. That value is determined after ascertaining whether the trespasser held an honest belief that he or she had the right to produce oil or gas from the estate upon which it trespassed. In those cases, the trespasser is said to have trespassed in good faith. Conversely, the trespasser acts in bad faith when it knowingly produces oil and gas without the right to do so. The rule is couched subjectively {{from the perspective of the}} trespasser and not from the view of a reasonable person in the same position as the trespasser...|$|E
40|$|Normally a lessee {{encounters}} few if {{any legal}} difficulties in gaining possession of the leased premises on the date his term begins. If, however, a prior tenant or other person in possession prevents the lessee from taking possession, the latter must bring an action against either the lessor or the occupier to obtain relief. The {{purpose of this article}} is to examine the remedies available in Nebraska to the lessee who seeks (1) to obtain possession of the demised premises and (2) to obtain damages for the time he was denied possession.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the history and}} contemporaneous common law position on the recovery of opportunity costs associated with money sums which are paid late or otherwise withheld from proper payment by defendants. Economics and finance define opportunity cost as 2 ̆ 7 the next most profitable employment of an asset 2 ̆ 7, but this definition has only recently been recognised in Australian courts. Since {{the formation of the}} common law in the post-Conquest era, opportunity costs have not been recognised in litigation as recoverable losses. In contrast, opportunity costs have been recognised by courts when associated with tangible assets such as land or goods through the action of <b>mesne</b> <b>profits.</b> The origin of the dichotomy stems from the religious influence of the church during the crucial formation period of the common law, coupled with the view that lending at interest in any form was the hateful sin of usury. The use of clerics as judges and the monopoly which the church enjoyed over the instruments of learning gave the church unmistakeable and plenary power over the common law processes, a power which is seen through the rules of both evidence and law which permeated early courts and lingers within the modem common law courts. The dichotomy of treatment between real assets and money was entrenched through the doctrine of stare decisis in the seminal 1829 case of Page v Newman which became known for the principle that no common law court had the power to award interest on an overdue sum of money in the absence of clear contractual terms or recognition of trade practice such as bills of exchange. This hindered commercial practice in Europe and England for centuries, stifling enterprise and subjecting plaintiffs to systemic injustice from unscrupulous defendants. This thesis assigns a stipulative definition of 2 ̆ 7 classification dilemma 2 ̆ 7 to the divergent common law treatment of the opportunity costs of assets and money. This dilemma existed until partially resolved by the High Court of Australia in 1989 through the case of ii Hungerfords v Walker, which recognized the common law action for the loss of the use of money. The religious legacy, however, still lingers through the evidential burden and the rules of 2 ̆ 7 remoteness 2 ̆ 7 which influence the recovery of damages in the litigious process, for Christianity formed {{an integral part of the}} common law from the formation period. Therefore, the fundamental methodology of the common law is antithetical in many respects to the commercial paradigm of economics and finance...|$|E
