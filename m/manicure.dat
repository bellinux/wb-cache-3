5|$|On May 3, 1917, the Brewers {{traveled}} to Indianapolis and defeated the team there {{to improve their}} win-loss record to 7–8. Shay visited a local tavern that night and had some drinks. The tavern owner took Shay to a beauty parlor and introduced him to its owner, Gertrude Anderson. Anderson gave Shay a <b>manicure</b> and accompanied him to the Hotel English. Shay complained to busboy Eugene Jones about the placement of sugar bowls at his table. Clarence Euell, a black waiter at the cafe, came to address Shay's concern. An argument ensued during which Shay pulled out a gun and shot Euell in the abdomen. Euell wrestled Shay to the ground, pressing his foot down on Shay's head.|$|E

50|$|French <b>manicures</b> are {{designed}} to resemble natural nails, and are characterized by natural pink base nails with white tips. French <b>manicures</b> {{were one of the}} first popular and well known color schemes. French <b>manicures</b> may have originated in the eighteenth-century in Paris but were most popular in the 1920s and 1930s. One updated trend involves painting different colors as the tips of the nails instead of the basic white. French tip nails can be made with stickers, stencils or with a basic toothpick.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>manicures</b> {{can include}} the {{painting}} of pictures or designs on the nails, or applying small decals or imitation jewels. Other nail treatments may include the application of artificial nail gel nails, tips, or acrylics, {{some of which are}} referred to as French <b>manicures.</b>|$|R
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a <b>Manicure</b> is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|Finally in August 1921, {{the coroner}} {{released}} {{the body for}} burial after a woman identified him as her son who she had sent off to a farm 18 years earlier and had never seen again. The police and newspaper reporters never explained {{the fact that the}} stranger, although dressed in rags, recently had had a professional <b>manicure</b> and was closely shaven. The man had no money on him to pay for such luxuries and the $1.25 paid to him by Wanderer for food and car fare would not have covered these services either.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the early}} {{department}} stores were {{more than just a}} retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a <b>manicure.</b> The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.|$|E

25|$|When {{making the}} {{character}} Clamp thought three patterns of conduct for her. The character was not fully decided until meeting her model. When meeting the beautician {{that made the}} artists' <b>manicure,</b> {{it was decided that}} Yūko would have the beautician's strong personality. However, there are no physical similarities between Yūko and her model. The artists had problems in designing the character, as it took them a long time to make her facial expressions. In choosing Sayaka Ohara as Yūko's Japanese voice actress, Clamp made a research to find a voice actress who was not heavily associated with another character. In the English dubbed series, she is voiced by and Colleen Clinkenbeard in English.|$|E
25|$|In {{a change}} to format, the final {{involved}} the Interviews that candidates undertook, though these included a scrutinising of the candidates' business plans as well. Thomas Pellereau became Lord Sugar's first business partner, whereupon {{he used his}} prize to launch a range of <b>manicure</b> products with assistance from Lord Sugar, including a line of curved nail files - the S-file, the S-Buffer and the Emergency File, two curved nail clippers, the S-Clipper and S-Clipper mini and a curved foot exfoliator, and the S-Ped - which were made available with major retailers in the country. While Susan Ma failed to win the series, Lord Sugar admitted he liked her plan, later investing into her skincare company Tropic in 2012.|$|E

500|$|The {{society was}} officially formed in January 1935 to lead {{wilderness}} preservation in the United States. [...] Additional founding members included notable conservationists Bob Marshall, Benton MacKaye, Bernard Frank, Aldo Leopold, and Harvey Broome. [...] In September, Yard published {{the first issue}} of the society's magazine, The Living Wilderness. [...] He wrote of the society's genesis, [...] "The Wilderness Society is born of an emergency in conservation which admits of no delay. [...] The craze is to build all the highways possible everywhere while billions may yet be borrowed from the unlucky future. [...] The fashion is to barber and <b>manicure</b> wild America as smartly as the modern girl. [...] Our mission is clear." ...|$|E

[...] The location was developed as a two-story [...] flagship location that was unveiled with dignitaries such as Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Governor Pat Quinn on January 12, 2012, selling a range of amenities far beyond that of a typical pharmacy. Some of the features included a cigar humidor, international newsstand, made-to-order smoothies, self-serve frozen yogurt, sushi and juice bars, a barista, over 700 fine wines, and <b>manicure</b> stations. The Walgreens investment was part of a business strategy to combat governmentally-induced declining pharmacy margins.|$|E

Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep my hair fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if her man comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'"

Then Stefani, accompanied by her Harajuku Girls, receive a <b>manicure</b> at a beauty salon while various couples kiss in their seats and check their cellphones. In the next sequence, she's styling her hair and applying cosmetics {{in front of a}} mirror while her roommates along with the Harajuku girls dance behind her and a couple makeout on the bed. She then applies rhinestones near her eyes, lip-liner, mascara and shows off gold jewelry with her name carved on it. During his rap, Slim Thug appears in sequences with either Stefani or two Harajuku Girls. It concludes with Stefani joining her friends in a block party, where they celebrate with breakdancing and a barbecue. The video is intercut with sequences of Stefani breaking open piñatas and lying on a candy-covered floor, styled in a fashion resembling Mexican painter Frida Kahlo.|$|E
500|$|... "One of Those Days" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song with}} a [...] "slight retro feel" [...] to it. Chuck Taylor of Billboard {{classified}} the song as a [...] "groovy, hip-swaying composition". The song's hook samples the melody from The Isley Brothers' 1983 song [...] "Between the Sheets". As Houston begins the first verse, she declares her stress: [...] "This {{is just for}} me [...] Got to take time out [...] You don't know what I'm going through." [...] She then sings about getting away from it, by indulging in activities like a <b>manicure,</b> pedicure and by having a [...] "late-night snack, a bubble bathe and a massage". Throughout the song, she sings over a [...] "warm bed of beats and horns". Writing for Entertainment Tonight, Tim Jaramillo commented that the song is a [...] "smoky track with a feel-good, chilled-out vibe". Dan LeRoy of NJ Star Ledger observed that the song sounded like an outtake from Brandy Norwood's debut album, while New York Daily News compared it to Houston's 1999 song [...] "It's Not Right but It's Okay". An official remix of the song features rapped verses from Nelly, which according to MTV News staffs has a reggae feel.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] {{talks about}} females wanting to submissevely serve their male love {{interests}} {{and take care}} of them as they admire their hard work and are inspired by them. The trio further sings about the men of their lives {{and the way in which}} they will take care of them. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was written as a continuation on the previous song on Destiny Fulfilled, [...] "Soldier"; after the trio sings about finding a suitable lover in the aforementioned song, they express a will to cater to him in [...] "Cater 2 U". In the second edition of the book Introducing Cultural Studies, the authors argued that the song contained lyrics about objectification of women, which suggested that their gender role was to [...] "'keep herself up', 'keep it right', 'cater to' their man by providing him with his dinner, a foot rub, a <b>manicure,</b> fetching his slippers, and much more, on demand". An editor writing in The Times of India found a theme of feminine assertiveness in [...] "Cater 2 U"; he noted that [...] "the women come off not so much as lovers as full-service romantic servants". J. Freedom du Lac, a staff writer of The Washington Post wrote that the song's theme was supplication.|$|E
