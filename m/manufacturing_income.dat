Whereas GDP growth lacks cyclical movements and appears to be dominated by trend and irregular movements, in contrast to GDP, CEI works well as a measure of cyclical dynamics and can contribute to the analysis of short term fluctuations of Chinese economic activity relative to its long term growth. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{offshoring}} has ignited a contentious debate over {{its impact on the}} US labor market. Between 1983 and 2002, the United States economy lost 6 million jobs in <b>manufacturing</b> and <b>income</b> inequality increased sharply [Ebenstein, 2011]. Today due to the falling costs of transportation, coordination and communication this tendency is accelerating affecting both white and blue collar workers. While there many papers that analyze the productivity increase due to offshoring practices [Mitra, 2007], [Global Insight, 2004], [Houseman, 2010], most of them just assume that this improvement is automatically translated into lower prices therefore benefiting consumers. Nevertheless this assumption only holds in price competitive markets, which is not always the case. In this paper I will challenge the assumption of price competitive markets and argue how offshoring increases within-country income inequality. In addition I will analyze the aggregated effect of offshoring in the U. S. economy through both empirical and theoretical approaches. by Jorge Malibran. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The American {{university}} was shaped in a formative period from 1890 to 1940 {{long before the}} rise of federal funding, the G. I. Bill, and mass higher education. Both the scale and scope of {{institutions of higher education}} were greatly increased, the research university blossomed, states vastly increased their funding of higher education, and the public sector greatly expanded relative to the private sector. Independent professional institutions declined, as did theological institutes and denominational colleges in general. Increases in the scale and scope of institutions of higher education were generated by exogenous changes in the that affected the professions generally and that of the clergy in particular. The increase in the share of students in the public sector may also have been prompted by these exogenous changes for they gave advantages to institutions, such as those in the public sector, that had research facilities, reputation, and a long purse. The high school movement, which swept parts of the country from 1910 to 1940, brought students from less privileged backgrounds to college and thus also buoyed enrollments in the public sector. States differed widely in their funding of higher education per capita and we find that greater generosity in 1929 was positively associated with later statehood, lower private college enrollments in 1900, greater shares of employment in mining and <b>manufacturing,</b> higher <b>income,</b> and a proxy for greater and more equally distributed wealth. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} claimed that {{multinational}} firms avoid taxes by shifting income from high-tax to low-tax countries. Using a five year panel of data for two hundred large U.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} economic liberalization on interregional inequality in India. It has been observed in many studies that interregional inequality in India has been steadily increasing over time. This paper is a further confirmation of this result. We have tried to locate the cause of rising interregional inequality within the production structure {{of the economy and}} observed that it is positively and systematically related to the cross-regional inequalities in agriculture and manufacturing. This systematic relationship has further been examined from a structuralist viewpoint to unravel the factors determining manufacturing production across regions where we have found that trade openness is the key factor determining the <b>manufacturing</b> share in <b>income</b> across the regions. Our further enquiry into manufacturing and trade patterns has shown that the Herfindahl index of concentration has been increasing over time on both counts. This result, along with the findings of the structuralist model about disproportionate growth of manufacturing across regions, provides an explanation of the cause of rising interregional inequality in India.

40|$|The Pacific Northwest is {{naturally}} endowed with vast forest resources. Federal public lands {{are an important}} part of this forest base, providing a variety of commodities, uses, and services. Forest resources support consumptive and nonconsumptive, and commercial and noncommercial uses that also provide for a mix of employment opportunities. From the perspective of regional economic development, timber production has been one of the largest economic drivers in the Pacific Northwest over the past century, and it remains an important economic component in many parts of the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) area. The relative importance of forest resource-related employment and income in the Plan area’s economy has changed over time, as has the contribution of forest products from the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands to this mix. Between 1990 and 2000, employment grew by 29 percent in the 72 counties in the Plan area. During the same period, manufacturing grew by 3 percent, compared to 56 percent employment growth in the services sector. Most of the other major industries grew at rates varying between 23 and 32 percent (fig. 3 - 1). Exceptions were mining (16 percent) and agriculture (4 percent). The low growth in manufacturing meant that this sector went from providing 13 percent of total employment in 1990 to 11 percent in 2000. Meanwhile, the services industry increased from 25 to 30 percent of total employment during this same period. The employment shift from manufacturing to services was consistent with nationwide shifts.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between economic structure and energy intensity in selected developed and developing countries of the world. A methodological and systematic approach was adopted to select the thirty-one countries explored in the study. Therefore, to answer the research questions posed in the study, the Granger Causality Technique and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) method were used. This study discovered that the variables examined in the study showed variations. The variations emerged because of differences in methodologies and analytical frameworks adopted. Errorcorrection models were estimated and used to test for the direction of Granger causality. In the model, a high R 2 was observed among the six variables (i. e. energy efficiency, per capita <b>income,</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> average energy prices, energy imports, technological developments), which invariably account for 60. 8 {{percent of the variance in}} the energy intensity. Based on this, the unidirectional Granger causality runs from efficiency, per capita <b>income</b> and <b>manufacturing</b> to energy intensity. Hence, the price effects are relatively less significant in the causal chain. The result is at variance with the hypothesis that the structure of the economy does not determine its energy intensity. Nevertheless, a unidirectional Granger causality running from economic structure to energy intensity indicates that improvement in the economic structure would encourage a decline in energy intensity...|$|R

In particular, this is the case in the service sector. We divide the service sector into a tradable and a non-tradable part using an approach to identify tradable industries utilizing a measure of regional concentration of production. We examine whether the probability of displacement is higher and income losses after displacement greater for workers in tradable services and manufacturing (tradable) than in non-tradable services. We also analyze whether the probability of re-employment is higher for workers displaced from tradable services and manufacturing than from non-tradable services. We find that in the 2000 s the probability of displacement is relatively high in tradable services in comparison to non-tradable services and manufacturing. On the other hand, the probability of re-employment is higher for those displaced from tradable services. The largest income losses are found for those who had been displaced from <b>manufacturing.</b> Interestingly, the <b>income</b> losses of those displaced from manufacturing seems mainly to be due to longer spells of non-employment, whereas for those displaced in tradable services lower wages in their new jobs compared to their pre-displacement jobs appears to play a larger role.
