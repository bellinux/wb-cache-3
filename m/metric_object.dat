40|$|There is {{currently}} a puzzle in perception/action research on visually guided reaching and grasping. Many psycho-physical {{studies have demonstrated that}} human observ-ers cannot accurately perceive metric 3 -D shape, but we ordinarily have no difficulty in reaching for and grasping solid objects. The puzzle is that accurate reaches-to-grasp would appear to require accurate shape perception, be-cause grasping typically involves contact of the fingers with the back of an object. Grasps are known to be ac-curately sized relative to the size of an object as a hand approaches an object. When the grasp involves contact of thumb and fingers on the front and back of an object, re-spectively, then the specification of the relevant extent of the object (in depth) requires combined information about object size and shape. The shape can be characterized by the aspect ratio of object depth to width or by curvedness (Koenderink, 1990, pp. 319 – 324; Perotti, Todd, Lappin, & Phillips, 1998). Specification of the <b>metric</b> <b>object</b> size in the frontoparallel plane together with the aspect ratio (or the curvedness) would determine the <b>metric</b> <b>object</b> depth. How can information about 3 -D shape be determined ac-curately in order to permit accurate reaches-to-grasp? A solution is suggested by the collected results from studies on shape perception. One possible solution involves using feedback information from grasping to calibrate informa-tion about shape. A large number of shape perception studies have inves-tigated the relation between perceived shape and actual physical shape. Early studies began with single cues, such as binocular disparity or motion parallax. In monocular structure-from-motion studies (e. g., Norman & Lappin...|$|E

Existing models for spatial reasoning tend {{to rely on}} pre-identified cardinal directions and minimal scale variations, assumption that cannot be considered as given in our image applications, where orientations and scale may vary substantially, and are often unknown. Accordingly, we have developed the method of varying baselines to identify similarities in direction and distance relations. Our method allows us to evaluate directional similarities without a priori knowledge of cardinal directions, and to compare distance relations even when query scene and database content differ in scale by unknown amounts. We use our method to evaluate similarity between a user-defined query scene and object configurations. Here we present this new method, and discuss its role within a broader image retrieval framework...|$|E

In particular, I present three application domains to facilitate long-term simulation of dynamic worlds within that project. First, MORSE is employed in a continuous integration and testing framework helping to ensure high code quality, not only on compilation levels, but also on a level of system integration and deployment. MORSE is being used to run system level tests defined for the Jenkins continuous integration platform, enabling STRANDS to maintain a high-level of code consistency required to successfully participate in events such as the Robot Marathon. Secondly, I outline the use of MORSE, and particularly its flexible build scripts, to automatically generate worlds from Qualitative Spatial Relations (QSR). These allow to define a world qualitatively on the level of builder scripts with defined probability distribution of <b>metric</b> <b>object</b> positions and orientations. In STRANDS, this ability is exploited to generated randomised world in a controlled way, both to study the formation of QSRs and to generate randomised worlds for the before-mentioned testing framework.

Permutation-based approaches represent <b>metric</b> <b>objects</b> as sequences (permutations) of reference objects, chosen from a predefined set of data. However, associating objects with permutations might have a high cost due to the distance calculation between the data objects and the reference objects.

Treating data collections as <b>metric</b> <b>objects</b> brings a great advantage in generality, because a single metric technique can be applied to many specific search problems quite different in nature. In this paper, we concentrate our attention on a special form of join, the Self Similarity Join, which retrieves pairs from the same dataset. In particular, we consider the case in which the dataset is split into subsets that are searched for self similarity join independently (e. g, in a distributed computing environment). To this end, we formalize the abstract concept of epsilon-Cover, prove its correctness, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to two real implementations on a real-life large dataset...|$|R
40|$|Surrogate Text Representation (STR) is a {{profitable}} solution to efficient similarity search on metric space using conventional text search engines, such as Apache Lucene. This technique {{is based on}} comparing the permutations of some reference objects {{in place of the}} original metric distance. However, the Achilles heel of STR approach is the need to reorder the result set of the search according to the metric distance. This forces to use a support database to store the original objects, which requires efficient random I/O on a fast secondary memory (such as flash-based storages). In this paper, we propose to extend the Surrogate Text Representation to specifically address a class of visual <b>metric</b> <b>objects</b> known as Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD).

40|$|The {{field of}} {{computational}} learning theory arose {{out of the}} desire to for­ mally understand the process of learning. As potential applications to artificial intelligence became apparent, the new field grew rapidly. The learning of geo­ <b>metric</b> <b>objects</b> became a natural area of study. The possibility of using learning techniques to compensate for unsolvability provided an attraction for individ­ uals with an immediate need to solve such difficult problems.

Current vision techniques, which have a strong geometric component, can be used to extract features. However, these techniques fall short of useful recognition of the sensed objects. One potential solution is to incorporate learning techniques into the geometric manipulation of sensor data.

40|$|Metric {{indexing}} is {{a branch}} of search technology that is designed for search non-textual data. Examples of this includes image search (where the search query is an image), document search (finding documents that are roughly equal) to search in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Metric indexing {{is based on the}} theory of metric spaces, where the only thing known about a set of objects is the distance between them (defined by a metric distance function). A large number of methods have been proposed to solve the metric indexing problem. In this thesis, we have concentrated on new approaches to solving these problems, as well as combining existing methods to create better ones. The methods studied in this thesis include D-Index, GNAT, EMVP-Forest, HC, SA-Tree, SSS-Tree, M-Tree, PM-Tree, M*-Tree and PM*-Tree. These have all been implemented and tested against each other to find strengths and weaknesses. This thesis also studies a group of indexing methods called hybrid methods which combines tree-based methods (like SA-Tree, SSS-tree and M-Tree), with pivoting methods (like AESA and LAESA). The thesis also proposes a method to create hybrid trees from existing trees by using features in the programming language. Hybrid methods have been shown in this thesis to be very promising. While they may have a considerable overhead in construction time,CPU usage and/or memory usage, they show large benefits in reduced number of distance computations.

40|$|The reverse k-nearest {{neighbor}} (RkNN) problem, i. e. find-ing {{all objects}} in a data set the k-nearest neighbors of {{which include a}} specified query object, is a generalization of the reverse 1 -nearest neighbor problem which has received in-creasing attention recently. Many industrial and scientific applications call for solutions of the RkNN problem in arbi-trary metric spaces where the data objects are not Euclidean and only a metric distance function is given for specifying object similarity. Usually, these applications need a solution for the generalized problem where the value of k is not known in advance and may change from query to query. However, existing approaches, except one, are designed for the specific R 1 NN problem. In addition — {{to the best of}} our knowledge — all previously proposed methods, especially the one for generalized RkNN search, are only applicable to Euclidean vector data but not for general <b>metric</b> <b>objects.</b> In this pa-per, we propose the first approach for efficient RkNN search in arbitrary metric spaces where the value of k is specified at query time. Our approach uses the advantages of exist-ing metric index structures but proposes to use conservative and progressive distance approximations in order to filter out true drops and true hits. In particular, we approxi-mate the k-nearest neighbor distance for each data object by upper and lower bounds using two functions of only two parameters each. Thus, our method does not generate any considerable storage overhead. We show in a broad experi-mental evaluation on real-world data the scalability and the usability of our novel approach. 1...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a novel {{solution to the}} <b>metric</b> reconstruction of <b>objects</b> using any smart device equipped with a camera and an inertial measure-ment unit (IMU). We propose a batch, vision centric approach which only uses the IMU to estimate the metric scale of a scene reconstructed by any algorithm with Structure from Motion like (SfM) output. IMUs have a rich history of being com-bined with monocular vision for robotic navigation and odometry applications. These IMUs require sophisticated and quite expensive hardware rigs to perform well. IMUs in smart devices, however, are chosen for enhancing interactivity- a task which is more forgiving to noise in the measurements. We anticipate, how-ever, that the ubiquity of these “noisy ” IMUs makes them increasingly useful in modern computer vision algorithms. Indeed, we show in this work how an IMU from a smart device can help a face tracker to measure pupil distance, and an SfM algorithm to measure the <b>metric</b> size of <b>objects.</b> We also identify motions that produce better results, and develop a heuristic for estimating, in real-time, when enough data has been collected for an accurate scale estimation...|$|R
