5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} <b>molluscs</b> appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine <b>molluscs</b> vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine <b>molluscs.</b> For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of <b>molluscs,</b> consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod <b>molluscs.</b> These <b>molluscs</b> feed on the algae growing {{on the surface of}} the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. Bivalve <b>molluscs</b> include the edible common cockle, although it is not harvested here.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among <b>molluscs,</b> many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early <b>molluscs.</b>|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} an interactive proof development shell, <b>Mollusc</b> [Richards 93], {{which can be}} used to construct and edit proofs in sequentbased logics. Conceptually, <b>Mollusc</b> may {{be thought of as a}} logic-independent successor to Oyster [Bundy et al 90]. However, where Oyster was tied to a variant of Martin-Lof type theory, <b>Mollusc</b> can be used with any sequent-based logic for which a suitable definition is provided. Although developed in a research environment, <b>Mollusc</b> should also be suitable for use in classroom exercises. In addition to proof editing facilities, <b>Mollusc</b> supports the definition of new logics, includes a proof-planner interface, and provides for automated proof construction through a tactic language and interpreter. 1 Introduction <b>Mollusc</b> is a general proof-development shell, which was designed as a logicindependent successor to Oyster.

5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described {{living species}} of <b>molluscs</b> vary from 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of living <b>molluscs</b> at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the living <b>molluscs.</b> In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described living species at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. <b>Molluscs</b> are second only to arthropods in numbers of living animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 but well ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 living species in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species ever to have existed, whether or not preserved, must be many times greater than the number alive today.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molluscs</b> are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous <b>molluscs</b> also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod <b>molluscs,</b> such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous <b>molluscs</b> in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E
5|$|<b>Molluscs</b> {{have been}} and still are an {{important}} food source for anatomically modern humans. However {{there is a risk}} of food poisoning from toxins which can accumulate in certain <b>molluscs</b> under specific conditions, and because of this, many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. <b>Molluscs</b> have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, Tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. Their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.|$|E
50|$|Their {{life cycle}} is much simpler {{than that of}} digenean trematodes, {{including}} a <b>mollusc</b> and a facultative or compulsory vertebrate host. There are no multiplicative larval stages in the <b>mollusc</b> host, as known from all digeneans.|$|R
50|$|Although this {{hermit crab}} species {{generally}} inhabits the discarded {{shell of a}} free-living gastropod <b>mollusc,</b> it sometimes makes use of the empty, tube-like shells of certain gastropod <b>mollusc</b> species while the tube is permanently cemented to rocks in the reef.|$|R
50|$|Shell colour varies between {{shades of}} yellow through pink to a darker red.This {{deepwater}} species {{can have a}} considerably extended siphonal canal sometimes accounting {{for more than half}} the <b>mollusc's</b> overall length.

5|$|The name Molluscoida was {{formerly}} used to denote {{a division of}} the animal kingdom containing the brachiopods, bryozoans, and tunicates, the members of the three groups having been supposed to somewhat resemble the <b>molluscs.</b> As it is now known these groups have no relation to <b>molluscs,</b> and very little to one another, the name Molluscoida has been abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} <b>molluscs</b> such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve <b>molluscs</b> such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|Seasonal {{rainfall}} {{patterns of}} the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater <b>molluscs</b> (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This include 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater <b>molluscs</b> are the mussels Pseudomulleria dalyi, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail Cremnoconchus, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, 4 species of freshwater <b>molluscs</b> are considered endangered and 3 are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out to {{evaluate}} the marketing of marine <b>mollusc</b> in Bangladesh coast during April-December, 2005. Different Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools, namely – questionnaire interview, Focus Group Discussion (FGD), market visit and case studies have been employed in the coastal areas of Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong, Khulna, Satkhira and Bagherhat. This study identified a range of <b>mollusc</b> species exploited at the Bangladesh coast and investigated their utilizations for edible and non edible purposes. <b>Mollusc</b> species of commercial importance identified are clam, green mussel, oyster, cockle, karotal, laza, kostura, kata shamuk and kori. The <b>mollusc</b> shells collected in the coastal areas are used in many different purposes, like, making poultry and fish feed, lime production, ornamental usage, paint making etc. People from Rakhaing and some other tribes of the coast traditionally have long been harvesting green mussel, clam and oyster for their household consumption. In addition, <b>mollusc</b> meat is used in the coastal shrimp and prawn hatcheries as feed for mother shrimp/prawn. <b>Mollusc</b> harvesters are mainly the coastal poor community and they harvest by hand and nets from coastal channels and muddy soil.
