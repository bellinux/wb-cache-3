40|$|Objectives: Socially {{constructed}} hierarchies of impairment {{complicate the}} general disadvantage experienced by workers with disabilities. Workers {{with a range}} of abilities categorized as a "disability" are likely to experience less favourable treatment at work and have their rights to work discounted by laws and institutions, as compared to workers without disabilities. Value judgments in workplace culture and local law mean that the extent of disadvantage experienced by workers with disabilities additionally will depend upon the type of impairment they have. Rather than focusing upon the extent and severity of the impairment and how society turns an impairment into a recognized disability, this article aims to critically analyse the social hierarchy of physical versus mental impairment. Methods: Using legal doctrinal research methods, this paper analysis how Australian and Irish workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation and negligence laws regard workers with <b>mental</b> <b>injuries</b> and impairments as less deserving of compensation and protection than like workers who have physical and sensory injuries or impairments. Results: This research finds that workers who acquire and manifest <b>mental</b> <b>injuries</b> and impairments at work are less able to obtain compensation and protection than workers who have developed physical and sensory injuries of equal or lesser severity. Organizational cultures and governmental laws and policies that treat workers less favourably because they have <b>mental</b> <b>injuries</b> and impairments perpetuates unfair and artificial hierarchies of disability attributes. Conclusions: We conclude that these "sanist" attitudes undermine equal access to compensation for workplace injury as prohibited by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities...|$|R

2500|$|Physician–patient {{privilege}} {{is usually}} statutorily defined, and {{can vary from}} state to state.

[...] Once the plaintiff alleges physical or <b>mental</b> <b>injuries</b> proximately flowing from a potentially tortious act by the defendant, or in some other disability hearing, medical records can be subject to subpoena duces tecum. [...] While witnesses may try to resist legal discovery [...] by asking the judge to protect them from questioning or inspection of documents, the policy of the courts is in favor of full disclosure. It is the intent of the rules of procedure that pre-trial discovery take place without any intervention of a judge. So-called [...] "fishing expeditions" [...] (massive and aimless calls for all documents related to the litigation) are permissible under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b) (1). This rule is repeated in many states' rules of procedure: [...] "Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant ... if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." [...] The looseness of the definition of relevant evidence is generally construed to mean [...] "liberal" [...] production. The physician who is the party to an action does not own the records of patients he has treated. They are not privileged if the patient has waived confidentiality. Physicians must produce medical records under subpoena duces tecum.|$|R
