Through analyzing {{the shape and}} characteristic parameters of double-helix screw, the helicoids equation and axial curve equation of double-helix screw were established. According to the relative position relations between formed <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and double-helix screw in the machining process, the geometric mapping relationship of screw coordinate system and formed <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> coordinate system was established by using the coordinate transformation theory. Based on noninstantaneous envelope method and the meshing conditions between formed <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and double-helix screw, the contact line equations were established by minimum value method. By analyzing the machining errors caused by resharpening the formed <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> the tooth back curve equation was established based on spiral of Archimedes, and the profile equation of formed <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with constant back angle was got. On this basis, the formed <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> of processing double-helix screw was designed, and the cutter head and tool post were manufactured, respectively.

"Autolock" [...] {{collet chucks}} (Osbourn [...] "Pozi-Lock" [...] {{is a similar}} system) were {{designed}} to provide secure clamping of <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> with only hand tightening. They were developed in the 1940s by a now defunct UK company, Clarkson (Engineers) Limited, and {{are commonly known as}} Clarkson chucks. Autolock collets require cutters with threaded shank ends to screw into the collet itself. Any rotation of the cutter forces the collet against the collet cap taper which tightly clamps the cutter, the screw fitting also prevents any tendency of the cutter to pull out. Collets are only available in fixed sizes, imperial or metric, and the cutter shank must be an exact match.|$|E
2500|$|Indexable {{drill bits}} are {{primarily}} used in CNC and other high precision or production equipment, {{and are the}} most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length. [...] Like indexable lathe tools and <b>milling</b> <b>cutters,</b> they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate {{the need for a}} tool grinder. [...] One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius. [...] The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task. [...] The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable. [...] Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged tool life under heavy usage. [...] They are also readily available in odd configurations, such as straight flute, fast spiral, multiflute, and a variety of cutting face geometries.|$|E

40|$|Milling is {{a process}} of {{producing}} flat and complex shapes with the use of multi-tooth cutting tool, which is called a <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and the cutting edges are called teeth. The axis of rotation of the cutting tool is perpendicular to the direction of feed, either parallel or perpendicular to the machined surface. The machine tool that traditionally performs this operation is a milling machine. Milling is an interrupted cutting operation: the teeth of the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> enter and exit the work during each revolution. This interrupted cutting action subjects the teeth to a cycle of impact force and thermal shock on every rotation. The tool material and cutter geometry must be designed to withstand these conditions. Cutting fluids are essential for most milling operations. In this Paper the design aspects of <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is analyzed. The objective considered is the design and modeling of <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and to analyse various stress components acting on it.

The key problem of this method is to obtain joint surface parameters between the machine tool spindle and face <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> through experimental modal analysis and MATLAB software.

40|$|Common {{practice}} in industry is to rotate the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> {{in only one}} direction even though the geometry of the inserts are thus {{that they could be}} used again while the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is rotating in the opposite direction.

Afterwards the inserts where used in another milling head which rotated in the opposite direction. The experiments were conducted while milling duplex stainless steel SAF 2304. This due to that machining of duplex stainless steel is often thought of as leading to adhesive wear of the cutting tool which added an important type of tool wear to the investigation in addition to the dominating abrasive wear.
