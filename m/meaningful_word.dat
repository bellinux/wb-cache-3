50|$|Mohmil (مہمل) is {{the name}} given to {{meaningless}} words in the Urdu language used mostly for generalization purposes. The mohmil word usually directly follows (but sometimes precedes) the <b>meaningful</b> <b>word</b> that is generalized.

40|$|Feeding {{practices}} show {{many benefits}} for child and cognitive development. The {{objective was to}} investigate the association between infant feeding practices and the first <b>meaningful</b> <b>words</b> of Thai children. The participants enrolled in this longitudinal study were 4245 children born between July 2000 and June 2002. They resided in 3 rural and 2 urban areas of Thailand and were followed from birth to childhood. The outcome was time from birth to expression of first <b>meaningful</b> <b>words.</b> Outcome and feeding information were gathered using a diary method, with parents and caregivers recording daily development. Nonstatistically significant corresponding reduction in time to expression of first <b>meaningful</b> <b>words</b> was found among children who were breastfed, and this increased with duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding may reduce the time taken for expression of first <b>meaningful</b> <b>words</b> by about 2 % (hazard ratio = 0. 98; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 94 to 1. 01). No association between infant feeding practices and the expression of first <b>meaningful</b> <b>words</b> was found...|$|R

50|$|The name of {{the chapter}} is {{combined}} with two words. (mozi+marabou). The word ‘mozi’ in Tamil denotes a language. Language is a <b>meaningful</b> <b>word</b> or words conveyed by human beings. Here mozi is used to denote a word and combination of words (phrases) by metonym. Marabou, a word in Tamil denotes the inherited custom of Tamil language. Here {{the title of the}} chapter denotes inherited custom of phrases in Tamil.|$|E
50|$|Units {{which are}} not {{independent}} words but convey meaning on account of their usage on combination are bound morphemes. A bound morpheme is a sound {{or a combination of}} sounds that cannot stand on its own as a <b>meaningful</b> <b>word.</b> Most of the bound morphemes in Odia language are ‘affixes’. An affix is a morpheme that may come at the beginning (Termed as Prefix) or the end (Termed as Suffix) of a base morpheme.|$|E

50|$|Odia {{morphology}} is the identification, {{analysis and}} {{description of the}} structure of morphemes and other units of meaning in the Odia language. Morphemes (called ରୁପିମ in Odia and pronounced Rüpémë) are the smallest units of the Odia language that carry and convey a unique meaning and is grammatically appropriate. A morpheme in Odia (Termed as: ରୁପିମ) is the most minuscule meaningful constituent which combines and synthesizes the phonemes into a meaningful expression through its (morpheme's) form & structure. Thus, in essence, the morpheme is a structural combination of phonemes in Odia. In other words, in Odia language, the morpheme is a combination of sounds that possess and convey a meaning. A morpheme is not necessarily a <b>meaningful</b> <b>word</b> in Odia. In Odia, every morpheme is either a base or an affix (prefix or a suffix).|$|E

50|$|Haridatta {{dispensed}} with the numerical symbolism used by Aryabhata {{and replaced it}} with the more flexible Katapayadi system.

These words and sentences could be remembered with much less effort.|$|R
50|$|Onomatopoeia work in {{the sense}} of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not {{necessarily}} constituting a direct <b>meaningful</b> <b>word</b> in the process. The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a phoneme, is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language’s connection to a sound's meaning, that language’s onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, hence why English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese, which overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.|$|E
50|$|While in {{his fifties}} O'Connor took time off from his public {{relations}} firm O’Connor Communications, Inc. to write Cuss Control, which takes a light-hearted but intent {{look at the history}} of swearing, why we do it, and how to control it. He doesn’t condemn profanity, but suggests being discreet about when and where we choose to swear. O'Connor chooses to define swearing under two classifications, casual and causal. Casual swearing can be intended humor or lazy language when the speaker doesn't make the effort to use a more <b>meaningful</b> <b>word.</b> Causal swearing is caused by an emotion like pain, anger, or frustration. He also sorts reasons to quit swearing into three clusters; personal, corruption of the language, and societal effects. Personal reasons include trying to maintain a pleasant, respectful, and emotionally in-control image. Swearing can also reflect an abrasive or negative attitude and poor vocabulary. Societal effects include a lack of civility and profanity's ability to instigate violence or unnecessary verbal aggression. O'Connor recommends eliminating casual swearing, working on patience, using alternative words, making points politely, and using volume to make points if necessary. Then friends and co-workers are spared the tension of tirades.|$|E
50|$|Altered neural {{activity}} of motor systems {{has been demonstrated}} to influence language comprehension. One such study that demonstrates this effect was performed by Dr. Pulvermüller et al. TMS was used to increase the excitability of either the leg region or the arm region of the motor cortex. Authors stimulated the left motor cortex, known to be more closely involved in language processing in right-handed individuals, the right motor cortex, {{as well as a}} sham stimulation where stimulation was prevented by a plastic block placed between the coil and the skull. During the stimulation protocols, subjects were shown 50 arm, 50 leg, 50 distractor (no bodily relation), and 100 pseudo- (not real) words. Subjects were asked to indicate recognition of a <b>meaningful</b> <b>word</b> by moving their lips, and response times were measured. It was found that stimulation of the left leg region of the motor cortex significantly reduced response times for recognition of leg words as compared to arm words, whereas the reverse was true for stimulation of the arm region. Stimulation site on the right motor cortex, as well as sham stimulation, did not exhibit these effects. Therefore, somatotopically-specific stimulation of the left motor cortex facilitated word comprehension in a body-part-specific manner, where stimulation of the leg and arm regions lead to enhanced comprehension of leg and arm words, respectively. This study has been used as evidence for the bi-directional hypothesis of language and action, as it showcases that manipulating motor cortex activity alters language comprehension in a semantically-specific manner.|$|E

40|$|When a novel word is learned, its memory {{representation}} {{is thought to}} undergo a process of consolidation and integration. In this study, we tested whether the neural representations of novel words change {{as a function of}} consolidation by observing brain activation patterns just after learning and again after a delay of one week. Words learned with meanings were remembered better than those learned without meanings. Both episodic (hippocampus-dependent) and semantic (dependent on distributed neocortical areas) memory systems were utilised during recognition of the novel words. The extent to which the two systems were involved changed as a function of time and the amount of associated information, with more involvement of both systems for the <b>meaningful</b> <b>words</b> than for the form-only words after the one-week delay. These results suggest that the reason the <b>meaningful</b> <b>words</b> were remembered better is that their retrieval can benefit more from these two complementary memory system...|$|R
