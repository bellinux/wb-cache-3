40|$|We {{construct}} {{a very simple}} environment where an institution, which closely resembles a bank, endogenously arises. In our model a bank is an agent that: (1) creates money (a debt instrument that circulates {{as a means of}} payment); (2) lends it out (swapping it for less liquid forms of debt); (3) monitors those agents in control of the capital backing the illiquid debt; and (4) collects on money loans as they come due. Bank money in our model is a debt instrument that embeds within it important stipulations that are found in actual private <b>money</b> <b>instruments.</b> We show that when trade is decentralized a Pareto efficient allocation can only be achieved if a bank is present.

Through the investment politics, Romania will continue to attract foreign investments, whose annual average was remarkable. For the financing of the investments, a diversification of the internal and external resources is necessary. The internal resources are based {{on the development of the}} saving instruments: the development of the market for transaction of state titles, public and corporative obligations, the settlement of the mortgage credit market; the stimulation of the public placement instruments, the fiscal instruments, the extension of the capital market, public-private partnership, initial public offers, a reduction in the usage of the public money.

40|$|Market discipline”—the {{theory that}} {{short-term}} creditors can efficiently rein in bank risk through their self-interested actions—has been a central pillar of banking regulation {{since the late}} 1980 s, both in the United States and abroad. While market discipline did not prevent the buildup of bank risk that caused the recent financial crisis, the conventional wisdom has been that this failure was due to extrinsic factors that impeded the effective operation of market discipline, rather than any underlying problems with the theory itself. As a result, policymakers have increased regulatory reliance on market discipline, making this {{a central part of}} their reform efforts. This Article challenges the prevailing wisdom and makes two contributions to the literature. First, I demonstrate that market discipline failed more severely and completely than has previously been acknowledged. A foundational premise of market discipline is that investors will signal elevated bank risk through higher prices and lower liquidity. But as I illustrate, there was no such reaction until after the financial crisis had already begun, despite historically high levels of bank risk. Second, I attempt to explain why market discipline failed so completely and fundamentally. I contend that the theory of market discipline relies too heavily on investors that are relatively insensitive to risk and thus serve as particularly poor monitors of banks, and wrongly ignores the effects of bank shareholders, who are highly risk-sensitive but may have incentives adverse to those of public policy. Both of these flaws with the doctrine of market discipline arise from its conflation of capital market investors, who generally are quite sensitive to risk, and purchasers of <b>money</b> <b>instruments,</b> who generally are not. Despite these enormous flaws with the underlying doctrine, improving the conditions for market discipline continues {{to be seen as a}} panacea for reducing systemic risk, thus increasing the likelihood that regulators may again be blindsided by another financial crisis...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the greater {{use in the}} past decade of <b>money</b> market <b>instruments</b> in the conduct of monetary policy by the central banks, or their equivalent, in six of the main East Asian developing economies. Some of these economies have been successful in using various <b>money</b> market <b>instruments</b> to control liquidity, while others have been much less successful. A common theme {{in the case of the}} successful economies has been one of employing <b>money</b> market <b>instruments</b> that have yields based on actual market demand and supply. In those cases where the yields have been unrealistic due to not being based on market conditions, the open market operations have generally not been successful. Indonesia's past experience would be an example of this. Based on the experience of these economies, it is suggested that a viable market in treasury bills issued by the national government [...] not the central bank [...] be developed for the central bank's use in its monetary policy operations. The advantages of a well-developed open market operation over other traditional monetary policy instruments are cited near the end of the paper.
