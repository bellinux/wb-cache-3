40|$|Men in the United States {{who spend}} {{time out of}} work during their youth tend to be {{employed}} less and earn lower wages in their adult years. Why? Is this because the state of being out of work as a youth causes workers to earn less and work fewer weeks later in life? Or is it because individuals who work fewer weeks during youth have personal traits that lower their probability of employment and their wages during both youth and adulthood? Researchers refer to the first possible explanation as state dependence and call the second explanation heterogeneity. Using successive observations {{of the same people}} over time from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this paper identifies a causal relationship (state dependence) between early employment experience and employment and wages ten years later among high school graduates and individuals with higher <b>measured</b> <b>ability</b> but not among high school dropouts or those with low <b>measured</b> <b>ability.</b> Previous research on this topic has not examined whether the impact of state dependence varies with schooling and <b>measured</b> <b>ability.</b> Among those who are affected by state dependence, those who as youths experience especially long periods of unemployment are particularly prone to long-term effects on future wages and employment...|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, {{studies have}} focused on {{measuring}} skills through educational attainment and experience, without <b>measuring</b> <b>ability</b> directly. Ability might affect labor market outcomes, including earnings. The ability bias has been discussed in the literature, and Griliches (1977) provides one of the earliest attempts to correct for unmeasured ability in the context of estimating returns to schooling. Although ability is not observable, cognitive and noncognitive tests can be good proxies. An individual’s skill set can be defined as a combination of cognitive, socioemotional, and technical skills. In turn, given that human capital is multidimensional, both cognitive and socioemotional skills can serve as good predictors of economic outcomes such as income and wealth (Bowles et al. 2001; Hansen et al. 2004; Heckman et al. 2006; Green and Riddell 2003).|$|E
