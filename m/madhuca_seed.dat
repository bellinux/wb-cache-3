40|$|Abstract. Defatted Madhuca butyraceae seeds contain 24 % {{of crude}} protein and 10. 4 % of saponins. The {{solubility}} of <b>Madhuca</b> <b>seed</b> proteins was determined {{in water and}} NaCl {{as a function of}} pH and minimum solubility occurred at pH 4. 0. The proteins consist of three components with S 20,w values of 2. 2, 9. 8 and 15. 4. On gel filtration the proteins gave three peaks and on diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography they resolved into two components. The in vitro digestibility of <b>Madhuca</b> <b>seed</b> protein was found to be 69 % when assayed with a pepsin-pancreatin system...|$|E

40|$|The {{depletion}} rate of non-renewable resources and their utility, which mostly {{ends up in}} polluting the environment, are the major reasons for which biomass usage has come into the limelight. Energy production from biomass is mostly done by thermo-chemical and biological conversion routes among which pyrolysis is considered as the most appropriate and efficient thermo-chemical method for biomass conversion. The present work is mostly based on the co-pyrolysis of Mahua <b>seed</b> (<b>Madhuca</b> indica) with plastic. Mahua seed is a widely available biomass, whose pyrolysis at different conditions of heating rate, temperature and residence time yields around 49...|$|R
40|$|Mahua (<b>Madhuca</b> longifolia) <b>seed</b> {{activated}} carbon (MSAC) {{has been developed}} as an effective adsorbent {{for the removal of}} phenol from contaminated wastewaters. Prepared MSAC was characterized for various physico-chemical properties, Fourier transform infra- red (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Laboratory batch experiments were performed to investigate the effect of MSAC dosage (w), pH, contact time (t), and initial phenol concentrations (Co) on sorption efficiency at optimal conditions. The maximum adsorption capacity of phenol was obtained at pH= 6, t= 5 h and MSAC dosage= 1. 2 g/l. The kinetics data of phenol adsorption was very well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium adsorption data were best fitted to the Langmuir isotherm. The average effective diffusion coefficient 6. 4 × 10 - 13 m 2 /s was calculated from the experimental data. Thermodynamic studies confirmed the sorption process to be spontaneous and exothermic. The isosteric heat of adsorption of phenol was found to increase with an increase in the surface loading indicating that MSAC have more homogeneous surface...|$|R

30|$|Recent {{realization}} that the plants having particular bio-efficacy should be explored and enhanced for other bonafide activities, have motivated us to enhance anti-inflammatory bio-efficacy of the plant <b>Madhuca</b> longifolia using <b>seed</b> extract saponin-loaded Ag nanoparticles (Sharma et al. 2018). In continuation of our work on this plant; exploring wound healing bio-efficacy in {{the seeds of the}} plant M. longifolia, the present communication reports a facile green synthesis of seed-extracted flavonoid-loaded Ag, Au, and Au–AgNps bimetallic nanoparticles, characterization and statistically significant enhancement in wound healing bio-efficacy. The observed highest enhancement in the wound healing bio-efficacy of Mlf@AgNps has been ascribed to the inherent antimicrobial property of silver, nanosizing, biological factors responsible for higher uptake, and coating of medicinally important flavonoid on the nanoparticles.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{people of}} far-flung rural areas still depend {{to a large}} extent upon plants and {{household}} remedies for curing veterinary ailments. The folk knowledge of ethno-veterinary medicine and its significance has been identified by the traditional communities through a process of experience over hundreds of years. The present paper documented ethno-veterinary practices of tribals related to different medicinal problems in their livestock. The study was conducted in purposively selected Sabarkantha district of Gujarat. A total of 120 tribal families were selected from 8 selected villages of 2 talukas namely Khedbhramha and Vijaynagar. Data were collected through interview and detailed discussion with traditional healers and family members those known about indigenous traditional knowledge. An inventory of 36 practices was prepared in 14 different ailments. Tribals prepared fermented product (alcohol) of Mahua (<b>Madhuca</b> indica) <b>seed</b> and drench to affected animals for removal of endo-parasites. Traditional healers prepared a paste of haldi (Curcuma longa) mixed with linseed (Linum usitatissium) oil and apply on ulcers of FMD. A mixture of crushed fruits of Tumba (Citrullus colocynthis) along with 2 - 3 litres chaach (Butter milk) drench to the animal at 6 hour interval in 2 doses, tribals reported that  this is very effective for quick eruption of gases of animals suffering from tympany.
