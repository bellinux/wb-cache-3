25|$|The {{diplomatic}} intrigue failed, {{largely due}} to the intervention of Sophia's mother, Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Historical accounts portray her as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Johanna's hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for King Frederick of Prussia. The Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: she had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother Charles Augustus (Karl August von Holstein), who had died of smallpox in 1727 before the wedding could take place. In spite of Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to the daughter, who, on arrival in Russia in 1744, spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with the Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the Russian people. She applied herself to learning the Russian language with such zeal, she rose at night and walked about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons (even though she mastered the language, she retained an accent). This led to a severe attack of pneumonia in March 1744. When she wrote her memoirs, she said she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> when she came to Russia to do whatever was necessary, and to profess to believe whatever was required of her, to become qualified to wear the crown.|$|E

In a review in the Chicago Tribune, Kuehn felt that the work has little impact and is not memorable.

Child actress Delaney Rose Stein was eventually cast as a young version Rapunzel.

500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My feeling is that she is not the one she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact".

Little was said; Longmore was asking himself with an {{agitation}} {{of his own}} in the unspoken words whether all this meant simply {{that he was in}} love. He looked at the rooks wheeling against the golden-hued sky, between the tree-tops, but not at his companion, whose personal presence seemed lost in the felicity she had created. Madame de Mauves was silent and grave--she felt she had almost grossly failed and she was proportionately disappointed. An emotional friendship she had not desired; her scheme had been to pass with her visitor as a placid creature with a good deal of leisure which she was disposed to devote to profitable conversation of an impersonal sort. She liked him extremely, she felt in him the living force of something to which, when she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> girlish <b>mind</b> that a needy nobleman was the ripest fruit of time, she had done too scant justice. They went through the little gate in the garden-wall and approached the house. On the terrace Madame Clairin was entertaining a friend--a little elderly gentleman with a white moustache and an order in his buttonhole. Madame de Mauves chose to pass round the house into the court; whereupon her sister-in-law, greeting Longmore with an authoritative nod, lifted her eye-glass and stared at them as they went by. Longmore heard the little old gentleman uttering some old-fashioned epigram about [...] "la vieille galanterie francaise"--then by a sudden impulse he looked at Madame de Mauves and wondered what she was doing in such a world. She stopped before the house, not asking him to come in. [...] "I hope you will act on my advice and waste no more time at Saint-Germain." ...|$|R

On the Friday the poor lady had said much on the subject, but had been comforted by an assurance from her nephew that the arrangement should be carried out exactly as she wished it, whether the codicil was or was not added to the will. To Clara she said nothing more on the subject, nor at such a time did Captain Aylmer feel that he could offer her any assurance on the matter. But Clara knew that the will was not altered; and though at the time she was not thinking much about money, she had, nevertheless, very clearly <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mind</b> as to <b>her</b> own conduct. Nothing should induce her to take a present of fifteen hundred pounds,--or, indeed, of as many pence from Captain Aylmer. During those hours of sickness in the house they had been much thrown together, and no one could have been kinder or more gentle to her than he had been. He had come to call her Clara, as people will do when joined together in such duties, and had been very pleasant as well as affectionate in his manner with her. It had seemed to her that he also wished to take upon himself the cares and love of an adopted brother. But as an adopted brother she would {{have nothing to do with}} him. The two men whom she liked best in the world would assume each the wrong place; and between them both she felt that she would be left friendless.|$|R
2500|$|Arbuckle's {{attorneys}} later concentrated {{their attention}} on one woman named Helen Hubbard who had told jurors that she would vote guilty [...] "until hell freezes over". She refused {{to look at the}} exhibits or read the trial transcripts, having <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> in the courtroom. Hubbard's husband was a lawyer who did business with the D.A.'s office, and expressed surprise that she was not challenged when selected for the jury pool. While much attention was paid to Hubbard after the trial, some other jury members felt Arbuckle was guilty but not beyond a reasonable doubt, and various jurors joined Hubbard in voting to convict, including – repeatedly at the end – Thomas Kilkenny. Arbuckle researcher Joan Myers describes the political climate and the media attention to the presence of women on juries (which had only been legal for four years at the time), and how Arbuckle's defense immediately singled out Hubbard as a villain; Myers also records Hubbard's account of the jury foreman August Fritze's attempts to bully her into changing her vote. While Hubbard offered explanations on her vote whenever challenged, Kilkenny remained silent and quickly faded from the media spotlight after the trial ended.|$|E

She returned to New Jersey with no idea of a location for the project, but was convinced it must be in a wilderness area far from city life. Ogden explained that she had received ‘a description and a mental picture of the place and knew it was on virgin soil, far removed from city life,’ {{as well as in}} the ‘intermountain country.’ [...] Through friends she learned of available land in San Juan County, Utah, and after visiting the area she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> She claimed that the location of their commune matched her vision. A group of 21 disciples, mostly from the Boise area, followed her to Dry Valley in southeastern Utah in September 1933. Intending to start a collective farm, the group first tried to buy some irrigated ranch land on Indian Creek, but they could not pay the asking price. Ogden offered the owner membership in the colony and a guarantee of eternal life, but to no avail.

Sigismund, supported by the Primate of Poland, had still enough authority to stop the inquisition half-way, but the young Queen's mother, the shrewd and sensible Archduchess Maria, who had accompanied her daughter to Kraków, had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> that Zamoyski was too strong to be set aside, and that therefore the interests of Austria demanded a reconciliation between the King and the Chancellor. This reconciliation was accomplished quietly by Mikołaj Firlej, Palatine of Kraków, and included all the leading men of both parties. The rival cardinals Bathory and Radziwiłł adjusted all their past differences; Zamoyski was fully reinstated in the Grand-Hetmanship; and as Grand Chancellor of the Crown, to the general astonishment, presented to the Sejm and eloquently defended all the royal propositions, including Sigismund's request for leave to proceed to Sweden to occupy the throne left vacant by {{the death of his father}} John III, on 17 November 1592. This reconciliation lasted for a long period of time, with the happiest results for Poland. Zamoyski, no longer distracted by personal considerations, gave his whole attention to public affairs and, from 1595 to 1602, achieved some of his most brilliant military and political triumphs.|$|E

It {{means that}} someone already has <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> about what a {{stranger}} is really like based only on the stranger's race, age, sex, etc. Having a stereotype about other people can lead you to having an opinion about them before you get to know them. Basically, a stereotype is a belief that all people of a certain type have some common quality-for exam-ple, 'All old people are politically conservative. " Someone who has this stereotypical belief will be inclined to expect a conservative atti-tude in the next old person he sees. In everyday life, a map we use when traveling is most useful to us when it is up-to-date and is a good match to the territory. We can rely on a new map of California to tell us how to get from one place to another. The layout of the cities and roads on the map is a close match to the actual layout of the cities and roads in the ter-ritory of California. The stereotype 'All old people are politically conservative " serves as a kind of mental map a person has inside her head that supposedly tells her about a part of the territory of the outside world called "all old people.
