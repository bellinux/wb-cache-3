The importance of these criticisms rests on judging the functional adequacy of alternative networks regarding these aspects.

The amount of agricultural land did not increase; it diminished {{as a result of the}} building of Lelystad (a city envisioned to eventually house at least 100,000 inhabitants.)

40|$|Abstract-Road traffic {{accidents}} (RTA’s) {{continue to be}} a serious problem. The paper argues that much research and effort to minimise this problem is locked into a fundamental misconception in so far as it assumes that blame, responsibility or engineering inadequacies can explain RTA’s. The whole system of <b>motorised</b> transport, <b>mobility</b> patterns, land uses, governmental intervention and large company support has deprived society of realistic alternatives to the motor car and bequeathed a delicient technology with several societal disbenefits. Long term solutions to the problem of RTA’s involve basic change to this systems design. Anything less will continue to reinforce the present trajectory. Road safety as an important area for research and action programmes has received a great deal of scientific attention in recent years. Progress has been made on several different fronts but in one area there would appear to be a serious lack of interest or, at the very least, a paucity of published information and informed debate. This area concerns the degree to which our thinking and hence our solutions are locked into a particular view of technology and society and thereby condemned to produce incremental improvements but no radical alteration in the magnitude or structure of the problem itself. In the case of road safety {{it can be argued that}} solutions which build on the acceptance of lfie motor car as a major and immutable technolog...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{relationships}} between {{two different types of}} human communication: mobility - i. e., communication with movement - and motionless communication, sometimes also called virtual mobility. The aim of the study has been to carry out an analysis of modern <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> around the world, considering the evolution of ITS. The final goal has been to provide an added value to the numerous publications already available on daily mobility, by outlining common elements and pointing out the role of being connected in future transport systems, in this way contributing to the pursuit of "interconnected transport systems": the Latin root of intelligent has two meanings, one of which is interconnect (inter-lego). An analysis on the long-term evolution of the main transport mode, that is, by car, has pointed out that an economic cycle has been completed in most motorised countries: this also complies with historical theories on the subject. However, new motionless communication systems have appeared on the market over the last decade, and they have become actual competitors to <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> or, hopefully, collaborators. Therefore, a new cycle of cars would be possible, under certain conditions - one of which includes being connected - a requirement that this paper wishes to outline with the help of some numerical analyses...|$|E

40|$|Increases {{in private}} {{motorised}} urban vehicle kilometres of travel are shown to arise from population growth, urban sprawl, increased car ownership and decreases in vehicle occupancy. In particular, the worldwide increase in urban mobility since 1960 {{has been the}} direct result of increased affluence and the consequent greater accessibility of private motor vehicles, as well as population growth. Urban sprawl has significantly less influence, although it has been significant in USA, Canadian and Australian cities.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} seven {{metropolitan regions}} {{that are all}} experiencing rapid motorisation and are perhaps appearing to capitulate to the automobile. Through 20 years of changes, evidenced in systematic data from the mid- 1990 s, a different perspective is found. None of the urban regions appear near to or even capable of becoming automobile cities. Physical limits are already being reached that make higher levels of private <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> very problematic if transport systems are to remain functional and the cities livable. These limits appear already to be reversing the decline in non-motorised modes and creating an upturn in transit systems, especially urban rail. That these cities {{have been able to}} either hold their own, or somewhat increase their share of total <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> by transit over a 20 -year period, is some indication that they are ‘hitting mobility walls’ much sooner in the motorisation path than cities in North America and Australia, which grew up with and were designed around the spatial needs of cars. Like many cities in the developed world that have shown a decoupling of car use and total passenger mobility from GDP growth from 1995 to 2005, there is now evidence that this is happening in less wealthy cities. This is important because it assists global and local goals for reduced CO 2 from passenger transport, while allowing for economic progress. Such evidence suggests that automobile dependence is not an irresistible force in emerging economies...|$|E

It focuses on two main aspects: the everyday geography of the ‘system of moto-mobility’, and the ‘social life’ of cars and motorbikes. The paper finds that although motorbikes still dominate in Hanoi, the car has overtaken the throne as the main aspirational and positional good, and currently automobility is becoming progressively normalised.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the implications of motorisation in emerging economies for deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents. It is shown that emerging economies have high rates of death and injury alongside low vehicle ownership rates. If vehicle ownership rates increase, so too could be the rate of deaths and injuries. Taking a broad view of automobility culture to include cars, infrastructure, legal systems, medical services, and populist views of motoring, it is argued that reducing the human cost of motorisation (and making <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> more sustainable) cannot be achieved only by technical fixes to the car. Rather, approaches that are sensitised to the particularities of place, and resonant with distinct cultures of automobility, represent the most likely means to achieve more sustainable mobility...|$|E

Alternatives, including fuel-cell vehicles and dual-drive vehicles fuelled with ethanol, will be less feasible.

40|$|In this {{historical}} moment, technology can guarantee transport systems some good solutions {{which seems to}} be quite in line with actual needs, by improving efficiency of engines (ICEs) or of travels or even rationalizing the consumption of related activities by using ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) and by developing systems which can be sustainable through their whole life-cycle (LCC). Main results of the paper can be synthesised in pursuing the independence from the main source transport systems are based on, which is a nearly-monopoly, and use of lower unitary energy in <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> {{in order to reduce the}} fuel consumption per person or per ton and - consequently - the emissions. This aim can be pursued either through higher capacity transport modes (e. g. trains, metros and automated people movers), yet guaranteeing as far as possible vehicles loaded more than their break-even in energy, or with a low level of black-oil energy used for vehicles: e. g., FEV, PHEV, natural gas for heavy-duty vehicles.

40|$|<b>Motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> has {{increased}} in a significant way in last years in European cities, and this has brought too much congestion in urban areas, which has deteriorated city centres ’ liveable conditions. For that reason, {{there is a need}} of effective and flexible transport systems in order to improve this situation in favour of public transport. The investment on design and innovation of competitive public transport is necessary in order to improve its modal share. Nevertheless, there exists other aspects, also very important, which make public transport more attractive. In the last years, many cities have implemented rail urban projects (tram, metros and light rail systems) as they have been considered the optimal option to foster public transport patronage and also for getting a sustainable mobility for the growing urban population. These kind of projects provide fast, regular, safe and comfortable services with medium-high capacity. At the same time, they provide a modern image of the city. Those characteristics are essential for a competitive public transport in contemporary cities, although they require large investments for its construction. This paper will present a comparison between different rail urban projects running in European cities since, at least, ten years ago. There will be described how they have increased modal share of public transport in different cities contexts. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a health}} impact {{assessment}} framework, we estimated the population health effects arising from alternative land-use and transport policy initiatives in six cities. Land-use changes were modelled {{to reflect a}} compact city in which land-use density and diversity were increased and distances to public transport were reduced to produce low <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility,</b> namely a modal shift from private motor vehicles to walking, cycling, and public transport. The modelled compact city scenario resulted in health gains for all cities (for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease) with overall health gains of 420 - 826 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) per 100 000 population. However, for moderate to highly motorised cities, such as Melbourne, London, and Boston, the compact city scenario predicted a small increase in road trauma for cyclists and pedestrians (health loss of between 34 and 41 DALYs per 100 000 population). The findings suggest that government policies need to actively pursue land-use elements-particularly a focus towards compact cities-that support a modal shift away from private motor vehicles towards walking, cycling, and low-emission public transport. At the same time, these policies need to ensure the provision of safe walking and cycling infrastructure. The findings highlight the opportunities for policy makers to positively influence the overall health of city populations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of a society that {{exhibits}} an increasing dependence on <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility,</b> the response of transport policy is one that remains grounded in the pursuit of quicker journey times. Less time spent travelling is assumed to convert 'unproductive' time into economically valuable time. This paper explores an alternative perspective on travel time. It seeks to examine the notion that travel time, rather than being wasted, can and does possess a positive utility. This brings into question the extent of assumed economic benefits derived from schemes and policies intended to reduce journey times. Specifically the paper reports on a national mail-back questionnaire survey of 26, 221 rail passengers in Great Britain conducted in autumn 2004. The survey examined how passengers used their time on the train, how worthwhile that time use was considered to be and the role of mobile technologies. The results paint a picture of travel time use in which the behaviour and opinions of commuters, business travellers and leisure travellers are compared and contrasted. A substantial if not overwhelming incidence of positive utility of travel time use is revealed, especially for business travel but also for commuting and leisure travel. In light of the survey evidence the paper points to the challenge of understanding the notion of productivity and offers some critical comments concerning the current approach to economic appraisal in Britain. ...|$|E

I will explore – briefly - {{the extent to which the}} current automobility system could adjust to drastic energy and resource use reduction or to a closed-loop economic system. If we explore the perceived extent of the changes needed and the implications of the changes to cars and car making this implies, we can see that current efforts on the part of the industry appear comparable to rearranging the ashtrays on the Titanic. However among the various actions the industry has been implementing to react to legislation and social pressure are a few gems that are more promising. Identifying and building on these may be more rewarding...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} powered {{mobility}} devices on occupational performance: A systematic review Purpose: To systematically review the impact powered mobility devices have on engagement in independent occupations for adults with acquired mobility limitations. Method: The following databases were searched electronically: CINAHL Plus, Medline, PsychInfo, OT Seeker, Joanna Briggs Institute and Physiotherapy Evidence Database. The search terms used {{a combination of}} words to encompass all terms which are used for powered mobility. Studies were included if they evaluated adults’ use of a <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> device, and if individuals used a powered mobility device due to acquired mobility limitation. Results: Eleven studies were eligible for inclusion. Studies varied in methodological quality and research design. One study was a true experimental design; four studies were preexperimental, and six used non-experimental designs. Positive improvements in occupational engagement were reported in five studies and increased independence was highlighted in four of these. Environmental barriers were described as being negatively associated with powered mobility use, with reports of accidents and injury closely associated with use of device when mobilising in the community. Conclusions: Due to differences in study focus, sample characteristics, outcome measures and varying methodological quality of each research study, drawing conclusions from the results is problematic. What can be suggested from the results is that environmental barriers generate difficulties and challenges for the user, which can subsequently result in accident or injury. In contrast these negative aspects, {{the use of a}} powered mobility is shown to provide positive impacts on the individual in the areas of independence, quality of life, mobility and engagement. The experience of being a <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> scooter user Purpose: This study explored the individual experiences of being a scooter user {{and the ways in which}} scooters impact the individual’s community and social engagement, daily activities and maintenance of mobility. Method: A qualitative, constructive framework utilising purposive sampling and a semi structured interview with fourteen individuals residing within aged care facilities in Perth, Western Australia was utilised. Data was analysed thematically with questions categorised under the main areas of activities, participation and environmental factors according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. Results: The three main themes identified through the research were knowledge, engagement and environments. Knowledge related to a lack of concise information, trialling and training prior to purchase leading to issues with the scooter catering for users’ individual needs. Engagement consisted of two sub categories of participation and interaction. Environments were broken into two areas of discrimination from the wider population and building design and barriers related to space requirements and physical barriers in the built environment. Conclusions: The research demonstrated a strong positive impact on individual’s engagement from using a scooter, while highlighting a lack of efficient knowledge about scooters, batteries, skill ability and design along with environmental challenges of discriminatory attitudes and barriers. The research indicates the need for pre-purchase assessments and trials along with improvements in community attitudes and environments. The use of a scooter results in increases to participation, role maintenance, choice, freedom and social interaction...|$|E
30|$|Historically, spatial {{mobility}} {{has been a}} crucial characteristic of human development (migration, the exchange of attitudes, values and knowledge or the spread of wealth) and civilisation (industrial revolution, the nature of wars, globalisation or land-sealing). While mobility in its early stage was rather characterised by self-sufficiency, sustainability (“natural or organic powered”) and {{a low level of}} transportation, as well as shared and slow travel, present mobility is usually the opposite. For almost a century our understanding of mobility as a mainly fossil-fuel powered transportation determines our daily life settings, urban and spatial planning. Accordingly, systems of provision (e.g., infrastructure, road networks and mobility options offered) [1] as well as our work- and leisure-travel behaviour have been designed on the principle of individual <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility.</b> This affects consumption choices and behavioural practices [2]. For instance, a public transport system of poor quality implies a low usage; a lack of sustainable mobility infrastructure and options offered (e.g., cycle lanes, sharing schemes or mobility plans) results in “car-addiction” [3]; or shifting shopping facilities out of the city triggers car travel and the economic dying of city centres. As a consequence, our mobility behaviour and means have become responsible for massive environmental (e.g., air pollution, climate change, bio-diversity loss and damage to eco-systems, land-waste and numerous road kills 1 of living creatures 2) and societal harm (e.g., reduced health and quality of life, social exclusion due to transport costs, availability and means, a capitalistic globalisation stimulating commuting and often global trade or goods transport that is not satisfying a demand).|$|E
40|$|Data for 1995 and 2005 on forty-two {{cities in}} the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and Asia suggest that car use as well as total <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> have {{decoupled}} from real growth in metropolitan GDPs. The car vehicle kilometres travelled per unit of GDP in thirty-nine out of the forty-two cities studied has reduced {{by an average of}} 24 %. In thirty-five or 83 % of the cities, total motorised passenger kilometres travelled per unit of GDP was lower in 2005 than it was in 1995, by an average of 26 %. Decoupling of urban mobility from GDP can occur in the context of still rising car use or total mobility. However, in twelve out of the forty-two cities the actual car use per capita also declined by an average of over 6 %. Overall, it is found that the average increase in car use in these forty-two cities from 1995 to 2005 was 7 % or less than one-third of the level in the 1980 s. This decoupling of car use from GDP growth is thus part of the ‘peak car use’ phenomenon. New data showing an improvement in the relative speed of public transport systems compared to general road traffic over many decades, which is being led by a strong global trend towards urban rail, may help to explain these results. Further research is needed to see if Chinese and Indian cities, with their heavy investments in rail, can also start to show a decoupling of passenger transport from GDP. Overall, the results suggest a possible future where wealth can continue to be created globally whilst reducing the use of cars, oil and their damaging global impacts...|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{reduction}} and modal shift towards public transport, walking and cycling were important {{aims of the}} Dutch spatial policy from the nineties (VINEX). This policy encompassed several criteria for new housing developments, to limit the mobility these generate. This paper reports on a study into the mobility consequences of the developments that {{were the result of}} this VINEX policy. It discusses the compliance of these locations with policy criteria and analyses the (car) travel behaviour of their inhabitants. The study focusses on the spatial situation of all newly built housing from the period 1995 - 2003 and the travel behaviour of their occupants. Part of these are classified as VINEX developments or dwellings, others are not developed as part of the VINEX policy and are referred to as non-VINEX. Results were obtained from detailled analyses of spatial characteristics and regression analyses of individual travel patterns. Differences between sections of the population and their specific characteristics are controlled for. The results show that the situation on the VINEX developments is largely in accordance with policy intentions, both with regard to proximity and accessibility. Many houses have been built within the existing urban area and the location of green field developments in relation to urban centres is favourable. Public transport facilities are on average better for VINEX dwellings, than elsewhere. Policy implementation was less succesful with regard to mixing land uses and the distances to daily amenities. The mobility generated proves to vary strongly between different types of locations. New developments, in general, generate more <b>motorised</b> <b>mobility</b> than average. Locations that were developed as part of the VINEX policy do better than non-VINEX. Especially the innercity VINEX-developments is characterised by low car use, {{despite the fact that they}} are inhabited by a relatively mobile section of the population. However, the results also show that innercity developments are most useful when located in the older parts of cities. Car use was high on Vinex-greenfield locations, but that is mainly caused by the composition of the population. The spatial criteria for VINEX developments, proximity and accessibility, have in fact played an important role in the more favourable mobility pattern. Particularly the location near urban centres and the accessibility by public transport have contributed to the lower car use in VINEX developments in comparison to non-VINEX. ...|$|E
