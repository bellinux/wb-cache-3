40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the identification and}} characterization of the BMH 1 gene from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene encodes a putative protein of 292 amino acids {{which is more than}} 50 % identical with the bovine brain 14 - 3 - 3 protein and proteins isolated from sheep brain which are strong inhibitors of protein kinase C. Disruption mutants and strains with the BMH 1 gene on <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> have impaired growth on minimal medium with glucose as carbon source, i. e. a 30 – 50 % increase in generation time.

40|$|The {{region of}} the Escherichia coli {{chromosome}} coding for the mutD gene was cloned, mutD 5 function resides on a 1. 2 -kilobase fragment coding for a 28 -kilodalton (kDa) protein. A deletion end-point analysis shows {{that the presence of}} the 28 -kDa protein is required for mutD 5 function and suggests that the mutD functional region has sufficient capacity to code for a second polypeptide of approximately 20 kDa. Plasmids carrying the mutD 5 and mut+ alleles both produce the 28 -kDa species. The product of mutD 5 is dominant when carried by single and <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids.</b> The product of mut+ is dominant only on <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Thus, mutD 5 exhibits negative complementation.

40|$|Expression of the tryptophanase (tna) operon in Escherichia coli is {{regulated}} by catabolite repression and transcription attenuation. Expression is {{induced by the}} presence of elevated levels of tryptophan in a growth medium devoid of a catabolite-repressing carbon source. Induction requires the translation of a 24 -residue coding region, tnaC, located in the 319 -nucleotide transcribed leader region preceding tnaA, the structural gene for tryptophanase. <b>Multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> carrying the tnaC leader region were found to inhibit induction of the chromosomal tna operon. Mutational studies established that this inhibition was not due to inhibited transcription initiation, translation initiation, tryptophan transport, or enzyme activity. Rather, <b>multicopy</b> tnaC <b>plasmids</b> inhibited induction by preventing tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination in the leader region of the tna operon. Translation of the single Trp codon in tnaC of the <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> was shown to be essential for this inhibition. We hypothesize that translation of the Trp codon of the leader peptide titrates out a trans-acting factor that is essential for tryptophan-induced antitermination in the chromosomal tna operon.

40|$|When {{the number}} of rRNA (rrn) operons in an Escherichia coli cells is {{increased}} by adding an rrn operon on a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid,</b> the rate of rRNA expression per operon is reduced to maintain a constant concentration of rRNA in the cell. We have used electron microscopy to examine rRNA transcription in cells containing a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid</b> carrying rrnB. We {{found that there were}} fewer RNA polymerase molecules transcribing the rrn genes, as predicted from previous gene dosage studies. Furthermore, RNA polymerase molecules were arranged in irregularly spaced groups along the operon. No apparent pause or transcription termination sites that would account for the irregular spacing of the groups of polymerase molecules were observed. We also found that the overall transcription elongation rate was unchanged when the rrn gene dosage was increased. Our data suggest that when rrn gene dosage is increased, initiation events, or promoter-proximal elongation events, are interrupted at irregular time intervals...|$|E
40|$|Transcription of the {{sporulation}} gene spoVG of Bacillus subtilis is induced at {{the onset}} of spore formation and depends on the products of the regulatory genes spoOA, spoOB, and spoOH. We describe two effects of propagating the promoter region of spoVG on a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid</b> replicon in B. subtilis cells. One effect is that transcription from the plasmid-borne spoVG promoter is altered with respect to the time of its induction and the dependence on spoO gene products. An example of this effect is that plasmid propagation was observed to relieve substantially the inhibitory effect of a mutation in spoOH, the spoO gene upon which spoVG promoter activity is most strongly dependent. We present results which suggest that propagation on a plasmid replicon causes an alteration in the conformation of spoVG promoter DNA which somehow compensates for the defective spoOH gene product. Plasmid propagation did not, however, entirely eliminate the requirement for the spoOH gene product; little or no spoVG-directed RNA synthesis was observed in cells bearing a putative spoOH deletion mutation, a finding which indicates that SpoOH protein plays an indispensable role in spoVG promoter utilization. Another effect of propagating the promoter region of spoVG on a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid</b> is to inhibit sporulation. S 1 nuclease mapping experiments suggest that amplification of spoVG on a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid</b> causes the titration of a transcription factor or minor form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme required for utilization of one of the two overlapping promoters which comprise the spoVG transcription initiation region...|$|E

40|$|The {{products}} of the lexA and recA genes of Escherichia coli regulate the cellular response to DNA damage (the SOS response). Here we describe the cloning of the wild-type lexA gene and the identification of its 24, 000 -dalton protein product. We also describe construction, by recombination in vitro, of a phage that bears the lexA promoter fused to the lacZ gene. Experiments with this fusion phage and with <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> that carry the lexA gene showed that the lexA gene product represses of its own promoter. This repression occurs even if the cell has no recA gene, showing that the lexA protein need not be complexed to the recA protein for activity. Moreover, the presence of <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> that carry the lexA gene blocks expression of all SOS responses tested. This presumably results from two effects: (i) repression of the recA gene, the product of which is required to activate many of these responses; and (ii) direct repression of other functions involved in the SOS response...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{function}} of the Escherichia coli F 1 F 0 -ATPase of the substitution of leucine- 31 by phenylalanine in the c-subunit of the enzyme was examined. The assembly of the mutant c-subunit requires an increased gene dosage [Jans, Fimmel, Langman, James, Downie, Senior, Ash, Gibson & Cox (1983) Biochem. J. 211, 717 - 726], and this was achieved by incorporation of the uncE 408 or uncE 463 alleles on to F-plasmids or <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids.</b> Membranes from strains carrying either the uncE 463 or uncE 408 alleles on F-plasmids or <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> were capable of carrying out oxidative phosphorylation. In particular, membranes from strain AN 1928 (pAN 162, uncE 463) gave phosphorylation rates and P/O ratios equal to or greater than those obtained for the control strain AN 1460 (pAN 45, unc+). However, the mutant membranes, on removal of the F 1 -ATPase, appeared to be proton-impermeable.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants {{containing}} {{different point}} mutations in the HXK 2 gene {{were used to}} study the relationship between phosphorylation by hexokinase II and glucose repression in yeast cells. Mutants showing different levels of hexokinase activity were examined for the degree of glucose repression {{as indicated by the}} levels of invertase activity. The levels of hexokinase activity and invertase activity showed a strong inverse correlation, with a few exceptions attributable to very unstable hexokinase II proteins. The in vivo hexokinase II activity was determined by measuring growth rates, using fructose as a carbon source. This in vivo hexokinase II activity was similarly inversely correlated with invertase activity. Several hxk 2 alleles were transferred to <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> to study the effects of increasing the amounts of mutant proteins. The cells that contained the <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> exhibited less invertase and more hexokinase activity, further strengthening the correlation.

40|$|When {{present on}} a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid,</b> a gene from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library {{suppresses}} the temperature-sensitive cdc 7 - 1 mutation. The gene {{was identified as}} DBF 4, which was previously isolated by complementation in dbf 4 - 1 mutant cells and {{is required for the}} G(1) -> S phase progression of the cell cycle. DBF 4 has an open reading frame encoding 695 amino acid residues and the predicted molecular mass of the gene product is 80 kD. The suppression is allele-specific because a CDC 7 deletion is not suppressed by DBF 4. Suppression is mitosis-specific and the sporulation defect of cdc 7 mutations is not suppressed by DBF 4. Conversely, CDC 7 on a <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmid</b> suppresses the dbf 4 - 1, - 2, - 3 and - 4 mutations but not dbf 4 - 5 and DBF 4 deletion mutations. Furthermore, cdc 7 mutations are incompatible with the temperature-sensitive dbf 4 mutations. These results suggest that the CDC 7 and DBF 4 polypeptides interact directly or indirectly to permit initiation of yeast chromosome replication...|$|E

40|$|The gene {{encoding}} M 2, the ion channel-forming protein {{of influenza}} virus A, was expressed {{under the control}} of an inducible promoter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using single and <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> containing GAL promoter-M 2 fusions, a correlation was observed between plasmid copy number and growth in medium inducing M 2 expression. Cells expressing M 2 from <b>multicopy</b> <b>plasmids</b> have reduced growth rates, suggesting that high levels of M 2 are toxic to growth. The addition of amantadine, a compound known to block the ion channel activity of certain M 2 alleles, restores the growth rates to wild-type levels in cells expressing an amantadine-susceptible allele of M 2 but not an amantadine-resistant allele of M 2, suggesting that M 2 expression in S. cerevisiae results in the formation of functional M 2 ion channels. Measurements of extracellular acidification by microphysiometry suggest that proton efflux in M 2 -expressing cells is altered and that the addition of amantadine permits the reestablishment of the proton gradient. The growth impairment phenotype resulting from M 2 expression was used to develop a high-capacity screening assay which identified a novel inhibitor possessing an antiviral profile similar to that of amantadine...|$|R
