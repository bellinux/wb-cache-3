[...] Coined as a [...] "new brand of hood majesty," [...] {{the song is}} accompanied by a simple beat, which includes finger snaps and [...] "xylophone clings." [...] Lean Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Rap's spitfire explores her softer side, sampling Annie Lennox on her honey-tongued ode to a good man." [...] Greenblatt went on to compare the song to Jay-Z's [...] "kindred" [...] "Young Forever." [...] Minaj makes several references in her lines to well known people, which includes Bruce Willis in Die Hard, as well as Adam and Eve. Minaj makes several connections to Superman including in the pre-chorus, [...] "'S' on my chest, let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> cape on." [...] The official remix featuring Cash Money labelmate Jay Sean was leaked via-internet on August 2, 2010, and later made available for purchase in Australia via iTunes. American rapper Flo Rida released an unofficial remix to the song, in which he adds a verse. Reggae recording artist Sean Paul also did a remix to the song where he ad-libs his verse throughout the original and later adds his own verse. Other remixes to the song include those done by American rapper Rick Ross and American R singer Chris Brown.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Anne, then," [...] he said, [...] "please let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> bearings. I {{understand}} that you were engaged to Harbord--you weren't forced into it, I suppose?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, my Lord; but I am glad {{it should}} be so. My father was not happy about--things here, and charged <b>me</b> to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> {{brothers}} away when I could.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, let's hurry out of here," [...] said Stewart. [...] "You've made {{annoyance}} enough. Ride down to {{the corral}} with <b>me.</b> I'll <b>get</b> <b>my</b> horse and go with you." ...|$|R

6000|$|A {{voice said}} suddenly, [...] "It's done," [...] with such {{emphasis}} that though, of course, she didn't understand the words it {{helped her to}} regain possession of herself; and when Lingard asked her very little above a whisper: [...] "Why don't you say something?" [...] she answered readily, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> breath first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, marm--I am discoursing {{pretty much}} from morning till night, when among my own people, though I own that this conversing rather puts {{me out of}} my reckoning.

6000|$|... "I'm {{not scared}} of dogs," [...] he explained, [...] "but {{that one of}} yours won't let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> about <b>my</b> own house. Besides, I guess he'd eat some of those Chinamen before morning if you leave him loose." ...|$|R

60|$|I promised readily enough. Then he bade <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> tea and he {{sank back}} again into his chair. Once I asked him timidly {{if he were}} not going to have some, but he took no notice. When I had {{finished}} he led me softly upstairs and locked me in my room. Never to this day have I forgotten that dull look of hopeless agony in his face as he turned away and left me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{interests}} you, eh? Ah, well--hot foot I {{went to the}} hall, {{and with}} burning words I called upon those dogs to render satisfaction for the dishonour they had put upon my house. Will you believe, Kenneth, that they denied me? They sheltered their craven lives behind a shield of mock valour.

It was a great dramatic entrance, and to the somewhat doleful prisoner within the sight was sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] I said, [...] "you are amusing {{yourself}} at my expense. When {{you have done}} me a great favour, will you now deny me this small thing?
