In mid-October, attendance was reduced; students were forced to leave school to pick cotton. During the previous interim of 1883, Pickens High School had informally adopted the name “Pickens Institute,” or “Piedmont Institute.” Dedication Day was April 20, 1883 and honored {{the opening of the}} new Victorian-style school building.
