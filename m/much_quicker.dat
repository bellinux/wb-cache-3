After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series from the sidelines.

5|$|Early on August11, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} slightly while crossing Florida. It then decelerated {{and reached the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later. Thereafter, the system began to re-strengthen and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 1200UTC on August12. Early the next day, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 90mph (150km/h). It weakened slightly early on August14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana. At 2100UTC, the storm made landfall near Buras with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Curving northeastward, the hurricane re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico early on August15. However, around 1700UTC, it made another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi at the same intensity. Early on August16, the system weakened to a tropical storm. It then weakened <b>much</b> <b>quicker</b> and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Mississippi at 0000UTC on August17. The remnant extratropical cyclone persisted until late the next day, at which time it dissipated over Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Charley did not weaken while {{moving over}} land; instead, it intensified, {{attaining}} peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina–Virginia border. Within 12 hours of reaching peak intensity, however, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status. The approaching trough, which had previously caused Charley to turn northward, forced the hurricane to accelerate northeastward and later eastward, bringing the storm about 80 mi (130 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts on August 19. As the trough {{was not very}} strong, Charley slowly underwent the process of extratropical transition, unlike other tropical cyclones that complete the transition <b>much</b> <b>quicker</b> with a stronger trough. As a result, the storm maintained hybrid, or subtropical characteristics for several days. By August 21, Charley completed the transition south of Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by moving quickly and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she may run away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate if she is mature, and if she is sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates <b>much</b> <b>quicker</b> than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, females of P. fimbriata do not eat their mates during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and <b>much</b> <b>quicker.</b> Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an Infrared Sulfur Analyzer is set {{to measure}} the {{desulphurization}} degree during thermal decomposition of phosphor-gypsum, which provides a <b>much</b> <b>quick,</b> convenient, continuous and accurate method. It might be considered as {{an effective way to}} study kinetics of phosphor-gypsum (or phosphogypsum) thermal decomposition (or pyrolysis). With the help of this method, the desulphurization degree and desulphurization rate of broadly constituted phosphor-gypsum samples in the temperature range of 1250 - 1400 ℃ were studied. The experimental results show that the desulphurization degree increase with the rising of temperature in the range of 1250 - 1300 ℃ quickly, however, this increase is not obvious when the temperature is above 1300 ℃. Besides, the corresponding regression equations are obtained. The decomposition degree of phosphor-gypsum could be judged according to the regression equations mentioned above...|$|R

To insist on perfect tranquility with an {{absolute}} rejection of violence may mean surrendering {{the right to}} change an unjust social order. On the other hand, to seek justice at any cost may result in bloodshed so great that its evil overshadows everything else and splatters the goal beyond recognition.
