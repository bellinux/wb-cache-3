40|$|The {{performance}} of the data memory hierarchy is extremely important in current and near future high performance superscalar microprocessors. To address the memory gap, computer designers implement caches to reduce the high memory latencies that are observed in the processor. Due to the ever increasing instruction window sizes and issue widths in new microprocessor designs, designers will need to implement <b>multiported</b> caches {{in order to be}} able service multiple memory requests per clock cycle. Several studies have been conducted in previous work dealing with the performance in terms of Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) for such cache designs. However, little is known about the access time, the energy consumption and the required chip area for <b>multiported</b> caches. This paper quantifies these aspects for several <b>multiported</b> cache designs. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multiported</b> {{register}} {{files are}} {{a critical component}} of high-performance superscalar microprocessors. Deeper pipeline speculation and higher instruction-level parallelism (ILP) of current processor designs push a growing requirement on both the number of ports and the number of registers. These increasing demands on register files cause the area of a conventional <b>multiported</b> regfile to grow more than quadratically with issue width [7]. The trend towards simultaneous multithreading (SMT) further increases register count as separate architectural registers are needed for each thread. For example, the proposed eight-issue Alpha 21464 design had a regfile that occupied over five times the area of the 64 KB primary data cache [3]. Hence, we examine the designs of banked <b>multiported</b> register files that consist of multiple interleaved banks of fewer ported register cells to reduce power, area, and access time. In this talk, we will present results that extend our previous work [4] on banked register files to SMT processors. Banked register files designs have been shown to provide sufficient bandwidth for a superscalar machine, but previous proposed designs had complex control structures that would likely limit cycle time and add to design complexity [6, 1, 2].

Banked register files designs have been shown to provide sufficient bandwidth for a superscalar machine, but previous designs had complex control structures that would likely limit cycle time and add to design complexity. We develop a banked register file with much simpler and faster control logic while only slightly increasing the number of ports per bank. We present area, delay, and energy numbers extracted from layouts of the banked register file. For a four-issue superscalar processor, we show that we can reduce area by a factor of three, access time by 20 %, and energy by 40 %, while decreasing IPC by less than 5 %...|$|R

These states are characterized by the fact that, much like composite systems, their entropy equals the sum of entropies of its one-particle substates.
