500|$|However, Hawking {{has also}} {{expressed}} dissatisfaction regarding {{the impact on}} his notoriety caused by his appearance in the episode. In a debate with physicist Brian Cox in The Guardian, Hawking was asked what the most common misconception about his work was. He replied, [...] "People think I'm a Simpsons character." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Peter Hutchison argued that Hawking [...] "feels he is sometimes not properly recognised for his contribution {{to our understanding of}} the universe." [...] In his book The book is dead: long live the book, Sherman Young wrote that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> Hawking from his appearance on The Simpsons, rather than from anything he has written.|$|E
500|$|Many {{homophobic}} slurs {{have caught}} the attention of media outlets. Many adolescents have emulated The Bad Girls Club. Mary Mitchell of Sun Times stated that the show was [...] "hazardous to the female psyche" [...] and wrote, [...] "Just like some teens try to emulate rappers in their dress and behavior, {{the same is true for}} 'bad girls. '" [...] She also commented that the show gives a [...] "distorted picture" [...] of how to live the good life, calling the cast [...] "wannabes" [...] who are [...] "sleeping in a mansion they can't pay for". Mitchell believes that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> the cast are living [...] "a bogus lifestyle", and assesses the message of the Bad Girls Club as [...] "disturbing".|$|E

2500|$|While <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> {{that light}} is {{important}} for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant sensitivity to light {{plays a role in}} the control of plant structural development (morphogenesis).

2500|$|Koizumi was {{at certain}} points in his tenure an {{extremely}} popular leader. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> {{him very well}} due to his trademark wavy grey hair. His outspoken nature and colourful past contributed to that; his nicknames included [...] "Lionheart", due to his hair style and fierce spirit, and [...] "Maverick". During his tenure in office, the Japanese public referred to him as Jun-chan (the suffix [...] "chan" [...] in the Japanese language {{is used as a}} term of familiarity, typically between children, [...] "Jun" [...] is a contraction of Junichiro).

Our state of preparation for the game may be understood when I say that we had indifferent and untrained horses, that the ground was very uneven and covered with huge ant-hills, while the riders were not expert--at least, not at polo.|$|E
60|$|It was, in fact, the twenty-fifth of March, which, as <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> {{to their}} cost, is, {{and has been}} time out of mind, one of those {{unpleasant}} epochs termed quarter-days. On this twenty-fifth of March, it was John Willet's pride annually to settle, in hard cash, his account with a certain vintner and distiller {{in the city of}} London; to give into whose hands a canvas bag containing its exact amount, and not a penny more or less, was the end and object of a journey for Joe, so surely as the year and day came round.|$|E

As <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know,</b> pumice is {{extremely}} light, so that no absolute injury was done to any one, though such rain was excessively trying. Soon, however, a change took place. The dense vapours and dust-clouds which had rendered it so excessively dark were entirely lighted up {{from time to time}} by fierce flashes of lightning which rent as well as painted them in all directions. At one time this great mass of clouds presented the appearance of an immense pine-tree with the stem and branches formed of volcanic lightning.|$|E

Now he has just got an appointment to Hazleford school, in another diocese, with a salary of fifty pounds a year; but, as Charles Hayward would tell you, 'he hasn't got one bit of pride, no more than when he lived up in the hay-loft.' ...|$|E

Assuredly, I was presented to no shabby old man with a goat's horns and tail (something between Pan and an old clothesman), holding conventional receptions, as stupid as those of real life and less decent; but, I came upon other things which appeared to me to have more meaning.|$|E

60|$|<b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>know</b> {{that in the}} {{concoction}} of {{a modern}} novel crime is a more important ingredient than culture. Mr. Hugh Conway certainly knew it, and though for cleverness of invention and ingenuity of construction he cannot be compared to M. Gaboriau, that master of murder and its mysteries, still he fully recognised the artistic value of villainy. His last novel, A Cardinal Sin, opens very well. Mr. Philip Bourchier, M.P. for Westshire and owner of Redhills, is travelling home from London in a first-class railway carriage when, suddenly, through the window enters a rough-looking middle-aged man brandishing a long-lost marriage certificate, the effect {{of which is to}} deprive the right honourable member of his property and estate. However, Mr. Bourchier, M.P., is quite equal to the emergency. On the arrival of the train at its destination, he invites the unwelcome intruder to drive home with him and, reaching a lonely road, shoots him through the head and gives information to the nearest magistrate that he has rid society of a dangerous highwayman.|$|E

This is the feeling in a coal-mine--only more so--much more so, for the darkness is the [...] "gross darkness of the inner sepulchre." [...] It is hard to see which is the black coal and which the passage driven through it. From far away, down the side galleries, comes the regular beat of the pick--thick and muffled as the beat of the labouring heart. [...] "Six men to a gang, and they aren't allowed to work alone. They make six-foot drives through the coal--two and sometimes three men working together. The rest clear away the stuff and load it into the tubs. We have no props in this gallery because we have a roof as good as a ceiling. The coal lies under the sandstone here. It's beautiful sandstone." [...] It was beautiful sandstone--as hard as a billiard table and devoid of any nasty little bumps and jags.|$|E
