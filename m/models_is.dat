5|$|The {{release of}} the {{fourth-generation}} iPad led to the discontinuation of its predecessor, which angered many third-generation iPad users. In response, Apple extended its 14-day return policy to 30 days. ITProPortal noted that, since the price of both <b>models</b> <b>is</b> identical, consumers that purchased the third-generation iPad within this time frame were effectively allowed to exchange their discontinued device for the fourth-generation model.|$|E
40|$|Semi-nonparametric (SNP) <b>models</b> <b>are</b> <b>models</b> {{where only}} a part of the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> parametrized, and the {{non-specified}} part is an unknown function which is represented by an infinite series expansion.

5|$|The {{uncertainty}} of the <b>models</b> <b>is</b> tied to the error margin in hitherto measured parameters: one of the rotational coefficients (J6) {{used to describe the}} planet's gravitational moment, Jupiter's equatorial radius, and its temperature at 1 bar pressure.

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex <b>models</b> <b>is</b> now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. GM (1, 1) <b>model</b> <b>is</b> {{a widely}} used model for forecasting. The {{characteristics}} of the <b>model</b> have <b>been</b> analyzed. The fact that the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> a biased exponential <b>model</b> has <b>been</b> testified. Based on the results, UGM (1, 1) <b>model</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper. The proposed model has more extensive application scope than GM (1, 1) model {{for the reason that}} the model can limit the inherent deviation of GM (1, 1) model. The proposed <b>model</b> <b>is</b> applied to the field of electric load forecasting, the actual results also show that the <b>model</b> <b>is</b> better than GM (1, 1) model. ...|$|R

A model of set theory is often assumed to be transitive unless it is explicitly stated that it <b>is</b> non-standard. Inner <b>models</b> <b>are</b> transitive, transitive <b>models</b> <b>are</b> standard, and standard <b>models</b> <b>are</b> well-founded.|$|R
