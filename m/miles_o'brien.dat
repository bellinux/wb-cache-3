50|$|Competing in the 1960s and 1970s, when {{a winning}} time of less two minutes was the paragon of excellence, on October 1, 1971 Joe O'Brien drove Steady Star to a World Record of 1:52 {{in a time}} trial at The Red Mile. On May 27, 1973 at Solvalla Racetrack in Sweden, O'Brien {{produced}} the first ever sub two-minute mile {{in the history of}} European harness racing when he won the second heat of the world-famous Elitloppet with Flower Child. Over a period of nine days at the October 1970 annual Grand Circuit meeting at Lexington, Kentucky's Red <b>Mile,</b> <b>O'Brien</b> beat the two-minute mile clocking a total of 10 times. Even more remarkable, in 1975 he set a World Record by winning 44 sub-two-minute mile races and 32 two-minute mile races.|$|R
50|$|Chief Petty Officer <b>Miles</b> Edward <b>O'Brien,</b> {{played by}} Colm Meaney, is a {{character}} in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.

5|$|A damaged, {{unidentified}} vessel {{from the}} Gamma Quadrant docks at Deep Space Nine for repairs. Its reptilian pilot, identified only as Tosk (Scott MacDonald), {{is the first}} known life-form from the Gamma Quadrant to visit the station. Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) suspects Tosk is running from something, due to evidence of weapons fire on his vessel. O'Brien befriends Tosk and tries to help him repair his ship. However, Tosk attempts to steal from a weapons locker and is put in a holding cell by Security Chief Odo (René Auberjonois).|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), {{thanks to}} his new-found friend Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson), overhears the Duras sisters {{planning}} to rendezvous with the Bajoran to give him materials {{that could be used}} to build a bomb. The crew allow him to take a runabout and to arrest him after the transaction. Kira finds herself confused about her own past with the Bajoran resistance and where her current loyalties stand, and offers to go with Tahna in the runabout. Commander Sisko and Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) wait in a second runabout nearby while Tahna and Kira complete the transaction. When the second runabout appears, Tahna realizes he has been set up; matters are further complicated by the arrival of the Cardassian warship.|$|E
50|$|Thatching {{began his}} four-year-old {{season in the}} Group Three Earl of Sefton Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket in which he {{finished}} fifth behind his owner's more fancied runner Hawaiian Sound. After being exposed as some way behind the best at longer distances, Thatching was then campaigned over sprint distances and showed much improved form. In May he contested the Group Three over six furlongs at York Racecourse and started at odds of 17/2. Owing to a strike by employees of Racecourse Technical Services the starting stalls were not available and the race had to be started by flag. Thatching was left behind at the start but recovered {{to take the lead}} inside the final furlong, and despite veering to the left in the closing stages he won decisively from Persepolis and the Ayr Gold Cup winner Vaigly Great. Later in the month, Thatching started favourite for the Temple Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse but finished fifth behind Double Form after hanging badly again in the final quarter <b>mile.</b> <b>O'Brien</b> was extremely disappointed with the performance, as the colt had been performing impressively in training.|$|R

50|$|The South Bend Lathe Works was {{established}} in 1906 in South Bend, Indiana by identical twin brothers John J. <b>O'Brien</b> and <b>Miles</b> W. <b>O'Brien.</b> By 1930, the company was building 47% of the engine lathes sold {{each year in the}} United States. In a quarter century, South Bend Lathe Works had become the largest exclusive manufacturer of metalworking precision lathes in the world. In the 1920s through 1960s, South Bend lathes were found in countless machine shops and factories, and they were {{also one of the most}} commonly used brands in vocational schools.|$|R
5|$|Picard pilots {{the shuttle}} {{through the field}} of {{distortion}} pockets. Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) transports the Captain {{back to the ship}} before the shuttle is destroyed. The approach resulted in the Enterprise nearing the edge of the nebula, and they quickly depart. Afterwards, D'Sora reveals to Data over a romantic dinner in his quarters that she broke up with her boyfriend because he was emotionally unavailable and then pursued him because he was the same. Data realises that she is breaking up with him and explains that he will delete the subroutine. D'Sora departs and Data blows out the candles seemingly unperturbed.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) {{is in the}} holosuite {{playing a}} secret agent program in the 1960s. Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) intrudes and convinces Bashir to let him tag along. Meanwhile, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), Lt Cmdr. Worf (Michael Dorn), Lt. Cmdr. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell), Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), and Chief Petty Officer <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) are on a runabout, {{returning}} to Deep Space Nine. As they arrive they find that their vessel has been sabotaged and that a warp core breach is imminent. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Eddington beams them out, but the ship is destroyed during transport and Eddington is forced to store their patterns while he repairs the transporter, but doing so uses {{almost all of the}} station's memory, putting many station systems off-line. Their physical patterns end up in the computer controlling the holosuite, where they appear as characters in Bashir's program.|$|E
5|$|Fearing that Darvin may be {{attempting}} to assassinate Kirk, the crew dress in period uniforms and investigate the Enterprise. They attempt {{to interact with}} history {{as little as possible}} whilst investigating Darvin. The crew does not initially recognize the Klingons of the time period, and when Worf (Michael Dorn) is asked about the difference in appearance, he replies that the matter is not discussed with outsiders. Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) and Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) get involved in a bar brawl between the Enterprise crew and a number of Klingons on shore leave. Captain Kirk disciplines them on the Enterprise alongside Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig). Bashir and O'Brien notice that the ship is covered with tribbles. Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) and Odo (René Auberjonois) detain Darvin and return him to the Defiant. There, Darvin admits that he planted a bomb in a tribble to kill Kirk.|$|E
50|$|When Garak sees a Cardassian boy {{on board}} Deep Space Nine, {{he decides to}} {{introduce}} himself, but the boy, Rugal, bites him on the hand. The boy has been raised by Bajoran parents and taught to hate and fear Cardassians. His adoptive parents claim {{that they do not}} consider him a Cardassian any more, but allegations of abuse lead to an investigation into the family. Gul Dukat tells Sisko that he is trying to bring orphaned Cardassians back from Bajor and that the discovery of Rugal will strengthen his case. <b>Miles</b> and Keiko <b>O'Brien</b> agree to care for Rugal during the investigation, and Rugal helps Miles overcome his prejudice against Cardassians.|$|R
500|$|The {{intention}} was that Ro {{would be one}} of a handful of The Next Generation characters moving over to the new series, alongside <b>Miles</b> and Keiko <b>O'Brien.</b> At this stage, the other characters were only described as a wheelchair-bound science officer, a brash doctor, a civilian law enforcer, a bar owner and the station commander and his son. Ro's position on the station would have been to act as the liaison between the station and the Bajoran government. As described in the series bible, the producers had planned for Ro to be a point of conflict with [...] "by-the-book Starfleet officers". Regarding the other main characters, she was planned to have a friendship with Odo and be mentored by Jadzia Dax.|$|R
2500|$|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (Ford Productions-Paramount, 1962) is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} last great film of Ford's career. It co-starred John Wayne and James Stewart, with Vera <b>Miles,</b> Edmond <b>O'Brien,</b> Andy Devine as the inept marshal Appleyard, Denver Pyle, John Carradine, and Lee Marvin {{in one of his}} first major roles as the brutal Valance, with Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin as his henchmen. It is also notable as the film in which Wayne first used his trademark phrase [...] "Pilgrim" [...] (his nickname for James Stewart's character). It was very successful, grossing over $3million in its first year, although the lead casting stretched credibility—the characters played by Stewart (then 53) and Wayne (then 54) were meant to be in their early 20s, and Ford reportedly considered casting a younger actor in Stewart's role but feared it would highlight Wayne's age. Though it is often claimed that budget constraints necessitated shooting most of the film on soundstages on the Paramount lot, studio accounting records show that this was part of the film's original artistic concept, according to Ford biographer Joseph McBride. According to Lee Marvin in a filmed interview, Ford had fought hard to shoot the film in black-and-white to accentuate his use of shadows. Still, it was one of Ford's most expensive films at US$3.2million.|$|R

25|$|Colm Meaney as <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien.</b> O'Brien is {{an unnamed}} {{helmsman}} in the show's pilot, and appears {{several times in}} other positions during the first season.

25|$|Worf {{was born}} in 2340 on Qo'noS (the Klingon homeworld) {{as the son of}} Mogh. Five years later, his parents moved to the Khitomer colony. Worf's parents were killed during a {{surprise}} attack by the Romulans on the Khitomer outpost. The colony's distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS Intrepid. Chief Petty Officer Sergey Rozhenko found Worf in the rubble and took him in after failing to find any living relatives. Rozhenko and his wife Helena raised him on a small farm colony on the planet Gault, a world of about 20,000 inhabitants, almost all of them human. Worf also has a human brother, Nikolai, with whom he often quarreled. He also spent time on Earth in his parents' native city of Minsk, later recommending it to <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> as one of his favorite places on Earth.|$|E
40|$|Both {{within and}} without oral studies, {{scholars}} have begun to examine the intimate relations between what have seemed to some strange bedfellows: oral theory and critical theory. Mark C. Amodio has recently called attention to these relations, observing that “Oral theory and contemporary critical theory share many basic principles, engage many similar issues, and ask many closely related questions ” (1998 : 97). Amodio acknowledges that this sense of commonality {{has been slow to}} emerge, a fact he attributes to two main causes: the narrowness of some oral-formulaic work and ignorance about oral theory among non-specialists (96). A major obstacle to a wider awareness of shared interests has been the long-held belief, among oralists and non-oralists alike, in the “Great Divide”: the chasm that supposedly divides oral art and culture from literate art and culture (103). With the bridging of this divide by such scholars as A. N. Doane, John <b>Miles</b> Foley, Katherine <b>O’Brien</b> O’Keeffe, Alain Renoir, Brian Stock, and others, a new perception of the relation between the oral and th...|$|R
5000|$|The {{start of}} the 2006 flat season saw George Washington confirm his {{juvenile}} promise by easily winning the 2,000 Guineas on Newmarket's Rowley <b>Mile</b> to give <b>O'Brien</b> his fourth win in the race. While George Washington disappointed in the Irish equivalent, he redeemed himself in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. Dylan Thomas also made his mark in the top middle distance races in Europe. After going close in the Epsom Derby, he {{was found to be}} more effective under a patient Kieren Fallon ride in the Irish Derby. Dylan Thomas also showed his battling qualities in the Irish Champion Stakes, where he beat the Champion mare Ouija Board by a neck. Other 2006 highlights came through Alexandrova who dominated the middle distance fillies classics taking in the Epsom Oaks, Irish Oaks and Yorkshire Oaks. The end of season saw the juvenile Holy Roman Emperor take the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère on Arc day at Longchamp. In one of the races of the season he was beaten by a head in the Dewhurst Stakes by European Champion 2-year-old Teofilo. Much anticipation centred on the expected rematch of these two colts in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket the following spring. Aidan finished the season with prizemoney of over €6.5m in Ireland and Great Britain. The season was marked however by the emerging race fixing allegations involving stable jockey Kieren Fallon. On 3 July 2006, Fallon was charged along with 7 other people for conspiring to defraud clients of the internet betting exchange Betfair. Fallon was one of 28 people answering bail at Bishopsgate police station in the City of London in connection with the inquiry. In a released police statement, he was described as being charged with [...] "offences relating to allegations of fixing the outcome of horse races between 1 December 2002 and 2 September 2004, and money laundering". He was amongst three jockeys charged, along with Darren Williams and Fergal Lynch, all of whom had their licences to ride in Britain suspended, effectively under the principle that they would be guilty until found innocent. Fallon's problems were further compounded when on 29 November 2006 the French racing authority France Galop suspended Fallon for six months after he tested positive for a metabolite of a banned substance.|$|R
25|$|As {{the shuttle}} program {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe {{was chosen as the}} first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> to fly on the space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled {{in the wake of the}} Columbia disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle.|$|E
25|$|The STS-134 crew {{installed}} the AMS-2 on flight day 4. AMS-2 was lifted out of Endeavours payload bay using the Canadarm, operated by Drew Feustel and Roberto Vittori. It was handed off to Canadarm2, which was operated by Greg Chamitoff and Greg Johnson, and {{was installed in}} its final location on the S3 truss segment at 09:46 UTC. Immediately after the installation, crews on the ground began activating the experiment. The installation of the AMS-2 marked {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment of the International Space Station. Later in the day, Greg Chamitoff, Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke prepared the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) that Chamitoff and Feustel would wear during their spacewalk on flight day 5. The trio was also assisted by commander Mark Kelly in preparing the tools required for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA). While this was going on, Expedition 27 crew members Paolo Nespoli, Cady Coleman and Ron Garan assisted the rest of the STS-134 crew in completing transfers to and from Endeavour. Late in the crew day, the two crews performed an EVA procedures review. After the review, Chamitoff and Feustel camped out in the Quest Airlock overnight, in preparation for the mission's first spacewalk. The campout was done with the airlock's air pressure reduced, so as to purge nitrogen bubbles from the astronauts' blood and thus prevent decompression sickness. Members of both crews also conducted two in-flight interviews with media on the ground, including PBS NewsHour, National Public Radio, Associated Press, Reuters and Fox News. The crew also answered questions that were relayed up to them by <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> for Google.|$|E
500|$|Colm Meaney {{was cast}} {{in the part of}} the conn ensign on the ship's battle bridge, and after a further {{appearance}} in the episode [...] "Lonely Among Us", his character was given the name <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> in season two.|$|E

Following the airing of the episode, fans wrote in to complain about a scene referencing cannibalism. Reviews were mostly negative, with criticism directed at the writing in particular.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} the third appearance of de Lancie as Q after [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] and [...] "Hide and Q", {{the latter of}} which had been written by Hurley under a pseudonym. Lycia Naff was introduced as Ensign Sonia Gomez, who was intended to be a recurring character {{in the same manner as}} Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> played by Colm Meaney (who also appeared in this episode). However, Naff only made one further appearance as Gomez, in the following episode, although the character later appeared in the Starfleet Corps of Engineers series of novellas.|$|E
500|$|... "Captive Pursuit" [...] is {{the sixth}} {{episode of the}} [...] of the American science fiction {{television}} series [...] The episode was written by executive producer Michael Piller and Jill Sherman Donner, and was directed by Corey Allen. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this episode, Tosk (Scott MacDonald) arrives on the station and befriends Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney), but is soon pursued by the Hunter (Gerrit Graham), who follows him through the wormhole.|$|E
500|$|Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) {{returns from}} the Gamma Quadrant in her runabout with a woman that Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) recognizes as Vash (Jennifer Hetrick) from his time on board the Enterprise. Although the crew is unaware of his presence, Q (John de Lancie) [...] a nearly omnipotent prankster [...] has also stowed away on the runabout. Vash {{explains}} that she {{has spent the past}} two years in the Gamma Quadrant, but she describes her method of getting there as a [...] "private matter". During their trip back to Deep Space Nine, the vessel undergoes a series of unusual power drains.|$|E
500|$|... "Rascals" [...] was not {{a popular}} episode with the staff, with {{scientific}} advisor Naren Shankar deriding the science proposed for the script. Several of the guest cast had appeared in other roles within the series before; David Tristan Birkin, Mike Gomez, Tracey Walter and Michael Snyder. The episode also marked the final appearance within the series for Rosalind Chao as Keiko O'Brien and the only appearance of Hana Hatae as Molly O'Brien. The episode received a Nielsen Rating of 13.5 percent, and received a mixed response from critics. The scene with Keiko and <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> was praised, while the Ferengi were seen in {{both positive and negative}} lights.|$|E
500|$|In a subplot, <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> (Colm Meaney) {{is faced}} with the {{increasingly}} uncomfortable situation of Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) carrying his baby and living {{with him and his}} wife, Keiko (Rosalind Chao) (see [...] ). The two begin to develop feelings of attraction, which are apparent to both Doctor Bashir and Odo (René Auberjonois), though Keiko remains oblivious. O'Brien and Kira try to avoid growing closer, but Keiko insists that O'Brien accompany Kira on a brief retreat to Bajor. As their shuttle is about to depart, Kira reveals that their destination is in a highly romantic setting, which prompts Miles to back out of the trip; Kira also changes her plans and decides to visit her lover, , instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to save money {{at the end of}} the season by being a bottle episode which featured few additional characters. The only guest star was Colm Meaney as recurring character Chief <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien.</b> The reason was that the show had overspent on the episodes [...] "Elementary, Dear Data" [...] and [...] "Q Who", and Paramount Pictures was holding the series to their overall season budget. It was the last episode on which Maurice Hurley acted as head writer; he referred to the episode as a [...] "piece of shit" [...] and [...] "terrible, just terrible". He turned in the idea of a cheap clip show to save money and wrote the first draft of the script, with Richard Manning and Hans Beimler conducting re-writes.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book Deep Space and Sacred Time: Star Trek in the American Mythos state that the episode [...] "Deadlock," [...] which {{featured}} the death of Kim, {{was one of several}} examples in the Star Trek franchise where the death of a major character is reversed by a parallel existence. Other examples included in The Next Generation with the return of Tasha Yar in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] and the death of <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> in the Deep Space Nine episode [...] "". They felt that Kim also shared another similarity with [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise" [...] in that in the episode [...] "Non Sequitur", he feels that reality has been changed – which was similar to the experience that Guinan felt in The Next Generation episode.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2013. Handlen remarked on the episode's farcical title and content, noting that the script was largely without substance. However, he granted that the episode served as a welcome change of pace from the ongoing [...] "agonies of war" [...] in the series. He notes that the main plot involving Grilka was [...] "wafer thin" [...] but nonetheless effective in creating humor and introducing the relationship between Dax and Worf. Still, Handlen thought Worf's strong attraction to Grilka lacked sufficient justification, given Worf's long-standing desire to maintain solitude on the station. In addition, Handlen disliked the subplot concerning <b>Miles</b> <b>O'Brien</b> and Major Kira, suggesting that the romantic tension between the two was forced and inconsistent with their personalities.|$|E
500|$|Several future [...] alumni also {{appeared}} in the first season of The Next Generation, although not in roles in which they later featured. These included Armin Shimerman as a wedding box in [...] "" [...] and as Letek in [...] "" [...] (he later appeared as other Ferengi before gaining the main cast role of Quark in Deep Space Nine). Marc Alaimo appeared as an Antican in [...] "Lonely Among Us", before appearing in different makeup as the Romulan Captain Tebok in the first-season finale [...] ""; he later appeared as the Cardassian Gul Macet in The Next Generation [...] episode [...] "" [...] and was later cast as the recurring character of Gul Dukat in Deep Space Nine.
