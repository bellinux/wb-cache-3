To increase accuracy further, any residual thermoelectric voltages generated by different wire types or screwed connections are eliminated by reversal of {{the direction of the}} 1 mA current and the leads to the DVM (digital voltmeter). The thermoelectric voltages will be produced in one direction only. By averaging the reversed measurements, the thermoelectric error voltages are cancelled out.|$|E
