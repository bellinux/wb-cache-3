5000|$|Łochów [...] {{is a town}} in the <b>Mazowieckie</b> <b>voivodship,</b> in the Węgrowskim district, {{the seat}} of the urban-rural gmina Łochów. In the years 1975-1998 the city {{administratively}} belonged to the Siedlce Voivodeship. According to data from 31 December 2005, the city had 6,654 inhabitants. Łochów is located {{on the banks of the}} Liwiec River, adjacent to the large Łochowskie forest.|$|E
40|$|In the <b>Mazowieckie</b> <b>voivodship,</b> as {{in whole}} Poland, there are {{numerous}} now formally rural settlements, which used to have urban status in the past. Some {{of them have been}} degraded not only in the formal-legal sense – they have also lost the specific attributes of urbanity. Some of these localities, however, have retained a number of urban characteristics, and therefore they have real chances to regain urban status. The aim of the study is to characterize the degraded towns, taking into account, among other aspects, their demography, functions and morphology. Some villages have been pointed to have chances to recover their urban status...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} local {{development}} remains a crucial one, {{especially in the}} context of European Union membership and its support funds. The multidimensional character of local development makes it a subject of interest not only to economists, but also geographers, sociologists and statisticians. The aim of the paper is to present differences in the level of socio-economic development of semi-urban and rural gminas in Poland and to find clusters of gminas with a similar level of development. Hellwig’s method was used to compare 2, 174 gminas, which showed large development disparities. There is a clear boundary between Eastern Poland with <b>Mazowieckie</b> <b>Voivodship,</b> where the country’s capital, Warsaw, is located, and Western Poland. gminas {{with a high level of}} development were observed usually on Poland’s Baltic coast and suburban areas of Warsaw, Szczecin, Poznań, Wrocław and Kraków. Low level gminas were mostly situated in the peripheries of the eastern voivodships...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{works were}} carried out at the Agricultural Experimental Station of Agricultural University in Chylice, <b>Mazowieckie</b> <b>voivodship.</b> Diseases, their causal agents and occurrence on winter wheat cv. Kobra and cv. Mikon were studied in 1999 - 2001. Observations were performed in field conditions, on plots treated with fungicides and untreated control plots. Studies were concetrated {{on the most important}} pathogenic fungi occurring on winter wheat leaves, ears and stem bases, especiaIly Puccinia recondita on leaves (45 % of infected leaf area), Stagonospora nodorum on ears (24 % of infected ear area), Mollisia (Tapesia) yallundae (infection index 29) and Fusarium spp. (54 % of infection culms) on stem bases. It has been proved that susceptibility to same diseases is strongly connected with cultivar and weather conditions. Average grain yield losses during three years period of study amounted: 1999 - 21, 68 %, 2000 - 7, 34 % and 2001 - 53, 15 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|It is {{said that}} natural {{environment}} consists less then 10 % of the Earth surface. Our surroundings is, in fact, anthropogenic, i. e. created and modified by humans. The civilization development unavoidably results in certain changes in various elements of nature. At the moment Poland is {{on the eve of}} acceleration of its economic and social activities. Their scale and directions are described in National strategic reference framework 2007 - 2013. On the regional scale the twin document is The Integrated Regional Operational Program. The necessity of the growth of the competitiveness of country and the regions and citizens' quality of life improvement should not mean the plundering and uncontrolled interference in natural ecosystems. The aim of the paper is to present how one of the priorities of the Regional Operational Program for <b>Mazowieckie</b> <b>Voivodship</b> can influence environment. The analysis is conducted on the priority Creation of the Conditions for Innovation Potential and Business Development. It was selected because of its importance and strong correlations with new agenda of Lisbon Strategy.
