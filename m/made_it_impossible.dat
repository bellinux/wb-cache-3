5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to cross the}} line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1974, before the Turkish occupation, Nea Salamina signed Bulgarian coach Iancho Arsov, {{who went on to}} win titles with Omonia decades later. The {{agreement}} was canceled when financial problems caused by the team's refugee status <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to pay for a foreign coach.|$|E
5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division's {{lines of}} {{communication}} were now fully extended, and the difficulties of supplying the mounted troops from Romani <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for the British Empire mounted force to consider any further advance at that time. Arrangements were made to hold and garrison the country decisively won by this series of indecisive engagements, from Katia eastwards to Bir El Abd.|$|E
50|$|The first legislature, {{dominated}} by Democratic party members, passed legislation that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> for African-Americans to seek elective office.|$|R
50|$|London still haven't won a match {{this season}} and their defeat against Warrington has now <b>made</b> <b>it</b> mathematically <b>impossible</b> to avoid relegation.|$|R
50|$|Captives, like Shaker Aamer, {{have told}} their {{attorneys}} that the solid steel walls <b>made</b> <b>it</b> practically <b>impossible</b> {{for them to}} talk with one another.|$|R
5|$|Alcoholism {{and poor}} health afflicted Clark during his final years. In 1809 he {{suffered}} a severe stroke. When he fell into an operating fireplace, Clark suffered a burn on his right leg that was so severe {{it had to be}} amputated. The injury <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for Clark to continue to operate his mill and live independently. As a result, he moved to Locust Grove, a farm eight miles (13km) from the growing town of Louisville, and {{became a member of the}} household of his sister, Lucy, and brother-in-law, Major William Croghan, a planter.|$|E
5|$|Although cinematographer Clyde DaVinna is {{credited}} with the cinematography, additional footage was shot by George Gordon Nogle, Josiah Roberts, and Leonard Smith. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin claims he shot {{a few of the}} scenes with Eskimo women when coverage was found to be lacking. Numerous days of shooting were lost in the summer when strong sunlight <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to film. To reduce glare from the snow, most of the sets were sprayed with pink paint from the air.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{for him to do}} so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
50|$|While Massacre doesn't {{have any}} {{traditional}} super-powers, an accident <b>made</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> {{for him to}} feel any emotion. Massacre also has a genius level intellect.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{overpass}} was considered innovative at the time; however, this design <b>made</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> to inspect thoroughly, as the entire deck {{would have had to}} be removed for such an inspection.|$|R
5000|$|Marlon Bain, {{a former}} E.T.A. {{student who was}} close to Orin. His Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> {{for him to leave}} his apartment. Steeply {{contacts}} him for information about Orin and the Incandenzas.|$|R
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E
5|$|Conflicting reports {{initially}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to determine}} {{who had made the}} first kill, which would be the first North Korean plane shot down by the United Nations forces in the war. Later research indicated Hudson had successfully shot down the first aircraft. The exact timing of Hudson and Moran's victories remains unclear, and it is possible each scored a victory within seconds of the other. For his determination in leading the flight, though, Little was awarded a Silver Star Medal.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{aircraft}} was left on the mountain since constant changing weather cycles <b>made</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> to retrieve the debris, most of {{it has now been}} washed away into deeper parts of the mountain range.|$|R
50|$|Bradford's defeat against Huddersfield has now <b>made</b> <b>it</b> mathematically <b>impossible</b> {{to remain}} in the Super League next season. This is the first time, in 40 years, that Bradford will not be playing in England's top rugby league competition.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with most}} {{moveable}} bridges on railway lines, Bridge 15 {{was protected by}} interlocking. This system <b>made</b> <b>it</b> physically <b>impossible</b> to have a signal indicating to trains that {{it was clear to}} proceed when the bridge was open.|$|R
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to for him to assault V. N. {{as described in the}} police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2â€“1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy. MacLaren {{believed that the}} choices of the selectors had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to win, and continued {{to write about the}} series for many years. He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for Democrats to win.|$|E
50|$|During World War I the Central Powers, {{most notably}} Germany, were {{blockaded}} by the Entente Powers. In particular the North Sea blockade <b>made</b> <b>it</b> nearly <b>impossible</b> for surface ships to leave Germany for the then neutral United States and other locations.|$|R
50|$|On 19 April 2009, Mons were relegated after Dender beat Roeselare 3-1 and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> mathematically <b>impossible</b> for Mons {{to climb}} into 16th {{position}} or higher. Tubize were relegated on 3 May 2009 after a 1-1 draw at home to Anderlecht.|$|R
5000|$|Parramatta's loss <b>made</b> <b>it</b> mathematically <b>impossible</b> {{for them}} to avoid their first wooden spoon since 1972, after Penrith had beaten the Titans the day before to go 2 wins clear and kill off the Titans finals {{aspirations}} in the process.|$|R
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> {{for the government to}} enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was no basis {{in the words of the}} Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on 5 January 1922, while Quest was {{anchored}} at South Georgia. After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land, was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild, and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to land.|$|E
5|$|The couple then {{journeyed to}} Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the {{presence}} of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for them to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.|$|E
6000|$|Some base {{streak of}} {{competitiveness}} in Mr. Britling's nature <b>made</b> <b>it</b> seem <b>impossible</b> {{that he should}} relinquish the lady to Oliver. Besides, then, {{what would he do}} with his dull days, his afternoons, his need for a properly demonstrated affection? ...|$|R
25|$|These rules <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{practically}} <b>impossible</b> {{to convict}} any woman of adultery; {{in nearly every}} case, women were acquitted. However, due {{to the belief that}} a priest should be untainted, a Kohen was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.|$|R
50|$|It is {{an offence}} under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{to listen to}} police radio in the UK. The move from open {{analogue}} to the encrypted digital Airwave system in the UK has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> practically <b>impossible</b> to just listen in to police radio.|$|R
5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, without creating a corresponding movement {{in each of the}} others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, and installation of a third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The electrified third rail <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> for passengers to cross at track level, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
50|$|What is now {{the breakfast}} room was {{previously}} known as the death room. After a family memberâ€™s death, caskets were brought {{through the door of}} this room because the design of the house <b>made</b> <b>it</b> almost <b>impossible</b> to navigate caskets through the front door.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Reid said, at 1965 AC 269, 324: [...] "The respondents' action <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{practically}} <b>impossible</b> for the appellants {{to do any}} {{new business}} with the barge hirers." [...] It was not disputed that such interference is tortious if any unlawful means are employed.|$|R
