5|$|Whatever {{his sources}} may have been, the immense {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae cannot be denied. Well over 200 manuscript copies of Geoffrey's Latin work {{are known to}} have survived, and this does not include translations into other languages. Thus, for example, around 60 manuscripts are extant containing Welsh-language versions of the Historia, the earliest of which were created in the 13th century; the old notion that some of these Welsh versions actually underlie Geoffrey's Historia, advanced by antiquarians such as the 18th-century Lewis Morris, has long since been discounted in academic circles. As a result of this popularity, Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae was enormously influential on the later medieval development of the Arthurian legend. While it was by no <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> creative force behind Arthurian romance, many of its elements were borrowed and developed (e.g., Merlin and the final fate of Arthur), and it provided the historical framework into which the romancers' tales of magical and wonderful adventures were inserted.|$|E

25|$|When {{a person}} {{performs}} two tasks simultaneously or in overlapping fashion, the BOLD response {{is expected to}} add linearly. This is a fundamental assumption of many fMRI studies. Linear addition <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> operation allowed on the individual responses before they are combined (added together) is a separate scaling of each. Since scaling is just multiplication by a constant number, this means an event that evokes, say, twice the neural response as another, can be modeled as the first event presented twice simultaneously. The HDR for the doubled-event is then just double that of the single event.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, {{it must be}} {{understood}} that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure {{to bring an end}} to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only.</b> Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the Sassanid era. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records.|$|E
25|$|This axiomatization {{is by no}} <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one, or even {{necessarily}} the most natural given {{that we did not}} pay attention to whether some of the axioms followed from others but simply chose to stop when we noticed we had enough laws, treated further in the section on axiomatizations. Or the intermediate notion of axiom can be sidestepped altogether by defining a Boolean law directly as any tautology, understood as an equation that holds for all values of its variables over 0 and 1. All these definitions of Boolean algebra can be shown to be equivalent.|$|E

From 1988 on, PCBoard systems were able to host similar {{functionality}} known as RelayNet, while other popular networks included RBBSNet from the Commodore 64 world, and AlterNet. Late {{in the evolution of}} the FidoNet system, there was a proposal to allow mail (but not forum messages) from these systems to switch into the FidoNet structure. This was not adopted, and the rapid rise of the internet made this superfluous as these networks rapidly added internet exchange, which acted as a lingua franca.|$|E

In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be {{measured in terms of}} its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{names are}} a well-studied example of surname extinction: there are {{currently}} only about 3,100 surnames in use in China, compared with close to 12,000 recorded in the past, with 22% of the population sharing the names Li, Wang and Zhang (numbering close to 300 million people), and the top 200 names covering 96% of the population. Names have changed or become extinct for various reasons such as people taking {{the names of their}} rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, among others. While family name lines dying out may be a factor in the surname extinction, it is by no <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> or even a significant factor. Indeed, the most significant factor affecting the surname frequency is other ethnic groups identifying as Han and adopting Han names. Further, while new names have arisen for various reasons, this has been outweighed by old names disappearing.|$|E
25|$|Persepolis {{was by no}} <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{large scale}} Achaemenid project, as Susa also hosted a similar {{structure}} initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, {{and the fact that}} it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of Naqsh-e Rustam, the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire. Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son Xerxes the Great, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion.|$|E

25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E
25|$|While CEN 1789:2007 {{represents}} the current European {{standard for the}} design of ambulances, it is by no <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> example of such a standard. Standards for ambulance design have existed in the United States since 1976, where the standard is known as KKK-1822-A. This standard has been revised several times, and is currently in version 'F', known as KKK-1822-F. As with the European system, only the most current version of the standard should be used. One of the first known standards for ambulance design occurred in London, England, as the result of efforts by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, acting in response to the cholera outbreak of 1832. While horse-drawn, this provided the actual standard for many of the earliest civilian ambulances around the world. More contemporary versions of ambulance design standards also exist at a local level in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In each case, the country or jurisdiction develops such standards based upon its own needs, priorities, and realities, and this is also true of the European standard. In some cases, standards compliance may not be planned, and may occur as an incidental result of normal operations. To illustrate, a small country has no domestic ambulance manufacturers, but imports its vehicles from a larger country in which the manufacturer must comply with a published standard. In most cases, the ambulances imported by the smaller country will end up complying with the larger country's standard, {{regardless of whether or not}} this outcome was intended. American and Australian standards were reviewed and considered during the development of the European standard, but were not precisely followed because European needs and priorities were different.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal were by no <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> team to {{have come}} {{up with the idea of}} {{dropping}} the centre half into defence – Newcastle United beat Arsenal 7–0 that season employing such a system with Charlie Spencer at centre-half; Queen's Park and Tottenham Hotspur had also adopted similar systems. Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence. Chapman himself summed it up by saying: [...] "the most opportune time for scoring is immediately after repelling an attack, because opponents are then strung out in the wrong half of the field." ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, his obituary in The Guardian commented that: Kneale was by no <b>means</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> author to have been largely wasted by television, and to have seen his status overtaken by soap opera hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss, as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.|$|E
