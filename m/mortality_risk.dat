This study compared the <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> of female nurses and general patients with diabetes and elucidated factors that caused this difference. Methods A total of 510, 058 female patients newly diagnosed with diabetes between 1998 and 2006 as recorded in the National Health Insurance Research Database were {{the participants in this}} study. Nurses with diabetes and general population with diabetes were matched with propensity score method in a 1 : 10 ratio. The participants were tracked from the date of diagnosis to 2009. The Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to compare the <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> in the two groups. Results Nurses were newly diagnosed with diabetes at a younger age compared with the general public (42. 01 [*]±[*] 12. 03 y vs. 59. 29 [*]±[*] 13. 11 y).

25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> is related to the evolution of polyandry.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To empirically {{test the}} salmon bias hypothesis, {{which states that}} the 'healthy migrant' effect - {{referring}} to {{a situation in which}} migrants enjoy lower <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> compared to natives - is caused by selective return migration of the weak, sick and elderly. Methods: Using a unique longitudinal micro-level database - the Historical Sample of the Netherlands - we tracked the life courses of internal migrants after they had left the city of Rotterdam, which allowed us to compare <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> of stayers, returnees and movers using survival analysis for the study group as a whole, and also for men and women separately. Results: While migrants who stayed in the receiving society had significantly higher <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> than natives, no significant difference was found for migrants who returned to their municipality of birth (returnees). By contrast, migrants who left for another destination (movers) had much lower <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> than natives. Natives who left Rotterdam also had significantly lower <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> compared to natives who stayed in Rotterdam. Migrants who stayed in the receiving urban society paid a longterm health price, particularly strong for female migrants.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Purpose of {{this study}} is to provide {{detailed}} age- and gender-specific <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> of patients hospitalized for elective AAA repair. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Whether to perform elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery is balancing the risks of natural history against the risks of surgical intervention. Literature is lacking <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> after elective AAA repair with stratification by both age and gender. METHODS: <b>Mortality</b> <b>risks</b> for 28 days, 1 year, and 5 years were derived from a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized for elective AAA repair in 1997 or 2000. This cohort was formed through linkage of the Hospital Discharge Register with the Dutch Population Register. The relations between demographics, medical history and mortality were studied by Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 3457 patients were identified; 86 % males, mean age 72 +/- 8. 0 years. <b>Mortality</b> <b>risks</b> after elective AAA repair increased with age: 28 -day mortality ranged from 3. 3 % to 27. 1 % in men and 3. 8 % to 54. 3 % in women, 5 -year mortality from 12. 9 % to 78. 1 % in men and 24. 3 % to 91. 3 % in women.

40|$|Background: Knowledge {{of spatial}} and {{temporal}} distributions of mortality and morbidity is important to prioritise areas for adjusting the public health system where people need services most. A Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) {{plays an important role}} where accurate national vital events are not available in identifying areas and periods with excess <b>mortality</b> <b>risks.</b> Methods: The HDSS in Matlab, a rural area of Bangladesh, provided data on yearly number of deaths and children aged below 5 years for each of 90 villages during 1998 &#x 2013; 2007, along with village location points, longitudes and latitudes. Kulldorff&#x 0027;s space&#x 2013;time scan statistic was used to identify villages and periods that experienced high <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> in the HDSS area with a statistical significance of p&# 60; 0. 001. Logistic regression was conducted to examine if village-level education and economic status explained village-level <b>mortality</b> <b>risks.</b> Results: There were 3, 434 deaths among children aged below 5 years in the HDSS area during 1998 &#x 2013; 2007 with an average yearly rate of 13 deaths per 1, 000 under-five child-years. The mortality rate showed a declining trend with high concentration in 1998 &#x 2013; 2002, but not in 2003 &#x 2013; 2007. Two clusters of villages had significantly higher <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> in 1998 &#x 2013; 2002, but not later, and the <b>mortality</b> <b>risks</b> in the high-risk clusters reduced little, but remained significant after controlling for adult education and economic status at village level. Conclusions: Spatial clustering of childhood mortality observed during 1998 &#x 2013; 2002 had disappeared in subsequent years with a decline in mortality rates.

500|$|Obesity {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{preventable}} causes of death worldwide. A number of reviews have found that <b>mortality</b> <b>risk</b> is lowest at a BMI of 20–25kg/m2 in non-smokers and at 24–27kg/m2 in current smokers, with risk increasing along with changes in either direction. This appears to apply in at least four continents. In contrast, a 2013 review found that grade 1 obesity (BMI 30-35) was not associated with higher mortality than normal weight, and that overweight (BMI 25-30) was associated with [...] "lower" [...] mortality than was normal weight (BMI 18.5-25). Other evidence suggests that the association of BMI and waist circumference with mortality is U- or J-shaped, while the association between waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-height ratio with mortality is more positive. In Asians the risk of negative health effects begins to increase between 22–25kg/m2. A BMI above 32kg/m2 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among women over a 16-year period.
