40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to assess if women with arrested preterm labor (PTL) have an {{increased}} risk of preterm delivery (PTD) compared with healthy pregnant women, and if digital examination, fetal fibronectin (fFn) and cervical length (CL) are prognostic markers for PTD after arrested PTL. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective-matched cohort study among women with arrested PTL (cases) and healthy pregnant women (controls). RESULTS: We included 74 index cases and 74 controls. PTD occurred in 20 (27 %) index cases and in 5 (7 %) controls (hazard ratio [HR], 4. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 7 - 12). A dilatation of the cervix[*]≥[*] 1 cm (HR, 9. 1 [95 % CI, 3. 3 - 25], an fFn positive status (HR, 13 [95 % CI, 4. 3 - 40]), and a CL[*]<[*] 15 [*]mm (HR, 11 [95 % CI, 3. 1 - 38]) increased this risk in cases compared with controls. Knowledge of the fFn result had additional value over the cervical dilatation or CL in the prediction of persistent PTD, with an increased risk in case of a positive fFn test. CONCLUSION: Women stay at increased risk for PTD after arrested PTL. This risk further increased in case of[*]≥[*] 1 cm cervical dilatation, CL[*]<[*] 15 [*]mm and/or a positive fFn status. Femke F.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} costs of {{induction}} of labor and expectant management in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). DESIGN: Economic analysis based on a randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Obstetric departments of eight academic and 52 non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. POPULATION: Women with PPROM near term who were not in labor 24  h after PPROM. METHODS: A cost-minimization analysis was done from a health care provider perspective, using a bottom-up approach to estimate resource utilization, valued with unit-costs reflecting actual costs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary health outcome was the incidence of neonatal sepsis. Direct medical costs were estimated from start of randomization to hospital discharge of mother and child. RESULTS: Induction of labor did not significantly reduce the probability of neonatal sepsis [2. 6 % vs. 4. 1 %, relative risk 0. 64 (95 % confidence interval 0. 25 - 1. 6) ]. Mean costs per woman were € 8094 for induction and € 7340 for expectant management (difference € 754; 95 % confidence interval - 335 to 1802). This difference predominantly originated in the postpartum period, where the mean costs were € 5669 for induction vs. € 4801 for expectant management. Delivery costs were higher in women allocated to induction than in women allocated to expectant management (€ 1777 vs. € 1153 per woman). Antepartum costs in the expectant management group were higher because of longer antepartum maternal stays in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In women with pregnancies complicated by PPROM near term, induction of labor does not reduce neonatal sepsis, whereas costs associated with this strategy are probably higher. Sylvia M.

5000|$|<b>Martina</b> <b>M.</b> Cartwright, {{an adjunct}} {{professor}} of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Arizona, states in her article on child beauty pageants, “many experts agree that participation in activities that focus on physical appearance {{at an early age}} can influence teen and/or adult self-esteem, body image and self-worth. Issues with self-identity after a child [...] "retires" [...] from the pageant scene in her teens are not uncommon. Struggles with perfection, dieting, eating disorders and body image can take their toll in adulthood”. Mothers are usually involved in their child's participation in pageants, so there's a lot of information regarding their outlook on the contests. Social worker Mark Sichel believes that many mothers [...] "push their daughters into pageants because of their own low self-esteem, or as compensation for a perceived lack of attention and admiration in their own lives". As a result of these mother's constant pushing, many of these young girls feel as if they let their mothers down by losing. To pull from a fathers point of view, an internet blog, [...] "The Father Factor", has an interesting perspective on the topic of child beauty pageants. One father writes, [...] "the mothers of the young pageant contestants all push their girls, some young as two, to emotional and physical limits. They parade the little girls around in makeup, big hairdos, and even bathing suits...I don’t see how a beauty pageant, especially at such young ages, promotes anything other than vanity." [...] In France, after a 10-year-old girl was featured on the cover of Vogue Paris in an inappropriate outfit- not fit for a child, lawmakers banned child beauty pageants all together.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether tocolysis with nifedipine can be omitted {{in women with}} symptoms of preterm labor, a shortened cervix, and negative fetal fibronectin test. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized noninferiority trial was performed in all Dutch perinatal centers. Women with symptoms of preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks, intact membranes, cervical length between 10 and 30 mm, and negative fibronectin test were randomly allocated to nifedipine (80 mg/day) or placebo. The primary outcome was delivery within 7 days. Secondary outcomes were severe neonatal morbidity and mortality. We also followed all eligible nonrandomized women. RESULTS: We allocated 37 women to nifedipine and 36 women to placebo. In the nifedipine group, three women (8. 1 %) delivered within 7 days, compared with one woman (2. 8 %) {{in the placebo group}} (difference - 5. 3 %; one-sided 95 % confidence limit 4. 5 %). Median gestational age at delivery were respectively 37 + 0 (interquartile range [IQR] 34 + 6 to 38 + 5) and 38 + 2 (IQR 37 + 0 to 39 + 6) weeks (p = 0. 008). In the nifedipine group, three pregnancies (8. 1 %) had a poor outcome; there were no poor outcomes in the placebo group. We observed similar trends in eligible nonrandomized women. CONCLUSION: In symptomatic women with preterm labor, a shortened cervix, and negative fibronectin test, placebo treatment is not inferior to tocolysis with nifedipine. Jolande Y.

40|$|BACKGROUND At present, {{there is}} {{insufficient}} evidence to guide appropriate management {{of women with}} preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) near term. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial in 60 hospitals in The Netherlands, which included non-laboring women with > 24 h of PPROM between 34 + 0 and 37 + 0 wk of gestation. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to induction of labor (IoL) or expectant management (EM) using block randomization. The main outcome was neonatal sepsis. Secondary outcomes included mode of delivery, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and chorioamnionitis. Patients and caregivers were not blinded to randomization status. We updated a prior meta-analysis {{on the effect of}} both interventions on neonatal sepsis, RDS, and cesarean section rate. From 1 January 2007 to 9 September 2009, 776 patients in 60 hospitals were eligible for the study, of which 536 patients were randomized. Four patients were excluded after randomization. We allocated 266 women (268 neonates) to IoL and 266 women (270 neonates) to EM. Neonatal sepsis occurred in seven (2. 6 %) newborns of women in the IoL group and in 11 (4. 1 %) neonates in the EM group (relative risk [RR] 0. 64; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 25 to 1. 6). RDS was seen in 21 (7. 8 %, IoL) versus 17 neonates (6. 3 %, EM) (RR 1. 3; 95 % CI 0. 67 to 2. 3), and a cesarean section was performed in 36 (13 %, IoL) versus 37 (14 %, EM) women (RR 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 50). The risk for chorioamnionitis was reduced in the IoL group. No serious adverse events were reported. Updating an existing meta-analysis with our trial results (the only eligible trial for the update) indicated RRs of 1. 06 (95 % CI 0. 64 to 1. 76) for neonatal sepsis (eight trials, 1, 230 neonates) and 1. 27 (95 % CI 0. 98 to 1. 65) for cesarean section (eight trials, 1, 222 women) for IoL compared with EM. CONCLUSIONS In women whose pregnancy is complicated by late PPROM, neither our trial nor the updated meta-analysis indicates that IoL substantially improves pregnancy outcomes compared with EM.

40|$|Published: 4 April 2014 BACKGROUND: Babies {{born after}} midtrimester preterm prelabour rupture of {{membranes}} (PPROM) {{are at risk}} to develop neonatal pulmonary hypoplasia. Perinatal mortality and morbidity after this complication is high. Oligohydramnios in the midtrimester following PPROM is considered to cause a delay in lung development. Repeated transabdominal amnioinfusion with the objective to alleviate oligohydramnios might prevent this complication and might improve neonatal outcome. METHODS/DESIGN: Women with PPROM and persisting oligohydramnios between 16 and 24 weeks gestational age {{will be asked to}} participate in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. INTERVENTION: random allocation to (repeated) abdominal amnioinfusion (intervention) or expectant management (control). The primary outcome is perinatal mortality. Secondary outcomes are lethal pulmonary hypoplasia, non-lethal pulmonary hypoplasia, survival till discharge from NICU, neonatal mortality, chronic lung disease (CLD), number of days ventilatory support, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) more than grade I, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) more than grade II, proven neonatal sepsis, gestational age at delivery, time to delivery, indication for delivery, successful amnioinfusion, placental abruption, cord prolapse, chorioamnionitis, fetal trauma due to puncture. The study will be evaluated according to intention to treat. To show a decrease in perinatal mortality from 70 % to 35 %, we need to randomise two groups of 28 women (two sided test, β-error 0. 2 and α-error 0. 05). DISCUSSION: This study will answer the question if (repeated) abdominal amnioinfusion after midtrimester PPROM with associated oligohydramnios improves perinatal survival and prevents pulmonary hypoplasia and other neonatal morbidities. Moreover, it will assess the risks associated with this procedure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} whether {{administration of}} 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate can prevent neonatal morbidity in multiple pregnancies {{by reducing the}} preterm birth rate. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial in 55 obstetric clinics in the Netherlands. Women with a multiple pregnancy were randomized to weekly injections of either 250 mg 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate or placebo, starting between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation and continuing until 36 weeks of gestation. The main outcome measure was adverse neonatal outcome. Secondary outcome measures were gestational age at delivery and delivery before 28, 32, and 37 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: We randomized 671 women. A composite measure of adverse neonatal outcome was present in 110 children (16 %) born to mothers in the 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate group, and in 80 children (12 %) of mothers {{in the placebo group}} (relative risk [RR] 1. 34; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 95 – 1. 89). The mean gestational age at delivery was 35. 4 weeks for the 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate group and 35. 7 weeks for the placebo group (P=. 32). Treatment with 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not reduce the delivery rate before 28 weeks (6 % in the 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate group compared with 5 % in the placebo group, RR 1. 04; 95 % CI 0. 56 – 1. 94), 32 weeks (14 % compared with 10 %, RR 1. 37; 95 % CI 0. 91 – 2. 05), or 37 weeks of gestation (55 % compared with 50 %, RR 1. 11; 95 % CI 0. 97 – 1. 28). CONCLUSION: 17 [alpha]-hydroxyprogesterone caproate does not prevent neonatal morbidity or preterm birth in multiple pregnancies.

Biol. 10 : 25 - 32, 2009. -Data on acclimatization during expedition-style climbing to > 5000 m are scant. We evaluated {{the hypothesis that}} minor differences in ascent protocol influence acute mountain sickness (AMS) symptoms and mountaineering success in climbers to Muztagh Ata (7546 m), Western China. We performed a randomized, controlled trial during a high altitude medical research expedition to Muztagh Ata. Thirty-four healthy mountaineers (mean age 45 yr, 7 women) were randomized to follow one of two protocols, ascending within 15 or 19 days to the summit of Muztagh Ata at 7546 m, respectively. The main outcome measures, AMS symptom scores {{and the number of}} proceeding climbers, were assessed daily. Mean +/- SD AMS-C scores of 16 climbers randomized to slow ascent were 0. 06 +/- 0. 18, 0. 26 +/- 0. 08, 0. 41 +/- 0. 45, 0. 53 +/- 0. 77 at camps I (5533 m), II (6265 m), III (6865 m), and the summit (7546 m), respectively. Corresponding values in 18 climbers randomized to fast ascent were significantly higher: 0. 17 +/- 0. 23, 0. 43 +/- 0. 75, 0. 49 +/- 0. 36, and 0. 69 +/- 0. 54 (p < 0. 008, vs. slow ascent in regression analysis accounting for weather-related protocol deviation). Climbers randomized to slow ascent were able to ascend according to the protocol without AMS for significantly more days than climbers randomized to fast ascent (p = 0. 04, Kaplan-Meier analysis). More climbers randomized to slow ascent were successful in reaching the highest camp at 6865 m without AMS (odds ratio 9. 5; 95 % confidence interval 1. 02 to 89).

Methods: A stratified, simple random sample of patients matched on preoperative sphere and cylinder was selected for four age categories: 45 – 49 years (group A), 50 – 54 years (group B), 55 – 59 years (group C), and 60 – 65 years (group D). Each group contained 320 patients. All patients underwent RLE with a multifocal intraocular lens at least in one eye. Three months postoperative refractive/visual and patient-reported outcomes are presented. Results: The percentage of patients that achieved binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity 20 / 20 or better was 91. 6 % (group A), 93. 8 % (group B), 91. 6 % (group C), 88. 8 % (group D), P= 0. 16. Binocularly, 80. 0 % of patients in group A, 84. 7 % in group B, 78. 9 % in group C, and 77. 8 % in group D achieved 20 / 30 or better uncorrected near visual acuity (P= 0. 13). The proportion of eyes within 0. 50 D of emmetropia was 84. 4 % in group A, 86. 8 % in group B, 85. 7 % in group C, and 85. 8 % in group D (P= 0. 67). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in postoperative satisfaction, visual phenomena, dry eye symptoms, distance or near vision activities.

40|$|Published: 3 March 2014 BACKGROUND: Preterm {{birth is}} {{the most common cause of}} {{neonatal}} morbidity and mortality. Postponing delivery for 48 hours with tocolytics to allow for maternal steroid administration and antenatal transportation to a centre with neonatal intensive care unit facilities is the standard treatment for women with threatening preterm delivery in most centres. However, there is controversy as to which tocolytic agent is the drug of first choice. Previous trials have focused on tocolytic efficacy and side effects, and are probably underpowered to detect clinically meaningfull differences in neonatal outcome. Thus, the current evidence is inconclusive to support a balanced recommendation for clinical practice. This multicenter randomised clinical trial aims to compare nifedipine and atosiban in terms of neonatal outcome, duration of pregnancy and maternal side effects. METHODS/DESIGN: The Apostel III trial is a nationwide multicenter randomised controlled study. Women with threatened preterm labour (gestational age 25 - 34 weeks) defined as at least 3 contractions per 30 minutes, and 1) a cervical length of ≤ 10 mm or 2) a cervical length of 11 - 30 mm and a positive Fibronectin test or 3) ruptured membranes will be randomly allocated to treatment with nifedipine or atosiban. Primary outcome is a composite measure of severe neonatal morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes will be time to delivery, gestational age at delivery, days on ventilation support, neonatal intensive care (NICU) admittance, length admission in neonatal intensive care, total days in hospital until 3 months corrected age, convulsions, apnoea, asphyxia, proven meningitis, pneumothorax, maternal side effects and costs. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of the treatment will be performed. Analysis will be by intention to treat principle. The power calculation is based on an expected 10 % difference in the prevalence of adverse neonatal outcome. This implies that 500 women have to be randomised (two sided test, β 0. 2 at alpha 0. 05). DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence on the optimal drug of choice in acute tocolysis in threatening preterm labour.

40|$|Background Pain relief during labour is a {{topic of}} major {{interest}} in the Netherlands. Epidural analgesia {{is considered to be}} the most effective method of pain relief and recommended as first choice. However its uptake by pregnant women is limited compared to other western countries, {{partly as a result of}} non-availability due to logistic problems. Remifentanil, a synthetic opioid, is very suitable for patient controlled analgesia. Recent studies show that epidural analgesia is superior to remifentanil patient controlled analgesia in terms of pain intensity score; however there was no difference in satisfaction with pain relief between both treatments. Methods/design The proposed study is a multicentre randomized controlled study that assesses the cost-effectiveness of remifentanil patient controlled analgesia compared to epidural analgesia. We hypothesize that remifentanil patient controlled analgesia is as effective in improving pain appreciation scores as epidural analgesia, with lower costs and easier achievement of 24 hours availability of pain relief for women in labour and efficient pain relief for those with a contraindication for epidural analgesia. Eligible women will be informed about the study and randomized before active labour has started. Women will be randomly allocated to a strategy based on epidural analgesia or on remifentanil patient controlled analgesia when they request pain relief during labour. Primary outcome is the pain appreciation score, i. e. satisfaction with pain relief. Secondary outcome parameters are costs, patient satisfaction, pain scores (pain-intensity), mode of delivery and maternal and neonatal side effects. The economic analysis will be performed from a short-term healthcare perspective. For both strategies the cost of perinatal care for mother and child, starting at the onset of labour and ending ten days after delivery, will be registered and compared. Discussion This study, considering cost effectiveness of remifentanil as first choice analgesia versus epidural analgesia, could strongly improve the care for 180. 000 women, giving birth in the Netherlands yearly by giving them access to pain relief during labour, 24 hours a day.

40|$|Collaboration {{between the}} artist and {{material}} scientist Exhibition Curator: Elisha Buttler/FORM Exhibition Guest Curator: Kevin Murray Exhibition venue and dates: April 9 th to May 30 th 2010, Midland Atelier, Perth Can jewellery function {{as an instrument of}} change? Jewellery is inherently appealing as an object. Frequently associated with status and beauty, a piece of jewellery can be iconic and convey overt messages regarding wealth, style, status. However, emerging trends in jewellery and related object design are beginning to challenge many customary ideas of jewellery, and instead, position it as an object which is not only functional but can exert degrees of change on the wearer – or viewer. These trends form the basis a FORM exhibition in development for 2010. Concepts such as ‘functionality’ and ‘change’ are open to multiple interpretations. However for the initial purposes of this exhibition, they have been grouped into two key categories: 1. Function and Technology This category includes jewellers and related designers who create products possessing tangible functions or new technologies which aim to deploy specific benefits to individuals and/or the broader community. Emphasis will be placed on designs that point to long-term benefits, rather than one-off, largely conceptual pieces. 2. Sociology and Symbolism This category includes the less tangible elements of contemporary jewellery which have potential to alter perspectives and promote action through their symbolic connotations. Like the Function and Technology category, the underlying themes here are designs which focus on benefits and heightened social awareness for individuals and the broader community. The exhibition will explore jewellery that fits into either (or both) of the above groups, while focusing on the varied levels of ‘change’ jewellery can wield; namely in the areas of health, technology, sciences and community. This is a relatively new area of development but one which possesses immense potential for groundbreaking innovation and cross-disciplinary, cross-industry advancement. A central aim of the exhibition will be to highlight this potential for innovation and cross-sector collaboration through jewellery design, and the strategies, investment and other conditions required to foster these new directions. Also key to the exhibition will be examinations of the crossovers between the two categories, and the relationships between aesthetics and practicality.

40|$|Background: There {{is little}} {{evidence}} to guide the management of women with hypertensive disorders in late preterm pregnancy. We investigated the effect of immediate delivery versus expectant monitoring on maternal and neonatal outcomes in such women. Methods We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial, in seven academic hospitals and 44 non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Women with non-severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between 34 and 37 weeks of gestation were randomly allocated to either induction of labour or caesarean section within 24 h (immediate delivery) or a strategy aimed at prolonging pregnancy until 37 weeks of gestation (expectant monitoring). The primary outcomes were a composite of adverse maternal outcomes (thromboembolic disease, pulmonary oedema, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, placental abruption, or maternal death), and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, both analysed by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR 1792). Findings Between March 1, 2009, and Feb 21, 2013, 897 women were invited to participate, of whom 703 were enrolled and randomly assigned to immediate delivery (n= 352) or expectant monitoring (n= 351). The composite adverse maternal outcome occurred in four (1 · 1 %) of 352 women allocated to immediate delivery versus 11 (3 · 1 %) of 351 women allocated to expectant monitoring (relative risk [RR] 0 · 36, 95 % CI 0 · 12 – 1 · 11; p= 0 · 069). Respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed in 20 (5 · 7 %) of 352 neonates in the immediate delivery group versus six (1 · 7 %) of 351 neonates in the expectant monitoring group (RR 3 · 3, 95 % CI 1 · 4 – 8 · 2; p= 0 · 005). No maternal or perinatal deaths occurred. Interpretation For women with non-severe hypertensive disorders at 34 – 37 weeks of gestation, immediate delivery might reduce the already small risk of adverse maternal outcomes. However, it significantly {{increases the risk of}} neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, therefore, routine immediate delivery does not seem justified and a strategy of expectant monitoring until the clinical situation deteriorates can be considered.

40|$|Background: In {{women with}} {{threatened}} preterm birth, delay of delivery by 48 h allows antenatal corticosteroids to improve neonatal outcomes. For this reason, tocolytics are often administered for 48 h; however, {{there is no}} consensus about which drug results in the best maternal and neonatal outcomes. In the APOSTEL III trial we aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine and the oxytocin inhibitor atosiban in women with threatened preterm birth. Methods: We did this multicentre, randomised controlled trial in ten tertiary and nine teaching hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Women with threatened preterm birth (gestational age 25 - 34 weeks) were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to either oral nifedipine or intravenous atosiban for 48 h. An independent data manager used a web-based computerised programme to randomly assign women in permuted block sizes of four, with groups stratified by centre. Clinicians, outcome assessors, and women were not masked to treatment group. The primary outcome was a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes, which included perinatal mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and necrotising enterocolitis. Analysis was done in all women and babies with follow-up data. The study is registered at the Dutch Clinical Trial Registry, number NTR 2947. Findings: Between July 6, 2011, and July 7, 2014, we randomly assigned 254 women to nifedipine and 256 to atosiban. Primary outcome data were available for 248 women and 297 babies in the nifedipine group and 255 women and 294 babies in the atosiban group. The primary outcome occurred in 42 babies (14 %) in the nifedipine group and in 45 (15 %) in the atosiban group (relative risk [RR] 0 · 91, 95 % CI 0 · 61 - 1 · 37). 16 (5 %) babies died in the nifedipine group and seven (2 %) died in the atosiban group (RR 2 · 20, 95 % CI 0 · 91 - 5 · 33); all deaths were deemed unlikely {{to be related to the}} study drug. Maternal adverse events did not differ between groups. Interpretation: In women with threatened preterm birth, 48 h of tocolysis with nifedipine or atosiban results in similar perinatal outcomes. Future clinical research should focus on large placebo-controlled trials, powered for perinatal outcomes. Funding: ZonMw (the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development).
