5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of the compact disc, flexi discs were {{sometimes}} used as a means to include sound with printed material such as magazines and <b>music</b> <b>instruction</b> <b>books.</b> A flexi disc could be moulded with speech or music and bound into the text with a perforated seam, at very little cost and without any requirement for a hard binding. One problem with using the thinner vinyl was that the stylus's weight, combined with the flexi disc's low mass, would sometimes cause the disc to stop spinning on the turntable and become held in place by the stylus. [...] For this reason, most flexi discs had a spot {{on the face of the}} disc for a coin, or other small, flat, weighted object to increase the friction with the turntable surface and enforce consistent rotation. If the turntable's surface is not completely flat, it is recommended that the flexi disc be placed on top of a full sized record.|$|R
50|$|Bookseller, publisher, {{and member}} of the Stationers' Company, Playford {{published}} <b>books</b> on <b>music</b> theory, <b>instruction</b> <b>books</b> for several instruments, and psalters with tunes for singing in churches. He is perhaps best known today for his publication of The English Dancing Master in 1651, during the period of the Puritan-dominated Commonwealth (later editions were known as 'The Dancing Master'). This work contains both the <b>music</b> and <b>instructions</b> for English country dances. This came about after Playford, working as a war correspondent, was captured by Cromwell's men and told that, if he valued his freedom (as a sympathiser with the King), he might consider a change of career. Although many of the tunes in the book are attributed to him today, he probably did not write any of them. Most were popular melodies that had existed for years.|$|R
40|$|The flute consort {{was popular}} for music-making in {{civilian}} society from {{about the second}} quarter of the sixteenth century, especially in Germany and France where the main sources of <b>music</b> and <b>instruction</b> <b>books</b> were published between about 1520 and 1560. Prior {{to the development of the}} consort, the flute was primarily played by Swiss and German soldiers, in a duo with a large drum. Their presence on the battlefield and playing for court entertainments can be documented from around 1470, and it would appear that their presence at court provided the impetus for civilian players to take up the flute and transform it to an instrument for soft chamber music. An introductory chapter deals with the instrument itself, describing its design features, surviving instruments, a short background history of the flute in the years leading up to the fifteenth century, and the names by which the so-called ‘Renaissance flute’ was known. Chapter 2 examines the contexts and activities of the Swiss and German military flautists, their movement into the courts of Europe, and the subsequent development of the flute consort, through a study of Swiss chronicles, court and city documents and payment records, pictures and musical sources. Chapter 3 follows the rise and development of flute consort playing in Germany and France ca. 1520 - 1560; I have focused on this period in these two countries, because the main sources of consort <b>music</b> and <b>instruction</b> <b>books</b> were published there. Relevant activities of Swiss flutes and flute consorts in other European centres supplement the discussion. Chapter 4 is devoted to an analysis of historic playing techniques. Important original source materials have been studied and interpreted, including some seventeenth-century treatises which indicate the survival of sixteenth-century playing techniques. <b>Instruction</b> <b>books,</b> along with evidence from surviving instruments, music and other written documents have made it possible to create a comprehensive method for playing the Renaissance flute.

50|$|In 1862, Parrott {{moved to}} East Portland, Oregon. For US$40, Parrott {{purchased}} {{a home on}} the corner of Fourth and H street. He would go on to operate the business at that location for 30 years. It was noted in the book An Illustrated History of the State of Oregon that Parrott was instrumental in growing the business community of East Portland. He worked as a music teacher and played in many ballrooms across Portland. Parrott could play any musical instrument in a brass band. His specialty was the piano, violin and organ. In 1889, Parrott opened another music store which featured different instruments, including hand-made pianos and cabinet organs. He also sold <b>music</b> sheets and <b>instruction</b> <b>books.</b> Another business venture of Parrotts was landlord. He rented out two farms in Yamhill County, Oregon.|$|R

50|$|Mensah {{also began}} {{teaching}} students and writing a <b>book</b> on <b>music</b> <b>instruction.</b> Her first <b>book</b> was called L'Arte di Cantare (The Art of Singing) and {{was published in}} 2001, to address gaps in education. Many of her students had studied for decades and {{felt that they had}} never learned proper breathing and other techniques, so she collected their concerns and created lessons in her book for students of modern music. In 2004, she founded and became the director of the Accademia Superiore di Canto in Verona, Italy. The school has a cooperative agreement with the Academy of Music of Verona so that students can earn teaching credentials. In addition to traditional music courses in a variety of genres, the school also offers work with a speech therapist to improve diction. Mensah recognized the importance of these types of interdisciplinary studies because she had to struggle with learning languages and technique when she emigrated from Africa.|$|R
