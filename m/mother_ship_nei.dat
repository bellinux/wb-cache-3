50|$|Folding space restructures {{the board}} {{so that the}} tile {{farthest}} away from the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> in the same column is moved {{directly in front of}} the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> while all other tiles in the column slide further away from said <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> In essence, the entire column of tiles is shifted one space away from the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> folding space. The tile that is now out of the square of tiles is then moved to fill the gap {{directly in front of the}} <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> Opposing players may not unfold a previous fold until there has been one full intervening round of play. Folding space can be used defensively to move Glynium closer to your <b>mother</b> <b>ship,</b> or offensively to disrupt an opponents mining operations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> {{concept was}} used in Moon {{landings}} performed in the 1960s. Both the 1962 American Ranger and the 1966 Soviet Luna unmanned landers were spherical capsules designed to be ejected {{at the last moment}} from <b>mother</b> <b>ships</b> that carried them to the Moon, and crashed onto its surface. In the manned Apollo program, astronauts in the Lunar Module left the Command/Service Module <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> in lunar orbit, descended to the surface, and returned to dock in a lunar orbit rendezvous with the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> once more for the return to Earth.|$|R
50|$|A <b>mother</b> <b>ship,</b> {{mothership}} or mother-ship {{is a large}} {{vehicle that}} leads, serves, or carries other smaller vehicles. A <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> may be a maritime ship, aircraft, or spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|Banks dories {{were carried}} aboard <b>mother</b> <b>ships,</b> usually fishing schooners, {{and used for}} handlining cod on the Grand Banks. Before Banks dories were introduced, fish were caught with {{handlines}} from the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> alone. Weather permitting, the dories were launched early each day {{with one or two}} crew and bait from previous catches. During the day they would return several times to the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> and unload their catches.|$|R
50|$|Some {{factory ships}} can also {{function}} as <b>mother</b> <b>ships.</b> The basic {{idea of a}} <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> {{is that it can}} carry small fishing boats that return to the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> with their catch. But the idea extends to include factory trawlers supporting a fleet of smaller catching vessels that are not carried on board. They serve as the main ship in a fleet operating in waters a great distance from their home ports.|$|R
5000|$|Shielding: When {{a player}} has a {{continuous}} movement path from their <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship</b> to a tile containing {{a single one}} of their own Explorers then that Explorer is considered shielded by the <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship</b> and immune to combat. Explorers may never enter a tile containing a shielded enemy Explorer. <b>Mother</b> <b>Ships</b> can shield multiple tiles with individual Explorers but provide no shielding to any tile containing more than one Explorer. (Shielding was added in the version 1.1 rules) ...|$|R
50|$|Moving a <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> left {{or right}} may give {{tactical}} advantages in folding space in future turns, or aid with explorer ship deployment. Opponents will often position their <b>mother</b> <b>ship's</b> directly {{across from each other}} to block each other's potential deployments or folds.|$|R

The generals and Strangemeister join them soon after. Ed and Roy board the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> and crawl through the air ducts to the computer room.|$|R
5000|$|... 81 space tiles are {{randomly}} {{placed in}} a 9x9 square configuration. The start player, who is chosen by the collective group, selects their <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> {{from one of the}} four races: Fangarr, Mradok, Ryldarian, or Vailyn. Each player places their <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> with their three explorer ships on the center tile of their respective board edge. The guardian is placed on the center tile of the board. In a two player game, <b>mother</b> <b>ships</b> must be placed on opposite edges of the game board.|$|R

5000|$|Submerged Dragon 1 (Qian Long Yi Hao or Qianlong Yi Hao 潜龙一号 in Chinese) AUV is a {{development}} of CR-02 AUV, with SIoA {{as the primary}} contractor. The most significant improvement of Submerged Dragon 1 AUV over its predecessors is that all previous Chinese AUV could not be directly retrieved by the <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> All previous AUVs can only be released from their <b>mother</b> <b>ships,</b> but not be retrieved. To recover AUV of earlier designs, small boats carrying the crew must be first released from the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> to approach the surfaced AUV, and then crew had to connect the recovery attachment to the AUV, and only such operations are successful completed, then the AUV could be retrieved by the <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> Such requirement not only increased cost, but has also limited the efficiency because such recovery operation can only be performed under clam sea. Submerged Dragon 1 solved this problem by incorporating automated recovery system on the <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> so that AUV can be directly retrieved. Submerged Dragon 1 AUV is equipped with obstacle avoidance sonar, high resolution side scan sonar, and other scientific equipment. Specifications: ...|$|R

50|$|Combat: Combat occurs {{whenever}} an Explorer {{enters a}} tile occupied {{by one or}} more enemy Explorers resulting in all of the enemy Explorers being returned to their <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship.</b> Combat in the Asteroid Belt is more dangerous and instead of being returned to their <b>Mother</b> <b>Ship</b> all of the enemy Explorers are removed from play instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> also occurs in science fiction, {{extending}} the idea to spaceships that serve as the equivalent of flagships among a fleet. In this context, <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> is often spelled as one word: mothership. A mothership may be large enough that its body contains a station {{for the rest of}} the fleet.|$|R

50|$|Sector 41 is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{game for}} two to four players. Game play takes place on a 9x9 grid of face-down tiles, randomly shuffled {{at the beginning of}} each game. Players control one <b>mother</b> <b>ship</b> which moves along the edge of the game board. <b>Mother</b> <b>ships</b> can deploy up to three explorer ships onto the face-down grid. Explorer ships are used to discover, mine, and tow deposits of Glynium to their <b>mother</b> <b>ship.</b> According to the game background, Glynium is an unstable power source only found in this sector. Victory is achieved when one player has mined more Glynium then any other player could match. In the case of a tie, the first person to reach that score is declared the victor.|$|R
