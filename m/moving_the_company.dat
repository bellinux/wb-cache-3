25|$|Just {{days after}} the appellate court's second ruling, {{executives}} of Ben Cooper, Inc. announced they were <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> to Greensboro, North Carolina. The company said {{at this time that}} it had 35 permanent employees, and manufactured and supplied more than 4 million costumes in the previous year. It said it controlled 70 to 80 percent of the licensed costume character costume business, and was partnered with companies such as Children's Television Workshop (producers of Sesame Street), DC Comics, Mattel, and Walt Disney Studios. It said the reason for the move was to be closer to Southern textile factories and cutting shops, so that it could move away from the environmentally harmful vinyl costumes it had obtained from Asia and toward more acceptable natural fabrics. The company hoped to invest $6 million ($) in building its new Greensboro facility, and said it would apply for a $600,000 Community Development Block Grant to help defray costs and provide jobs to low-income workers in the area.|$|E
25|$|Staging and {{presentation}} {{were of a}} high standard, {{under the direction of}} Louis P. Verande (assisted by George King), from Covent Garden where he had been responsible for the staging of Thomas Beecham's controversial 1910 Salome. Verande also had extensive Continental and American experience. All the costumes were designed by Dorothy Carleton Smyth from Glasgow, an authority on historical pageant and theatrical costumes, who travelled with the company. Quinlan pointed out that she concentrated on a harmoniously blended colour scheme, eschewing extraneous spangles and similar gewgaws. The sets for all the operas were designed by Oliver Percy Bernard, from the Boston Opera, and set models for the Puccini operas were first passed by the composer; while Humperdinck, Debussy, Cosima Wagner, Ricordi and other authorities lent their assistance with others. Quinlan claimed the largest scenic studio in England and said that a great deal of research had been done on the historical accuracy of stage accessories. The cost of <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> and all the baggage — 365 tons of scenery, props and costumes — around the world was £100,000.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, MicroProse {{released}} the lauded Civilization II, designed by Brian Reynolds. Spectrum Holobyte who owned MicroProse at the time, opted to consolidate their business under the MicroProse name, <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> from Maryland to California {{by the time}} the game shipped, and laying off several MicroProse employees. Disagreements between the new management and its employees prompted Reynolds, Jeff Briggs, and Sid Meier (designer of the original Civilization) to leave MicroProse and found Firaxis. Although unable to use the same intellectual property as Civilization II, the new company felt that players wanted [...] "a new sweeping epic of a turn-based game". Having just completed a game of human history up to the present, they wanted a fresh topic and chose science fiction.|$|E

500|$|The Islington theatre was by now clearly {{too small}} to allow the company to achieve any further growth. A study {{conducted}} for the Arts Council reported that in the late 1960s the two Sadler's Wells companies comprised 278 salaried performers and 62 guest singers. The company had experience of playing in a large West End theatre, such as its 1958 sell-out production of The Merry Widow that had transferred to the 2,351-seat London Coliseum for a summer season. Ten years later, the lease of the Coliseum became available. [...] Stephen Arlen, who had succeeded Tucker as managing director, was the primary advocate for <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> After intense negotiations and fund-raising, a ten-year lease was signed in 1968. [...] One of the company's last productions at the Islington theatre was Wagner's The Mastersingers, conducted by Goodall in 1968, which 40 years later was described by Gramophone magazine as [...] "legendary". The company left Sadler's Wells with {{a revival of the}} work with which it had re-opened the theatre in 1945, Peter Grimes. Its last performance at the Rosebery Avenue theatre was on 15 June 1968.|$|E
500|$|At age 18, Jackson {{and one of}} the boys, Phillip Storey, {{dropped out}} of {{university}} and became partners in an electronics business. They used their surname initials to form the company name: J Research Electronics Pty Limited. The partnership's largest customer, Roger Foley, doing business as Ellis D Fogg, a producer of psychedelic lighting effects, refused to write out the full company name and instead wrote JandS on his checks. The partners added an equipment rental company with the name JANDS Pty Limited, in response. After <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> from Point Piper to Rose Bay, JANDS made [...] "whatever the hell they felt like", according to Jackson: lighting equipment, guitar amplifiers and public address system components such as column loudspeakers. He described how, with so many American servicemen stationed in Vietnam spending their recreation time in Sydney, Australian bands and clubs were doing well: [...] "the live music scene was jumping, and we were busy". JANDS' successful rental business paid for the design of new gear. After two years, Jackson and Storey quarrelled and the two decided to disband the company. They sold out to Paul Mulholland, David Mulholland and Eric Robinson, who were operating a small lighting company Jubillee Gaslight, on Sydney's north shore. Later, JANDS grew under Mulholland and Robinson to become Australia's largest sound and lighting company. [...] Jackson and Storey served as consultants to JANDS, from time to time.|$|E

Following this act by the English, Lingappa blockaded Madras and prevented goods and supplies from entering the settlement. He demanded that the English agree to pay him an annual tribute of 2,000 pagodas in order to lift the embargo. At one point of time, the situation became so serious that the Directors of the Council even contemplated <b>the</b> thought of <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>Company's</b> factory to Gingee.

[...] When the five founders of the company thought they had found mineral called corundum, which {{would be used for}} making sandpaper, they began the process of setting up a mining company. The five men who started the company were; Henry S. Bryan, Dr. J. Danley Budd, Herman Cable, William McGonagle, and John Dwan. To get the company started the men erected a large dock, crushing mill and bunk and storage houses. After selling the corundum to a company in Chicago the men learned that the corundum wasn’t really corundum and moved on to other ventures. [...] In 1905 the company was moved to Duluth and then in 1907 it was moved to St. Paul. [...] Despite <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> out of Two Harbors the company still had ties in Two Harbors until the death of John Dwan.

He shifted BHP from silver and lead mining to zinc and sulphur production. These moves were the basis of BHP's later success.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>company</b> leaders {{sought a}} Royal Charter for the colony {{because they were}} {{concerned}} about the legality of conflicting land claims given to several <b>companies</b> (including <b>the</b> New England <b>Company)</b> for <b>the</b> little-known territories of the New World, and because of the increasing number of Puritans who wanted to join <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> Charles granted <b>the</b> new charter on 4 March 1628/9, superseding the land grant and establishing a legal basis for the new English colony at Massachusetts. It was not apparent whether Charles knew that <b>the</b> <b>Company</b> was meant to support the Puritan emigration, and he was likely left to assume that it was purely for business purposes, as was the custom. The charter omitted a significant clause: the location for the annual stockholders' meeting. Charles dissolved Parliament in 1629, whereupon <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> directors met to consider <b>the</b> possibility of <b>moving</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> seat of governance to the colony.
