5|$|Twyfelfontein (Afrikaans: {{uncertain}} spring), officially {{known as}} ǀUi-ǁAis (Damara/Nama: jumping waterhole), is {{a site of}} ancient rock engravings in the Kunene Region of north-western Namibia. It consists of a spring in a valley flanked by the slopes of a sandstone table <b>mountain</b> <b>that</b> receives very little rainfall and has {{a wide range of}} diurnal temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} <b>mountain</b> <b>that</b> sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{heaviest}} attacks subsided against the 25th Division, Walker ordered it to release the 5th Regimental Combat Team on September 7 to move to other engagements along the Pusan Perimeter. The continuing fighting north of Taegu made it necessary to move reserves there. That evening the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 27th Infantry, moved from the Nam River battlefield to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team on the Masan front. 27th commander Colonel John H. Michaelis assumed command of the regimental zone at 15:00 on September 9. The 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry, broke off its counterattacks on Battle <b>Mountain</b> <b>that</b> day, rejoined the regiment, and took {{its place in the}} southern end of the line on September 11. Meanwhile, the 5th Regimental Combat Team began moving to Samnangjin on the September 10. Upon arrival at Samnangjin, it passed to Eighth Army reserve.|$|E
5|$|Skyline Drive {{reaches the}} Hogback Overlook on Hogback <b>Mountain</b> <b>that</b> faces {{northwest}} and turns southerly. The roadway heads west and straddles {{the boundary between}} Page and Rappahannock counties, coming to Mathews Arm, where a campground and ranger station are located. The drive turns {{to the south and}} comes to Elkwallow, which hosts restrooms, picnic grounds, a camp store, and food service. Skyline Drive continues along and comes to the Jeremys Run Overlook {{on the west side of}} the road before it winds to the east. The roadway comes to the east-facing Thornton Hollow Overlook and heads back to the south, coming to the Beahms Gap Parking on the west side of the road. The drive traverses Pass Mountain as it continues to the south. Skyline Drive comes to an interchange with US 211 at the Thornton Gap Entrance Station, which is located in Thornton Gap to the east of Luray and the west of Sperryville. A ranger station is present at the entrance station.|$|E
5|$|Venue {{construction}} {{ran from}} spring 1990 to December 1993. All {{the competition and}} most of the non-competition venues were purpose-built for the Games. For the first time in Olympic history, environmental and sustainability issues were considered in venue construction. This resulted in five venues being modified during their design and construction phase to lessen their impact upon the environment. Among the issues considered were the venues blending into surrounding landscape, treatment of terrain with as minimal damage to natural surroundings as possible, use of environmentally-friendly materials, and environmental auditing. Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall was constructed inside a <b>mountain</b> <b>that</b> maintained a year-round temperature of , with the excavated rock used to build a beach promenade. Transport was dominated by the use of buses and trains for spectators. Downtown Lillehammer and the axis between Lillehammer and Oslo were the most congested areas, and the Norwegian State Railways ran up to 22 trains per day between Oslo and Lillehammer. All venues could be reached within walking distance from train stations.|$|E

25|$|Once Scafell Pike (which {{has its own}} {{convoluted}} name history) {{had been}} identified as England's highest <b>mountain,</b> <b>that</b> fact and the greater interest in climbing and fell-walking necessitated the Scafell Range being broken down {{into a number of}} individually named elements.

Some scrambling takes place on narrow exposed ridges where more attention to balance will be required than in normal walking.|$|E

Instead, the Coast Guard members and CAB employees retrieved the bodies of the victims from the scene, a process which took several days due to ongoing foul weather.|$|E
