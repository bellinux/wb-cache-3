5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{production of}} its new airliner, Boeing doubled {{the size of the}} Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5billion to provide space for two new assembly lines. New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections. <b>Major</b> <b>assembly</b> of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993. By the start of production, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines. Total investment in the program was estimated at over US$4billion from Boeing, with an additional US$2billion from suppliers.|$|E

25|$|Boeing {{completed}} {{detailed design}} for the −10 on December 2, 2015. <b>Major</b> <b>assembly</b> began in March 2016. Designers targeted 90% commonality between the 787-9 and -10 and achieved 95%; the 18-ft stretch was reached by adding 10ft forward of the wing and 8ft aft, and by strengthening the fuselage for bending loads in the center wingbox. Because of the length and additional tail strike protection needed, a semilevered landing gear enables rotation over the aft wheels {{rather than at the}} bogie center, like the 777-300ER, and the cabin air conditioning system has 15% more capacity. The first and third -10s have Rolls-Royce's new Trent 1000 TEN engines, while the second is powered by the competing General Electric GEnx-1B engine.|$|E

40|$|Which issues {{should be}} dealt with by <b>major</b> <b>assemblies?</b> It seems as if the {{reformed}} churches, in their distinction between minor and <b>major</b> <b>assemblies,</b> will always have to keep a balance between maintaining the right of the congregation as a fully-fledged church and the necessity or right of the church as a denomination. In order to achieve this, Article 30 of the Church Order of Dordt 1619 was the temporary end of a development in that church order tradition which carries the name of Dordt. Freely translated, Article 30 states: <b>Major</b> <b>assemblies</b> shall deal only with those matters which concern its churches in common or which could not be finished in the minor assemblies. With minor changes made by some churches, this formulation has withstood the test of time up till today. It can, however, also stand up to a test based on a sound reformed ecclesiology. Such an ecclesiology accepts in principle that the congregation is a fully-fledged church, but, at the same time, also sees the need for a meaningful bond between congregations (the denomination) as a visible sign of the unity of the church. In this bond <b>major</b> <b>assemblies</b> – like consistories – could also only act under an authority entrusted to them by Christ...|$|R
500|$|The Great Seimas of Vilnius ( [...] , {{also known}} as the Great Assembly of Vilnius, the Grand Diet of Vilnius, or the Great Diet of Vilnius) was a <b>major</b> <b>assembly</b> held on December 4 and 5, 1905 (November 21–22, 1905 O.S.) in Vilnius, Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire, largely {{inspired}} by the Russian Revolution of 1905. It was the first modern national congress in Lithuania and dealt primarily not with the social issues that sparked the revolution, but with national concerns. Over 2,000 participants took part in the Seimas. The assembly made the decision to demand wide political autonomy within the Russian Empire and achieve this by peaceful means. It is considered an important step towards the Act of Independence of Lithuania, adopted on February 16, 1918 by the Council of Lithuania, as the Seimas laid the groundwork for the establishment of an independent Lithuanian state.|$|E
