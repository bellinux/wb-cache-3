The same review found limited evidence that real acupuncture and sham acupuncture appear to produce biological differences despite similar effects.

The same review found that it remains unclear whether acupuncture reduces pain independent of a psychological impact of the needling ritual. A 2016 Cochrane review found moderate quality evidence that real acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture or inactive treatment for short-term relief of neck pain measured either upon completion of treatment or at short-term follow-up.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [28]- 30) The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> in positive well-being (PWB), psychological distress (PD) and fatigue (FAT) before and after three different fitness tests using the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES). The present study examined the tendency of a subject to be competitive or non-competitive oriented using the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ). Subjects included 40 elementary male and female students ages 9 - 11 years old enrolled in two different physical education classes. Prior to the administration of the three fitness tests, all subjects completed the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ). The subjects completed the 1 -mile run, 1 -mile walk, and PACER shuttle run counterbalanced over a four-week time period, completing no more than one fitness test per week. Subjects were required to complete the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (SEES) pre- and post fitness test in order to determine changes in positive well-being, psychological distress, and fatigue. An ANOVA revealed no significant <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> between a subject’s competitive orientation and fitness test among all SEES factors (PWB, PD, FAT). Data was further analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA. A significant difference was indicated between <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> among fitness tests for both positive well-being and psychological distress. No significant <b>difference</b> between <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> among fitness tests was indicated for fatigue. These findings support the hypothesis that subjects would indicate higher <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> of PWB after a low exertion fitness test (1 -mile walk) compared to high exertion fitness tests (1 -mile run and PACER). Similarly, <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> of psychological distress and fatigue were the smallest after completion of a low exertion test (1 -mile walk) compared to a high exertion test (1 -mile run and PACER).

30|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{research}} that tested <b>mean</b> <b>differences</b> of service quality measurement items among different healthcare user groups (e.g., type of patients, the patient’s family members and general public) in a hospital setting.

6000|$|Fifty-four {{barometric}} observations, {{taken at}} the level of the water on the voyage between Dacca and the Soormah, and compared with Calcutta, showed a gradual rise of the mercury in proceeding eastwards; for though the pressure at Calcutta was [...] .055 of an inch higher than at Dacca, it was [...] .034 lower than on the Soormah: the <b>mean</b> <b>difference</b> between all these observations and the contemporaneous ones at Calcutta was + [...] .003 in favour of Calcutta, and the temperature half a degree lower; the dew-point and humidity were nearly the same at both places. This being the driest season of the year, it is very probable that the mean level of the water at this part of the delta is not higher than that of the Bay of Bengal; but as we advanced northwards towards the Khasia, and entered the Soormah itself, the atmospheric pressure increased further, thus appearing to give the bed of that stream a depression of thirty-five feet below the Bay of Bengal, into which it flows! This was no doubt the result of unequal atmospheric pressure at the two localities, caused by the disturbance of the column of atmosphere by the Khasia mountains; for in December of the same year, thirty-eight observations on the surface of the Soormah made its bed forty-six feet above the Bay of Bengal, whilst, from twenty-three observations on the Megna, the pressure only differed + 0.020 of an inch from that of the barometer at Calcutta, which is eighteen feet above the sea-level.|$|E
