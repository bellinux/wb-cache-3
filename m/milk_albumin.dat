40|$|Joseph F. Foster first {{suggested}} that the model of albumin was a flexible linkage of semiindependent domains (Foster, 1960). The name albumin derives from the early German term albumen, generally indicating proteins. Albumen, on the other hand, derives from the Latin word albus (white) indicating the white part of the cooked egg surrounding the yolk. The protein component of the egg white makes part of a heterogeneous group of proteins, broadly indicated as albumins, including serum albumin, <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> and urinary proteins. More specifically, serum albumin {{is a member of}} a family of homologous proteins characterized by distinctive structural features with peculiar ligand binding properties. Members of this family are -fetoprotein (AFP), afamin (AFM; also named -albumin), and vitamin D binding protein (DBP) (Peters, 1996; Fasano et al., 2007). Serum albumin was recognized as the principal component of the blood as early as 1839. It has been a model protein for many years for physiological studies. It is the most abundant soluble protein in the circulatory system comprising of about 52 - 60 % of the total plasma protein content...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Adverse {{reactions}} to food intake have very diverse etiology and symptomatology. Regarding milk, its food allergy {{is presented as}} lactose intolerance, the sugar in milk, or allergy to milk protein. Despite having different symptomatology, confusions among allergic conditions to dairy and its mediators are common. Milk protein allergy originates from protein components present in milk, causing {{reactions to}} either the protein fractions in emulsion (caseins) or in whey (<b>milk</b> <b>albumin).</b> The allergic reaction is type IV mediated by T lymphocytes. The allergic reaction produces severe cellular damage and it triggers physical, mental and emotional symptomatology that may vary in time, intensity and severity. Lactose intolerance is originated by total or partial absence of the enzyme that digests this disaccharide. Lactose intolerance can be primary or congenital and secondary; the former being more rare and severe, the latter being more common. Lactase deficiency can be diagnosed by symptoms associated with cramping and diarrhea. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to conduct a review of available literature on cow&# 8217;s milk protein allergy and lactose intolerance...|$|E
40|$|Murine milk {{contains}} 18 mg ml− 1 serum albumin, {{a concentration}} {{equal to that}} in the serum of the lactating mouse. We examined cellular transport using in vivo methods in the mouse. At steady state the specific activity of 125 I-albumin injected into the blood stream was equal in plasma and whey, confirming that <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> is extra-mammary in origin. Fluorescent albumin crossed the gland from basolateral surface to lumen via cytoplasmic vesicles, but was not transported in the apical to basal direction. Albumin was segregated from transferrin at the basal surface of the epithelial cells and did not colocalize with either caveolin- 1 or - 2. Vesicular transport was not disrupted by filipin providing additional evidence that, unlike the vascular endothelium, caveoli are not involved. Cytoplasmic albumin was localized to vesicles containing IgA and transport was disrupted by agents that interfere with clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Together, these findings provide evidence that albumin is transported across the mammary epithelium by the same pathway as immunoglobulin. The possibility that the massive transfer of albumin into mouse milk is mediated by fluid phase transport is considered...|$|E

Inventory {{of the results of}} the SAT in a number of patient groups and controls. Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen and Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem. The SAT was performed in 51 controls (25 children, 26 adults) and in a number of diseases: (suspected) allergy to cow's <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> (30 children), (suspected) coeliac disease (86 children and 35 adults), Crohn's disease (25 patients) with ulcerative colitis (9), and pancreatic insufficiency (31) due to cystic fibrosis or chronic pancreatitis. For the SAT, the fasting patient is given a solution of mannitol (M) and lactulose (L) following which the L/M ratio, as an indicator of the selective intestinal permeability, is determined in 5 -hour urine by means of gas chromatography. In cow's milk protein allergy, the L/M ratio showed a statistically significant increase in clinically positive cow's milk provocation results, unlike that in clinically negative results. After pretreatment with cromoglycate this difference decreased to non-significant values. The L/M ratio was increased in active coeliac disease (with villous atrophy), first-degree relatives of coeliac disease patients, Crohn's disease, clinically active ulcerative colitis and pancreatic insufficiency. The L/M ratio was not increased in inactive coeliac disease (with normal villi), suspicion of coeliac disease because of short stature, dystrophy and/or aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms with normal villi, and in clinically inactive ulcerative colitis. The selective intestinal permeability can be determined by means of the SAT. This could be an important tool for diagnosis and evaluation of therapy in gastrointestinal disorder...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} limit the {{contamination}} problem in plant tissue cultures experiments on selection of media suitable for detection and isolation of bacteria contaminating plant tissue explants, and preliminary characterization of isolates were made. In the first experiment aiming at detection of bacteria in plant explants four strains representing genera most often occurring at our survey of plant tissue cultures, and earlier isolated and identified (Bacillus, Methylobacterium, Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas) were streaked on five bacteriological media (NA, King B, K, R 2 A and 523) and on the medium used for plant culture initiation – ½ MS with <b>milk</b> <b>albumin</b> (IM). All strains grew on all media but on K and IM at the slowest rate and on 523 medium at the fastest. The IM medium proved to be useful for immediate bacteria detection at the initial stage of culture. In the second experiment, aiming at characterization of isolates {{on the basis of}} colony growth and morphology 14 strains (Agrobacterium, Bacillus, Curtobacterium, Flavobacterium, Lactobacillus, Methylobacterium – 2 strains Mycobacterium, Paenibacillus, Plantibacterium, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas, and species Serratia marcescens) were streaked on five microbiological media: KB, NBY, YDC, YNA and YPGA. All strains grew on all those media but at different rates. The only exception was the strain of Lactobacillus spp., which did not grow on King B medium. This medium allowed the detection of such characteristic traits as fluorescence (Pseudomonas) and secretion of inclusions (Stenotrophomonas). The third experiment was focussed on assessment of the sensitivity of detection of specific bacteria in pure cultures and in plant tis- sue cultures using standard PCR and BIO-PCR techniques with genus specific primers and 2 methods of DNA isolation. Results showed that the use of Genomic Mini kit enabled an increase of the sensitivity by 100 times as compared to extraction of DNA by boiling. Moreover, the application of BIO-PCR increased sensitivity of detection from 102 to 105  times over the standard PCR. If looking for unknown cultivable bacteria more effective detection seems to be use of microbiological method enabling detection on bacteriological media single cells in the fragments of explants or in wash liquids, in which fragmented explants were shaken...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>albumins,</b> <b>milk</b> proteins (solution of the skim milk powder) demonstrated a high efficiency when being {{applied for the}} blocking procedure (Fig.  2, red) [26]. However, after few days of exploitation with regeneration of the sensor surface, the injections of, for example, 40  μg/ml IgG resulted in the SPR response, which was {{much larger than the}} usual one. It {{can be explained by the}} assumption that the regeneration buffer solution washes out some molecules of the blocking layer. As a result, an additional portion of IgG molecules could bind nonspecifically to the bare gold surface. The injection of an additional portion of milk protein solution led the SPR response on IgG to the return to its usual level.|$|R

40|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for quantifiable detection of specific antibodies in warm-blooded animals, {{but it has not}} been accepted for detection of fish antibodies because of its low reproducibility, which {{is due in part to}} high background optical density (OD) measurements. In the present study, we report that the high background of a fish antibody- detection ELISA resulted from non-specific adsorption of fish immunoglobulin M (IgM) to blocking reagents on the ELISA plate wells. Four fish sera (from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, masu salmon O. masou, Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus and koi Cyprinus carpio) were poured into ELISA plate wells pre-blocked with several blocking reagents (skim milk, soybean <b>milk,</b> bovine serum <b>albumin,</b> fetal bovine serum, gelatin and Roche BlockingReagent®) and then washed out in order to measure the remaining fish IgM on the ELISA plate wells. Significant amounts of fish IgMs (OD absorbance at 492 nm: 0. 3 to 1. 1) remained on the ELISA plate wells with no antigenic protein except blocking reagents. The amount of remaining fish IgMs on the ELISA plate wells decreased significantly following treatment of fish sera with skim milk. However, the specific immuno-reactivity of fish IgM was not reduced by such treatment. Thus, we conclude that treatment of fish sera with skim milk is useful in reducing the high background OD often observed in fish IgM detection ELISA...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and validate a colorimetric assay to measure caprine serum albumin (CSA) concentrations in milk. The principle of the say was based on the binding of albumin to bromocresol green (BCG) dye at pH 4. 0. The absorption of the dye-albumin complex was determined spectrophotometrically at 640 nm. A linear relationship existed between CSA concentrations (0. 01 to 8. 0 mg/ml) and absorbance values. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation for the proposed assay were 2. 6 % and 12 % respectively. Recovery from milk samples spiked with albumins was 89. 15 % ± 7. 6 %. The developed assay was validated using 126 milk samples collected from lactating Saanen goats at various stages of lactation`. Caprine serum <b>albumin</b> concentrations in <b>milk</b> ranged between 0. 31 and 0. 52 mg/ml. The concentrations of CSA were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) at the beginning of lactation, declined rapidly and remained relatively stable in mature <b>milk.</b> Caprine serum <b>albumin</b> correlated positively (p < 0. 05) with milk somatic cell counts, total solids, protein, fat and whey and correlated negatively (p < 0. 05) with milk lactose and casein concentrations.

Specific diets {{may be useful in}} one region or country and inadequate or economically unviable in others. We compared two artificial protein diets that had been formulated from locally-available ingredients in Brazil with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Groups of 100 newly-emerged, adult workers of Africanized honey bees in Brazil and European honey bees in the USA were confined in small cages and fed on one of four diets for seven days. The artificial diets included a high protein diet made of soy <b>milk</b> powder and <b>albumin,</b> and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, brewer’s yeast and rice bran. The initial protein levels in newly emerged bees were approximately 18 - 21 μg/μL hemolymph. After feeding on the diets for seven days, the protein levels in the hemolymph were similar among the protein diet groups (~ 37 - 49 μg/μL after seven days), although Africanized bees acquired higher protein levels, increasing 145 and 100 % on diets D 1 and D 2, respectively, versus 83 and 60 % in the European bees. All the protein diets resulted in significantly higher levels of protein than sucrose solution alone. In the field, the two pollen substitute diets were tested during periods of low pollen availability in the field in two regions of Brazil. Food consumption, population development, colony weight, and honey production were evaluated to determine the impact of the diets on colony strength parameters. The colonies fed artificial diets had a significant improvement in all parameters, while control colonies dwindled during the dearth period. We conclude that these two artificial protein diets have good potential as pollen substitutes during dearth periods and that Africanized bees more efficiently utilize artificial protein diets than do European honey bees.

40|$|Coconut milk (CM) {{containing}} {{coconut oil}} {{extracted from the}} endosperm (meat) of coconut fruit is not stable and undergoes a rapid separation into a creaming layer {{at the top and}} a serum phase at the bottom. In this study, coconut milk was separated into coconut cream (CC) and coconut skim milk (CSM). The ability of proteins in CM, CC and CSM to form and stabilise oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions containing coconut oil was investigated. The unstable nature of coconut oil droplets in CM was found to be due to types of proteins adsorbed on the surface of oil droplets, which were predominantly 11 S globulins, known to be hydrophobic and salt soluble proteins. The oil droplets stabilised by 11 S globulins in CM and CC were larger in size and highly flocculated, probably due to hydrophobic interaction, thus resulting in rapid creaming and phase separation, compared to those stabilised by proteins (e. g. water-soluble albumins) in CSM. Smaller droplet size with less droplet flocculation and slower phase separation was obtained when emulsions were prepared with a predominance of proteins present in CSM. The CSM-based emulsions were relatively more stable but they were only able to provide short-term stability against phase separation. The results suggest that the ability of proteins (both globulins and albumins) in CM to stabilise the emulsion oil droplets was not high because these proteins did not seem to posses the ability to provide steric and electrostatic stabilisation to the emulsion droplets stabilised by them. An addition of small molecule surfactants, particularly a water-soluble surfactant of Tween 80, induced the formation of smaller droplets in the CM- and CSM-based emulsions, thereby improving their emulsion stability to a certain extent. However, the addition of oil-soluble small molecule surfactants (e. g. mono- and diglycerides and/or partially unsaturated mono- and diglycerides) in the absence of Tween 80 caused a significant increase in droplet size of emulsions prepared from CSM. In contrast, this phenomenon was not observed in emulsions made from CM. The formation and properties of coconut milk ice creams differing in the concentration of CSM proteins, as well as ratios of solid fat-to-liquid oil (blends of coconut oil and sunflower oil) were also investigated. The differences in those variables were found to have a significant influence on the properties and stability (particle size, flow properties, droplet flocculation) of ice cream mixes as well as the characteristics of ice creams, such as overrun, melt resistance and shape retention. Several instrumental analyses, including size measurement, flow behaviour and small-deformation oscillatory tests, showed the presence of an agglomerated structural network in ice creams based on CSM containing oil blends as well as in ice creams based on dairy milk. From the findings, the agglomerated fat structural network in the CSM-based ice creams containing the suitable solid fat content at 68 % could change ice creams with a slow melting rate and the more ability to retain their shape during melting compared with those of the dairy milk-based ice cream and ice creams made directly from CM. Overall the results suggest that coconut milk proteins do not possess the properties of proteins suitable for making very small droplets as well as stable emulsions against phase separation, particularly 11 S globulins that are one of the major constituent proteins in coconut <b>milk.</b> However, <b>albumins,</b> which are the predominant proteins in coconut skim milk, may be suitable for use as the surface-active proteins for making smaller emulsion droplets in coconut oil-in-water emulsions, but their concentration needs to be increased for use probably by membrane filtration or freeze drying after removal of some carbohydrates from coconut skim milk...|$|R
