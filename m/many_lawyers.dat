25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. <b>Many</b> <b>lawyers</b> use and re-use written documents in this way and call these re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E
25|$|As {{an interim}} measure, Edward II {{was held in}} the custody of Henry of Lancaster, who {{surrendered}} Edward's Great Seal to Isabella. The situation remained tense, however; Isabella was clearly concerned about Edward's supporters staging a counter-coup, and in November she seized the Tower of London, appointed one of her supporters as mayor and convened a council of nobles and churchmen in Wallingford to discuss the fate of Edward. The council concluded that Edward would be legally deposed and placed under house arrest {{for the rest of his}} life. This was then confirmed at the Parliament of England, dominated by Isabella and Mortimer's followers. The session was held in January 1327, with Isabella's case being led by her supporter Adam Orleton, Bishop of Hereford. Isabella's son, Prince Edward, was confirmed as Edward III, with his mother appointed regent. Isabella's position was still precarious, as the legal basis for deposing Edward was doubtful and <b>many</b> <b>lawyers</b> of the day maintained that Edward was still the rightful king, regardless of the declaration of the Parliament. The situation could be reversed at any moment and Edward was known to be a vengeful ruler.|$|E

[...] Legal experts and the public are debating the idea ahead of discussions and a legislative push. On 1 August 2013, the nation's first good Samaritan law went into effect in Shenzhen.|$|E

On November 20, Jackson flew in a leased jet to Santa Barbara Municipal Airport and surrendered himself to California police. Driven by police to the Santa Barbara County Jail, he emerged from the police vehicle in handcuffs. <b>Many</b> <b>lawyers</b> and Jackson supporters saw it as an attempt by both police and media to convince the public of Jackson's guilt, while some attached a racial element to the police's actions.

2500|$|In Canada (except Quebec), {{the professions}} of {{barrister}} and solicitor are fused, and <b>many</b> <b>lawyers</b> refer to themselves with both names, {{even if they}} do not practise in both areas. In colloquial parlance within the Canadian legal profession, lawyers often term themselves as [...] "litigators" [...] (or [...] "barristers"), or as [...] "solicitors", depending on the nature of their law practice though some may in effect practise as both litigators and solicitors. However, [...] "litigators" [...] would generally perform all litigation functions traditionally performed by barristers and solicitors; in contrast, those terming themselves [...] "solicitors" [...] would generally limit themselves to legal work not involving practice before the courts (not even in a preparatory manner as performed by solicitors in England), though some might practise before chambers judges. As is the practice in many other Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, Canadian litigators are [...] "gowned", but without a wig, when appearing before courts of [...] "superior jurisdiction".|$|E

Special tributes were paid to prominent male role models. Jamal observed that in Pakistan {{over the last few}} years a lot of feminist organizations paint the whole male gender as cruel, and likewise in some prevailing laws there are discriminatory clauses against men, particularly in Family Law and Harassment in the Work Place Act. Jamal paid reference to the steady decline of male participation at Higher Education and University level, citing student numbers in Karachi University as 90% female, in Punjab University 70% female, and in BZ University 52% female. Mr Jamal spoke of the importance of gender cooperation in tackling various problems faced by males and females and cautioned that we should avoid the [...] "Each gender for itself" [...] approach and instead promote better gender relationships. He proposed that all people should celebrate both Men's Day and Women's Day and asked everyone to join with Rights and Rights International for the elimination of Gender Based Discrimination.|$|E

And yet, all these different expedients to raise a fortune, pass generally under the milder names of fees, perquisites, vails, presents, gratuities, and such like; although, in strictness of speech, they should be called robbery, and consequently be rewarded with a gibbet.|$|E

You see, I have not the means to take lessons otherwise. I thought to find work here in the law. But I have failed.

6000|$|... 'Sir John Patteson's contemporaries {{have nearly}} all, one by one, passed away,' writes one of them, Sir John Taylor Coleridge. 'He has left few, if any, {{literary}} monuments to record what his intellectual powers were; {{and even in}} our common profession the ordinary course and practice are so changed, that I doubt whether <b>many</b> <b>lawyers</b> are now familiar with his masterly judgments; but I feel that I speak the truth when I describe {{him as a man}} of singularly strong common sense, of great acuteness, truthfulness, and integrity of judgment. These were great judicial qualities, and to these he added much simplicity and geniality of temper and manners; and all these were crowned by a firm, unhesitating, devout belief in the doctrines of our faith, which issued in strictness to himself and the warmest, gentlest charity to his fellow-creatures. The result was what you might expect. Altogether {{it would be hard to}} say whether you would characterise him as a man unusually popular or unusually respected.' ...|$|E

When a young man discusses what shall be his future walk in life, he is talking of all that concerns his success {{as far as this}} world is concerned. And it is so hard for a youth to know, to make even a fair guess, as to what his own capacities are! The right man is wanted in the right place; but how is a lad of two and twenty to surmise what place will be right for him? And yet, if he surmises wrong, he fails in taking his tide at its single flood.
