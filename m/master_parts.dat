40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a new {{methodology}} for the uncertainty analysis of coordinate measurements is presented. The methodology {{can be applied}} on any kind of measurements performed by a CMM, and {{it is intended to}} be especially useful when performing reference measurements of geometrical and dimensional characteristics of workpieces. <b>Master</b> <b>parts</b> calibrated using this approach can be used in connection with ISO/TS 15530 - 3 for the uncertainty assessment of other CMMs, when measuring similar parts. Consistent measurement strategies and the real measurand definition according to the technical drawing are the foundations of this methodology, generally based in high-density measurement points. Assessment of uncertainties is performed using models in complete agreement with the measurement procedure, considering all major uncertainty contributions. Resources from artificial intelligence were applied to accelerate the development of adequate measurement procedures, simplifying the work of the CMM operator. To validate the proposed methodology, a cast iron steering case was calibrated and compared to simulation results obtained with PUNDIT/CMM, a software solution for task-specific uncertainty evaluation of coordinate measurements...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of manufacturing textured materials and devices, with surface properties controlled from the design stage, {{instead of being}} the result of machining processes or chemical attacks, is a key factor for the incorporation of advanced functionalities to a wide set of micro- and nanosystems. High-precision additive manufacturing (AM) technologies based on photopolymerization, together {{with the use of}} fractal models linked to computer-aided design tools, allow for a precise definition of final surface properties. However, the polymeric <b>master</b> <b>parts</b> obtained with most commercial systems are usually inadequate for biomedical purposes and their limited strength and size prevents many potential applications. On the other hand, additive manufacturing technologies aimed at the production of final parts, normally based on layer-by-layer melting or sintering ceramic or metallic powders, do not always provide the required precision for obtaining controlled micro-structured surfaces with high-aspect-ratio details. Towards the desired degree of precision and performance, lithography-based ceramic manufacture is a remarkable option, as we discuss in the present study, which presents the development of two different micro-textured biodevices for cell culture.

40|$|The many {{efforts to}} make higher {{education}} more effective for to-morrow's economy and society seem to fail as there is an ever-growing urgency to measure its short-term "effectiveness". As the clarity of measuring "objectively" {{and the need to}} convince skeptic policy makers dominate didactic evolutions it is not likely that higher education will transform itself into new vital scenarios for problem. MOOCs (massive open online courses) work out as a complication as it articulates the need for perfect lecturing modes like movie recordings rather than teacher-student dialogues. Finally I will present communication paradigms that allow educationalists to blend both the lecturing with the learning in discursive ateliers. Essentially the message is that creative learning needs the design of creative teaching from the beginning. Wisdom of the cloud: The financial crisis not only urges the economic sector to reflect and reorient; Also education, care and the institutions for social cohesion are in serious reconsideration on how to let communities survive and target a new ideology. This keynote presentation starts from the initial notions of the current interconnected communities as a networked society. Authors like Castells and Van Dijk mention the vulnerability and fragmentation of social networks and its threats for a self-regulated society. Much more important is the value of networked instead of hierarchic relationships for creating innovative ideas. The compact summary is that instead of regarding knowledge to be as an interpersonal rather than intrapersonal asset. If we look to the recent type of large projects, they are interdisciplinary and the result of a massive "wisdom of the cloud": Already in its conceptual stage there is a large cross-over among idea dimensions like the economical-, sustainable- and political considerations, so that less unexpected negative side effects can emerge during the stage of implementation and dissemination. This keynote presentation brings recent models in the domain of creative problem solving like the Triz model and the best possible examples in the medical and societal domain. Its goal is to inflict the conference participants with new frameworks to generate more optimal future scenarios. Massive open online courses. So far we have seen that the potential of web-based communities entail both to solutions and to complications of new innovations like the arrival of MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses. The first symptom of MOOCs as a solution is its widespread dissemination; any online learner may access the best available video lectures from top teachers at top institutes around the world. The first complication is that countries that rely heavily on international students may fear less online students or maybe a shorter residence as they already <b>master</b> <b>parts</b> of the prerequisite courses via MOOC-based certificates. Feel welcome to visit our monitoring of recent reflections on MOOCs by Ronald Voorn and Piet Kommers: [URL] A second potential positive effect of MOOCs is its stimuli to increase quality awareness by the traditional f 2 f universities; lectures currently show a great deal of improvisation and rest upon pseudo-interaction between the teacher and the students in the best case. In the scope of this special issue, it is the challenge to see how students' perception of "joining an online community can mitigate the negative connotation of "feeling a remote guest" rather than a "participant" etc. The overall reactions to MOOCs is that it is essentially not a new phenomenon and MOOCs are massively overhyped. Its unique selling point that it may attract several hundred of thousand students at the same time already shows to be a disadvantage; systems get overloaded and the size of responses to broadcasted course schedules can hardly be handled in back- and mid-offices. An even more pervasive problem is that research on instructional design so far migrated from pure delivery to interactive and cooperative learning modes. So we barely lack appropriate models for optimizing broadcasted learning modules. Even more: the majority of academicians doubts about the essential premise that distance learning can be achieved without tutorials and process diagnostics by a human teacher. In other words: MOOCs need to be complemented by collaborative learning anyway. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered by the best universities and entities are entering our world. Business models are yet to be developed. How these how does the interactions work in online education. How can web based communities support this new developments? Important aspects are : - Virtual versus pseudo social presence - Demand- instead of delivery-based knowledge - Courses where (re) construction, problem solving and creativity is key - Collaborative- rather than solitary learning - New implications for social media in education - Fresh quality awareness and branding standards for the institutes in higher education The conclusion from current MOOC disputes is likely to stress that "perfect lectures via video" is not sufficient to create active and loyal student attitudes. Once we find ways to promote collaborative learning at a distance, a more successful stage of MOOCs can be expected. From delivery into demand-driven education: The larger underlying question of innovation in higher education is if and how we can bring students in the responsible position of being the owner of one's learning process. It might already look like conquered innovation step, however as long as fixed curricula and assignment criteria are there, students will refrain from accepting full autonomy and responsibility. If the teacher already knows the test items, it does not look smart to undertake problem-based and authentic learning; In this case the teacher is kindly requested to tell as much as possible from his/her priorities in the topic domain, hence helping the students to prepare for a higher grade. The examples in this keynote lecture target the audience to think about more options for active ("committed") co-learning and how a new generation of social media can trigger such process...|$|E
