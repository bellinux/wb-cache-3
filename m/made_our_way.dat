60|$|We {{hurried down}} {{together}} and <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the beach, {{accompanied by a}} dozen or so of the inhabitants of Branksome.|$|E

60|$|What {{with this}} noise {{on the part}} of Mr. Commissioner Pordage, and what with the cries of Sergeant Drooce on the raft astern (which were {{sometimes}} more than Tom Packer could silence), we often <b>made</b> <b>our</b> slow <b>way</b> down the river, anything but quietly. Yet, that it was of great importance that no ears should be able to hear us from the woods on the banks, could not be doubted. We were looked for, to a certainty, and we might be retaken at any moment. It was an anxious time; it was, indeed, indeed, an anxious time.|$|R
5000|$|Remarking on the album's {{themes in}} 2008, Grace said: [...] "you get to {{an age where}} you get {{discouraged}} with dreams like in a band and you're told you're {{never going to be}} able to do anything like that, and you start to feel like there's a closed door, and when I started to feel that way, I went ahead and started doing my own thing. We <b>made</b> <b>our</b> own <b>way</b> and that was kind of just what the title of the album and a lot of the album was about, really, was just doing it yourself and not taking 'no' for an answer, and reclaiming your dreams." ...|$|R
60|$|We rejoined Eve, paid our bill, and <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the door. Louis, {{looking very}} pathetic, {{was in the}} background. Mr. Bundercombe beckoned to him.|$|E
60|$|We <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{down into}} the garden, which they searched last. At the creek's side the boat was gone, and there were {{footsteps}} in the mud.|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} I {{was out of}} the house. Kate was close on my heels, and {{together}} we <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the orchard, followed by the others.|$|E

[125] Rydal first, the {{smallest}} lake, [...] Famous for great Wordsworth's sake; [...] Grasmere next appeared in sight, [...] Grim Helvellyn on the right, [...] Till we <b>made</b> <b>our</b> downward <b>way</b> [...] To {{the streets of}} Keswick gray. [...] Then amid a weary waste [...] On to Penrith Town we raced, [...] And for many a flying mile, [...] Past the ramparts of Carlisle, [...] Till we crossed the border line [...] Of the land of Auld lang syne. [...] Here we paused at Gretna Green, [...] Where many curious things were seen [...] At the grimy blacksmith's shop, [...] Where flying couples used to stop [...] And forge within the smithy door [...] The chain which lasts for evermore.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that W. E. Henley once took me severely to task {{on account of}} some jeering remarks <b>made</b> about <b>our</b> poet's <b>way</b> of treating the birds and their neglect {{of so many of}} our charming singers. In the course of our correspondence he questioned me about the cirl bunting, that lively singer and pretty first cousin of the yellow hammer; and after I had supplied him with full information, he informed me that it was his intention to write a poem on that bird, and that he would be the first English poet to sing the cirl bunting.|$|R
60|$|We rode {{diligently}} on, <b>our</b> <b>way</b> lying {{along the}} fertile {{banks of the}} Garonne, now yellow with the rustling corn. Towards evening we <b>made</b> <b>our</b> last halt at Fenouillet, whence a couple of hours' riding should bring us to Toulouse.|$|R
60|$|As we <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the {{hospital}} after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.|$|E
60|$|We had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{about half}} the {{distance}} across {{one end of the}} great apartment when a low growl from the far end brought us to a startled halt.|$|E
60|$|We <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{across the}} sand of the beach, among the rocks and through the close matted scrub, beyond which an {{eminence}} of rugged boulders shut out the further view.|$|E
60|$|Finding that {{traveling}} in company with To-mar <b>made</b> <b>our</b> journey both easier and safer, Ajor and I did not continue on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> alone while the novitiates delayed {{their approach to}} the Kro-lu country in order that they might properly fit themselves {{in the matter of}} arms and apparel, but remained with them. Thus we became well acquainted--to such an extent that we looked forward with regret to the day when they took their places among their new comrades and we should be forced to continue upon <b>our</b> <b>way</b> alone. It was a matter of much concern to To-mar that the Krolu would undoubtedly not receive Ajor and me in a friendly manner, and that consequently we should have to avoid these people.|$|R

We had a taste of the big time. We had great musicians in a big, grand studio. We were happening. Things were going <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> But up until that point I had been {{thinking}} of quitting it all and going back to school because I was sick of being miserable and I hate being poor." ...|$|R
40|$|In this twentieth century, we are {{privileged to}} witness the first steps toward {{realization}} of an age-old dream: the exploration of space. Already, {{in the first few}} years of the Space Age, man has been able to penetrate the layer of atmosphere which surrounds his planet and to venture briefly into space. Scores of man-made objects have been thrust into space, some of them to roam the solar system forever. Behind each space mission are years of patient research, thousands of man-hours of labor, and large sums of money. Because the sums involved are so enormous, the question is frequently asked, "Is it worth it?" Many people want to know what return this huge investment will bring to mankind. The return on the investment is knowledge. The accumulation of knowledge over the centuries has <b>made</b> possible <b>our</b> advanced <b>way</b> of life. As we unlock more and more of the secrets of the universe through space exploration, we add new volumes to the encyclopedia of man's knowledge. This will be applied to the benefit of mankind. For the practical-minded, there are concrete benefits to <b>our</b> <b>way</b> of life. Although we are still in the Stone Age of space exploration, a number of immediate applications of space technology are already apparent. For instance, imagine the benefits of an absolutely perfect system of predicting the weather. Or, going a step further, even changing the weather. And wouldn't it be fascinating to watch the next Olympic games, telecast from Tokyo, on your TV set? These are just a few of the practical benefits made possible by space technology...|$|R

60|$|At length {{we reached}} the {{outskirts}} of the town. Judge Penfold lived at the top of what was termed the Hill, the aristocratic district of the place, and thither we <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{had nothing}} to do now but to think of coming back to Madagascar, so we made the best of our Way; only that, to make us quite distracted without other Joy, we took in <b>our</b> <b>Way</b> a small Bark loaden with Arack and Rice, which was good Sawce to our other Purchace; for if the Women <b>made</b> <b>our</b> Men drunk before, this Arack made them quite mad; and they had so little Government of {{themselves}} with it, that I think it might be said, the whole Ship's Crew was drunk for above a Fortnight together, till six or seven of them kill'd themselves; two fell overboard and were drown'd, and several more fell into raging Fevers, and it was a Wonder, in the whole, they were not all kill'd with it.|$|R

40|$|Internet has <b>made</b> <b>our</b> world, the <b>way</b> we {{live and}} educate, more dynamic and virtual than ever, {{creating}} greater challenges and new possibilities. In this way, {{it is important that}} higher education institutions have, as a priority, the goal of finding effective ways of providing new learning opportunities according to their environment: student characteristics; teacher training; economic crisis and advancing technology {{in an effort to make}} learning more efficient, equitable and innovative. At Guarda Polytechnic Institute, Portugal (IPG), we recognize the needs and the opportunities to create and develop new e-education courses in order to engage and motivate students and teachers according to their needs. Thus, we have, in this last decade, developed and implemented a set of institutional objectives with regard to teaching electronic courses which aim to provide intuitive content online courses, easy to access anywhere, any time. The main purpose of this paper is to present our strategies as an institution, vision and goals when we talk about electronic learning. We bring forward what we believe to be extremely important and that must be considered when an organization wants to implement and develop e-Learning. The paper also presents the outcomes and synthesizes the insights collected since when we implemented a mobile learning solution. Findings indicate that building a successful e-learning project depends basically on two components, teachers’ training and students’ characteristics. The focus attention on these two components can create new, successful and powerful opportunities of e-learning...|$|R
