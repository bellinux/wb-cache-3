50|$|In addition, the Protocol added Article 21 bis, Limitation of Production of Opium, {{which allowed}} the Board to deduct from a nation's opium {{production}} quota the amounts it determines {{have been produced}} within that nation and introduced into the illicit traffic. This could happen {{as a result of}} failing to control either illicit production or diversion of licitly produced opium to illicit purposes. In this way, the Board can essentially punish a nation that does not control its illicit opium traffic by imposing an economic sanction on its <b>medicinal</b> <b>opium</b> industry. This provision is ineffective on nations that are not opium exporters.|$|E

Hannen ruled this arrangement to be invalid in 1872. [...] Judges from Shanghai remained in Yokohama but sat as a judge of the Kanagawa Consular Court. In 1877 and 1878 the legality of these arrangements were challenged by the Japanese Government when the acting law secretary, Hiram Shaw Wilkinson, ruled that the import of <b>medicinal</b> <b>opium</b> into Japan was legal.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} <b>medicinal</b> plants including <b>opium</b> are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants in De materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|R
25|$|The Persian {{physician}} Abū ‘Alī al-Husayn ibn Sina ("Avicenna") described opium as {{the most}} powerful of the stupefacients, in comparison to mandrake and other highly effective herbs, in The Canon of Medicine. The text lists <b>medicinal</b> effects of <b>opium,</b> such as analgesia, hypnosis, antitussive effects, gastrointestinal effects, cognitive effects, respiratory depression, neuromuscular disturbances, and sexual dysfunction. It also refers to opium's potential as a poison. Avicenna describes several methods of delivery and recommendations for doses of the drug. This classic text was translated into Latin in 1175 and later into many other languages and remained authoritative until the 19th century. Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu used opium in the 14th-century Ottoman Empire to treat migraine headaches, sciatica, and other painful ailments.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{initiative}} to extend opium production for medicinal purposes called Poppy for Medicine was launched by The Senlis Council which proposes that Afghanistan could produce <b>medicinal</b> <b>opium</b> under a scheme {{similar to that}} operating in Turkey and India.

Senlis is on record advocating reintroduction of poppy into areas of Afghanistan, specifically Kunduz, which has been poppy free for some time.|$|E

40|$|The opium poppy, Papaver somniferum, {{is one of}} mankind's oldest <b>medicinal</b> plants. <b>Opium</b> poppy {{today is}} the {{commercial}} source of the narcotic analgesics morphine and codeine. Along with these two morphinans, opium poppy produces approximately eighty alkaloids belonging to various tetrahydrobenzylisoquinoline-derived classes. It {{has been known for}} over a century that morphinan alkaloids accumulate in the latex of opium poppy. With identification of many of the enzymes of alkaloid biosynthesis in this plant, biochemical data suggested involvement of multiple cell types in alkaloid biosynthesis in poppy. Herein the immunolocalization of five enzymes of alkaloid formation in opium poppy is reported: (R,S) - 3 ′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4 ′-O-methyltransferase central to the biosynthesis of tetrahydroisoquinoline-derived alkaloids, the berberine bridge enzyme of the sanguinarine pathway, (R,S) -reticuline 7 -O-methyltransferase specific to laudanosine formation, and salutaridinol 7 -O-acetyltransferase and codeinone reductase, which lead to morphine. In capsule and stem, both O-methyltransferases and the O-acetyltransferase are found predominantly in parenchyma cells within the vascular bundle, and codeinone reductase is localized to laticifers, the site of morphinan alkaloid accumulation. In developing root tip, both O-methyltransferases and the O-acetyltransferase are found in the pericycle of the stele, and the berberine bridge enzyme is localized to parenchyma cells of the root cortex. Laticifers are not found in developing root tip, and, likewise, codeinone reductase was not detected. These results provide cell-specific localization that gives a coherent picture of the spatial distribution of alkaloid biosynthesis in opium poppy...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The <b>medicinal</b> {{value of}} <b>opium</b> poppy (2 n = 22, &# 13; Papaver somniferum L.) {{is due to}} {{presence}} {{of more than two}} dozen alkaloids. The &# 13; genetic origin and diversity of cultivars used in the breeding collection is not &# 13; fully known. To evaluate the genetic diversity of the 24 germplasm currently cultivated &# 13; in the state to provide genetic information about heterogeneity, using RAPD and &# 13; ISSR markers. Approach: Isolated genomic DNA was subjected to &# 13; PCR amplification using either random or ISSR markers. The amplified fragments &# 13; were scored and matrix was prepared. Jaccard similarity coefficients were calculated &# 13; and dendogram was generated. Results: RAPD with 12 primers gave &# 13; 46 scorable fragments out of which 32 bands were polymorphic (69. 52 %) with 2. 6 &# 13; polymorphic band per primer, while in ISSR analysis 9 primer gave good amplification &# 13; with DNA of 24 opium poppy germplasm. They gave 27 scorable polymorphic with 3. 0 &# 13; bends per primer. Dendrogram constructed revealed that the based on RAPD the germplasm &# 13; cultivated comprised of one major group A and one minor group B, while two clusters &# 13; of two germplasm each stands apart, on the basis of ISSR they fall into one major &# 13; group A and one minor groups B, while one germplasm clusters of UOP- 60 stands &# 13; apart. Based on combined RAPD and ISSR analysis these germplasm were divided into &# 13; 1 major group A and 3 minor group B, C, D whereas one genotype UOP- 6 stood apart. &# 13; Conclusion: These results showed that the majority of cultivated &# 13; germplasm fall in one cluster and have low genetic diversity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} complex history of opium suppression during the Qing dynasty. Going beyond {{our understanding of}} the Opium War and opium trade, both of which in past decades have received considerable scholarly attention in the West, I examine the social construction of what would eventually be called 2 ̆ 2 the opium problem 2 ̆ 2 (yapian wenti) and the range of responses to it during a roughly one hundred seventy-five year period. This period was characterized by the centuries-old legacy of <b>medicinal</b> consumption of <b>opium</b> as a <b>medicinal</b> drug, the legislation of government opposition to the smoking of opium beginning in 1729, the rise of the import and domestic opium trades from the late eighteenth through the nineteenth century, the dramatic {{increase in the number of}} opium smokers that attended the surge in native production, and the emergence at various levels of Chinese society of a contentious discourse about opium. Westerners living in China during this period, particularly missionaries, played a significant role in influencing the debate over how to respond to the threat posed by the drug. However, reform-minded Chinese officials, non-bureaucratic elites, and other Chinese throughout the country created their own vision of a society freed of the 2 ̆ 2 opium poison, 2 ̆ 2 and in so doing these reformers revealed how traditional values about morality, health, and social order were changing to suit the needs of a China experiencing the rise of incipient nationalism. By 1906, the year the Qing government launched its full-scale opium suppression campaign, the opium issue had become for many living under the Manchu regime a symbol of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s political and social ills. For such socially conscious Chinese, the solution would be as imperative as the ending of extraterritoriality and the recovery of railway rights if China was ever to become a strong, healthy, and independent nation. Although the Opium Suppression Campaign ultimately fell victim to entrenched economic interests and the political upheaval of the Warlord Era, the anti-opium movement fostered the expression of a national consensus that helped mobilize the forces of social reform. ...|$|R
