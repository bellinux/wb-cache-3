40|$|Abstract—Since {{straightness}} {{error of}} linear <b>motor</b> <b>stage</b> is hardly dependent upon machining accuracy and assembling accuracy, there is limit on maximum realizable accuracy.

From position dependency and repeatability of the straightness error of the slider, a feedforward compensation control is applied to the platform servo control. In the consideration of required fine positioning accuracy, a platform driven by an electro-magnetic actuator is suggested and a sliding mode control was applied.

40|$|Masked prime stimuli {{presented}} {{immediately before}} target stimuli in a choice reaction task {{give rise to}} behavioral costs when the primes and the target stimuli are mapped to the same response and result in benefits when they are mapped to opposite responses. Researchers assume that this negative compatibility effect reflects inhibitory processes in the control of perceptuomotor links. The authors investigated whether the inhibition operates {{at the level of}} abstract central codes or at effector-specific <b>motor</b> <b>stages.</b> In 2 experiments (N = 8 participants in each), left or right hand or foot responses were required to target stimuli that were preceded by masked arrow primes mapped to the same response side as the target stimuli in compatible trials and to the opposite response side in incompatible trials; the primes were irrelevant in neutral trials. In Experiment 1, when the masked primes determined both response side and modality, there was no transfer of negative compatibility effects across response modalities. That finding is inconsistent with a central abstract locus of inhibition and suggests that inhibition operates at effector-specific <b>motor</b> <b>stages.</b> In Experiment 2, primes conveyed only response side information but left response modality uncertain, and negative compatibility effects were elicited for both hand and foot responses, suggesting that partially informative masked primes can trigger a parallel activation and subsequent inhibition of response processes within separate effector systems...|$|R

This prospective study (clinicaltrials. gov Identifier NCT 01518751) investigated GE and visceral perception in early motor phase PD patients in comparison to age-matched and younger controls. In addition, the effect of Levodopa on GE was assessed in healthy aged controls. 16 PD patients (Hoehn & Yahr 2), 11 sex-/age-matched Ctrl 1 and 10 young, male Ctrl 2 subjects were subjected to a high caloric (428 kcal) (13) C-Sodium Octanoate breath test strictly OFF dopaminergic medication. Visceral appetite sensation was monitored using visual analogue scales (VAS). GE was similarly studied in 7 controls ON/OFF oral Levodopa. GE was not altered in PD patients compared to age-/sex-matched and younger controls (p = 0. 76). Subjective appetite perception was not altered in the PD group in comparison to Ctrl 1, but was significantly higher in Ctrl 2 subjects (p = 0. 02). 100 mg oral Levodopa/ 25 mg Benserazide significantly slowed GE by 18 % among healthy controls (p = 0. 04). In early <b>motor</b> <b>stage</b> PD OFF dopaminergic medication, there was no GE slowing after a high caloric test meal. Levodopa, however, caused a robust GE slowing in healthy aged individuals. Our data indicate that clinically relevant GE slowing in early PD {{is related to the}} iatrogenic effect of dopamine treatment. Subjective appetite perception is not affected in this disease stage.

40|$|Cerebral palsy (CP) is {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorder in children that is associated with life-long disability and multiple impairments. The clinical manifestations of CP vary among children. CP is accompanied by a wide range of problems and has a broad spectrum. Children with CP demonstrate poor fine and dross motor function due to psychomotor disturbances. Early rehabilitation programs are essential for children with CP and should be appropriate for the age and functional condition of the patients. Kinesio taping (KT) technique is a relatively new technique applied in rehabilitation programs of CP. This article reviews the effects of KT techniques on improving motor skills in children with CP. In this study, we used keywords "cerebral palsy, Kinesio Tape, KT and Taping" in the national and international electronic databases between 1999 and 2016. Out of the 43 articles obtained, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria. There are several different applications about KT technique in children with CP. Review of the literature demonstrated that the impact of this technique on gross and fine motor function and dynamic activities is more effective than postural and static activities. Also this technique has more effectiveness in the child at higher developmental and <b>motor</b> <b>stages.</b> The majority of consistent findings showed that KT technique as part of a multimodal therapy program can be effective in the rehabilitation of children with CP to improve motor function and dynamic activities especially in higher developmental and <b>motor</b> <b>stages...</b>|$|R

Many studies focus on the impact of depression and motor disability on poor life quality but neglect to examine the role of anxiety.

Symptoms of anxiety, more than depression, cognitive status, or <b>motor</b> <b>stage,</b> significantly affected quality of life in 38 nondemented patients with mild-to-moderate motor disability.

40|$|According to the {{extended}} bottleneck model, dual-task interference does not arise {{only from a}} central bottleneck but also from processing limitations at the <b>motor</b> <b>stage.</b> Evidence for this assumption has previously been found only for same-effector tasks but not for different-effector tasks. In order to examine the existence of motor interference with different effectors, we used the psychological refractory period paradigm and employed response sequences of different length in Task 1 (R 1 sequence length). Experiment 1 incorporated vocal response sequences in Task 1 and a manual response in Task 2. In Experiment 2, the assignment of the effectors to the two tasks was reversed. In both experiments, the long R 1 sequence prolonged reaction time for Task 2 (RT 2), and this effect was reduced with decreasing temporal overlap of the two tasks. Thus, the present experiments demonstrate motor interference between different-effector tasks. This interference {{may be due to}} on-line programming or to central response monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The {{temperature}} rise, deformation, deformation via {{room temperature}} {{change and the}} time of reaching heat balance of the motion table in precision linear motor driven stage made of steel, aluminum, alumina ceramic and silica ceramic are analyzed. The results show that the temperature rise of silica ceramic with small heat conductivity coefficient decreases clearly. Because of the small thermal expansion coefficient, the deformation of silica ceramic table is small. The thermal stress and deformation of silica ceramic table due to room temperature change are smaller than those of aluminum, steel and alumina ceramic tables. The heat conduction of silica ceramic is slow, so the time of reaching heat balance is long. As a result of the motion table being badly influenced by the primary section of the linear motor in precision linear <b>motor</b> <b>stage,</b> precision stage should choose the material with small heat conductivity coefficient, small thermal expansion coefficient and insensitive to temperature change.

40|$|Saccadic {{reaction}} times (SRTs) {{were analyzed}} {{in the context}} of stochastic models of information processing (e. g., Townsend and Ashby 1983) to reveal the processing architecture(s) underlying integrative interactions between visual and auditory inputs and the mechanisms of express saccades. The results support the following conclusions. Bimodal (visual + auditory) targets are processed in parallel, and facilitate SRT to an extent that exceeds levels attainable by probability summation. This strongly implies neural summation between elements responding to spatially aligned visual and auditory inputs in the human oculomotor system. Second, express saccades are produced within a separable processing stage that is organized in series with that responsible for intersensory integration. A model is developed that implements this combination of parallel and serial processing. The activity in parallel input channels is summed within a sensory stage which is organized in series with a pre-motor and <b>motor</b> <b>stage.</b> The time course of each subprocess is considered a random variable, and different experimental manipulations can selectively influence different stages.
