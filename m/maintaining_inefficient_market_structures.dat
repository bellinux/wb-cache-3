In this paper we endogenize the <b>market</b> <b>structure</b> by considering incentives to introduce (costly) options exchanges which issue derivative securities. The {{method of financing}} the exchange is critical in determining whether the <b>market</b> <b>structure</b> is socially efficient. If the exchange can charge fees to all agents and make every agent's participation {{a necessary condition for}} establishing the exchange then the <b>market</b> <b>structure</b> chosen in equilibrium is efficient. However, if either of these conditions is not satisfied then an <b>inefficient</b> <b>market</b> <b>structure</b> may be chosen.

The welfare analysis shows that discounts definitely increase major shareholders' wealth in contrast to the benchmark case of uniform pricing.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{free trade}} creates permanent losses {{for a less}} industrious nation by observing trade between the United States and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The initial idea behind free trade was to eliminate dead weight losses caused by trade barriers and to improve international relations; however, literature from {{the latter part of}} the 20 th century dictates that free trade is sub-optimal at best. Contemporary theory suggests that the negative effects of <b>inefficient</b> <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> are enlarged when trade policies are liberalized. Empirically, this paper uses several models based on Cobb-Douglas production functions and Specific Factors models to explain how returns to scale and trapped factors contribute to permanent losses in potential growth for Mexico in certain manufacturing industries. Overall, this paper confirms that trapped factors contribute to permanent competitive losses for Mexico as it trades with the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Competition {{policy and}} {{regulation}} are essential components of economic systems at the national, regional and global levels. In Arab countries, however, heavily concentrated and inefficient economies, collusion, centralization of economic power among a few elites and general rent-seeking behaviour have aggravated {{challenges to the}} adoption and enforcement of competition and antitrust laws, thereby hindering the improvement of <b>inefficient</b> <b>market</b> <b>structures</b> and economic governance systems. The Arab region needs effective antitrust and competition laws and well-functioning market regulators to enhance the business environment, foster investments and improve economic performance and growth. This report reviews {{the current state of}} competition policy and regulation in the Arab region. Noting that the adoption of competition laws in the Arab region is recent compared with other regions, the report identifies challenges to effective enforcement of competition and antitrust laws and market regulators, which include, among others, lack of adequate policy drafting, complexity of competition law, institutional structure, collusion and corruption. It stresses the importance of political economy reform in the Arab region, emphasizing that the adoption and enforcement of competition laws contribute to promoting inclusive growth and development and reducing poverty. The report offers policy recommendations taking into account existing initiatives of international partners and the different stages of competition and regulation policy development in the Arab countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Beans {{are widely}} grown {{as a major}} food crop in Eastern and Southern Africa. It is the most {{important}} staple food crop after maize in Kenya (ECABREN, 2000). The beans industry in Kenya is faced with problems of shortages, seasonal supply and price fluctuations and inadequate information on production, marketing and consumption. These problems are more acute in urban areas. This paper analyzes the structure and performance of the beans marketing system in Nairobi metropolitan area, the single most important beans market in Kenya. Data from a sample of 102 traders augmented by secondary data were used to analyze the marketing system by applying descriptive statistics, concentration ratios and co-integration models. The results showed that the beans <b>marketing</b> <b>structure</b> approached that of pure competition; however, lack of capital was a barrier to entry into the wholesale and retail trade. The Johansen likelihood-based vector autoregressive model showed that there was no significant co-integration of the major markets in the city possibly due to <b>inefficient</b> <b>market</b> information flow.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{behavior}} of simple models for financial markets with widely spread frequency either in the trading activity of agents or in the occurrence of basic events. The generic picture of a phase transition between information efficient and <b>inefficient</b> <b>markets</b> still persists even when agents trade on widely spread time-scales. We derive analytically the dependence of the critical threshold {{on the distribution of}} time-scales. We also address the issue of market efficiency as a function of frequency. In an <b>inefficient</b> <b>market</b> we find that the size of arbitrage opportunities is inversely proportional to the frequency of the events on which they occur. Greatest asymmetries in market outcomes are concentrated on the most rare events. The practical limits of the applications of these ideas to real markets are discussed in a specific example. ...|$|R
50|$|Thus, if we {{took the}} final price of a good (the cost to the final consumer) and {{analysed}} the cost structure of that good, we might find that, {{over a period of}} time, the direct producers get less income and intermediaries between producers and consumers (traders) get more income from it. That is, control over the access to a good, asset or resource as such may increasingly become a very important factor in realising a surplus-value. In the worst case, this amounts to parasitism or extortion. This analysis illustrates a key feature of surplus value which is that it accumulated by the owners of capital only within <b>inefficient</b> <b>markets</b> because only <b>inefficient</b> <b>markets</b> - i.e. those in which transparency and competition are low - have profit margins large enough to facilitate capital accumulation. Ironically, profitable - meaning <b>inefficient</b> - <b>markets</b> have difficulty meeting the definition a free market because a free market is to some extent defined as an efficient one: one in which goods or services are exchanged without coercion or fraud, or in other words with competition (to prevent monopolistic coercion) and transparency (to prevent fraud).|$|R

40|$|The price-quality schema {{rests on}} an {{assumption}} that price is credible information about product quality. However, the credibility of price information varies across different <b>markets.</b> In an <b>inefficient</b> <b>market,</b> consumers would believe in the price-quality relationship {{to a lesser extent}} because price information is less credible. Paradoxically, in such a market, sometimes consumers have to rely more on price to infer quality because other product information is less available. With a cross-national perspective, this study investigated the influences of market efficiency and consumer risk aversion on the price-quality schema between the China and the US markets. We found that due to the <b>inefficient</b> <b>market</b> environment, Chinese consumers possess a weaker price-quality schema than American consumers. Chinese consumers are more risk averse than their American counterparts. However, in China, risk-averse consumers are more likely to use price to infer product quality.
