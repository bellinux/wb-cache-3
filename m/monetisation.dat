50|$|In February 2012, LL Social, {{an online}} {{marketing}} blog, {{broke the news}} that Pinterest was using Skimlinks to monetise content posted by its users. Commercial links included in Pins were being affiliated via Skimlinks. Although the partnership had been ongoing for 2 years, Pinterest had just recently grown exponentially in popularity and the news was badly received. Most of the backlash centered on the company's failure to disclose its <b>monetisation</b> practices rather than its decision to monetise users' content. Though it was claimed that the revelations prompted Pinterest to drop its affiliation with Skimlinks, Pinterest's CEO, Ben Silbermann, clarified that they had actually been using Skimlinks as a test while they explored various <b>monetisation</b> solutions and had stopped using the service {{a week before the}} news broke.|$|E

50|$|Overcapitalisation {{is closely}} related (in causes and consequences) to assets inflation. As the {{financialisation}} of the economy {{has led to the}} <b>monetisation</b> (also called ‘securitisation’) of many non-financial assets, such as real estate, infrastructures, etc., overcapitalisation has become rife, with deleterious consequences at the level of firms (struggling to achieve an unrealistically high level of profitability), households (struggling to pay their inflated mortgage), and individuals (whose equity holding, and hence borrowing and repayment potential, may be vastly over-valued).|$|E

5000|$|Focus on monetisation: One of {{the dangers}} of SROI is that people may focus on <b>monetisation</b> without {{following}} the rest of the process, which is crucial to proving and improving. Moreover, an organisation must be clear about its mission and values and understand how its activities change the world - not only what it does but also what difference it makes. This clarity informs stakeholder engagement. Therefore, if an organisation seeks to monetise its impact without having considered its mission and stakeholders, then it risks choosing inappropriate indicators; and as a result the SROI calculations can be of limited use or even misconstrued.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{commercial}} mobile games {{use one of}} {{the following}} <b>monetisation</b> models: pay-per-download, subscription, free-to-play ('freemium') or advertising-supported.

Subscription business models also existed and had proven popular in some markets (notably Japan) but were rare in Europe. Today, a number of new business models have emerged which are often collectively referred to as [...] "freemium". The game download itself is typically free and then revenue is generated after download either through in-app transactions or advertisements; this resulted in $34 billion spent on mobile games in 2013.|$|E

5000|$|On April 25, 2016, YouTuber and {{freelance}} {{video game}} critic Jim Sterling included clips of footage from Metal Gear Solid V, Grand Theft Auto V and Beyond: Two Souls, {{as well as}} the song Chains of Love, in a video largely discussing Star Fox Zero. Sterling explained this {{at the end of the}} video as a way of preventing Nintendo from claiming and monetising the video by including other material which was similarly flagged by Content ID, hoping that multiple claims would prevent anyone from monetising the video and running advertisements on his channel, which is intended to be ad-free and funded solely by Patreon. In a follow-up video, he claimed that the technique, which he termed the [...] "copyright deadlock" [...] had succeeded, as the video received multiple ContentID claims, one of which attempted to monetise the video, while two others prevented any <b>monetisation,</b> allowing the video to run advertisement-free. Sterling stated that this was indicative of a poorly designed system on YouTube's part, as a video which was well within the bounds of fair use had attracted three copyright claims. He also claimed that he would continue to include material which had previously received Content ID claims in videos likely to attract <b>monetisation</b> attempts from the copyright owners, since fair use was not protecting his videos from copyright claims, pointing out that he now felt incentivized to use as much copyrighted material in his videos as possible, the opposite of what YouTube's copyright policies were intended to achieve.|$|E

50|$|The third {{component}} of the scheme of monetary regulation recommended by the committee and which marks an important departure from the prevailing Monetary Policy practice in India relates to significant relaxations in the prevailing system of administered rates of Interest. The committee {{does not support the}} idea of pricing Credit too low for both the government and the commercial borrowers in public or Private Sector. This is attributable to the fact that low rates of Interest, encourages too much <b>monetisation</b> of Government debt, leaves too little for the Reserve Bank of India's refinance of banks, discourages effective use of Credit by borrowers, discourages financial savings and reduces profitability of Banks and other Financial institutions.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 60% of all {{insurance}} premiums are generated from car insurance. There are about 14 million vehicles in Iran and 90 {{percent of them}} are insured (2012). Of the 10 million motorcycles that operate on Iran's roads only 2 million are insured. Also, 95% of all premiums come from general insurance contracts and only 5% relate to life products (against world average of 58% for life insurance in 2011). One of the defining characteristics of the economy is entrenched high inflation (and expectations) thanks to persistent <b>monetisation</b> of fiscal deficits. This produces an environment in which no prudent person would enter into a long-term savings contract. According to Business Monitor International, unless and until economic policies in Iran change radically, the reality of the insurance sector will fall a long way short of its potential.|$|E
5000|$|Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead {{was even}} more {{critical}}. Scoring the game 4 out of 10, he called the control system [...] "a clumsy and unnatural way to play an FPS." [...] He was also heavily critical of the IAP system's integration into the core gameplay; [...] "This is a game that cannot wait to start asking you to pay, and has at least four interlocked currencies designed {{to make you feel}} like you should.

5000|$|In December 2008, Eric Lonergan and Martin Wolf {{suggested}} in the Financial Times that central banks make cash transfers directly to households, financed with base money, to combat the threat of global deflation. [...] From around 2012 onwards, some economists began advocating variants of helicopter drops, including 'QE for the people', and a 'debt jubilee' financed with the monetary base. These proposals reflected a sense that conventional policies, including QE, were failing or having many adverse effects - on either financial stability or the distribution of wealth and income. In 2013, {{the chairman of the}} UK's Financial Services Authority (FCA), Adair Turner, who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit <b>monetisation</b> is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.|$|E
5000|$|Amateur {{sports are}} sports in which {{participants}} engage largely or entirely without remuneration.

The majority of worldwide sporting participants are amateurs. Sporting amateurism was a zealously guarded ideal in the 19th century, especially among the upper classes, but faced steady erosion throughout the 20th century with the continuing growth of pro sports and <b>monetisation</b> of amateur and collegiate sports, and is now strictly held as an ideal by fewer and fewer organisations governing sports, even as they maintain the word [...] "amateur" [...] in their titles.|$|E
50|$|Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) is a <b>monetisation</b> option {{introduced}} by Singapore to help elderly households in three-room or smaller flats unlock their housing equity {{to meet their}} retirement needs.

The scheme underwent a review, following Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Manpower, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam announcement on 17 Feb 2012. The enhanced LBS was announced on 27 December 2012, under which, eligible elderly households will receive a $20,000 LBS bonus when they sell the tail-end lease of their 4-room or smaller flats to HDB and use their net proceeds to top up their CPF Retirement Account (RAs) to the specified top-up requirements. Further revisions to the scheme were announced on 3 Sep 2014, and took effect from 1 April 2015.|$|E
