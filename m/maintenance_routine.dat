2500|$|James W. Hudspeth, an {{investigator}} {{of a previous}} near accident (an MD-83, starting from Lanzarote) that was similar in its details, {{pointed out that the}} fuse of the so-called [...] "left ground control relay" [...] at position K-33 of the control panel might have been the actual culprit in the erroneous flight mode: Hudspeth found out during a 2-week investigation at Lanzarote that it is customary in normal <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine</b> to temporarily remove this fuse to engage flight mode, but the fuse is afterwards sometimes not replaced correctly. Because of the frequent handling of this fuse, it is also not easy to visually check that the fuse is functioning properly (as is customary for the pilots to do when they enter the cockpit). Hudspeth speculates that this may have happened with both JK 5022 and Northwest Airlines Flight 255.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a gear mechanism, or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine.</b> Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) was {{discovered}} in core shrouds, resulting in a heightened awareness of core shroud <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Routine</b> core shroud inspections became mandatory in most nuclear power plants worldwide because if a core shroud were to collapse, a nuclear meltdown could occur.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} capital asset, {{manufacturers}} typically include the standard maintenance practices and procedures {{needed to keep}} the asset functioning properly and within design specifications. In many cases, scheduled <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines</b> are based on laboratory or design parameters and do not necessarily represent the optimum. MFM supports proper maintenance on marine engines and generators by using the actual fuel burned or hours operated as the basis for performing <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines.</b> This condition-based <b>maintenance</b> program more accurately reflects the operating environment of the engine, but more importantly, reduces or eliminates unnecessary maintenance work.|$|R
40|$|Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is {{commonly}} used for designing <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines</b> by analysing potential failures, predicting their effect and facilitating preventive action. It is used to make decisions on operational and capital expenditure. The literature has reported that despite its popularity, the FMEA method lacks transparency, repeatability {{and the ability to}} continuously improve <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines.</b> In this paper an enhancement to the FMEA method is proposed, which enables the probability of asset failure to be expressed as a function of explanatory variables, such as age, operating conditions or process measurements. The probability of failure and an estimate of the total costs can be used to determine <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines.</b> The procedure facilitates continuous improvement as the dataset builds up. The proposed method is illustrated through two datasets on failures. The first was based on an operating company exploiting a major gas field in the Netherlands. The second was retrieved from the public record and covers degradation occurrences of nuclear power plants in the United State...|$|R

50|$|Flywheel {{maintenance}} {{in general}} runs about one-half {{the cost of}} traditional battery UPS systems. The only maintenance is a basic annual preventive <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine</b> and replacing the bearings every five to ten years, which takes about four hours.

50|$|In {{addition}} to feeding and operating the plant, and packaging or preparing the product for shipping, plant workers {{are needed for}} taking samples for routine and troubleshooting analysis and for performing routine and non-routine <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Routine</b> maintenance can include periodic inspections and replacement of worn catalyst, analyzer reagents, various sensors, or mechanical parts. Non-routine maintenance can include investigating problems and then fixing them, such as leaks, failure to meet feed or product specifications, mechanical failures of valves, pumps, compressors, sensors, etc.|$|E

5000|$|If {{one is the}} {{custodian}} of a pole, it {{is recommended}} to develop a maintenance plan. It is preferable to have the maintenance performed by a professional conservator. [...] "The maintenance of a pole can include the removal of vegetation and an application of a water repellent. During a <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine</b> check, {{the stability of the}} base of the pole is tested. The base of the pole is checked for rot and decay and can be done with a resistograph. [...] "The resistograph uses a very fine drill bit 20" [...] long which gives graphic chart readings as it penetrates the wood". Testing the density of the base is important {{to ensure the safety of}} the public so the pole does not fall down. In addition to checking for decay and stability, any loose fragments can be repaired or removed. Last, any type of insect or biological growth can be documented and treated. Photographs and documentation help keep track of the condition of the pole throughout the years.|$|E
50|$|Improved {{methods of}} {{aligning}} the Gresley conjugated valve gear in the 1950s led to tighter tolerances for the bearings used within it and consequently to almost total eradication of the overloading {{of the middle}} cylinder.

50|$|Clusters are {{primarily}} designed with performance in mind, but installations {{are based on}} many other factors; fault tolerance (the ability for a system to continue working with a malfunctioning node) also allows for simpler scalability, and in high performance situations, low frequency of <b>maintenance</b> <b>routines,</b> resource consolidation, and centralized management.

40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} a video {{ethnography}} of building care and makes this work available to {{an investigation of}} how “non human agency” is sustained in actual cases of repair and maintenance activities. Therefore, the paper homes in on a particular situation of maintenance work, bringing together a caretaker {{and a couple of}} tenants, regarding a low water pressure problem (LWPP) at the couple’s flat. The paper examines how the participants engage in a situated, temporally unfolding, collaborative and yet distributed inquiry regarding the encountered problem and its candidate solutions. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>routine,</b> {{in the course of the}} examined situation, appears to stand in an asymmetrical relationship with repair work due to a prior ‘botched job’, and the outlined video analysis demonstrates just how the involved participants establish, elaborate and, eventually, suspend this relationship. The expression “reassembling repair” encapsulates this moment of suspension, when the caretaker, upon the tenants’ final hint, indeed repairs the LWPP (by reassembling and removing its ‘root cause’), instead of sustaining his <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine</b> (to temper only the problem’s ‘symptoms’). In describing participants’ situated inquiry, their practical deliberations and its eventual denouement, the paper offers an apt opportunity to reflect upon socio-material approaches that simplify, simply invoke, or actually “neglect the situation” in favor of renewed epistemologies or generalized ontologies in Science and Technology Studies...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft, wind turbines, {{or space}} {{stations}} {{are expected to}} remain in service well beyond their designed performance lifetime. Consequently, maintenance {{is an important issue}} for aircraft or aerospace structures. This is accomplished through inspecting for damage at scheduled times and replacing damaged parts before failure. Ground inspections of aircraft, even using simple nondestructive testing techniques, generally require the aircraft be pulled from operation so that its components can be inspected for damage. Structural components are replaced if sufficient damage is found. Research is underway to develop a structural health monitoring (SHM) system as a means to improve the current <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine.</b> This system would consist of an array of sensors and associated analysis codes which would scan for damage in-flight and perform real time damage analysis of an aircraft’s structure. If damage is recognized long before failure occurs, then a damage tolerance and prognostic assessment could be implemented, allowing for a determination of the remaining life of components. This would ultimately lead to fewer required ground inspections. The current method of inspecting aircraft, consisting of ground inspections for damage after a set number of flight hours, works well from an aircraft safety point of view. However, an in...|$|E
40|$|Workshop 5 Social inclusionGenerally, Brazilian students, {{especially}} rural residents, face several {{challenges to}} stay in school, from insufficient access to food, to difficulties in affording transportation, clothing and school materials. That is why offering free public education does not enable the access of students to school or prevent them from dropping out. Rural school transportation is the conveyance of students from their home to the school {{in which they are}} enrolled. Students may be conveyed between rural districts or from a rural area to the municipality’s urban seat. Further, the Brazilian Constitution mandates that states and municipalities provide free rural pupil transportation. To that end, states and cities may establish agreements for the municipality to convey students who attend schools under the state’s jurisdiction in exchange for the due financial aid. Public Authorities may provide school transportation directly or by means of contracting a third party enterprise through a bidding procedure. Thus, to support such agreements, it is central to identify the cost of operation of rural school transportation. Such cost encompasses input costs; optimizing route lengths; monitor the <b>maintenance</b> <b>routine</b> of vehicles and controlling taxes and fees related to the service.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years in New Zealand, machine {{collected}} data such as texture, roughness, and rutting {{has been the}} mainstay for pavement analysis and performance measurement. The problem is that ‘machine ’ collected data does not portray the full pavement performance picture; particularly as we are always looking at historical data. The measures therefore, become ‘lag ’ measures. Field work is {{a key component of}} analysis. It is however, often left until after the desktop analysis (data mining and modelling). Also, field operatives traditionally find it difficult to contribute to discussions around Pavement Modelling and Performance Indicators and, therefore can feel disconnected. This research paper investigates an enhanced visual condition rating system of actual pavement defects {{that can be used to}} reconnect the decision makers with the field staff and their observations. For the test network (Wanganui District Council, New Zealand) decision makers now have a (near) real-time view of the changing performance of the network. This has lead to the development of new types of performance measures i. e. ‘lead ’ indicators that are sensitive enough to identify the quality of maintenance intervention strategies. This has allowed asset managers to proactively manage <b>maintenance</b> (<b>routine</b> and periodic) in a more agile environment and for the development of new contract delivery models. This approach has contributed, on the test network, to a 21 % improvement in the way funds are turned into asset value, i. e. value for money...|$|E
