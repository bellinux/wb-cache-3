Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, whose uncle was a prominent official in a minor opposition party.

25|$|The main {{characters}} are a group {{who attended the}} fictional Walden College during the strip's first 12 years, and moved into a commune together in April 1972. Most of the other characters first appeared as family members, friends, or other acquaintances. The original Walden Commune residents were Mike Doonesbury, Zonker Harris, Mark Slackmeyer, Nicole, Bernie, and DiDi. In September 1972, Joanie Caucus joined the comic, meeting Mike and Mark in Colorado and eventually moving into the commune. They were later joined by B.D. and his girlfriend (later wife) Boopsie, upon B.D.'s return from Vietnam. Nicole, DiDi, and Bernie were mostly phased out in subsequent years, and Zonker's Uncle Duke was introduced as the most prominent character outside the Walden group, and the <b>main</b> <b>link</b> to many secondary characters.|$|E
25|$|The roads have {{reverted to}} their {{previous}} 'heavily restricted' status. There is still considerable car traffic {{into and out}} of the park, mainly of families with children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park 'through traffic' is now completely blocked by sturdy gates across the <b>main</b> <b>link</b> roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced the use of the park as a rush-hour short-cut (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced wear and tear on the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes relay {{selection}} {{to increase the}} physical layer security in multiuser cooperative relay networks with multiple amplify-and-forward relays, {{in the presence of}} mul-tiple eavesdroppers. To strengthen the network security against eavesdropping attack, we present three criteria to select the best relay and user pair. Specifically, criteria I and II study the re-ceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receivers, and perform the selection by maximizing the SNR ratio of the user to the eavesdroppers. To this end, criterion I relies on both the <b>main</b> and eavesdropper <b>links,</b> while criterion II relies on the <b>main</b> <b>links</b> only. Criterion III is the standard max-min selection criterion, which maximizes the minimum of the dual-hop channel gains of <b>main</b> <b>links.</b> For the three selection criteria, we examine the system secrecy performance by deriving the analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability. We also derive the asymptotic analysi...|$|R
25|$|Stauning {{remained}} {{prime minister}} {{until his death}} in 1942, as head of a coalition cabinet encompassing all major political parties (the exceptions being the tiny Nazi party, and the Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1941 as discussed). Vilhelm Buhl replaced him briefly, only to be replaced by foreign minister Erik Scavenius, who had been the <b>main</b> <b>link</b> to the Nazi authorities throughout the war. Scavenius was a diplomat, not an elected politician, and had an elitist approach to government. He was afraid that emotional public opinion would destabilize his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of German occupation. Scavenius felt strongly that he was Denmark's most ardent defender. After the war there was much recrimination over his stance, particularly from members of the active resistance, who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark's national honour. He felt that these people were vain, seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through emotionalism.|$|E
25|$|While Natale ran the family, Merlino and {{his young}} allies {{maintained}} control on the street, collecting extortion payments and profiting from rackets and schemes Natale was not made aware of. Merlino was also the crime family's <b>main</b> <b>link</b> {{to many of the}} other criminal groups in Philadelphia. Merlino was only 32 years old, an extremely young age for any Mafia member, let alone a leader of a Mafia family. Merlino and his allies were all young and unexperienced in running a criminal organization of such magnitude. They were also flashy, violent and loved the limelight. Merlino was often spotted by reporters and cameramen on the streets of South Philadelphia followed by a large entourage. Merlino's high-profile brought a lot of attention from the press and law enforcement. The crime family itself was unstable, with things poorly managed by Merlino's crew whose violent reputation was used to keep things in order. The Merlino faction's arrogance and aggressiveness turned off a lot of criminals from working with the crime family. Merlino's associates were also involved in drug deals in Philadelphia and Boston while overseeing the crime family's gambling, loan sharking, stolen goods and extortion rackets.|$|E

The total distance of the Trans-Canada Highway in Saskatchewan is [...] [...] The highway traverses Saskatchewan from the western border with Alberta, from Highway 1, to the Manitoba border where it continues as PTH 1. The TransCanada Highway Act was passed on December 10, 1949. The Saskatchewan segment was completed August 21,1957. The speed limit along {{the majority of the}} route is 110kilometres per hour (70–mph) with urban area thoroughfares slowing to a speed of 90–100 kilometres per hour (55–65mph). Portions of the highway—the section through Swift Current, an 8-kilometer section east of Moose Jaw, and the Regina Ring Road—are controlled-access. Highway 1 serves as a major east-west transport route for commercial traffic.

Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the <b>main</b> <b>link</b> to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script.

500|$|As {{trade in}} Blyth {{continued}} to grow, {{so did the}} population. [...] Development of the Cowpen Quay and Waterloo areas began in about 1810 and 1815 respectively, and between the 1850s and 1890s major house building took place in these areas. [...] Blyth railway station, first built in 1847, was relocated in 1867 and rebuilt in 1896, {{to cope with the}} increase in goods and passenger traffic. [...] The 1890s saw the filling in of [...] "the Slake" [...] (also known as [...] "the Flanker" [...] or [...] "the Gut"). [...] The Slake was a tidal inlet which stretched south from the river, across the site of today's bus station, along the route of Beaconsfield Street, and on past Crofton Mill Pit. [...] Before it was filled in, it almost entirely separated Blyth from Cowpen—Waterloo Bridge providing the only <b>main</b> <b>link.</b> [...] Once it was removed, the two areas could combine and allow the town to begin to take its present form.

500|$|Like its predecessor, Ultima Underworld II was {{produced}} by Warren Spector, who was Looking Glass' <b>main</b> <b>link</b> to publisher Origin Systems. Church later praised Spector's handling of the project: his weekly phone conversations and monthly meetings with Looking Glass helped Church and the team to refocus creatively during development. When the team failed to produce enough art for the game, Spector supplemented the art team with contractors from Origin, which Church believed was [...] "critical" [...] to the game's being released on schedule. As {{a result of the}} art team's distance from Looking Glass, Church had to phone [...] "nine different area codes every couple days to check up on things". He recalled the challenge of describing the enemy designs by phone. Dan Schmidt and the recently hired Seamus Blackley composed the game's score in Blackley's apartment over one week. They attempted to give each world a unique sound, while hiding variations of the main theme in each track. The music system from the original Ultima Underworld was retained with only minor alterations, but the team included digitized sound effects instead of the synthesized audio used in the first game.|$|E
