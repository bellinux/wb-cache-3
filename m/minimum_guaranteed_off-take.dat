In return for their contributions, members expect a benefit at termination of their contract. Due to the volatile nature of returns that pension funds attain, pension companies started attaching a <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> amount to member’s benefits. In this mini-thesis we look at the pioneering work of Brennan and Schwartz [10] for pricing these <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantees.</b> The model they developed prices these <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantees</b> using option pricing theory. We also look at the model proposed by Deelstra et al. which prices <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantees</b> in a stochastic financial setting. We conclude this mini-thesis with new contributions where we look at simple alternative ways of pricing <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantees.</b> We conclude this mini-thesis with an approach, related to the work of Brennan and Schwartz [10], whereby the member’s benefit is maximised for a given <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> amount, which comprises of multi-period guarantees.

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} optimal {{investment}} and optimal portfolio strategies with <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantee</b> and inflation protection in a defined contribution (DC) pension scheme. We assume a market structure that {{is characterized by}} a cash account, an indexed bond (i. e., inflation-linked bond) and stock. We obtain optimal share of portfolio values (that depend on the <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantee)</b> in the indexed bond and stock for the pension plan member (PPM) at time t. We find that in the presence of indexed bond in the investment strategy, the inflation risk that is associated with the PPM’s contributions and <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantee</b> is hedged. Hence, indexed bond can be used to hedge inflation risk that is associated with a contributory pension funds scheme. We also find in our numerical result that, with effective management of the pension funds by pension fund administrators (PFAs), PPMs will have high returns from their investment. From our results, we find that the optimal terminal wealth that will accrue to the PPM and PFA to be 221097. 1 N. We also find that the <b>minimum</b> <b>guarantee</b> that will accrue to the PPM at retirement to be 81005. 3 N. The portfolio values in stock, indexed bond and cash account are 0. 5, 3. 1, and- 2. 6, respectively. Therefore, more investment should go to indexed bond and stock since they yield positive portfolio value...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that Table  3 is also showing an {{interesting}} difference of best effort with <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> services and guaranteed ones. Guaranteed services are bounded by the maximum capacity, and the allocated capacity cannot go higher than this boundary, while best effort with <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> service does not have this limitation. Considering VoIP in VNO GB and VNO BG, {{it can be seen that}} the latter is allocated with a higher capacity since this service of VNO GB is assigned with the maximum capacity; for VNO BE, VoIP shows the effect of fairness among services.|$|R

40|$|Many {{real-world}} financial contracts {{have some}} sort of minimum rate of return guarantee included.

However, VNO GB faces the violation on the <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> data rate in the PE approach, as the number of subscribers passes 1100 : while at least 3.42  Gbps is required, only 97.3 % of it is allocated to the VNO; this means that the network capacity in this approach is lower than the total <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> data rates, and the resource management entity has to violate some of the <b>minimum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> data rates. The VNO requires at least 4.36  Gbps for the heavy load, the allocated data rate being 6.28  Gbps in RL and 4.42  Gbps in G, which are still enough to fulfil the SLA, but it goes down to 3.3  Gbps, i.e., 76.8 % of the minimum required data rate, in PE, in clear violation of the SLA. This clearly shows the effect of SINR on resources usage efficiency and QoS offered to VNOs.|$|R
