5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory <b>mediators</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

Some workers {{have attempted to}} fit prostaglandins into a simple model, i. e. inflammatory leads to chemical mediator leads to vascular response. Recent work has shown that this approach may be misleading. An alternative model is proposed, involving the interaction of two chemical agents, i. e. a vascular permeability-increasing <b>mediator</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> histamine or bradykinin) and a vasodilator (prostaglandin) which potentiates the plasma exudation produced by the permeability-increasing mediator.

40|$|AbstractIn bone {{development}} and regeneration, angiogenesis and bone/cartilage resorption are essential processes and are {{closely associated with}} each other, suggesting a common mediator for these two biological events. To address this interrelationship, we examined the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most critical growth factor for angiogenesis, on osteoclastic bone-resorbing activity in a culture of highly purified rabbit mature osteoclasts. VEGF caused a dose- and time-dependent increase {{in the area of}} bone resorption pits excavated by the isolated osteoclasts, partially by enhancing the survival of the cells. Two distinct VEGF receptors, KDR/Flk- 1 and Flt- 1, were detectable in osteoclasts at the gene and protein levels, and VEGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in osteoclasts. Thus, osteoclastic function and angiogenesis are up-regulated by a common <b>mediator</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> VEGF...|$|R

40|$|Lipopolysaccharide, {{a potent}} {{activator}} {{of the immune}} system, elicits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in immunocytes. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and myeloid differentiation factor (MD) 2 receptor complex is required for recognition and signaling of LPS. Previous study suggested water soluble chitosan decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL- 6. However, no studies have provided direct target and molecular mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of chitosan oligosaccharide on LPS-stimulated cells. In this study, we found that chitosan oligosaccharides significantly inhibited binding of LPS to TLR 4 /MD- 2 receptor complex, thus attenuated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and decreased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). Finally, chitosan oligosaccharides reduced the production of pro-inflammatory <b>mediator,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> IL- 1 beta and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells. Therefore, chitosan oligosaccharides are potential inhibitive effector of LPS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We study well-motivated {{dark matter}} {{candidates}} arising from weakly-coupled hidden sectors in compactified string/$M$-theory. Imposing generic top-down constraints greatly restricts allowed candidates. By considering the possible mechanisms for achieving the correct dark matter relic density, we compile categories of viable dark matter candidates and annihilation mediators. We {{consider the case}} where supersymmetry breaking occurs via moduli stabilisation and is gravitationally mediated to the visible and other hidden sectors, without assuming sequestering of the sector in which supersymmetry is broken. We find that in this case, weakly-coupled hidden sectors only allow for fermionic dark matter. Additionally, most of the mechanisms for obtaining the full relic density only allow for a gauge boson <b>mediator,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> a dark $Z'$. Given these considerations, we study the potential for discovering or constraining the allowed parameter space given current and future direct detection experiments, and direct production at the LHC.

500|$|Furthermore, aspirin, while {{inhibiting}} {{the ability}} of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins, converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving <b>mediators</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the aspirin-triggered lipoxins, aspirin-triggered resolvins, and aspirin-triggered maresins.

40|$|Abstract__ __Purpose__ – We {{analyze the}} effects of {{leadership}} on work-family spillovers. Specifically, we analyze the relationships between leadership (leader-member exchange, LMX) with one negative work-family spillover effect (work-family interference) and one positive work-family spillover effect (work-family facilitation). We hypothesize that LMX influences work-family spillover via different mediators, rather than one all-encompassing <b>mediator,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> empowerment. __Design/methodology/approach__ – We hypothesize that {{a good relationship with}} your supervisor (high LMX) diminishes work pressure, which in turn reduces work-family interference. Furthermore, we expect that a good relationship with your supervisor positively relates to the meaningfulness of work, as you could get more interesting work and more understanding of your role within the organization. In turn, this will increase work-family facilitation. These hypotheses are tested using a nation-wide survey among Dutch healthcare professionals. __Findings__ – Findings of Structural Equation Modeling indeed indicate that high quality LMX is negatively related to work-family interference, and that this is mediated by work pressure (53...|$|R

40|$|Tumor Necrosis Factor/cachectin (TNF) 1 {{has been}} implicated as a {{mediator}} of the host response in sepsis and neoplasia (1 - 2). The close relationship between the septic state and coagulation abnormalities (e. g., disseminated intravascular coagulation), and the hemorrhagic nature of the lesions in the tumor bed induced by TNF (2) suggest that defects in the hemostatic system may result from the action of TNF. In this context, recent {{studies have indicated that}} TNF can modulate hemostatic properties of the cells forming the luminal vascular surface, the endothelium (3). Through the concomitant induction of endothelial cell procoagulant activity and suppression of anticoagulant mechanisms, TNF renders the vessel wall a potentially effective surface for thrombotic phenomena and the ensuing coagulopathies. These data suggest the hypothesis that endothelium is a target tissue for TNF. To serve as a target tissue for an inflammatory <b>mediator</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> TNF, endothelium would be expected to provide both binding sites and an amplification mechanism through which the TNF-stimulated cell could augment th...|$|R
2500|$|The {{generation}} of single-stranded DNA tracts {{is important in}} initiating the checkpoint pathways downstream of replication damage. Once single-stranded DNA becomes sufficiently long, single-stranded DNA coated with RPA are able to recruit ATR-ATRIP. In order to become fully active, the ATR kinase rely on sensor proteins that sense whether the checkpoint proteins are localized to a valid site of DNA replication stress. The RAD9-HUS1-Rad1 (9-1-1) heterotrimeric clamp and its clamp loader RFCRad17 are able to recognize gapped or nicked DNA. The RFCRad17 clamp loader loads 9-1-1 onto the damaged DNA. The presence of 9-1-1 on DNA is enough to facilitate the interaction between ATR-ATRIP {{and a group of}} proteins termed checkpoint <b>mediators,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> TOPBP1 and Mrc1/claspin.

30|$|After synthesis, we {{performed}} graphene {{transfer to a}} SiO 2 -covered Si wafer, glass plates, and PET sheets for further development. Here, we tried {{to carry out the}} transfer without a polymeric <b>mediator</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> polymethyl methacrylate film to prevent potential contamination during the removal of the polymeric films and thus preserve the clean surface of the as-synthesized graphene, as schematically shown in Fig. 2 c. In brief, we first etched silicon dioxide using a 3 M KOH solution at 75 °C and obtained a catalytic Ni layer covered with graphene. The temperature of the solution was sensitive to removal of the SiO 2 layer. Then, we further etched out the Ni layer using a 1 M FeCl 3 solution. When the Ni layer was completely removed, the graphene began floating on the solution and was discernable with the naked eye; we were thus able to scoop it up using receiving substrates. For optical microscopic observation, we used SiO 2 (300 -nm thick)-coated Si wafers since we can clearly determine the number of graphene layers by color differences (Fig. 2 d).|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of an organic <b>mediator</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> dibenzofuran, the reduction of chlorobenzene occurs indirectly and at substantially less negative potentials compared to its direct reduction at a glassy carbon cathode in acetonitrile. By using the indirect, mediator approach to reduction of chlorobenzene, constant current electrolysis at carbon plate cathodes can give complete dechlorination with high current efficiency. Both divided and undivided cells were used, each having their own advantages. Besides dibenzofuran, naphthalene and biphenyl were successfully tested as organic mediators for chlorobenzene reduction. During the entire electrolysis, the mediator concentration remained practically constant so that substantially less mediator was required in comparison to the substrate, i. e., chlorobenzene. Higher concentrations of mediator can be beneficial, e. g., a dibenzofuran:chlorobenzene ratio of 2. 5 : 5 as compared to 1 : 5, if the electrolysis is to be conducted at higher current density. For electrolysis of large amounts of chlorobenzene, an approach where the substrate is added periodically to a solution of the (reduced) mediator is recommended. A comparison of the results from direct vs. indirect dechlorination of chlorobenzene clearly demonstrates the substnatial superiority of the latter approach.

40|$|In {{order to}} design azo {{polymers}} having potential {{for use as}} colonic coating materials, {{the most important factors}} able to affect the bacterial degradation of azo derivatives were evaluated by a reliable method, using Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 as colonic bacteria. The azo degradation was followed by recording the decrease of the absorbance of azo dye solutions in phosphate buffer salt (PBs), pH 7. 2, containing Clostridium perfringens, vs time. The results obtained show that the degradation of azo substrates is linear (zero order), faster in basic media and when a redox <b>mediator,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> riboflavin or benzylviologen, is introduced in the incubation medium. Moreover, the substrate redox potential was shown not to affect significantly the degradation rates. However, when several azo dyes are introduced simultaneously into the incubation medium, the microbial azo reduction occurs sequentially as a first. Finally, when Eudragit® RL/RS films containing an azo dye (amaranth) are incubated with Clostridium perfringens or NADPH, the rime required to bleach the films decreases dramatically when the percentage of Eudragit® RL in the films increases, {{as a result of the}} increase of the film permeability.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is presented {{that describes the}} effects of hormone concentration on receptor saturation and biological response in systems dependent upon the generation of a secondary <b>mediator</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> cyclic AMP. The analysis makes the following assumptions: (i) the binding of hormone to its receptor is a reversible, second-order reaction; (ii) the concentration of mediator that is generated is directly proportional {{to the number of}} membrane binding sites occupied by hormone; and (iii) the binding of the mediator with its intracellular receptor to generate an effector complex is also second-order and results in a proportionate biological response. It follows from this treatment that the hormone concentration required for half-maximal biological response is formally lower than that required for half-maximal receptor saturation and that the difference between these two concentrations will depend upon the ratio of total mediator generated at full receptor occupancy to the dissociation constant of the mediator with its receptor. Without invoking concepts of negative cooperativity, this model offers a simple explanation for discrepancies between receptor occupancy and biological response curves that are often observed. Moreover, the mathematical form of the predicted biological response curves conforms to the shape of the response curves observed experimentally {{in a wide variety of}} systems...|$|R
