50|$|The MiG-29 has two widely spaced Klimov RD-33 {{turbofan}} engines, each {{rated at}} 50.0 kN (11,240 lbf) dry and 81.3 kN (18,277 lbf) in afterburner. The {{space between the}} engines generates lift, thereby reducing effective wing loading, hence improving maneuverability. The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading-edge extensions (LERXs), which have variable ramps to allow high-Mach speeds. As an adaptation to rough-field operations, the <b>main</b> <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> can be closed completely and the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage {{can be used for}} takeoff, landing and low-altitude flying, preventing ingestion of ground debris. Thereby the engines receive air through louvers on the LERXs which open automatically when intakes are closed. However the latest variant of the family, the MiG-35, eliminated these dorsal louvers, and adopted the mesh screens design in the main intakes, similar to those fitted to the Su-27.|$|E

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time.

The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. <b>Air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures of 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C and <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities of 0. 6 m/s, 1. 6 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0. 6 m/s to 1. 6 m/s. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time. For lower <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant {{over a longer period}} of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity of 0. 6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that discharging time can be extended by reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size on (i) the flowfield {{generated}} in a dry powder inhaler, and (ii) the device-specific resistance, and the subsequent effect on powder deagglomeration. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{analysis was used to}} simulate the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer 1 with different <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> sizes at 30, 45, and 60 l/min. Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured using mannitol powder and a multistage liquid impinger at the same flow rates. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size had a varying effect on powder dispersion depending on the flow rate. At low flow rates (30 and 45 l/min), reducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size increased the inhaler dispersion performance by increasing the flow turbulence and particle impaction velocities above their critical levels for maximal powder dispersion. At 60 l/min, re-ducing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> size reduced the inhaler dispersion performance by releasing a large amount of powder from the device before the turbulence levels and particle impaction velocities could be fully developed. The results demonstrate that the maximal inhaler dispersion performance can be predicted if details of the device flowfield are known...|$|R

30|$|The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> {{system of}} {{traditional}} engines mainly relies on absorption by the quarter-wavelength straight-tube to suppress high-frequency noise, but two major problems exist. First, the quarter-wavelength straight-tube has a narrow denoising band and cannot cover the low-frequency noise band completely, {{which results in}} incomplete noise reduction. Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> tube in the engine’s inlet system, the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> system. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of muffler design, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength straight-tube and Helmholtz muffler, with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size. When used in a practical automobile test, the muffler showed excellent performance in high frequency noise reduction of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> system, and this performance was supported by the experimental data.|$|R

The jets were injected from the perimeter of a cylindrical duct through round-hole orifices into a fuel-rich mainstream flow. The number of orifices investigated in this study gave over- to optimum to underpenetrating jets at a jet-to-mainstream momentum-flux ratio of J = 57. The size of individual orifices was decreased {{as the number of}} orifices increased to maintain a constant total area; the jet-to-mainstream mass-flow ratio was constant at MR = 2. 5. The experiments focused on the effects of the number of orifices and <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> preheat and were conducted in a facility that provided the capability for independent variation of jet and <b>main</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> preheat temperature.
