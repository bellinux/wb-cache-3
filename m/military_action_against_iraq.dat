25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for <b>military</b> <b>action</b> <b>against</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

40|$|OTTAWA- A Canadian {{court has}} sided {{for the first}} time with a {{military}} deserter who fled to Canada seeking refugee status, ruling that the U. S. soldier witnessed enough human rights abuses during a stint in Iraq that he could qualify for asylum. The decision yesterday also marked the first time that the Federal Court, which has heard a handful of cases involving deserters, concluded that <b>military</b> <b>action</b> <b>against</b> civilians in <b>Iraq</b> violates the 1949 Geneva Convention, an international prohibition against humiliating and degrading treatment. Federal Court Justice Richard Barnes ordered the Immigration and Refugee Board to reconsider the failed refugee claim of Joshua Key, a soldier who entered Canada with his wife, Brandi, and their small children in March, 2005. Mr. Key, an army private, deserted during a two-week break from serving as a combat engineer in Iraq, where he spent eight months in 2003 and says he was involved in military-condoned home invasions against civilians. Judge Barnes said the immigration board found Mr. Key "was not a conscientious objector in the usual sense of being opposed to war generally, and that his objections to the conflict in Iraq were not politically or religiously motivated. Rather, what Mr. Key objected to were the systematic violations of human rights that resulted from the conduct of the United States Army in Iraq and the requirement that he participate.
