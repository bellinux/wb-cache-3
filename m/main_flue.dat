40|$|AbstractSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) DeNOx is the <b>main</b> <b>flue</b> gas {{denitrification}} technology, and {{the efficiency}} of SCR DeNOx system depends on whether the flue gas and ammonia distributions of the velocity and concentration fields are uniform in the reactor. Combined with the porous medium model and component transport equations, the numerical simulations were carried on for the SCR system of the 1000 MW coal-fired station, and the velocity fields and concentration fields in different cases were obtained. The results showed that: the corner vane cascades and rectifier grills installed, the non-uniformity of flue gas velocity is less than 15 % at the catalyst inlet within the reactor. Under {{the premise of the}} best flow field, the vortex mixers can ensure the full blending of the ammonia and flue gas in the reactor. The reliability of numerical simulation is verified through the cold model test, and then the design of the SCR system is guided effectively by the numerical simulations...|$|E
50|$|Sixty {{feet of the}} <b>main</b> stack dust <b>flue</b> {{collapsed}} in May 1912. Rebuilding was completed by 13 June. A temporary chimney {{was used for the}} lead smelters only. In early June 1912 the Chillagoe lead smelter was closed down and 50 men laid off. The water jacket on the copper smelter burst and copper smelting also closed down. The lead smelter resumed on 2 August 1912 and the copper smelter on 4 September 1912. Both furnaces ran until October when the coke ran out. The Huntingdon- Heberlein furnace was out of commission. The roasting works operated solely on Mungana sulphide ores and on ore from Torpy's Crooked Creek mine. The Chillian mill (No.8 ball mill) operated on the fine ores.|$|R

40|$|AbstractClimate change {{mitigation}} is {{a dynamic}} area that, as it is addressed, brings new challenges to other environmental aspects. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) plants are the latest development {{in a series of}} environmental controls and have some distinctive features that could potentially lead to other wider environmental problems. Whilst CCS represents a significant step towards cutting greenhouse gas emissions, consideration needs to be given to the potential wider environmental consequences especially in terms of pollutant emissions and local air quality impacts. Challenges remain for existing plants which will need to consider the most cost-effective strategies for installation of CCS plant balanced against managing air quality impacts as dispersion characteristics change. In the case of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture technology, which is the focus of this paper, removal of CO 2 from the <b>main</b> <b>flue</b> gas stream requires diversion of the flue gas through the CCS process, before it arrives at the exhaust stack. This flue gas stream may be {{all or part of the}} total plant flow or for multi-unit plants may be diverted from specific power generation units into the CCS plant before exhausting to atmosphere, either through returning back to the existing stack or through a new dedicated stack. This diversion and subsequent emission in itself poses an engineering challenge. In particular, the integration of the CCS process with the existing plant must also ensure that the diverted flue gas still achieves adequate dispersion as it contains residual levels of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2), despite the fact that the CCS process itself may reduce some of these pollutant levels further as a process by-product. Power plants which incorporate CCS will still be required to adhere to the appropriate pollutant emission limits and ensure effective dispersion to minimise the risk of breaching local air quality standards. This paper draws on experience gained through post-combustion CCS projects and addresses the potential effects of CCS on air quality, in the case of carbon capture retrofits. The findings of this paper are relevant to project developers, power generators and policymakers globally who have an interest in the potential for CCS to provide an emissions abatement option for existing thermal assets in the short and long term...|$|E

This work is {{the first part of}} a project aiming to optimize the design of a H 2 O/CO 2 Oxy-Fuel condenser. The project aims to achieve an in-depth understanding of the separation process at varying thermal conditions and with varying fluid compositions. COMSOL simulation tool has been used to study fluid flow, heat transfer and condensation process for H 2 O/CO 2 mixtures. The simulated condenser is a tank with all of its accessories.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of the <b>main</b> constituents of <b>flue</b> gases from coal combustion (CO 2, O 2, N 2 and water vapor), in air and oxy-fuel combustion conditions on the re-emission of Hg 0 in wet scrubbers. It was observed that the concentration of water vapor does not affect the re-emission of mercury, whereas O 2 and CO 2 have a notable influence. High concentrations of O 2 in the flue gas prevent the re-emission of Hg 0 due to the reaction of oxygen with the metals present in low oxidation states. High concentrations of CO 2, which cause a decrease in the pH and the redox potential of gypsum slurries, reduce the amount of Hg 0 that is re-emitted. As a consequence, the high content of CO 2 in oxy-fuel combustion may decrease the re-emission of Hg 0 due to the solubility of CO 2 in the suspension and the decrease in the pH. It was also found that O 2 affects the stabilization of Hg 2 + species in gypsum slurries. The results of this study confirm that the amount of metals present in limestone as well as the redox potential and pH of the slurries in wet desulphurization plants need to be strictly controlled to reduce Hg 0 re-emissions from power plants operating under oxy-fuel combustion conditions.

40|$|Oxidation of Hg 0 {{with any}} oxidant or {{converting}} it to a particle-bound form can facilitate its removal. Two sulfur-chlorine compounds, sulfur dichloride (SCl 2) and sulfur monochloride (S 2 Cl 2), were investigated as oxidants for Hg 0 by {{gas phase reaction}} and by surface-involved reactions {{in the presence of}} flyash or activated carbon. The gas phase reaction rate constants between Hg 0 and the sulfur/chlorine compounds were determined, and the effects of temperature and the <b>main</b> components in <b>flue</b> gases were studied. The gas phase reaction between Hg 0 and SCl 2 is shown to be more rapid than the gas phase reaction with chlorine, and the second order rate constant was 9. 1 (+- 0. 5) x 10 - 18 mL-molecules- 1 cdots- 1 at 373 oK. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibited the gas phase reaction of Hg 0 with sulfur-chlorine compounds. The presence of flyash or powdered activated carbon in flue gas can substantially accelerate the reaction. The predicted Hg 0 removal is about 90 percent with 5 ppm SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 and 40 g/m 3 of flyash in flue gas. The combination of activated carbon and sulfur-chlorine compounds is an effective alternative. We estimate that co-injection of 3 - 5 ppm of SCl 2 (or S 2 Cl 2) with 2 - 3 Lb/MMacf of untreated Darco-KB is comparable in efficiency to the injection of 2 - 3 Lb/MMacf Darco-Hg-LH. Extrapolation of kinetic results also indicates that 90 percent of Hg 0 can be removed if 3 Lb/MMacf of Darco-KB pretreated with 3 percent of SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 is used. Unlike gas phase reactions, NO exhibited little effect on Hg 0 reactions with SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 on flyash or activated carbon. Mercuric sulfide was identified as one of the principal products of the Hg 0 /SCl 2 or Hg 0 /S 2 Cl 2 reactions. Additionally, about 8 percent of SCl 2 or S 2 Cl 2 in aqueous solutions is converted to sulfide ions, which would precipitate mercuric ion from FGD solution...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{reports have}} shown that global {{population}} is rising and more fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, are required to meet the global energy demands. The adverse effect of burning fossil fuels has become a concern due to its contribution to global warming and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly CO 2, have been regarded as a main cause for the rising temperature of the earth’s surface. To partially address this pressing social problem, CO 2 capture technology, which has been considered as an efficient and feasible technology to reduce global CO 2 emissions, has been deeply explored and tested over the last decades. Among several available CO 2 capture technologies, the MEA-based post-combustion CO 2 capture process is considered a mature technology for mitigating CO 2 emissions due to its inherent benefits, e. g. high CO 2 capture capacity, low price of MEA solvent and fast kinetics. However, {{a large amount of}} energy is required to regenerate MEA solvent. Thus, the efficiency of fossil fuel-fired power plants decreases. In addition, the dynamic operation of the CO 2 capture process needs to be explored in more detail to analyze the transient operation of this plant and its interaction with the operation of the fossil fuel-fired power plants. Thus, the development of MEA-based CO 2 capture technology has gained attention. Based on above, in the present study, a dynamic model of a pilot-scale MEA-based CO 2 capture plant was first developed and a flexibility analysis under critical operating conditions was performed followed by an implementation of simultaneous scheduling and control using the proposed dynamic model. Based on the pilot-scale CO 2 capture plant, a natural gas power plant integrated with a commercial-scale MEA-based post-combustion CO 2 capture process was developed. The proposed model was used to perform a flexibility analysis on the integrated systems. This study first presents a dynamic flexibility analysis of a pilot-scale post-combustion CO 2 capture plant using MPC. The critical operating conditions in the plant’s <b>main</b> load (<b>flue</b> gas flowrate) were initially identified in open-loop and closed-loop. Insights from this analysis {{have shown that}} oscillatory changes with high frequencies content in the load are particularly harmful to the system in closed-loop. Taking these insights into account, a simultaneous scheduling and control framework was developed to identify optimal operating policies under the critical operating conditions in the flue gas flowrate. The results obtained from this framework were compared against a sequential scheduling and control approach. The results show that the proposed integrated framework specifies more economically attractive operating policies than those obtained from the sequential approach. Furthermore, a model describing the dynamic operation of a 453 MWe NGCC power plant integrated with a commercial-scale post-combustion CO 2 capture plant has been developed. The proposed model has been used to evaluate the dynamic performance of the integrated process under various scenarios, e. g. changes in the reboiler heat duty and power plant inputs. In addition, the transient operation of the integrated plant using a pre-defined (scheduled) trajectory profile in the consumption of steam in the reboiler unit has been compared to the case of constant withdrawal of steam from the power plant. The results show that a coordinated effort between the two plants is needed to run the integrated plant efficiently and at near optimal economic points under changes in power demands. In the present work, flexibility analysis and scheduling and control have been performed based on the proposed pilot-scale CO 2 capture process. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour of the natural gas power plant integrated with the commercial-scale CO 2 capture plant was assessed under several scenarios that are likely to occur during operation. The insights gained through these analyses will be instrumental to design basic and advanced control and scheduling strategies for integrated NGCC-CO 2 capture plants...|$|R
