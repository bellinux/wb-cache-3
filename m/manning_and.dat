5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were.

Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him.

Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted <b>Manning,</b> <b>and</b> Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E
