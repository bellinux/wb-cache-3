40|$|Sex {{differences}} are often reported in spatial abilities. However, some studies show conflicting results, {{which can be}} ascribed {{to the complexity of}} the variables involved in the visuo-spatial domain. Until a few years ago, it was widely accepted that men outperformed women on almost all spatial tasks. However, recently some studies [A. Postma, G. Jager, R. P. C. Kessels, H. P. F. Koppeschaar, J. van Honk, Sex differences for selective forms of spatial memory, Brain Cogn. 54 (2004) 24 - 34; D. H. <b>McBurney,</b> <b>S.</b> J. C. Gaulin, T. Devineni, C. Adams, Superior spatial memory of women: stronger evidence for the gathering hypothesis, Evol. Hum. Behav. 18 (1997) 165 - 174; Q. Rahman, G. D. Wilson, S. Abrahams, Sexual orientation related differences in spatial memory, J. Int. Neuropsychol. Soc. 9 (2003) 376 - 383] found sex differences for selective forms of spatial memory and described a female advantage in specific spatial abilities. In this paper, we studied sex differences by testing object locations and route memories with the Corsi Block-Tapping test (CBT), one of the non-verbal tasks most used in clinical settings, and its modified, large-scale version. Our results showed a performance advantage for males in both tests and a more homogeneous pattern of memory in females. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
