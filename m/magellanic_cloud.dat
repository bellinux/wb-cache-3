5|$|Located at the {{southern}} end of Tucana, the Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> is a dwarf galaxy that is one of the nearest neighbors to the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, tidal forces from the Milky Way have distorted it. Along with the Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud,</b> it lies within the Magellanic Stream, a cloud of gas that connects the two galaxies. NGC 346 is a star-forming region located in the Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b> It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system HD 5980, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.|$|E
5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> are more elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Located {{mostly in}} Dorado, the Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> extends into Hydrus. The {{globular}} cluster NGC 1466 is an outlying {{component of the}} galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type variable stars. It has a magnitude of 11.59 and {{is thought to be}} over 12 billion years old. Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. NGC 602 is composed of an emission nebula and a young, bright open cluster of stars that is an outlying component on {{the eastern edge of the}} Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud,</b> a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.|$|E
50|$|However, the gas was not mapped, and the {{connection}} to the two <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> was not made. The Magellanic Stream as such was discovered as a Neutral Hydrogen (HI) gas feature near the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> by Wannier & Wrixon in 1972. Its connection to the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> was made by Mathewson et al. in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|His {{work on the}} {{structure}} of the Milky Way and the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>clouds</b> was held in high regard. He contributed significantly in studies of star clusters, stellar populations, carbon stars, planetary nebulae, Wolf-Rayet stars, stellar classification and supernova remnants. [...] He was regarded as an expert on the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> and wrote a book on them (The <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds,</b> Cambridge University Press, 1997 [...] ).|$|R
500|$|The {{research}} produced remarkable results: [...] "it {{meant that}} the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> were twice {{as far away as}} was previously thought, and if then the baseline is twice as long, the size of the universe is doubled." [...] It also showed that star formation in the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way. The results overturned the prevailing view that our galaxy and the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> had evolved in parallel. Gascoigne said of his work: ...|$|R
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> and, later, the Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b> They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Supernova 1987A in the Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> was {{observed}} {{within hours of}} its start. It was the first supernova to be detected through its neutrino emission {{and the first to}} be observed across every band of the electromagnetic spectrum. The relative proximity of this supernova has allowed detailed observation, and it provided the first opportunity for modern theories of supernova formation to be tested against observations.|$|E
50|$|HIPASS {{discovered}} the Leading Arm of the Magellanic Stream. This {{is an extension}} of the Magellanic Stream beyond the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>clouds.</b> The existence of the Leading Arm is predicted by models of a tidal interaction between the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> and the Milky Way.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> is {{investigated}} using N-body hydrodynamic simulations where the initial conditions are set by a genetic algorithm. This technique allows us to identify possible orbits for the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> around the Milky Way, by directly comparing the simulations with observational constraints. We explore the parameter space {{of the interaction between}} the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> and the Milky Way, considering as free parameters the proper motions of the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds,</b> the virial mass and the concentration parameter (c) of the Galactic dark matter halo. The best orbital scenarios presented here are considered with two different sets of parameters for the Milky Way disc and bulge components. The total circular velocity at the Sun’s position (R = 8. 5 kpc) is directly calculated from the rotation curve of the corresponding Galactic mass model. Our analysis suggests that the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> have orbited inside the virial radius of the Milky Way for at least 3 Gyr, even for low mass haloes. However, this is possible only with high values for the concentration parameter (c> 20). In both orbital models presented here, the mutual interaction between the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> is able to reproduce the observed features of the Magellanic System...|$|R
50|$|The Magellanic Stream is {{a stream}} of {{high-velocity}} clouds of gas extending from the Large and Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> over 100° through the Galactic south pole of the Milky Way. The stream was sighted in 1965 {{and its relation to}} the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> was established in 1974.|$|R
5|$|Tucana {{is not a}} {{prominent}} constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.87. Beta Tucanae is a star system with six member stars, while Kappa is a quadruple system. Five star systems {{have been found to}} have exoplanets to date. The constellation contains 47 Tucanae, one of the brightest globular clusters in the sky, and most of the Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|The second-brightest {{globular}} cluster {{in the sky}} after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) lies {{just west of the}} Small <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b> Only 14,700 light-years distant from Earth, it is thought to be around 12 billion years old. Mostly composed of old, yellow stars, it does possess a contingent of blue stragglers, hot stars that are hypothesized to form from binary star mergers. 47 Tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3.9, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye; it is a Shapley class III cluster, which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus. Near to 47 Tucana on the sky, and often seen in wide-field photographs showing it, are two much more distant {{globular cluster}}s associated with the SMC: NGC 121, 10 arcminutes away from the bigger cluster's edge, and Lindsay 8.|$|E

50|$|The Magellanic Bridge (MBR) is {{a stream}} of neutral {{hydrogen}} that links the two <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds,</b> with a few known stars inside it. It {{should not be confused}} with the Magellanic Stream, which links the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> to the Milky Way. It was discovered in 1963 by J. V. Hindman et al.|$|R
5|$|Following the war, Gascoigne and {{astronomer}} Gerald Kron used newly modernised telescopes at Mount Stromlo {{to determine}} that the distance between our galaxy and the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> dwarf galaxies had been underestimated {{by a factor of}} two. Because this measurement was used to calibrate other distances in astronomy, the result effectively doubled the estimated size of the universe. They also found that star formation in the Magellanic Clouds had occurred more recently than in the Milky Way; this overturned the prevailing view that both had evolved in parallel. A major figure at Mount Stromlo Observatory, Gascoigne helped it develop from a solar observatory to a centre of stellar and galactic research, and was instrumental in the creation of its field observatory in northern New South Wales, Siding Spring Observatory. When the British and Australian governments agreed to jointly build the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring, Gascoigne was involved from its initial conception and throughout its lengthy commissioning, taking its first photograph. Gascoigne was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his contributions to astronomy and to the Anglo-Australian Telescope.|$|E

40|$|Abridged) A close {{scrutiny}} of the microlensing results towards the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>clouds</b> reveals that the stars within the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>clouds</b> are major contributors as lenses, and the contribution of MACHOs to dark matter is 0 to 5 %. The principal results which lead to this conclusion are the following. (i) Out of the ~ 17 events detected so far towards the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds,</b> the lens locations have been determined for four events where the lenses are most likely within the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>clouds.</b> (ii) If caused by MACHOs, the event timescales would imply that the MACHOs {{in the direction of}} the LMC and the SMC have masses of the order of 0. 5 and 2 solar masses, respectively. This is inconsistent with even the most flattened model of the Galaxy. If caused by stars within the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds,</b> the masses of the lenses are of the order of 0. 2 solar mass for both the LMC as well as the SMC. (iii) The fact that the two observed binary events are caused by lenses within the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> would suggest that there should be a total of ~ 20 events caused by lenses within the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds.</b> This implies that most of the microlensing events observed so far are probably caused by stars within the <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds.</b> (iv) If the microlensing events are caused by MACHOs of 0. 5 solar mass, ~ 15 events should have been detected by now towards the SMC, with timescales of ~ 40 days. The fact that both the events detected towards the SMC have been shown to be due to self-lensing places severe constraints on the MACHO contribution and suggests that the contribution of MACHOs to dark matter is consistent with zero, with an upper limit of 5 %.
