5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is <b>My</b> <b>Lady,</b> which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, which had to be abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E

5|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} {{who was the first}} choice for the role of the itinerant prostitute, Suzy. By some accounts, Rodgers and Hammerstein attempted to get Julie Andrews, only to find that she had just signed a two-year contract to appear in a musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, tentatively titled <b>My</b> <b>Lady</b> Liza. Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, would launch her to stardom. Another candidate was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers spotted her on television while watching The Howdy Doody Show, in which she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{he wrote}} {{keyboard}} music, {{most of which}} shows an unusually progressive use of idiomatic keyboard: his Hornepype in particular is often cited {{as an example of}} early idiomatic keyboard writing.

25|$|In Pakistan, {{judges of}} the Supreme Court {{and the high}} courts are {{addressed}} as Your Lordship or My Lord and Your Ladyship or <b>My</b> <b>Lady,</b> a tradition directly attributable to England.

25|$|Jones's {{first hit}} show was A Gaiety Girl (1893), {{one of the}} first major successes of the Edwardian musical comedy genre. A series of Jones hits followed: An Artist's Model (1894), The Geisha (1896), A Greek Slave (1898) and San Toy (1899). After this, Jones had less {{frequent}} and intense successes, but his more popular shows included <b>My</b> <b>Lady</b> Molly (1902), See See (1906), King of Cadonia (1908), The Girl from Utah (1913) and The Happy Day (1916).|$|E
25|$|In 1914, Courtneidge and Hulbert became {{engaged to}} be married, but their plans were delayed by Robert Courtneidge's insistence {{that they should}} wait {{for two years before}} marrying. They {{complied}} with this injunction and did not marry until February 1916. Soon after the outbreak of war, Hulbert joined the army. Courtneidge continued to appear in her father's productions in the West End and on tour. These were revivals of The Arcadians and The Pearl Girl and three unsuccessful new shows, The Light Blues, <b>My</b> <b>Lady</b> Frayle and Oh, Caesar! (all 1916).|$|E

25|$|Back in England, Moore left Edwardes's {{company and}} {{returned}} to light opera. She starred in The White Silk Dress by A. McLean (1896) at the Prince of Wales Theatre and the British production of Lost, Strayed or Stolen (1897). She toured abroad extensively {{before returning to the}} D'Oyly Carte in 1899, for the third and last time, to play Scent of Lilies in The Rose of Persia after which she starred in the musical comedy Florodora (1900–01) at the Lyric Theatre. In 1901 Moore appeared in both A Diplomatic Theft at the Garrick Theatre, London and The Swineherd and the Princess at the Royalty Theatre. She toured in The Gay Cadets (1902). In 1903, she starred as Alice Coverdale in another success, <b>My</b> <b>Lady</b> Molly, at the Lyceum Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Of Courtneidge's two {{productions}} in 1913, Ivan Caryll's American musical Oh! Oh! Delphine {{received a}} strong reception, but The Pearl Girl {{was only a}} moderate success. In 1914 Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert starred in The Cinema Star, an adaptation by Hulbert and Harry Graham of Die Kino-Königin, a 1913 German comic opera by Jean Gilbert. It was a hit for Courtneidge and ran to full houses at the Shaftesbury Theatre until Britain and Germany went to war in August 1914; anti-German sentiment brought the run to a premature and abrupt halt. Courtneidge's next shows, <b>My</b> <b>Lady</b> Frayle, Oh, Caesar! and The Light Blues (all 1916, the last of which included a young Noël Coward in its cast) all failed, and the patriotic operetta Young England was only a modest success.|$|E
