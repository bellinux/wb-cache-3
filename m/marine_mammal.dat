5|$|The <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) {{was passed}} on October 21, 1972 under {{president}} Richard Nixon {{to prevent the}} further depletion and possible extinction of <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> stocks. It prohibits the taking ("the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such") of any <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding walruses) and cetaceans.|$|E

40|$|In oceans, {{the limited}} {{acoustic}} spectrum resource is heavily shared by <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and manmade systems including underwater sensor networks. In order {{to limit the}} negative impact of acoustic signal on <b>marine</b> <b>mammals,</b> we propose an environmentally friendly power control (EFPC) scheme for underwater sensor networks. EFPC allocates transmission power of sensor nodes with a consideration of the existence of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> By applying a Nash Equilibrium based utility function with a set of limitations to optimize transmission power, the proposed power control algorithm can conduct parallel transmissions to improve the network’s goodput, while avoiding interference with <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> Additionally, to localize <b>marine</b> <b>mammals,</b> which is a prerequisite of EFPC, we propose a novel passive hyperboloid localization algorithm (PHLA). PHLA passively localize <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> {{with the help of the}} acoustic characteristic of these targets. Simulation results show that PHLA can localize most of the target with a relatively small localization error and EFPC can achieve a close goodput performance compared with an existing power control algorithm while avoiding interfering with <b>marine</b> <b>mammals...</b>|$|R

5|$|NOAA {{cultivated}} {{a network}} of volunteers to protect the seals while they bask or bear and nurse their young. NOAA is funding considerable research on seal population dynamics and health {{in conjunction with the}} <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Center. From NOAA, several programs and networks were formed in order monk seal. Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community standards for the Hawaiian monk seal. The program also creates networks with the Native Hawaiians on the island to network more people in the fight for conservation of the seals. The <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Response Network (MMRN) is partnered with NOAA and several other government agencies that deal with land and marine wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} of the United States and Russia train bottlenose dolphins {{as military}} dolphins for wartime tasks, such as locating sea mines and detecting enemy divers. The U.S.'s {{program is the}} U.S. Navy <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Program, located in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|Like many seabirds storm petrels will {{associate}} with {{other species of}} seabird and <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> species {{in order to help}} obtain food. It is theorised that they benefit from the actions of diving predators such as seals and penguins which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the surface feeding storm petrels to reach them.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling of populations of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|R
40|$|Incidental {{capture of}} <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> in ﬁshing gear {{is a major}} cause of concern. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identiﬁed bycatch as one of the serious threats to the <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> The International Whaling Commission (IWC) {{estimated}} that at least 308, 000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in bycatch every year in the world oceans. The Indian seas support 26 species of cetaceans and one species of sirenian. Until 2003, knowledge on <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> of India was restricted to incidental catch of different species in ﬁshing gear. Between 2003 and 2012, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) undertook a research project on <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and conducted extensive visual sighting cruises onboard FORV Sagar Sampada in the Indian EEZ and contiguous seas to explore diversity, distribution and ecological characters of this mega fauna. The project also undertook a survey on the <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> that are incidentally captured by ﬁshing gea...|$|R
50|$|Its {{surrounding}} waters {{serve as}} an invaluable nursery for the sea life that feeds larger <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and seabirds. Great white sharks are fairly common in the northern Channel Islands (especially San Miguel and Santa Rosa) and feed on the abundant <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mammal</b> {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and sirenians are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> species are currently threatened.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. Species richness peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> species richness and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually {{kept in a}} large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E
40|$|The <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> {{are one of}} the {{important}} biotic constituents of marine environment. The <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> of India are comprised of whales, dolphins and dugongs. The <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> of Indian seas are attracting special attention due to the declaration of Indian Ocean as a sanctuary for the whales. Though whales and dolphins do not form a regular fishery along the coasts of India, there is no place for complacency as dolphins and dugongs are caught in the gill nets along the coasts...|$|R
40|$|Reports on the {{accidental}} stranding and inadvertant landings of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals,</b> mostly dolphins, porpoises and dugongs by different gears such as drift gillnets, trawlnets, purse seines etc., along the Indian coasts are well documented by different workers in recent days. Consequent to the sustained efforts by different International Agencies, awareness is created {{among the public}} on the conservation of the endangered <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> and on certain occasions the people themselves {{get involved in the}} act of saving the lives of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals...</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammals,</b> {{located in}} the waters of Italy, France and Monaco, there are eight species of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> residents, most of them all year.

5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected by}} the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where manatees exist.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|Bowie Seamount {{supports}} a biologically rich {{area with a}} vigorous ecosystem. Studies have recorded high densities of crab, sea stars, sea anemones, sponges, squid, octopus, rockfish, halibut and sablefish. Eight species of <b>marine</b> <b>mammal</b> {{have been found in}} the Bowie Seamount area, including Steller sea lions, orca, humpback and sperm whales, along with 16varieties of seabirds. This has made Bowie Seamount a rare habitat in the northeast Pacific Ocean {{and one of the most}} biologically rich submarine volcanoes on Earth. The rich marine life is due to the intense food supply of microscopic animals and plants, including phytoplankton and zooplankton.|$|E
5|$|Vessel strikes cause {{death for}} a number of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals,</b> {{especially}} whales. In particular, fast commercial vessels such as container ships can cause major injuries or death when they collide with <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b> Collisions occur both with large commercial vessels and recreational boats and cause injury to whales or smaller cetaceans. The critically endangered North Atlantic right whale is particularly affected by vessel strikes. Tourism boats designed for whale and dolphin watching can also negatively impact on <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> by interfering with their natural behavior.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> {{have evolved}} to live in oceans, but the {{effects of climate change}} are rapidly {{altering}} their natural habitat. We can learn about the consequences of global warming on arctic <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> by studying the difference in their habitat, distribution, abundance, movement and migration, body conditions, behavior, and their sensitivity. Climate is rapidly changing, which makes it hard for certain species to adapt fast enough. Immense pressure and stress due to global warming are imposed on <b>marine</b> <b>mammals,</b> which can lead to their potential extinction.|$|R

5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting Killer Whales in Washington in 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the hunting of Killer Whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} fish, shellfish, and {{crustaceans}} frequent both the local rivers and sea, notably crayfish and paua. Nugget Point {{in the northern}} Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a marine reserve off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. Hector's dolphins can often be seen close to the Catlins coast, especially at Porpoise Bay near Waikawa, which is protected {{as part of the}} Catlins Coast <b>Marine</b> <b>Mammal</b> Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory southern right whales and humpback whales can be spotted along the coastline during winter.|$|E

50|$|Historically, <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans {{for food}} and other resources. The effects of this were only localised as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Later large scale commercial hunting was developed. <b>Marine</b> <b>mammals</b> were heavily exploited, leading to the extinction of some species.|$|R
5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals</b> include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of <b>marine</b> <b>mammals.</b>|$|R
