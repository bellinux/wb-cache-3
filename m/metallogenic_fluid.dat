40|$|This work {{investigates the}} ultra-large Huize Pb–Zn deposit, {{based on the}} results of {{preceding}} studies and detailed field geological surveys. The existing findings were reorganized and reinterpreted and supplemented with C–H–O isotopic measurements, which resulted in the identification of two different metallogenic fluids: a high temperature, low salinity, and acidic Fluid A, which originates from deep-seated fluids and is enriched in lighter C and O isotopes (− 3 ‰ < δ 13 C‰ < − 4 ‰; 10 ‰ < δ 18 O‰ < 17 ‰; − 92 ‰ < δD‰ < − 50 ‰), and a low temperature, high salinity Fluid B, which is a subsurface brine formed by atmospheric precipitation. Fluid B is characterized by heavier C–O–H isotopic compositions (− 2 ‰ < δ 13 C‰ < 1 ‰; 2 ‰ < δ 18 O‰ < 24 ‰; − 66 ‰ < δD‰ < − 43 ‰) than Fluid A and cycles continuously within the strata. We hypothesize that the Huize Pb–Zn deposit is the result of large-scale fluid migration from deep regions of the crust. These upward-moving fluids extracted metallic elements from carbonate strata of various ages, forming a metal-rich <b>metallogenic</b> <b>fluid</b> (Fluid A). After higher-grade ores were precipitated from the fluid following decompression boiling, it then mixed with Fluid B and continued to precipitate sulfides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractXingyuanchong copper deposit at Wanzai, Jiangxi, {{is located}} in the west section of Yifeng-Jingdezhen deep faults- Huangmao area. By {{studying}} the fluid inclusions, and integrating the metallogenic features and sulfur isotope compositions of the ore deposit, the source of <b>metallogenic</b> <b>fluids</b> and <b>metallogenic</b> mechanisms can be studied. The study of fluid inclusions indicates that the deposit was controlled by fluids from at least two different sources: δ 34 S data indicates sulfur was characterized by submarine exhalation sedimentation and late-stage hydrothermal superimposition. Thus, combining the above geochemical characteristics and the geological setting, it is proposed that the <b>metallogenic</b> <b>fluids</b> of the deposit were extrusive gas-hydrothermal fluids, seawater, and later magmatic hydrothermal fluids. The mineralizing processes can be divided into two stages: first, submarine volcanic sediments or a proto-ore layer formed in the Mesoproterozoic; second, the pre-existing proto-ore was diplogenetically altered by the hydrothermal fluids and dynamic metamorphism mainly derived from the Jinning orogenic period in Late Proterozoic...|$|R

Cu-(Ag) deposits, {{the third}} {{main source of}} Cu in Chile, have a controversial genesis (magmatic vs. metamorphic and syn vs. epigenic models [1]). These deposits are hosted in Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary rocks on the Coastal Range. The Cabildo district (lat 32 ?? 30 ???S; long 70 ?? 55 ???W) is unique in that ???Manto-type??? Cu-(Ag) and Cu (Mo) -skarn deposits coexist. The ?? 34 S range of Cabildo ???Manto-type??? sulphides is extremely wide (- 30. 8 to + 16. 9 ???). In contrast, in the Cu-skarn sulphides the same range is very homogeneous (- 3. 2 to - 1. 5 ???). However, the ?? 34 S range of sulphides from the Mo-bearing skarn zone differs {{from the rest of}} the skarn showing more depleted values (- 8. 6 to - 5. 6 ???). A two-stage mineralization process in ???Manto-type??? deposits is proposed: 1) Bacteriogenicc pyrite formed during an early digenetic stage in a semi-closed system. 2) S re-mobilization and Cu input in a low metamorphic environment to produce bornite-chalcopyrite ores. The skarn formation could be coeval or at least close in time to the second mineralization event of the ???Manto-type??? deposit. The S source for Cu- skarn mineralization is dominantly magmatic. Nonetheless, a contribution of bacteriogenic S in the Mo-rich skarn zone also appears likely. Supporting this hypothesis, further isotopic analysis 87 Sr/ 86 Sro, C and O show two main sources of <b>metallogenic</b> <b>fluids</b> in the area, low-grade metamorphic fluids (which leach limestone with bacteriogenic pyrite) and magmatic fluids, with intermediate isotopic signatures (and sources) for Mo-rich skarn...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} Re-Os molybdenite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite geochronology at five shear-hosted Au occurrences (Kenge, Mbenge, Porcupine, Konokono, and Dubwana) in the Lupa goldfield, southwestern Tanzania, {{is reported}} in this paper. Au occurrences within the Lupa goldfield share many geologic similarities with the orogenic Au deposit type and are situated within a Paleoproterozoic magmatic arc that intruded the Archean Tanzanian cratonic margin. Pyrite ± chalcopyrite ± molybdenite-bearing fault-fill veins and mylonitic shear zones crosscut granitic host rocks and {{are associated with the}} highest Au grades. Re-Os sulfide ages are deemed a suitable proxy to constrain the timing of Au based on the occurrence of Au-bearing minerals as inclusions within pyrite and chalcopyrite, whereas Au-bearing minerals filling pyrite fractures may represent a younger and undated metallogenic event. Molybdenite at Kenge occurs as ultrafine disseminations within fault-fill veins (1953 ± 6 Ma; n = 3) that possess nominally older weighted average Re-Os ages than molybdenite hosted by stylolite-like veins (1937 ± 8 Ma; n = 7). Both sample sets are ca. 70 m. y. older than a weighted average Re-Os pyrite age from the mylonitic shear zones at Kenge and Mbenge (1876 ± 10 Ma; n = 13), which contain fault-fill veins and record the timing of mylonitization. Molybdenite at Porcupine occurs as ultrafine disseminations within quartz veins and mylonitized granite samples (1886 ± 6 Ma; n = 4) that are broadly equivalent in age to weighted average Re-Os ages of molybdenite occurring as stylolite-like veins (1873 ± 5 Ma; n = 6) and pyrite within oblique-extension veins (1894 ± 45 Ma; n = 2). Weighted average Re-Os pyrite model ages at Konokono (1880 ± 14 Ma; n = 9) and Dubwana (1905 ± 25 Ma; n = 2) are also consistent with the ca. 1. 88 Ga event observed at Kenge, Mbenge, and Porcupine. Gold occurrences in the Lupa goldfield therefore record a protracted hydrothermal history (1. 95 – 1. 87 Ga) comprising at least three temporally distinct hydrothermal events (ca. 1. 95, 1. 94, and 1. 88 Ga), which are each represented in detail by a complex vein history that occurred at a time scale less than the resolution of the Re-Os method. The sampling of broadly contemporaneous sulfides from five shear zones suggest that mylonitic shear zones represented an interconnected network of midcrustal permeable fluid conduits at ca. 1. 88 Ga that permitted the transportation and deposition of gold. Comparison between Re-Os sulfide and high-precision U-Pb zircon ages for the granitic host rocks provides unequivocal evidence for sulfidation concomitant with magmatism. However, the range of Re-Os ages argues against an intrusion-related deposit model whereby <b>metallogenic</b> <b>fluids</b> are solely derived from an individual intrusion. The regional ca. 1. 88 Ga metallogenic event identified as part of this study occurred concurrently with eclogite facies metamorphism during the Ubendian orogenic cycle and provides one of Earth’s earliest temporal links between subduction zone processes and orogenic Au deposit formation during the Paleoproterozoic...|$|R
