The etiology remains poorly understood. We delineate this disease by reporting on a 16 -year-old patient showing the cardinal features of MURCS association accompanied by a persistent left superior vena cava and atrial septal defect, orofacial clefting, and mild reduction deformities of the left hand. Fluorescence in situ hybridization did not show major deletions or duplications of the DiGeorge/VCFS (velocardiofacial syndrome) region at chromosome 22 q 11. 1 as well as the TBX 5 /TBX 3 region at 12 q 24. 1. In addition, sequencing of the TP 63 L (p 63) gene, residing at 3 q 27, remained normal in the presented patient. Thus, we provide further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of MURCS association...|$|R

50|$|<b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> is a {{congenital}} malformation {{characterized by a}} failure of the Müllerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea. Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Müllerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Müllerian duct is completely absent.|$|E

5000|$|Between {{the years}} 2005 and 2008 four women with vaginal {{hypoplasia}} due to <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> were given regenerated vaginas. [...] Up {{to eight years}} after the transplants all organs have normal function and structure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> (also {{known as}} MRKH or Vaginal Agenesis) - A {{condition}} {{that causes the}} uterus and other reproductive organs in a 46,XX female to be small or absent, {{as well as the}} vaginal canal itself.

50|$|Congenital {{disorders}} such as adrenal hyperplasia {{can affect}} the structure and function of the vagina and sometimes the vagina is absent; these can be reconstructed or formed, using a vaginoplasty. Other candidates for the surgery include babies born with a microphallus, people with <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> resulting in vaginal hypoplasia, {{and women who have}} had a vaginectomy after malignancy or trauma. Vaginoplasty can reduce the size of the entrance of the vagina or alter the appearance of the vulva.|$|E
50|$|Amenorrhea, {{the lack}} of a menstrual period, may {{indicate}} a congenital anomaly of the reproductive tract. Typically obvious on an external visual examination of a child's vulva, imperforate hymen is the presence of a hymen that completely covers the introitus. Other anomalies that can cause amenorrhea include <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> affecting the uterus, cervix, and/or vagina; obstructed uterine horn; OHVIRA syndrome; and the presence of a transverse vaginal septum. OHVIRA and uterine horn obstruction can also cause increasingly painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea) in the months following menarche.|$|E
50|$|Amenorrhoea {{can also}} be caused by {{physical}} deformities. One {{example of this is}} Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, the second-most common cause of primary amenorrhoea. The syndrome is characterized by <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis.</b> In MRKH Syndrome, the Müllerian ducts do not develop, which prevents menstruation. The syndrome usually develops during the first trimester of pregnancy. MRI techniques can be helpful in determining the extent of the problem. Women may recover from MRKH syndrome, but other times primary amenorrhoea, which is characteristic of the disorder, may prevent pregnancy for life.|$|E

50|$|In {{treating}} <b>müllerian</b> <b>agenesis,</b> the Vecchietti {{procedure is}} a laparoscopic surgical technique {{that produces a}} vagina of dimensions (depth and width) {{comparable to those of}} a normal vagina (ca. 8.0 cm. deep). A small, plastic sphere (“olive”) is threaded (sutured) against the vaginal area; the threads are drawn though the vaginal skin, up through the abdomen, and through the navel. There, the threads are attached to a traction device, and then daily are drawn tight so that the “olive” is pulled inwards and stretches the vagina, by approximately 1.0 cm. per day, thereby creating a vagina, approximately 7.0 cm. deep by 7.0 cm. wide, in 7 days. The mean operating room (OR) time for the Vecchietti vaginoplasty is approximately 45 minutes; yet, depending upon the patient and her indications, the procedure might require more time. The outcomes of Vecchietti technique via the laparoscopic approach are found to be comparable to the procedure using laparotomy. In vaginal hypoplasia, traction vaginoplasty such as the Vecchietti technique seems to have the highest success rates both anatomically (99%) and functionally (96%) among available treatments.|$|E
5000|$|Primary {{amenorrhoea}} can {{be diagnosed}} in female children by age 14 if no secondary sex characteristics, such as enlarged breasts and body hair, are present. [...] In {{the absence of}} secondary sex characteristics, {{the most common cause}} of amenorrhoea is low levels of FSH and LH caused by a delay in puberty. Gonadal dysgenesis, often associated with Turner's Syndrome, or premature ovarian failure may also be to blame. If secondary sex characteristics are present, but menstruation is not, primary amenorrhoea can be diagnosed by age 16. A reason for this occurrence may be that a person phenotypically female but genetically male, a situation known as androgen insensitivity syndrome. If undescended testes are present, they are often removed after puberty (~21 years of age) due to the increased risk of testicular cancer. In the absence of undescended testes, an MRI can be used to determine whether or not a uterus is present. <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> causes around 15% of primary amenorrhoea cases. If a uterus is present, outflow track obstruction may be to blame for primary amenorrhoea.|$|E

30|$|The coelemic {{epithelium}} {{is derived}} from the underlying mesenchyme. Müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts are formed from the coelemic epithelium that invaginates at several points. The superficial stroma of the ovary is also composed of the mesenchyme and the coelemic epithelium [1]. This embryonic kinship may explain the coexistence of an ovarian endometrioma and <b>müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> in our patient. Additional factors such as sensitivity to estrogens and the occurrence of ovulation may also be considered in the pathogenesis of endometriomas. Induction of müllerian-directed metaplasia by an increase in estrogens following puberty (as in our patient) could be possible. The beginning of ovulation might also trigger the metaplasia to end with endometrioma formation.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Amenorrhea is {{classified}} as primary if menstrual bleeding has never occurred {{in the absence of}} hormonal treatment. The clinical significance of a lack of regular menstrual cycles extends beyond reproductive concerns. Episodes of amenorrhea as short as 90 day may have implications for bone and cardiovascular health. Aims and Objective: To evaluate all patients presenting with primary amenorrhea in the Endocrinology OPD of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. Materials and Methods: A total of 14 patients presenting to the Endocrinology OPD from March 2010 to May 2012 with a history of primary amenorrhea were included in the study. All patients were subjected to a detailed history, a thorough clinical examination, and relevant biochemical, hormonal, and radiological investigations. Result: In our study, the average age of presentation was 17. 23 ± 4. 2 years. Out of the 14 patients presenting with primary amenorrhea, 5 patients (35. 71 %) were found to have Turner′s syndrome, 2 (14. 28 %) had XX (pure) gonadal dysgenesis, 2 (14. 28 %) patients had XY gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome), 2 (14. 28 %) patients had <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis,</b> 2 (14. 28 %) patients had hypothalamic amenorrhea, and 1 (7. 14 %) patient was found to have multiple pituitary hormone deficiency. Conclusion: In concordance with other studies, Turner′s syndrome, <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis,</b> and gonadal dysgenesis are the commonest causes of primary amenorrhea in our study. However, in contrast to certain Western reports, primary amenorrhea rather than short stature remains the commonest cause for seeking medical evaluation in patients with Turner′s syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Alterations in {{the normal}} {{sequence}} of development of müllerian ducts lead to {{a wide spectrum of}} reproductive tract abnormalities. A rare form of lack of development, regarding a short tract of the müllerian ducts, leads to the isolated agenesis of the uterine cervix. Anomalies identified among patients with <b>müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> include skeletal deformities (i. e., scoliosis of the spine and Klippel-Feil anomaly). Case presentation A 46 years old woman presenting cyphoscoliosis and very low stature (120 cm – 3, 93 feet), came to our observation for acute pelvic pain; she also reported primary amenorrhoea associated with cyclic pelvic pain. Clinical and imaging evaluation, evidenced a blind vaginal duct of normal length, left cystic adnexal mass, and enlarged uterus with hematometra. FSH, LH, 17 β estradiol and CA- 125, karyotype and radiographic study of limbs and vertebral column were also evaluated. At laparotomy, a left ovarian cyst was found. Uterus ended at the isthmus; under this level a thin fibrous tissue band was found, joining the uterus to the vagina. Uterine cervix was replaced by fibrous tissue containing some dilated glands lined with müllerian epithelium. Karyotype resulted 46, XX. The described skeletal deformity, were consistent with Klippel-Feil syndrome. Conclusion We report a case of congenital scoliosis associated with <b>müllerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> limited to uterine cervix, association thus far seen only among patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (utero-vaginal agenesis).

40|$|The femoral-facial {{syndrome}} is usually sporadic and its aetiology remains unknown. Non-genetic factors as maternal diabetes mellitus have been associated. Reports of familial cases have otherwise suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. We report the 20 years clinical follow-up {{of a girl}} with femoral-facial syndrome diagnosed at birth. Recently, array CGH investigation identified a 1400 kb duplication at 9 q 31. 1, including the gene SMC 2, and a 343 kb deletion at 12 q 24. 33 including the genes CHFR, ZNF 26, ZNF 140, ZNF 10 and ZNF 268.

40|$|Introduction: Urethral coitus is {{very rare}} with {{significant}} consequences and less than 30 cases were reported in the literature. It is most commonly associated with Mullerian anomalies. Observation: We report a case of 28 years married woman with <b>Mullerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> and associated anomalies who was engaged in urethral coitus and urethral dilation was detected on examination under anesthesia. The patient did not accept vaginoplasty after she learned {{that it would not}} be a cure for her infertility problem. Conclusions: Urethral coitus {{is very rare}} with few cases reported. Woman diagnosed with MRKHS II should be assessed for associated abnormalities especially skeletal and renal ones. Urinary incontinence associated with coitus and dyspareunia with Mullerian anomalies should raise the suspicion of urethral coitus. Follow-up is important to avoid urinary tract infections if the female rejects surgery and is satisfied with intra-urethral coitus. Mullerian anomaly should be corrected to allow vaginal intercourse if possible...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Vagina is a {{composite}} structure formed partly from the mullerian duct and partly from urogential sinus. Most of the patients with <b>mullerian</b> <b>agenesis</b> have small rudimentary uterus without any endometrial cavity, 7 % - 8 % may have functioning uterus. Case: A 15 years old girl admitted with primary amenorrhea, cyclical abdominal pain, hematometra and complete vaginal agenesis. Surgical correction is the mainstay of treatment in patients with functioning uterus and absent vagina. Vaginoplasty was done to reconstruct a neovagina using amnion graft and establish uterovaginal continuity. In this case we have used only perineal approach to dissect the neovagina and identify the cervix with formation of a patent drainage tract and adequate vaginal length of 9 cm. Conclusion: In rare cases of obstructed functioning uterus by complete vaginal agenesis, vaginoplasty effectively restores anatomy and function by an overall minimal operative morbidity. Human amnion provides excellent results in neovaginal reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{several new}} white matter {{diseases}} {{have been identified}} based on magnetic resonance imaging and clinical findings. For most newly defined disorders the genetic basis has been identified. However, {{there is still a}} large group of patients without a specific diagnosis.

In some disorders characterized by hypomyelination only central nervous system involvement is observed, but in some disorders involvement of other organs is observed as well, such as eyes or teeth. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) is an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating disorder of the central nervous system characterized by nystagmus, ataxia, and progressive spasticity. The disease is caused by mutations in GJC 2, the gene that encodes the gap junction protein connexin 47.

30|$|A {{specially}} designed reusable sterilized inserter, {{which was designed}} to perforate the vaginal dimple in cases of BV in women with <b>Müllerian</b> <b>agenesis,</b> was used to make a uterine fundal hole. The inserter is 35  cm long and 4  mm girth and is made of stainless steel. It has a sharp penetrating pyramidal tip with a long double strand silk suture (DSSS) threaded into its fenestrated caudal end. After penetrating the uterine fundus with the inserter under laparoscopic guidance, the inserter passes across the distended uterine cavity to pass through the atretic segment of the cervix to be finally extracted through the vagina in cases with isolated cervical atresia or through vaginal dimple in cases with concomitant vaginal aplasia. A silicon catheter is then inserted from the vaginal side through the hole made by the inserter and manipulated into the uterine cavity as described in our original procedure. The catheter was pulled up into the uterine cavity via the DSSS. The inserter and the technique used in BV-EC was previously described [5].|$|E
