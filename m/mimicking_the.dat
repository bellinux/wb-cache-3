5|$|Hyundai {{developed}} a warning noise for called the Virtual Engine Sound System (VESS). The system, which {{was introduced in}} September 2010 on its test fleet of BlueOn electric hatchbacks, provides synthetic audio feedback <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> sound of an idling internal combustion engine.|$|E
5|$|Once the P. rebeli larvae {{infiltrate}} the host’s brood, they ascend {{to the highest}} social ranks of the host's hierarchy by using acoustics to achieve social acceptance from worker M. schencki ants. P. rebeli larvae and pupa accomplish this by <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> sound that {{the queen of the}} ant colony makes, both while as a larva and as a pupa in the colony.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} produced two other mobile-based Guitar Hero games; Guitar Hero III: Backstage Pass, released in July 2008, adds role-playing elements {{to manage the}} band's success {{in addition to the}} core rhythm game, while the mobile version of Guitar Hero World Tour, released in December 2008, expands each included track for play on both lead guitar and drums, <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> expansion of the console series to the full band.|$|E

25|$|The common mime has two mimetic {{forms in}} both sexes. The {{nominate}} form P. clytia form clytia <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> common Indian crow (Euploea core) while <b>the</b> form dissimilis <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> blue tiger (Tirumala limniace).|$|R
50|$|The typical form of {{the great}} blue mime <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> striped blue crow (Euploea mulciber) in both sexes. There also occurs in India a form danisepa which <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> magpie crow (Euploea radamanthus). Though the great mimes are easily {{distinguished}} when caught, in flight they very closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>mimicked</b> butterflies.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the game's high sales and critical acclaim, Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick revealed {{in a conference call}} to analysts that the company now considered the game as part of a franchise. He also speculated on any follow-ups <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> development cycle of Grand Theft Auto, with a new release expected every two to three years. 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that BioShock could have five sequels, comparing the franchise to the Star Wars movies.|$|E
5|$|The Angry Dad {{internet}} cartoon, {{as well as}} {{the other}} internet cartoons in the episode, were originally going to be animated using Macromedia Flash, however, the department of Film Roman that handled Flash animation would not be able to complete the scenes in time. Because of this, director Sheetz had to draw the scenes himself, <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> look of Flash animation. At the end of Bart's trap, Homer falls into a pool of green paint, making him resemble the Hulk. Selman originally wanted Homer to fall into blue paint, since the blue paint mixed with his yellow skin would make green, however the idea never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Video footage before City's Europa League {{clash with}} Dynamo Kiev in March 2011 showed Balotelli {{requiring}} assistance {{to put on}} a training bib, an incident which teammate Edin Džeko was seen <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> following week in the warm up before City's game at Chelsea. In September 2011, Balotelli was reportedly seen using his iPad whilst on the substitutes' bench for Italy during their game with the Faroe Islands, although he denied this on a visit to a prison later that week.|$|E

5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (DI) {{was conducted}} at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar.|$|E
5|$|I-94 {{traverses}} Detroit in an east–west direction well inland of, {{and parallel}} to, the Detroit River. The freeway intersects I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) on the West Side, passing the main campus of Wayne State University {{before entering the}} East Side at M-1 (Woodward Avenue). Immediately east of the interchange with I-75 (Chrysler Freeway), I-94 forms the southern border of the Milwaukee Junction district. The Edsel Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit's East Side. The Interstate turns more northerly, <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> shoreline of Lake St. Clair, and exits Detroit for Harper Woods. Just north of the interchange for M-102 (Vernier Road), the freeway crosses 8Mile Road and enters Macomb County.|$|E

5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> silhouette of a small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

5|$|The attacking {{force has}} the natural {{advantage}} {{at the start}} of each game, likely indicating an important cultural aspect by <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> success of Viking raids. Another cultural indication of the king is that importance of the Viking chiefs' presence in battle. Although the kings of Europe later claimed divine rule and sat upon the throne rather than being a physical presence on the battlefield, it was essential for a Viking chief to be considered an equal in war. The importance of war is also reflected in Hnefatafl because it is a war strategy game, which can indicate an important reason why the gaming boards have been found with males of all ages. In Balnakeil, a male skeleton between the ages of 8 and 13 was found with weapons and a Hnefatafl board game. Vikings tended to take boys onto the battlefield with them, which explains why young boys also played these war-strategic board games.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} lord {{was taken}} back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual. The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quiriguá and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quiriguá as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region. After this, Quiriguá engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> sculptural style of Copán, possibly using captured Copán sculptors {{to carry out the}} work. The population of Quiriguá and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although Quiriguá was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Planet is a 2D {{platform}} and action game featuring anthropomorphized animal characters and 16-bit style graphics <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> look of games released for the Sega Genesis, particularly the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game puts {{players in the}} role of one of the available playable characters as they traverse each level, fighting enemies and obstacles before facing a boss at the end. Players have a health meter, which can be replenished by collecting red leaves, and a regenerative energy meter used to perform each character's unique special moves. Players can earn extra lives by collecting blue crystals found throughout the level, or by rescuing creatures trapped in cages. Players can also obtain various types of shields, some of which often bonus attributes such as invulnerabilty to fire or the ability to breathe underwater, and invincibility power-ups. Cards are hidden through the levels, which unlock bonus content such as music and concept art, and bonus tokens which allows access to a bonus game {{at the end of the}} level.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, the {{commander}} of the 104th Brigade, Colonel Ivan Rukljić, took command of all Croatian forces in Varaždin. The Yugoslav Air Force attacked an airfield in Čakovec, <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> strike carried out in Varaždin a few days earlier. That evening, the heaviest fighting of the siege erupted in Varaždin, and the 104th Brigade reported it was uncertain how long it would be able to maintain the blockades. Croatian forces received additional weapons that day, after the JNA garrisons in Čakovec, Križevci and Virovitica surrendered to the ZNG. In Varaždin itself, corps-level units of the JNA 32nd Corps based at the 15. maj barracks also surrendered to the ZNG that day. The following day, fighting intensified again, as Croatian forces captured several minor JNA facilities in Varaždin itself—leaving the Corps headquarters, the Kalnički partizani barracks and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks as the only JNA-held military bases in the city. In the course of this fighting, the ZNG suffered one fatality and captured nine JNA officers and 30 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{to synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), <b>mimicking</b> <b>the</b> r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
50|$|Also in 2004, Harran and {{co-workers}} reported a dimeric small molecule that <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> proapoptotic protein Smac (see mitochondrial regulation in apoptosis). This molecule <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal linear motif Ala-Val-Pro-Ile. Uniquely, the dimeric structure of this peptidomimetic {{led to a}} marked increase in activity over an analogous monomer. This binding cooperativity results from the molecule's ability to also <b>mimic</b> <b>the</b> homodimeric structure of Smac, which is functionally important for reactivating caspases. Smac mimetics of this type can sensitize an array of non-small-cell lung cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutics (e.g. Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine) both in vitro and in mouse xenograft models.|$|R
