25|$|In 2001, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} constructed a prism composed of <b>metamaterials</b> (negative-index <b>metamaterials)</b> to experimentally test for negative refractive index. The experiment used a waveguide to help transmit the proper frequency and isolate the material. This test achieved its goal because it successfully verified a negative index of refraction.|$|E
25|$|Currently, negative-index <b>metamaterials</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} to manipulate electromagnetic radiation in new ways. For example, optical and electromagnetic properties of natural materials are often altered through chemistry. With <b>metamaterials,</b> optical and electromagnetic properties can be engineered by changing the geometry of its unit cells. The unit cells are materials that are ordered in geometric arrangements with dimensions that are fractions of the wavelength of the radiated electromagnetic wave. Each artificial unit responds to the radiation from the source. The collective result is the material's response to the electromagnetic wave that is broader than normal.|$|E

However, the analytical formulae of effective parameters of a fishnet <b>metamaterial</b> have not been reported hindering the design of deep-subwavelength imaging devices using this structure.

We also theoretically demonstrate the deep-subwavelength focusing at λ/ 83 using the composite structure of a slit-array layer and a fishnet <b>metamaterial.</b> It is found that the focused intensity inside a fishnet <b>metamaterial</b> is several times larger than that without the fishnet <b>metamaterial,</b> but the transmitted intensity is still restricted by large-wavevector difference in air and a fishnet <b>metamaterial.</b> Our effective parameters may aid the next-generation deep-subwavelength imaging devices working at terahertz or microwave radiation...|$|R

2500|$|Research in the {{microwave}} range continues with split-ring resonators and conducting wires. Research also continues in the shorter wavelengths with this configuration of materials and the unit cell sizes are scaled down. However, at around 200 terahertz [...] issues arise which make using the split ring resonator problematic. [...] "Alternative materials become more suitable for the terahertz and optical regimes." [...] At these wavelengths selection of materials and size limitations become important. For example, in 2007 a 100 nanometer mesh wire design made of silver and woven in a repeating pattern transmitted beams at the 780 nanometer wavelength, {{the far end of}} the visible spectrum. The researchers believe this produced a negative refraction of 0.6. Nevertheless, this operates at only a single wavelength like its predecessor <b>metamaterials</b> in {{the microwave}} regime.

2500|$|In {{the year}} 2000, David R. Smith's team of UCSD {{researchers}} produced {{a new class}} of composite materials by depositing a structure onto a circuit-board substrate consisting of a series of thin copper split-rings and ordinary wire segments strung parallel to the rings. This material exhibited unusual physical properties that had never been observed in nature. These materials obey the laws of physics, but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these negative-index <b>metamaterials</b> were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the physical properties that govern the behavior of ordinary optical materials. One of those unusual properties is the ability to reverse, for the first time, Snell's law of refraction. Until the demonstration of negative refractive index for microwaves by the UCSD team, the material had been unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation abilities allowed these first <b>metamaterials</b> to be constructed.

Likewise, by fabricating such <b>metamaterials</b> researchers are trying to overcome fundamental limits tied to the wavelength of light.

2500|$|The first actual <b>metamaterials</b> {{worked in}} the {{microwave}} regime, or centimeter wavelengths, {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} [...] (about 4.3GHz). It was constructed of split-ring resonators and conducting straight wires (as unit cells). The unit cells were sized from 7 to 10 millimeters. [...] The unit cells were arranged in a two-dimensional (periodic) repeating pattern which produces a crystal-like geometry. Both the unit cells and the lattice spacing were smaller than the radiated electromagnetic wave. This produced the first left-handed material when both the permittivity and permeability of the material were negative. This system relies on the resonant behavior of the unit cells. Below a group of researchers develop an idea for a left handed metamaterial that does not rely on such resonant behavior.|$|E

This means, when a charged particle (usually electrons) passes through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium, that particle will emit trailing radiation from its progress through the medium rather than {{in front of it}} (as is the case in normal materials with, both permittivity and permeability positive). One can also obtain such reverse-cone Cherenkov radiation in non-metamaterial periodic media (where the periodic structure is on the same scale as the wavelength, so it cannot be treated as an effectively homogeneous metamaterial).|$|E

2500|$|In {{general the}} {{physical}} properties of natural materials cause limitations. Most dielectrics only have positive permittivities, ε > 0 [...] [...] Metals will exhibit negative permittivity, ε < 0 at optical frequencies, and plasmas exhibit negative permittivity values in certain frequency bands. Pendry et al. {{demonstrated that the}} plasma frequency {{can be made to}} occur in the lower microwave frequencies for metals with a material made of metal rods that replaces the bulk metal. However, in each of these cases permeability remains always positive. At microwave frequencies it is possible for negative μ to occur in some ferromagnetic materials. But the inherent drawback is they are difficult to find above terahertz frequencies. In any case, a natural material that can achieve negative values for permittivity and permeability simultaneously has not been found or discovered. Hence, all of this has led to constructing artificial composite materials known as <b>metamaterials</b> in order to achieve the desired results.|$|E
