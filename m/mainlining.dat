In December 2011, Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android <b>Mainlining</b> Project, which aims to put some Android drivers, patches and features back into the Linux kernel, starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel, after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes: to memory (the traditional suspend that Android uses), and to disk (hibernate, as it is known on the desktop). Google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.|$|E

5000|$|In the Forever Evil storyline in the New 52, Power Ring {{was shown}} with {{the ring of}} Volthoom, it was causing {{detrimental}} effects on his body. These effects were displayed through grotesque, greenish veins being visible on Power Ring's right hand and arm, extending to his neck. The same deformation was visible (to a much greater degree, resultant of a longer [...] "bonding" [...] period) on Power Ring's predecessor, Abin Sur. The deformation started to take effect on Jessica Cruz after the ring was placed on her hand. These veins are ring <b>mainlining</b> with the wielder's basolateral nucleus in their amygdala in order to channel their fear. The ring is rendered powerless if its user is not afraid, Batman shut down the ring after he convinced Jessica not to be fearful, also if the user is knocked unconscious the ring will stop working until the user retains consciousness as shown when Jessica Cruz was knocked out cold. Captain Cold was also able to [...] "quiet" [...] the ring {{for a few moments}} with a blast from his cold gun. Flash also states that the Ring of Volthoom is unable to do anything that the user will not allow it too, to this end Jessica Cruz was able to make Volthoom go into dormancy by enforcing her will over his; this was implied earlier In Forever Evil when Harold Jordan refused to charge his ring it could do nothing but make more demands to get charged. This action ironically lead to Harold's death as he foolishly battled Sinestro when the ring was low on power.|$|E

An {{important part of this}} presentation will talk about the efficient system-wide user-space tracing infrastructure being designed.

The team's branch must have all changes from the <b>mainline</b> merged in (the equivalent of a workspace update), there must be a successful build and all tests must pass. Integrating with the <b>mainline</b> will be easier than usual because only pre-integrated features will be in it, not features in-process. Then, the team's changes are merged into the <b>mainline</b> which will trigger a build and test cycle on the <b>mainline.</b> If that passes, then the team goes back to the first phase where individual developers work on their own tasks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} tracing re-quirements stated by the LTTng user-base. It presents LTTng as a tracer having a wide user-base, with needs different from kernel devel-opers. It presents tracing infrastructure as be-ing made of distinct parts which can be catego-rized as either common core-kernel infrastruc-ture (instrumentation, tracing time-source) or tracer-specific, driver-like code (trace manage-ment, buffering mechanism). This paper builds the case for LTTng <b>mainlining</b> into the Linux kernel by explaining the specific user require-ments LTTng fulfills, its degree of maturity {{and the number of}} users it has. This case is then supported by showing that most of its code-base does not affect the kernel core. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} 102 {{participants}} to analyse {{the influence that}} body mass, training experience and fighting stance had on the isometric neck strength of male amateur boxers. A MANCOVA analysed allometriclly scaled isometric neck strength data, in flexion (FLX), extension (EXT), left lateral flexion (LLF) and right lateral flexion (RLF) across 10 weight divisions. Training experience groups was set as the covariate. A second MANOVA assessed absolute neck strength scores against the boxer’s preferred fighting stance. Results across weight divisions highlighted {{a significant difference in}} FLX (p =. 02) only. No differences were noted between training groups. A Pearson’s r produced significant weak negative correlations in FLX and lateral flexion (p =. 05). The fighting stance observation highlighted a significant difference (p <. 01) in LLF between southpaws and orthodox fighters. Ratio trends also highlighted that southpaws have stronger RLF and orthodox boxers had stronger in LLF. Conclusions: The neck strength of boxers differs among the weight divisions, but only in FLX. General trends indicate heavier boxers have marginally weaker necks. Training age has no impact on neck strength but preferred fighting stance does, especially in lateral flexion. Recommendations: Further research is required on neck responses of the boxer when receiving a punch. By understanding this, practitioners will be able to best utilise the lateral flexion finding. Until such information is available, develop isometric neck strength in FLX and bi-lateral flexion, whilst <b>mainlining</b> strength symmetry is suggested...|$|E
