The dependence of these quantities on the austenitizing temperature and the tempering provided by subsequent weld passes is also investigated. The {{use of a}} tempering parameter, as developed by Hollomon and Jaffe, allows comparison of different tempering times and temperatures. It was found that in the rapid heating cycle of simulated welding that the AC 1 and AC 3 temperatures are approximately as much as 150 to 170 Â°F higher than the corresponding temperatures of the equilibrium phase diagram for this 0. 1 % C- 5. 0 % Ni steel. Results indicate that cast plate tends to resist tempering more than either the rolled plate or weld metal. Additionally, structures formed at lower austenitizing temperatures temper more readily. Although all three conditions tempered, the cast plate retained a steep hardness and microstructural gradient through the HAZ and consequently is probably more susceptible to a <b>metallurgical</b> <b>notch</b> effect.

40|$|The studies {{reported}} herein {{were concerned with}} the effects of external geometry on the fatigue behavior of transverse butt welded joints in structural steels. Included were studies of the effects of weld profile, the stress concentrations produced by the weld geometry, and metallurgical aspects of the welds. The weld profile was measured in terms of the radius at the toe of the weld, the flank angle, the width of the weld, and the height of the weld. For the ASTM A 36 and A 441 steels studied, the height of the crown of the weld and the general angle at the toe of the weld appeared to provide the best geometrical correlation with fatigue life [...] the shorter lives were obtained from specimens with the highest reinforcement and the largest angle. Thus, the stress concentration produced by the radius at the toe of the weld (determined theoretically and by photoelastic measurement) does not, as had been expected, necessarily define the fatigue behavior of a butt welded joint. The metallurgical studies of the fracture surfaces helped to identify and define the points of fatigue crack initiation in the heat affected zone of the base metal. This aspect of the program demonstrated that the effects of the <b>metallurgical</b> <b>notches</b> and the micro-geometry resulting from the welding process are apparently superimposing on the overall geometrical effects and may have a greater effect on the determination of the sites of crack initiation than such external geometrical parameters as the radius or angle at the toe of the weld.
