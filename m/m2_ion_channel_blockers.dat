40|$|Given {{the ability}} of M. {{tuberculosis}} to survive as an intracellular pathogen and its propensity to develop resistance to the existing antituberculosis drugs, its treatment requires new approaches. Here the antimycobacterial properties of verapamil, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, flupenthixol and haloperidol were investigated against a panel of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains, both in vitro and on human-infected macrophages. These compounds are efflux inhibitors that share among them the characteristic of being <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers.</b> In vitro, all compounds exhibited synergistic inhibitory activities when combined with isoniazid and rifampicin, {{and were able to}} inhibit active efflux, demonstrating their role as efflux inhibitors. Gene expression analysis showed that M. tuberculosis efflux genes were overexpressed in response to antibiotic exposure, in vitro and within macrophages, irrespective of their resistance pattern. These compounds displayed a rapid and high killing activity against M. tuberculosis, associated with a decrease in intracellular ATP levels demonstrating that the bactericidal action of the <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> against M. tuberculosis clinical strains is associated with their interference with energy metabolism. The compounds led to a decrease in the intracellular mycobacterial load by increasing phagosome acidification and activating lysosomal hydrolases. The results presented in this study enable us to propose the following mechanism of action for these compounds: a) in the bacteria, the compounds generate a cascade of events involving the inhibition of the respiratory chain complexes and energy production for efflux activity. Indirectly, this reduce the resistance level to antituberculosis drugs potentiating their activity; b) on the host cell, the treatment with the <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> increases phagosome acidification and induces the expression of phagosomal hydrolases, leading to bacterial growth restriction irrespective of their resistance pattern. This work highlights the potential value <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> as adjuvants of tuberculosis chemotherapy, in particular for the development of new therapeutic strategies, with strong potential for treatment shortening against drug susceptible and resistant forms of tuberculosis.

Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were activated via monoclonal antibodies targeting the TCR-CD 3 complex and the co-stimulator CD 28.

The pathological process, which involves the production of amyloid-β peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, spreads over well-delineated neuroanatomical circuits. The gradual deterioration of proper synaptic functioning (via GluN 2 A-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, NMDARs) and the development of excitotoxicity (via GluN 2 B-containing NMDARs) in these structures both accompany the disease pathogenesis. Although one of the most important therapeutic targets would be glutamate excitotoxicity, the application of conventional anti-glutamatergic agents could result in further deterioration of synaptic transmission and intolerable side-effects. With regard to NMDAR antagonists with tolerable side-effects, <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> with low affinity, glycine site agents, and specific antagonists of polyamine site and GluN 2 B subunit may come into play.

40|$|Background: The {{blood brain barrier}} (BBB) {{controls}} the brain microenvironment and limits penetration of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) by chemicals, thus creating an obstacle to many medical imaging and treatment procedures. Research efforts to identify viable routes of BBB penetration have focused on structures such as micelles, polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes as drug carriers, however, many of them failed to provide unequivocal proof of BBB pen-etration. Here we proved that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) penetrate the BBB in rats to reach brain regions. Results: Injection of AuNPs to the abdominal cavity of rats resulted in levels of gold found in blood, urine, brain regions and body organs. After perfusion the concentration of gold in brain regions diminished dramatically indi-cating that most of the gold was in venous blood and not in the brain tissues. Injection of Na, K or Ca <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> reduced BBB penetration by half. A biological half-life of 12. 9 ± 4. 9 h was found for the gold nanoparticles.

In atrial fibrillation, atria beat more than 300 times per minute. The arrhythmatous condition needs to be controlled, as humans cannot withstand this rapid and chaotic beating of the heart. New investigational drugs like Dronedarone&reg; are being used. Dronedarone {{is the most}} recent antiarrhythmic drugs. It was approved by US-FDA on July 2 nd 2009 and is available in the USA as Multaq tablets (400 mg). Dronedarone falls under the category of multiple <b>ion</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker.</b> It mainly targets the repolarization currents, making them less active and hence prolonging the action potential duration (APD). Dronedarone also exhibits antiadrenergic activity, thus reducing the pace of the pacemaker. Dronedarone has been proven to be a safer and efficacious AAD, evidenced by both animal and human studies. These studies showed that there was prolongation of the APD and absence of QT interval prolongation with long term administration of the drug. Also there was reduced thyroid hormone receptor expression. Dronedarone is significantly safer and effective in maintaining the sinus rhythm and reducing the ventricular proarrhythmias, justifying it for the long term treatment of atrial fibrillation compared to other antiarrhythmic drugs.
