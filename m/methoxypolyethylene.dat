The pH-NanoPM was prepared {{with a size}} of ~ 110 [*]nm by self-assembly of a pH-responsive polymeric photosensitizer (pH-PPS) consisting of pH-cleavable <b>methoxypolyethylene</b> glycol (pH-C-mPEG). Because the pH-C-mPEG can be detached from the nanoparticles by hydrolysis of the benzoic-imine group at the pH of an acidic tumor (~ 6. 5), the particle size and surface charge of the pH-NanoPM were changed along with the environmental pH condition. After detachment of the pH-C-mPEG, the pH-NanoPM particles became positively charged (+ 18. 67 ± 1. 95 [*]mV) due to exposure of primary amine groups and decreased to a size of ~ 40 [*]nm. From in vitro cellular experiments with HeLa human cervical cancer cells, the pH-NanoPM exhibited enhanced cellular internalization at acidic tumor pH compared to normal pH, {{which led to a}} significant cancer cell killing effect. These results suggest that this system {{has the potential to be}} used as a new class of nanophotomedicine for targeted photodynamic cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the optimum {{conditions}} were determined for PEGylation ofhuman {{red blood cells}} by <b>methoxypoly(ethylene</b> glycol) (mPEG) with molecularmass of 5 kDa, activated by succinimidyl carbonate. Factorial and Taguchi design methods for experiments were used to {{study the effects of}} process variables on coating of the cells and determine the optimum conditions for PEGylation. The inhibition of agglutination by a blood-type specific antiserum (anti-D) was employed to evaluate the effect of the polymer coating. The remaining single cells after incubation with anti-D sera were counted using a simple hemocytometer (Improved Neubauer Ruling). The extent of surface coating was evaluated by attachment of cells to FITC labeled-anti-D serum and recording as the fluorescence intensity ratio of FITC-anti-D bound cells of the PEG-RBCs versus control (uncoated) RBCs. The morphology of red blood cells was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. Statistical analysis of experimental design together with SEM results showed that the optimum conditions were pH = 8. 7, T= 14 °C, and t = 60 min while the suitable polymer concentration was found to be 12 mg/mL...|$|E
40|$|The major {{allergen}} of ragweed pollen, antigen E, {{was modified}} by coupling its amino acid groups with either methanol, <b>methoxypolyethylene</b> glycol (MPEG) of 5, 000 daltons, or a synthetic copolymer of D-glutamic acid and D-lysine (DGL) of 34, 000 daltons, all appropriately activated. The conjugates were characterized chemically and immunologically. Compared {{to the native}} antigen, the methoxy conjugate showed little reduction in allergenic activity, but the other two conjugates showed strong reductions, as measured by heterologous passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in rats sensitized with murine anti- antigen E reaginic sera. The MPEG conjugate was apparently nonimmunogenic in mice known to be high responders to the native antigen. MPEG and DGL conjugates retained the immunosuppressive property of the native antigen as subcutaneous treatment of antigen E sensitized mice with these two conjugates led to significant long- lasting depression of their antigen E-specific IgE and IgG antibody levels. These immunological changes are believed to result from reduction of antigenic valency and specificity upon coupling the bulky molecules to the protein antigens...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Nanoparticle drug {{carriers}} {{consist of}} solid biodegradable particles in size ranging from 10 to 1000 nm (50 – 300 nm generally). They cannot freely diffuse through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and require receptor-mediated transport through brain capillary endothelium to deliver their content {{into the brain}} parenchyma. Polysorbate 80 -coated polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles can deliver drugs to the brain by a still debated mechanism. Despite interesting results these nanoparticles have limitations, discussed in this review, that may preclude, or at least limit, their potential clinical applications. Long-circulating nanoparticles made of <b>methoxypoly(ethylene</b> glycol) - polylactide or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (mPEG-PLA/PLGA) have a good safety profiles and provide drug-sustained release. The availability of functionalized PEG-PLA permits to prepare target-specific nanoparticles by conjugation of cell surface ligand. Using peptidomimetic antibodies to BBB transcytosis receptor, brain-targeted pegylated immunonanoparticles can now be synthesized that should make possible the delivery of entrapped actives into the brain parenchyma without inducing BBB permeability alteration. This review presents their general properties (structure, loading capacity, pharmacokinetics) and currently available methods for immunonanoparticle preparation...|$|E
30|$|The GNR sols were {{centrifuged}} {{twice at}} 16, 000 [*]×[*]g for 1 h and then redispersed in water {{to remove the}} excess CTAB molecules. The pH of the GNR sols was adjusted to 9 by adding 0.2 M K 2 CO 3, followed {{by the addition of}} <b>methoxy(polyethylene</b> glycol)-thiol (mPEG-SH; MW 5, 000, Nektar Therapeutics, San Francisco, CA, USA) at a final concentration of 10 nM. The mixture was allowed to react overnight. The PEGylated (mPEG-SH-modified) rods were centrifuged at 16, 000 ×g for 60 min and then redispersed in water to remove nonspecifically bound PEG molecules. The PEGylated GNRs were again centrifuged at 16, 000 ×g for 1 h and redispersed in a small amount of water to a concentration of 5 g/L. To completely remove CTAB and unreacted PEG, the nanoparticles were dialyzed for 72 h, fresh water being added to them several times. Finally, these dialyzed, PEGylated, and concentrated GNRs were transferred to a sterile bottle, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and freeze-dried overnight under vacuum. The measured zeta potential of the as-prepared and redispersed PEGylated GNRs was about − 20 mV. For details, the readers are referred to [48, 49].|$|E
